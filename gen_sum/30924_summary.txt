This was  completed after careful review of the capital requirements, competitive position and market opportunities facing  each company. We completed subsidiary funding rounds in 2017 for HawkEye 360 , BridgeSat, Federated Wireless and  Signature Medical that each included external strategic investors. Simon Davidson joined the team in June as Executive Vice President, Technology Investments, bringing extensive  experience working with federal laboratories and government customers. Omar Amirana, MD, Senior Vice President, Life Sciences Investments, has focused on investment theses  revolving around proprietary minimally-invasive solutions for procedures with a clear reimbursement path that  reduce morbidity, mortality and costs. We are largely focused in areas where adoption can be dramatic such  as interventional cardiology, electrophysiology, neuroradiology, pulmonology, and gastroenterology. o On 5 October 2017, Spin Transfer Technologies, Inc. announced that it had secured $22.8 million of  funding via a convertible bridge facility. • In addition to these fundraisings, $16.6 million was invested by the Group into new and other existing  subsidiary businesses. • On 12 July 2017, BridgeSat announced the appointment of Barry Matsumori, formerly a senior executive at  Qualcomm, SpaceX and Virgin Galactic, as CEO. The Phase I/II study assessed the safety and preliminary efficacy of SF0166  in 40 evaluable patients with DME who were randomized to one of two dose strengths (2.5% and 5.0%  solutions) self-administered by patients as an eye drop twice-a-day for 28 days, with a 28 day follow-up  period. The company has defined six key success factors that, if present, can create the  conditions for a superior exit valuation: • Disruptive innovation solving an important problem (ideally with first mover advantage) • Favourable market dynamics (large market and/or high growth rate) • Sustainable competitive advantage (unique or superior solutions, with sustainable barriers to entry, potentially  including IP) • Route to widespread adoption (minimum barriers to adoption; known/available distribution channels) • Capable management with aligned interest (right skill mix and accountability for delivery) • Potential for competitive tension (operate to maximise exit optionality and nurture potential buyers) 11 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017     COMPANY OVERVIEW (CONTINUED)   Strategic Report (CONTINUED) Source Since inception, Allied Minds has sought to deliver the commercial potential of IP developed in universities,  federal laboratories, and medical institutions, by working with technology transfer offices (TTOs). It is a fact of life in early stage company creation and development that not all ideas or technologies will  successfully transition to commercialisation. Portfolio composition Allied Minds has identified six subsidiaries as defined earlier that we believe are well-positioned for  commercialisation and have the potential to realise superior exit valuations. Below  we provide an overview of our 12 current operating subsidiary businesses, including year formed, and Allied  Minds’ ownership interest. These valuations assume there will be available funds for the subsidiaries to  reach next stages of their development towards commercial success or an exit event. The cost and speed characteristics of RF, together with increasingly scarce spectrum, make it difficult to support  this increase in data downlink demand. BridgeSat enjoys first mover advantages and is thought to be the only commercial entity currently building out a  network of optical communications ground stations. BridgeSat’s first target market is the fast-growing LEO data downlink segment, currently estimated to be worth  $1.5 billion annually. 2017 management objectives • Complete series A fund-raise • Acquire launch customers • Demonstrate operation of first BridgeSat ground station 20 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017     PORTFOLIO REVIEW AND DEVELOPMENTS  (CONTINUED)   (CONTINUED) Progress in 2017 • Appointed Barry Matsumori as CEO • Completed a $6.0 million series A fund-raise completed in May 2017, including participation by Space  Angels, a venture capital firm focused on emerging space • Signed ground station partnership with Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) • First ground station designed and contracted with completion due in 2018 • Contracted with launch customers (3 pathfinder customers signed and one space terminal delivered) • Signed an agreement with Tesat to develop interoperability with BridgeSat’s ground station network • Received a contract award in Japan to deliver a GEO space terminal for the ETS-IX GEO satellite programme 2018 key operational management objectives • Successfully demonstrate end-to-end service: NOC, at least one ground station, and customer pathfinder(s) • Sign 2+ customer agreements; build strong commercial revenue backlog Federated WireleSS , i nc . Federated Wireless is installing and will operate over one  hundred ESC sensors along substantial stretches of the US coastlines. • In Q4 began field trials with customers covering all five of the spectrum sharing verticals, including Charter  Communications; Arris International; American Tower as well as Verizon and Telrad (a wireless broadband  provider or WISP) • After the period end, signed a multi-year commercial agreement with Telrad in January to deliver LTE fixed  wireless services 2018 key operational management objectives • FCC certification • Support multiple customer launches and realise commercial revenue • Build out national availability of ESC network to meet customer requirements Ha Wk e ye 360 , i nc . For example maritime vessels engaged in illegal fishing may seek to evade detection by switching off their AIS  (Automatic Identification System) and going “dark”. Poor diagnosis rates mean that cancer is missed nearly half  of the time and patients are subjected to repeat treatments. In 2016 worldwide combined revenue for Lucentis and Eylea,  the two leading injectable drugs treating these diseases, exceeded $8 billion. The Spin Polarizer adds an infinitesimal processing cost  (fractions of a per cent) while greatly reducing silicon area. 2017 management objectives (as of March 2017) • Advance technology to demonstrate differentiators • Secure strategic development/investing partner • Complete Series B fund-raise Note: After Tom Sparkman was hired as CEO, new objectives were set, including: • Partner with Tokyo Electron Limited (TEL) • Create 1G of data to demonstrate advanced pMTJ capability • Meet with 25+ potential partners • Increase patent portfolio Progress in 2017 • In July recruited Tom Sparkman as CEO, with previous executive roles at Maxim, Spansion • New strategy in place, transformed operational and commercial focus • In September signed a collaborative engineering program with TEL providing expedited access to MRAM  deposition tools and engineering resource 28 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017     PORTFOLIO REVIEW AND DEVELOPMENTS  (CONTINUED)   • 1G data measured • Held over 50 partner meetings • 87 new patents filed • $22.8 million bridge finance facility underwritten by Allied Minds in October 2017. The company’s mission is to create novel drug candidates against serious diseases with  large market potential. Through this joint discovery  process between Allied Minds and GE Ventures’ technology licensing group, multiple promising candidates for  eventual spin-out have been reviewed. While we have not yet identified a candidate that meets each of our  investment criteria and objectives, we continue to seek an opportunity for Allied Minds to form new entities based  on the cutting-edge technologies developed by one of the world’s leaders in technology innovation.

In addition to these fundraisings, $16.6 million was invested by the Group into new and  other existing subsidiary businesses. The Group’s strategy is to maintain healthy, highly liquid cash balances that are readily available for investment. It is possible that one or more of these identified  risks could impact the Group in a similar timeframe which may compound their effects. The Group may not be able to sell its ownership interests  in subsidiary businesses during any specific time frame or otherwise on desirable terms, if at all.

In all cases, the Directors must ensure that their external appointments do not involve excessive time  commitment or cause a conflict of interest. There is  also an agreed procedure for directors to take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense. The indemnity would not provide any coverage where a director is  proved to have acted fraudulently or with willful misconduct. The Company has also arranged appropriate  insurance coverage in respect of legal action against its directors and officers.

Details of any such payments will be set out  in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise. The Committee may in its discretion determine that there are  exceptional circumstances justifying vesting to a greater or lesser extent. An Executive Director’s cash incentive bonus  award is considered by the Remuneration Committee upon completion of each financial year. The Board used its discretion  to treat Mr. Silva’s resignation as a termination without cause (good leaver). The Committee has  not set a timeframe during which Executive Officers are required to accumulate their share ownership level. The maximum opportunity for each Executive Director in 2018  will remain constant and may be up to 225% of base salary. Ms. Smith has a service contract that commenced on 26 May 2017 and shall continue until terminated by either  of Allied Minds or the Executive Director. If the Executive Director’s employment is terminated by Allied Minds for “Cause”, she shall only be entitled  to amounts that are accrued or owing but not yet paid and reimbursement of any properly incurred business  expenses but excluding any bonus payments or other compensation provided pursuant to Allied Minds’ incentive  compensation plan (such amounts, the “Standard Benefit”). No  changes were suggested or required to be made in our 31 December 2017 accounts as result of this review. Our results –  We found the group’s judgement that there is no  indicator of impairment to be appropriate. The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods  presented in these consolidated financial statements. Other investments comprise fixed income debt securities, including government agency and corporate bonds,  are stated at amortised cost less impairment. Such financial liabilities are recognised at fair value through profit and loss plus any directly attributable  transaction costs. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful  life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. As  at 31 December 2017, the Group’s future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases  amounted to $8.0 million, on an undiscounted basis (see note 21). Those currently include our top six subsidiaries, namely BridgeSat, Federated Wireless, HawkEye 360 , Precision  Biopsy, SciFluor Life Sciences, and Spin Transfer Technologies. These valuations assume there will be available funds for the subsidiaries to  reach next stages of their development towards commercial success or an exit event. Each ordinary share is entitled to receive dividends when and if declared  by the Company’s board of directors. Should this next lead optimisation phase prove successful, Bristol-Myers  Squibb has the right to acquire Allied Minds’ interest in ABLS II at a pre-determined multiple of invested  capital.
