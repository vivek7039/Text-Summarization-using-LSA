that means for instance some focus on consumer stocks such as sports direct, where phoenix have been patient and successful – in terms of investment returns. lyndon davies joined hornby in october 2017 as ceo, with an agreement to buy the business he founded and built, oxford diecast. he has a keen awareness of the hornby’s strengths, weaknesses and potential; we couldn’t be happier to have him on board. these changes do not herald any change in our investment philosophy or principles which have served us well at phoenix for the past 20 years. however, fears remain that the company doesn’t have sufficient new patented drugs to replace older products whose patents face expiry. initial reports suggest that these new, freehold flagship stores are doing very well, generating a high return on the capital invested in them. our investment in hornby (shares down 4%) may appear unusual as we own 75% of the business and a phoenix partner, james wilson, sits on their board. debt also fell and the 20% return-on-capital remains very impressive for any business, let alone one in an industry that is generally capital intensive. the board has determined as a matter of policy, however, that all directors should in any case submit to annual re-election. we also determine a lower level of specific materiality for certain areas such as investment income, directors’ remuneration and related party transactions. therefore our audit work was focused on: • obtaining an understanding of, and evaluating, relevant internal controls at the company’s third-party service providers. christopher
