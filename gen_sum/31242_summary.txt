Phoenix currently seeks to achieve the Objective by investing in a portfolio of UK listed equities. Despite Aurora’s strong outperformance of the Index in 2017 , no performance fee was earned by Phoenix. That means for instance some focus on consumer stocks such as Sports Direct, where Phoenix have been patient and successful – in terms of investment returns. This appointment will be paid for, at their suggestion, by Phoenix and therefore minimise the cost to shareholders. The Company seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a portfolio of UK listed equities. The Company’s policy is not to invest more than 15% of its gross assets in any one investment. Revised Investment Policy The Company’s objective is to provide Shareholders with long-term returns through capital and income growth. The Company seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing predominantly in a portfolio of UK listed companies. Objectives and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) The Company’s principal investment objective is to achieve capital growth. The Company’s success in attaining its objectives is measured by reference to KPIs as follows: a.

Lyndon Davies joined Hornby in October 2017 as CEO, with an agreement to buy the business he founded and built, Oxford Diecast. He has a keen awareness of the Hornby’s strengths, weaknesses and potential; we couldn’t be happier to have him on board. His view, which I have come to share, was that having gained a good understanding of a company’s value we should look for the best risk adjusted way of making our investment, anywhere in the capital structure. These changes do not herald any change in our investment philosophy or principles which have served us well at Phoenix for the past 20 years.

However, fears remain that the company doesn’t have sufficient new patented drugs to replace older products whose patents face expiry. Another “bear” argument is that global pharma’ firms are unwieldy and staid; sitting-ducks to smaller, more nimble competitors. Because the bigger firms, with their benefits of scale, are more likely to succeed in commercialising innovation. Initial reports suggest that these new, freehold flagship stores are doing very well, generating a high return on the capital invested in them. Our investment in Hornby (shares down 4%) may appear unusual as we own 75% of the business and a Phoenix Partner, James Wilson, sits on their Board. We increased our shareholding of Hornby during the year, believing that these set-backs will be overcome with better management. Her emphasis on return-on-capital meant that the business pursued a very disciplined growth strategy, creating much value for shareholders. Apart from the loss of McCall, the news for easyJet has been largely positive this year as some weaker European airlines such as Monarch and Air Berlin have gone bust and easyJet’s strategy of providing a convenient, low-cost alternative to more expensive national airlines continues to work. On what percentage of those routes do they compete with each other, within a two-hour time slot? Debt also fell and the 20% return-on-capital remains very impressive for any business, let alone one in an industry that is generally capital intensive.
