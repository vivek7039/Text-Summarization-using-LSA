report strategic report statement from the cio of the investment manager gary channon april 2018 if 2016 was a year for sowing, as we did in a substantial way after the brexit vote, then 2017 was a year of reaping. lyndon davies joined hornby in october 2017 as ceo, with an agreement to buy the business he founded and built, oxford diecast. he has a keen awareness of the hornby’s strengths, weaknesses and potential; we couldn’t be happier to have him on board. these changes do not herald any change in our investment philosophy or principles which have served us well at phoenix for the past 20 years. gary channon cio phoenix asset management partners 20 april 2018 job no: 34360 proof event: 15 black line level: 0 park communications ltd alpine way london e6 6la customer: praxis project title: aurora annual report 2017 t: 0207 055 6500 f: 020 7055 6600 16 annual report strategic report investment manager’s review and outlook tristan chapple april 2018 in early march, a week or so before putting pen to paper for this review, the ft published a story entitled “global investors shun uk stock market” (ft : chris flood: 5 march 2018) that suggested uk equities are currently the most unpopular asset class in the world among large institutional investors; not the most auspicious of backdrops for an investment trust with significant exposure to uk domestic businesses. however, fears remain that the company doesn’t have sufficient new patented drugs to replace older products whose patents face expiry. another “bear” argument is that global pharma’ firms are unwieldy and staid; sitting-ducks to smaller, more nimble competitors. because the bigger firms, with their benefits of scale, are more likely to succeed in commercialising innovation. initial reports suggest that these new, freehold flagship stores are doing very well, generating a high return on the capital invested in them. our investment in hornby (shares down 4%) may appear unusual as we own 75% of the business and a phoenix partner, james wilson, sits on their board. we increased our shareholding of hornby during the year, believing that these set-backs will be overcome with better management. her emphasis on return-on-capital meant that the business pursued a very disciplined growth strategy, creating much value for shareholders. apart from the loss of mccall, the news for easyjet has been largely positive this year as some weaker european airlines such as monarch and air berlin have gone bust and easyjet’s strategy of providing a convenient, low-cost alternative to more expensive national airlines continues to work. on what percentage of those routes do they compete with each other, within a two-hour time slot? debt also fell and the 20% return-on-capital remains very impressive for any business, let alone one in an industry that is generally capital intensive. all figures shown are net of fees and do not account for an investor’s tax position. social, ethical,
