number of shares increased to reflect ltip and sharesave options, was also a loss of 5.68p (fy16: 2.94p). as at 30 december 2017 the group had access to £29.8m of combined liquidity from available cash and undrawn committed borrowing facilities. our leverage, calculated as net debt divided by adjusted ebitda, increased from 3.2x in fy16 to 4.8x at the end of fy17. analysts and investors also assess our earnings per share using an adjusted earnings per share measure, calculated by dividing an adjusted profit after tax by the weighted average number of shares in issue over the period. adjusted earnings per share is used as a performance metric for the vesting of 2016 ltip and 2017 market value option awards. this metric is also used in the calculation of any annual bonuses payable to executive directors. paul quested chief financial officer 5 april 2018 hss hire group plc annual report and financial statements 2017 strategic report corporate governance financial statements

directors alan peterson chairman alan peterson has served as the group’s chairman since december 2012. he also served as the group’s chairman between 2004 and 2007. alan’s experience over the last 25 years includes involvement in a number of public and private equity-backed businesses across the uk, europe and north america. paul quested chief financial officer paul quested joined the group as chief financial officer in august 2016. before joining the group, he was chief corporate development officer for electrocomponents plc and had held a number of senior positions within electrocomponents, including those of global strategy director, general manager (rs uk) and head of finance (rs uk). prior to electrocomponents, paul worked at inbev for ten years, where his roles included planning & performance management director. code provision b.1.2 provides that a smaller company should have at least two independent non-executive directors. the board has satisfied itself that such customer is not material enough to create a potential conflict of interest. both the market disclosure and remuneration committees are chaired by an independent non-executive director, amanda burton. shorter, less detailed trading updates are also provided to the market on a quarterly basis. these areas are identified as significant due to their complexity, size, level of judgement required and/or potential impact on the financial statements and our strategy. certain of the group’s funding arrangements are also linked to specific assets or asset classes. as a result of this work the committee has concluded that no impairment provisions are required. → succession planning – there had been a number of senior appointments and some new senior roles created in the company during 2017, but no significant progress had been made as regards director succession during 2017, partly as a result of recent changes at that level. for fy18 the committee has introduced a third measure
