hire group plc annual report and financial statements 2017 18 19 overview the first half of 2017 was heavily impacted by changes to the operating model in the prior financial year, with a higher cost base and reduced availability during these changes, adversely impacting rental revenue. the total cost was £3.7m and this included a property impairment of £1.2m as head office functions were centralised in manchester. as at 30 december 2017 the group had access to £29.8m of combined liquidity from available cash and undrawn committed borrowing facilities. our leverage, calculated as net debt divided by adjusted ebitda, increased from 3.2x in fy16 to 4.8x at the end of fy17. adjusted earnings per share is used as a performance metric for the vesting of 2016 ltip and 2017 market value

create a potential conflict of interest. these areas are identified as significant due to their complexity, size, level of judgement required and/or potential impact on the financial statements and our strategy. → succession planning – there had been a number of senior appointments and some new senior roles created in the company during 2017, but no significant progress had been made as regards director succession during 2017, partly as a result of recent changes at that level. → grant of exceptional long-term incentive award in fy17 following shareholder approval at egm (see page 45)

restrictions subject to the rights or restrictions set out below or detailed in the notice of agm, on a show of hands every member who is present in person shall have one vote and on a poll every member present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which he is the holder. we also agreed to report differences below these thresholds that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. the group’s operating companies vary significantly in size, and we identified eleven reporting units at the year end which had non- trivial external transactions, seven of which, in our view required an audit of their complete financial information due to their size or risk characteristics. the accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements. all other foreign currency translation gains and losses are presented in the income statement within administrative expenses. impairment reviews are undertaken whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of property, plant and equipment may not be recoverable. all other brands and customer relationships are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic life. computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which does not exceed four years. other intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic life, and the amortisation charge is included within administrative expenses. subsequently, trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment. deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. non-recurring third party consultancy costs of £1.2 million were incurred for the period ended 30 december 2017 to support this review (2016: £nil). 5. finance income and expense year ended 30 december 2017 £000s year ended 31 december 2016 £000s interest
