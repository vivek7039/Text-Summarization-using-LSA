borrowing facilities. adjusted earnings per share is used as a performance metric for the vesting of 2016 ltip and 2017 market value option awards. colleagues involved in professional diploma or certification programmes are allowed time away from their roles to complete these each year. prior to electrocomponents, paul worked at inbev for ten years, where his roles included planning &

outstanding amounts, together with accrued interest, would become immediately due and payable. the group’s operating companies vary significantly in size, and we identified eleven reporting units at

reviews are undertaken whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of property, plant and equipment may not be recoverable. computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which does not exceed four years. other intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic life, and the amortisation charge is included within administrative expenses. subsequently, trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment. → cash flows
