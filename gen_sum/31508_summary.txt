Our specialist generator hire businesses are leading providers of temporary power equipment and operate throughout the UK. We drive safer product design throughout our supply chain – such as the unique anti- entrapment system Activ’Shield on our UK Platform diesel booms – and we ensure that every single bit of kit is robustly maintained and tested through strictly controlled processes before every hire so it is always safe to use. We also support our customers by ensuring that – from recruiting the right people to providing them with ongoing training and development – our colleagues are better equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to provide an excellent hire service. The National Distribution and Engineering Centre model was initially envisaged to support a much larger branch network.

The total cost was £3.7m and this included a property impairment of £1.2m as head office functions were centralised in Manchester. Our diluted adjusted earnings per share, calculated in the same manner as basic adjusted earnings per share but with the weighted average number of shares increased to reflect LTIP and Sharesave options, was also a loss of 5.68p (FY16: 2.94p). As at 30 December 2017 the Group had access to £29.8m of combined liquidity from available cash and undrawn committed borrowing facilities. Our leverage, calculated as net debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA, increased from 3.2x in FY16 to 4.8x at the end of FY17. Adjusted earnings per share is used as a performance metric for the vesting of 2016 LTIP and 2017 market value option awards. This metric is also used in the calculation of any annual bonuses payable to Executive Directors.

Colleagues involved in professional diploma or certification programmes are allowed time away from their roles to complete these each year. The Nomination Committee is recommending that all Board Directors are re-elected at our Annual General Meeting (AGM). We are committed to creating a fair and equal reward structure across our workforce, regardless of gender. Prior to Electrocomponents, Paul worked at InBev for ten years, where his roles included planning & performance management director. The Board has satisfied itself that such customer is not material enough to create a potential conflict of interest. Both the Market Disclosure and Remuneration Committees are chaired by an Independent Non-Executive Director, Amanda Burton. Corporate Governance continued 34 HSS Hire Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 35 Board training As part of induction, any new Directors receive training from the Company’s sponsors/brokers in relation to their responsibilities as a Director of a listed company. These areas are identified as significant due to their complexity, size, level of judgement required and/or potential impact on the Financial Statements and our strategy. Certain of the Group’s funding arrangements are also linked to specific assets or asset classes. As a result of this work the Committee has concluded that no impairment provisions are required. → Succession planning – there had been a number of senior appointments and some new senior roles created in the Company during 2017, but no significant progress had been made as regards Director succession during 2017, partly as a result of recent changes at that level. For FY18 the Committee has introduced a third measure based on growth in core hire rental revenue. Steve Ashmore was appointed as CEO on 1 June 2017 and did not receive a salary increase in FY17. → Grant of exceptional long-term incentive award in FY17 following shareholder approval at EGM (see page 45) measured over four years with a further one-year holding period.

Service contracts for new Executive Directors will generally be limited to 12 months’ notice by the Company. All Non-Executive Directors have initial fixed-term agreements with the Company of no more than three years. Colleagues are also invited to raise issues via the online communications forum ‘Yammer’ and receive feedback. Focus groups have also been carried out at key Group locations, to discuss employee engagement and gain more detailed feedback from employees. Revolving Credit Facility Following a change of control all outstanding amounts, together with accrued interest, would become immediately due and payable. Voting rights and restrictions Subject to the rights or restrictions set out below or detailed in the Notice of AGM, on a show of hands every member who is present in person shall have one vote and on a poll every member present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which he is the holder. We also agreed to report differences below these thresholds that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. The group’s operating companies vary significantly in size, and we identified eleven reporting units at the year end which had non- trivial external transactions, seven of which, in our view required an audit of their complete financial information due to their size or risk characteristics. The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Financial Statements. All other foreign currency translation gains and losses are presented in the income statement within administrative expenses. Impairment reviews are undertaken whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of property, plant and equipment may not be recoverable. All other brands and customer relationships are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic life. Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which does not exceed four years. Other intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic life, and the amortisation charge is included within administrative expenses. Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value, which is deemed to be the transaction price. Subsequently, trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Non-recurring third party consultancy costs of £1.2 million were incurred for the period ended 30 December 2017 to support this review (2016: £nil). → Cash flows beyond 2021 (ie after four years) have been determined based on a long term growth rate of 2.5% (2016: 2.5%). The overall provision for bad debts and credit notes amounts to 5.2% of trade receivables at 30 December 2017 (2016: 4.5%). The Group’s future minimum sub-lease rental income expected to be received under non-cancellable operating leases is as follows: 30 December 2017 £000s 31 December 2016 £000s Sub-lease rental income Within one year 452 713 Between two and five years 1,121 1,181 After five years 403 274 1,976 2,168 24.
