A number of core targets have been established within this strategy and we are committed to achieving these in the coming years. Proposals including accelerating the planning process, making available more development land and supporting SME builders in order to build sector capacity are encouraging. Shareholders We have grown pre-tax profit tenfold since 2012, paying at least one third of earnings as dividends each year.

This strategy has positioned the business well in economic downturns and increased our access to finance. Any potential dampening effect of these factors has been outweighed by the structural imbalance between supply and need for new homes in London, particularly at our typical price point. We sell homes early in the development cycle as a means of de-risking projects and advancing investment into new opportunities. This secure and de-risked position is underpinning our stated expectations for growth over the next few years. Post year end we have exchanged contracts to acquire Stone Studios in Hackney Wick for 120 homes plus commercial space, and have been selected as the preferred partner of the London Borough of Brent to develop 236 homes in South Kilburn. Both sites have full planning consent and we expect to start on site later this year. Notwithstanding this we are confident that there remains a healthy market for our typical product from individual buyers. Since February 2016 we have entered into four build to rent transactions comprising of nearly 500 homes, together worth over £230 million. In particular, we will pursue longer term partnerships whilst also maintaining an awareness of other opportunities. CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW 20 STRATOSPHERE E15 36 storey tower in the heart of Stratford All 307 open market homes and 34 affordable homes sold Under construction with completion due in 2018 Computer generated images OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS KEY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION 21 Presentation of joint ventures In the year to 31 March 2015, the Group adopted IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ which states that joint ventures should be accounted for as equity investments rather than by proportional consolidation. The Board has prepared an income statement and a balance sheet using proportional consolidation along with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) compliant versions presenting joint ventures as equity investments. The margin recognised on open market homes is expected to trend down towards the target margin over time as older developments which benefitted from more significant sales price inflation and minimal build cost inflation are replaced with sites appraised more recently. Secondly, a greater proportion of the revenue this year is generated from build to rent contracts which attract a lower gross margin to compensate for the advantages of being forward funded and for savings in selling expenses and interest costs. Non-refundable deposits are paid on exchange of contracts with a minimum 10 per cent received at that point and, where the Group is selling well ahead of completion, a further 10 per cent is paid 12 months after exchange. Telford Homes has a £180 million revolving credit facility which is available to fund developments that are not joint ventures. Joint venture developments are funded outside of the revolving credit facility with site specific loans secured as and when required.

Changes in both local and national Government can have a direct bearing on the regulatory environment. As a responsible business, we have been working in innovative and sustainable ways for many years. We are proud to have above industry average levels of employee retention, which is currently running at 90%. Even with this rate of growth we have been able to retain our unique culture, thanks to the Telford Homes behaviours that run through the business and which are now included as a core element of our induction process. We also require our supply chain partners to employ competent people and encourage their continuing professional development. This ensures we are constantly up to date with any changes in working practices or regulations.

These examples are used to advise clients, partners and future investors of the most appropriate delivery models.

Under the Group's annual bonus scheme for Executive Directors and senior management there is a deferred element to be paid in future years. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are tax deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. Judgement is required to assess whether the total eventual profit on each contract can be foreseen with reasonable certainty (note 13). This would apply to the Group's property lease for its office premises and motor vehicle leases. This dividend was declared after 31 March 2017 and as such the liability of £6,400,000 has not been recognised at that date. There have been no other additions or disposals of investments in subsidiary undertakings during the year ended 31 March 2017. There have been no other additions or disposals of investments in joint ventures during the year ended 31 March 2017. A full list of subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures not disclosed within this note is included on page 101. The operating cycle is such that a proportion of inventories will not be realised within 12 months. All schemes are equity-settled and options can normally be exercised three years after the grant date. Individual calculations have been performed for groups of share options with differing exercise prices and dates. This SIP has been approved by the Inland Revenue and confers certain tax advantages for participating employees. On 13 February 2017, the Group entered into a new 10 year contract to lease its existing head office. Borrowings The Group uses loan finance, all of which is denominated in sterling, to acquire development land and undertake site construction.
