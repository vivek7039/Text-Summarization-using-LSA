• formerly general works manager for xstrata vanadium’s rhovan integrated vanadium operations in sa, a position held since mid-2005; • malcolm previously held a range of senior management positions with xstrata sa from production manager to operations manager at rhovan, vantech and lydenburg operations, from 1995; • now president of vanitec for second term running. bushveld can mitigate this risk through its large, high-grade, low-cost resource base and scalable processing capacity. vrfbs have several features that make them ideal for utility scale, stationary energy storage applications: a) lifespan cycles – able to charge and discharge repeatedly (>35,000 times) giving it a long (>20 years) lifespan; b) capacity for 100% discharge without performance degradation is unique; c) capacity to store large quantities of energy and scalable up into the mw-range; d) very fast response time (<70kms); e) only one battery element – therefore no cross-contamination – unique among flow batteries; and f) 100% of vanadium is reusable upon decommissioning of the system. it showed that the three main uses for vrfbs in africa are expected to be energy-intensive storage applications requiring locational flexibility. initial estimates show highly favourable internal rates of return at globally competitive electrolyte pricing, and these are being detailed via a financial model. the largest cost driver for electrolyte production is operating expenses, of which over 85% are reagent costs, primarily vanadium. based on the highly favourable findings and recommendations of the techno-economic study, both bushveld energy and the idc have decided to pursue this opportunity further by: • studying possible locations within south africa for the electrolyte production facility, taking into account environmental requirements, logistics costs, ability to in-stream with existing vanadium processing and government incentives;
