this has resulted in the announced merger proposal between vodafone india and idea cellular, which will create a new, more competitive market player with the scale to invest in india’s digital future, while also capturing substantial synergies. in concluding, on behalf of the board i would like to express our appreciation to nick land and phil y ea, who will not seek re-election at our annual general meeting in july 201 7 after more than ten years of valuable service. by incorporating more energy efficient technology, such as free air cooling and solar power solutions whenever we upgrade

which has been largely stable over the last couple of years. we believe that gigabit networks direct to homes and businesses form the bedrock of modern digital communications infrastructure. in the 1990s, mobile phones were mostly used for calls on 2g networks, and basic picture messages could be sent at very low speeds of 50–200 kbps. €1.65tn value of the mobile and fixed market in 2016 1 69%

are increasingly taking bundles of mobile, landline, broadband and tv services. increasing competition the telecommunications industry is highly competitive, with many alternative providers, giving customers a wide choice of supplier. in addition, there are an increasing number of over-the-top (‘ott’) operators that provide internet-based apps for content, messaging and voice services. vodafone typically offers twice the number of 4g roaming destinations to its customers than any other operator. page 26 of this report shows how we are successfully aligning our business objectives with a clear social purpose to create value and meet customer expectations. chief executive’s strategic review review of the year vodafone’s transformation into a leading converged operator in our developed markets made further progress this year, while long- lasting tailwinds from rising smartphone penetration and data services adoption drove growth in our emerging markets. this was supported by our strategic differentiators – network leadership, customer experience excellence, and outstanding people – together with improved cost efficiency. overall, i am pleased to report that the group’s commercial and financial performance has further improved, although on a reported basis this was masked by currency headwinds. we have agreed a mechanism with the aditya birla group to equalise our shareholdings over time. an improved overall customer experience allowed us to introduce “more-for - more” propositions, in which customers received greater value for a higher monthly payment. a stronger overall organic service revenue performance translated into even faster organic adjusted ebitda growth (up 5.8%* vs. 2.3%* last year) thanks to good progress on cost efficiency, which nick read describes on page 16. none of these achievements would have been possible without the talent and dedication of our people, supported by the values of speed, simplicity and trust which we call “the vodafone way”. in developing markets, which typically lack extensive fixed infrastructure, demand for internet access via mobile is a long-lasting driver of data consumption and revenue growth. we now have 75 million 4g customers, up from 47 million a year ago – we want our customers to use data wherever they want, so our 4g roaming network now reaches 1 18 countries – we are preparing for 5g in the longer term by building more fibre connections to carry more data group data traffic growth in 2017 % europe amap group 57 78 65 figures exclude india and the netherlands. we are an established leader in mobile and our recent investments have positioned us as the leading challenger in fixed, with scope to gain significant profitable revenue market share by cross-selling fixed products to our mobile base. 36 million of these homes are connected by our own cable or fibre networks (including vodafoneziggo in the netherlands). our progress this past year has been strong: we remained europe’s fastest growing broadband company, winning 1.2 million new customers. this outperformance reflects four important differences in our business composition and strategy compared to a “typical” incumbent operator position. with seven times the coverage reach of existing gsm-based services and very low power consumption (devices could last up to ten years with a single aaa battery), this technology is likely to catalyse a new wave of innovation and industry growth. we have very limited exposure to declining fixed voice calling, or segments such as the uk public-sector which have been under pressure from government spending cuts; conversely, we enjoy strong growth in our emerging markets operations, for example with vodacom achieving 12% enterprise growth during the year. our core european mobile revenues remain under pressure as a result of intense competition, so it is important that we diversify into fixed and related services. these networks are being phased out, and customers migrated to modernised solutions, over the coming years. scale is also critical, as only a leading or co- leading market position – combined with highly efficient operations and talented people – provides us with sufficient cash generation to continue to invest, while also earning the necessary return for our shareholders. areas of significant cost saving included procurement, shared service centres, improved sales channel efficiency and standardised network design. these imply another reduction in absolute operating costs on an organic basis during the coming financial year. a focus on returns the group is performing strongly, supported by leading network quality and growing customer advocacy. we continue to deliver good cost efficiency, supporting the group’s improving free cash flow profile and underpinning our dividend. this approach is critical to ensure that we are allocating our capital investment towards higher return opportunities. under ifrs rules india is technically treated as a discontinued operation for 201 7 and prior financial years. this change will help to ensure that the company remains highly focused on capital efficiency moving forwards. our digital service channels also include live webchat capability, “my vodafone” app and artificial intelligence chatbots. maximised through our core programmes: customer experience excellence brand vodafone is one of the most recognised and valuable telecoms brands in the world, with an attributed worth of us$22 billion 1 , which helps us to retain and attract customers. maximised through our core programmes: people and culture financial resources over the last three years we have generated strong free cash flow and our pro-forma ratio of net debt to adjusted ebitda at 2.2 times is below the industry average. among our fixed broadband customers, 1 1 million (including vodafoneziggo) take high-speed fibre providing download speeds up to one giga bit per second. 24% share of service revenue from fixed services (2016: 23 %) free cash flow we have a strong track record of converting revenues into free cash flows – with some €6.7 billion generated over the last three years – despite the increased investment in project spring. 18 markets have tailored reward programmes (2016: 11) 16.2% consumer contract churn (2016: 17.1%) network leadership investing in our infrastructure over the year we invested €7 .7 billion in network and it infrastructure, which has enabled us to further expand our reliability, data speeds, coverage and customer service. developing our people 81% of employees feel that they can learn the skills and knowledge to do their jobs well. we also want our employees to act in the vodafone way – by operating with speed, simplicity and trust 1 . first, initiatives focused on female employees to support our goal of building a diverse and inclusive organisation. third, incorporating digital technology to improve our hiring process, career development tools and the workplace experience. we continued to make good progress this year, but further improvements are needed, particularly in the uk. more work to do grow adjusted ebitda faster than service revenue, improving margins out of 22 markets we established multi-year margin improvement targets for all markets and aim to grow organic adjusted ebitda faster than service revenue. vodafone group plc annual report 2017 22 customer experience excellence network leadership fit for growth people and culture strategic growth engines 4g customers 1,2 million to monetise our 4g investments, we aim to migrate and attract new customers onto our 4g network. we have significantly expanded our 4g customer base and as a result data usage has increased by 65% over the last year. within this we added 0.7 million converged customers, i.e. those taking both a fixed and mobile integrated service. our “code of conduct” outlines the behaviours we expect from every single person working for and with vodafone. further details can be found on the vodafone way, code of conduct and our business principles at vodafone.com/ governance. this year we launched our fourth annual global wellbeing challenge on world heart day in october 2016. the 2016–17 survey demonstrated that 87% of employees who responded are proud to work for vodafone, one point higher than in 2015–16. our sustainable business strategy is founded on vodafone’s long- standing commitment to responsible behaviour in everything we do. at the centre of that strategy, launched in 2016, is our intention to work towards three significant global transformation goals. importantly, each goal has been derived from, and will be achieved by means of, our core long-term business objectives. equally, failure to manage risk could have an adverse impact on the achievement of our strategic goals. this also allows us to consolidate our view on risk looking across all local markets, functions and specialist areas. all local markets and entities identify their priority risks which are consolidated into a group-wide view. – we have increased our engagement with risk owners to improve monitoring of key risks, actions and indicators. we seek successful it transformation initiatives as the vehicle for delivering a great customer experience, high-quality reliable systems, improving our time to market and enabling best-in-class digital capabilities. as a multinational business, we operate in many countries and currencies so changes to global economic conditions can impact us. key risk indicators we monitor multiple trends including: – privileged user access levels – confirmed security incidents – critical vulnerabilities changes since last report organisations in all sectors are targeted by an increasing volume and sophistication of cyber attacks. we actively look for opportunities, in all markets, to provide services beyond mobile through organic investment, acquisitions, partnerships, or joint ventures. this is an unlikely risk; however, it would have a major impact on services used by our customers in all our markets – particularly in countries that have a very low tolerance for environmental and health related risks. key risk indicators – results of the annual compliance testing programme – number of speak up cases in each market – changes to applicable legal and regulatory requirements changes since last report with mature compliance programmes in place, this risk remains stable. we actively seek to improve these programmes and this year will see a focus on ensuring compliance with the eu general data protection regulation. a cross-functional team, led by two executive committee members, has identified ways in which brexit might affect the group’s operations. although this review has considered severe but plausible scenarios relevant to the group, any such review cannot consider all risks which may occur, therefore an overall view of the total level of risk required to impede our viability was also considered. see “alternative performance measures” on page 205 for further details and reconciliations to the respective closest equivalent gaap measure. on an organic basis, adjusted ebitda increased 3.1%*, driven by tight cost control through our “fit for growth” programme. margin expansion was driven by revenue growth, our focus on more profitable direct channels and a reduction of underlying operating costs. mobile service revenue grew 1.5%* (q3: 1.4%*, q4: 1.4%*) driven by arpu growth in prepaid following changes to our tariff plans and improved data monetisation through targeted “more-for-more” offers. we also launched our advanced digital “vodafone tv” proposition in march 201 7 , which is gaining good early traction. service revenue declined 3.3%* (q3: -3.2%*, q4: -4.8%*) reflecting the impact of operational challenges, increased competition in enterprise and lower roaming revenues. excluding carrier service revenue, fixed service revenue declined 2.5%* in q4, reflecting a strong comparator together with the ongoing effect of two large contract losses during the year as we balanced our growth objectives with a focus on customer profitability. in march 2017 , we reached a commercial wholesale agreement with telefónica to access its fibre network in both regulated and deregulated areas, which expands our ngn footprint to 18.7 million homes passed (almost 65% population coverage), of which 10.2 million are on our own network. on an organic basis service revenue was up 7 .7%* driven by strong commercial momentum in south africa, turkey and egypt. our market-leading network has now reached 76% 4g coverage (up from 58% in the prior year), and we have 6.0 million 4g customers. in south africa, margin improvement was supported by a subsidy shift towards data enabled devices, improved channel efficiencies, rationalisation of offices and network cost savings. other amap service revenue grew by 10.8%* (q3: 10.5%*, q4: 9.8%*), with strong local currency growth in turkey, egypt and ghana. vha continued to grow service revenue (excluding mtrs), driven by growth in our contract customer base and arpu. local currency adjusted ebitda grew 19.0%, driven by an increase in underlying revenue and strong commercial cost discipline. this was driven by lower projected cash flows within our business plan as a result of increased competition in the market. alternative performance measures are non -gaap measures that are presented to provide readers with additional financial information that is regularly reviewed by management and should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent gaap measure. see “alternative performance measures” on page 205 for further details and reconciliations to the respective closest equivalent gaap measure. dividend payments on ordinary shares will be paid directly into a nominated bank or building society account. board engagement with operations is also an important aspect of our focus on talent development and succession planning. board changes and diversity in january 201 7 , we announced the appointment of maria amparo moraleda martinez as a non-executive director with effect from 1 june 2017 . we are also looking at measures to increase diversity on the boards of our subsidiary businesses in local markets. by embedding the vodafone way into our processes, we strive for a culture of speed, simplicity and trust. our culture is not static and has evolved over time, reflecting the changing environment we operate in. nick

currency was changed from pounds sterling to the euro to better align with the geographic split of the group’s operations as detailed in note 1 “basis of preparation”. the group believes it adequately manages or mitigates its solvency and liquidity risks through two primary processes, described below. those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. we determined that the carrying value of deferred tax assets at 31 march 2017 was supported by management’s plans including intercompany funding arrangements. based on our procedures, we noted no exceptions and consider management’s key assumptions to be within a reasonable range. based on our procedures, we noted no issues and were satisfied with the associated accounting for these matters. further details on items in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income can be found in the

preparation”. a discussion on the group’s critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty is detailed below. in determining and applying accounting policies, directors and management are required to make judgements in respect of items where the choice of specific policy, accounting estimate or assumption to be followed could materially affect the group’s reported financial position, results or cash flows; it may later be determined that a different choice may have been more appropriate. critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty revenue recognition arrangements with multiple deliverables in revenue arrangements where more than one good or service is provided to the customer, customer consideration is allocated between the goods and services using relative fair value principles. the final resolution of uncertain tax positions may give rise to material profits, losses and/ or cash flows. post employment benefits management uses estimates when determining the group’s liabilities and expenses arising for defined benefit pension schemes. further details, including a sensitivity analysis, are included in note 26 “post employment benefits” to the consolidated financial statements. management prepares formal five year forecasts for the group’s operations, which are used to estimate their value in use. further details, including a sensitivity analysis, are included in note 4 “impairment losses” to the consolidated financial statements. the performance obligations identified will depend on the nature of individual customer contracts, but might typically be identified for mobile handsets, other equipment provided to customers and for services provided to customers such as mobile and fixed line communications services. vodafone group plc annual report 2017 108 1. basis of preparation (continued) – under ifrs 15, certain incremental costs incurred in acquiring a contract with a customer will be deferred on the consolidated statement of financial position and amortised as revenue is recognised under the related contract; this will generally lead to the later recognition of charges for some commissions payable to third party dealers and employees. the arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on its relative fair value. cash incentives that do not meet these criteria are recognised as a reduction of the related revenue. this had the effect of reducing equipment revenue and decreasing direct expenses, with no impact on profits or cash flows. these services had a value of approximately €3 million through to completion and are included in the table above. this was driven by lower projected cash flows within our business plan as a result of increased competition in the market. y ear ended 31 march 2017 as a discontinued operation, vodafone india has been valued at fair value less costs to sell. vodafone group plc annual report 2017 117 overview strategy performance governance financials additional information 5. investment income and financing costs investment income comprises interest received from short-term investments, bank deposits, government bonds and results from foreign exchange contracts which are used to hedge net debt. t ax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they either relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. a deferred tax asset of €19,632 million (2016: €23,942 million) has been recognised in respect of these losses, as we conclude it is probable that the luxembourg entities will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses. a deferred tax asset of €2,799 million (2016: €2,858 million) has been recognised in respect of these losses as we conclude it is probable that the german business will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses. a deferred tax asset of €914 million (2016: €851 million) has been recognised in respect of ono’s losses as we conclude it is probable that the spanish business will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses. income statement and segment analysis of discontinued operations 2017 restated 2016 restated 2015 €m €m €m revenue

proceedings contingent liabilities are potential future cash outflows, where the likelihood of payment is considered more than remote, but is not considered probable or cannot be measured reliably. legal proceedings the company and its subsidiaries are currently, and may from time to time become, involved in a number of legal proceedings, including inquiries from, or discussions with, governmental authorities that are incidental to their operations. the finance act 2012, which amended various provisions of the income tax act 1961 with retrospective effect, contained provisions intended to tax any gain on transfer of shares in a non-indian company, which derives substantial value from underlying indian assets, such as vihbv’s transaction with htil in 2007 . in june 2016, the tribunal was fully constituted with sir franklin berman kcmg qc appointed as presiding arbitrator. a hearing has been adjourned until some time in july or august 2017 with no specified date. vodafone has contractual indemnities from suppliers which have been invoked in relation to the alleged patent infringement liability. this matter has been ongoing since 2001. the german courts are also determining whether “squeeze out” compensation is payable to affected mannesmann shareholders in a similar proceeding. judgement was handed down by the court in august 2015, awarding €12 million
