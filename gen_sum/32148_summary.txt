On average, a customer consumes 203 outgoing minutes per month, which has been largely stable over the last couple of years. In the 1990s, mobile phones were mostly used for calls on 2G networks, and basic picture messages could be sent at very low speeds of 50–200 Kbps. In addition, there are an increasing number of over-the-top (‘OTT’) operators that provide internet-based apps for content, messaging and voice services. Page 26 of this report shows how we are successfully aligning our business objectives with a clear social purpose to create value and meet customer expectations. Overall, I am pleased to report that the Group’s commercial and financial performance has further improved, although on a reported basis this was masked by currency headwinds. An improved overall customer experience allowed us to introduce “more-for - more” propositions, in which customers received greater value for a higher monthly payment. In developing markets, which typically lack extensive fixed infrastructure, demand for internet access via mobile is a long-lasting driver of data consumption and revenue growth. Our core European mobile revenues remain under pressure as a result of intense competition, so it is important that we diversify into fixed and related services. Among our fixed broadband customers, 1 1 million (including VodafoneZiggo) take high-speed fibre providing download speeds up to one giga bit per second. We have significantly expanded our 4G customer base and as a result data usage has increased by 65% over the last year. We seek successful IT transformation initiatives as the vehicle for delivering a great customer experience, high-quality reliable systems, improving our time to market and enabling best-in-class digital capabilities. As a multinational business, we operate in many countries and currencies so changes to global economic conditions can impact us. Key risk indicators We monitor multiple trends including: – Privileged user access levels – Confirmed security incidents – Critical vulnerabilities Changes since last report Organisations in all sectors are targeted by an increasing volume and sophistication of cyber attacks. We actively look for opportunities, in all markets, to provide services beyond mobile through organic investment, acquisitions, partnerships, or joint ventures. We actively seek to improve these programmes and this year will see a focus on ensuring compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation. A cross-functional team, led by two Executive Committee members, has identified ways in which Brexit might affect the Group’s operations. Margin expansion was driven by revenue growth, our focus on more profitable direct channels and a reduction of underlying operating costs. Mobile service revenue grew 1.5%* (Q3: 1.4%*, Q4: 1.4%*) driven by ARPU growth in prepaid following changes to our tariff plans and improved data monetisation through targeted “more-for-more” offers. In South Africa, margin improvement was supported by a subsidy shift towards data enabled devices, improved channel efficiencies, rationalisation of offices and network cost savings. This was driven by lower projected cash flows within our business plan as a result of increased competition in the market.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP also identified this as an area of higher audit effort and the Committee received reporting from it on these matters. This remains an area of audit focus and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP provided detailed reporting on these matters to the Committee, including sensitivity testing. The 2015 Global Long-Term Incentive award was subject to free cash flow and TSR performance as measured over a three year period ending 31 March 2017 .

In determining and applying accounting policies, Directors and management are required to make judgements in respect of items where the choice of specific policy, accounting estimate or assumption to be followed could materially affect the Group’s reported financial position, results or cash flows; it may later be determined that a different choice may have been more appropriate. Post employment benefits Management uses estimates when determining the Group’s liabilities and expenses arising for defined benefit pension schemes. This was driven by lower projected cash flows within our business plan as a result of increased competition in the market. Accounting policies Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 147 Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials Additional information Committed bank facilities Amounts drawn Terms and conditions 2 December 2014 US$0.8 billion loan facility, maturing 2 June 2018. The Group uses a number of derivative instruments for currency and interest rate risk management purposes only that are transacted by specialist treasury personnel. Money market investments are in accordance with established internal treasury policies which dictate that an investment’s long-term credit rating is no lower than mid BBB. 2 Level 1 classification comprises financial instruments where fair value is determined by unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 5 Commercial paper and other bank loans are held at amortised cost with fair values calculated from market observable data where appropriate. Operating lease commitments The Group has entered into commercial leases on certain properties, network infrastructure, motor vehicles and items of equipment. On 9 June 2016, Vodafone announced its intention to merge with Sky Network Television in New Zealand, thereby creating the country’s leading integrated telecommunications and media group. Both cases have been adjourned until September 2018, but it is possible that Papistas may re-file his claim under the new Greek civil procedure regime (which aims to hear trials within one year). Mr. Makate failed to obtain from the Constitutional Court a second order that compensation be based on revenue rather than fees for his contribution. Unless otherwise stated the Company’s subsidiaries all have share capital consisting solely of ordinary shares and are indirectly held. We have made further strong progress on network investment, with 87% 4G coverage and dropped call rates declining 25% year-on-year to an all-time low of 0.44%. The mobile business is on a steady recovery path, while fixed performance continues to be positive despite increased competition in recent months. Excluding this effect, adjusted EBITDA margins rose driven by operating leverage, tight cost control and a tailwind from foreign exchange gains. A strong revenue performance and improved margins in Turkey were partly offset by higher costs for imported goods post foreign exchange rate devaluations across the region. Fixed assets Accounting policies Shares in Group undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment and capital related to share-based payments. This ensures secure delivery and means dividend payments are credited to shareholders’ bank or building society accounts on the same day as payment. However, the Company does not maintain calculations of its earnings and profits in accordance with US federal income tax accounting principles. US holders should therefore assume that any distribution by the Company with respect to shares will be reported as ordinary dividend income. Deutsch Telekom’s vectoring deployment is expected to commence in September 201 7 , once the existing unbundled local loop (‘ULL ’) reference offer updates have been finalised. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 218 Definition of terms Unaudited information 2G 2G networks are operated using global system for mobile (‘GSM’) technology which offers services such as voice, text messaging and low speed data. The Group’s definition of adjusted EBIT may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other companies. The Group’s definition of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other companies. This removes the need for customers to make capital investments and instead they have an operating cost model with a recurring monthly fee.
