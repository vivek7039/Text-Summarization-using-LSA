04 annual report 2017 bgeo group plc at a glance retail banking client-centric, multi-brand strategy for our c.2.3 million clients. we are the leading retail banking player in georgia, serving c.2.3 million clients through the widest network of 281 retail branches, 850 atms and 2,842 express pay (self-service) terminals, a sales force of more than 3,000 people, along with our diverse products and services. our bank is a leading corporate lender in the country, with deep sector knowledge and local expertise. our property & casualty business (p&c or aldagi) is a leading player in the georgian p&c insurance market, with a market share of 38.6% based on gross premiums earned as of and for the nine months ended 30 september 2017. the company offers a wide range of insurance products in georgia to corporate and retail clients, covering more than 47,000 customers through five business lines: motor, property, credit life, liability and other insurance services. ghg offers by far the most comprehensive range of inpatient and outpatient services in georgia. ghg is also the second largest provider of medical insurance in georgia with a 29.0% market share based on gross revenue and has approximately 155,000 insurance customers at january 2018. at 31 december 2017, in line with ifrs, ghg is classified as a “disposal group held for sale” and the results of its operations are reported under “discontinued operations”. generated power is primarily used by ggu’s water business, with the excess amount sold to third parties. we will have created three large groups, all quoted on the london stock exchange, each with their own board, management, and strategic logic. according to transparency international, georgia has maintained its ranking as a low bribery environment — on a par with many european union member states b. georgia’s ease of doing business ranking was 9th out of 190 countries in the world, in 2018, up from 16th last year. the new york times reported last year on russia’s attempts to provoke georgia on the boundaries of abkhazia and south ossetia – all true; but we also see that russia is doing more business with georgia, specifically in terms of transport links and increased tourism flows. elsewhere, turkey remains georgia’s largest trade partner, whilst the development of trading links with iran are likely to take more time than we originally thought. second, each entity will be freer to pursue its own growth strategy without worrying about “the group”. this might not have happened if we had decided to stay in the “previous structure”. the bank is repositioning its portfolio away from straight lending to corporates which require capital and see their margins diminishing. the bank has a very good management team with kaha kiknavelidze as its leader, and they are at work on this strategy. the healthcare company, ghg, is a stand-alone entity today, with its own board and separate stock market listing. we have attracted cecil quillen to the bank’s board and are actively seeking an additional member. unfortunately, at the outset, we will still have only one woman on each of our boards. this year we have moved further into changing our corporate culture in every one of the entities. before closing, i would like to thank irakli gilauri for his leadership as chief executive officer. during his tenure at bgeo, irakli has taken a georgia quoted bank and transformed it into the organisation with multiple businesses which we have today. our property and casualty insurance business, aldagi, continues development of a strong portfolio of new products, supporting 24.6% year-on-year growth in net earned premiums during 2017 and aldagi’s position as the clear market leader in the fast-developing georgian p&c insurance market. over the last few months, aldagi has also enhanced its distribution capabilities by signing major third- party partnership agreements with two georgian banks – liberty bank and credo bank – which will support the further diversification of aldagi’s multi-channel distribution network. sincerely yours, irakli gilauri, chief executive officer 7 march 2018 this strategic report as set out on pages 2 to 75 was approved by the board of directors on 7 march 2018 and signed on its behalf by irakli gilauri chief executive officer 7 march 2018 10 annual report 2017 bgeo group plc industry and market overview reforms-driven success georgia has carried out genuine economic and structural improvements which have been institutionalised. the economic liberty act also requires electorates’ approval through a nationwide referendum for imposing new taxes and raising existing tax rates, subject to certain exceptions. moreover, georgia-china economic ties are increasing and a free trade agreement signed in 2017 is expected to further expand the chinese market for georgia’s exports. once completed, it will be the first georgian port capable of accommodating panamax size cargo vessels. georgia is a regional energy corridor that accounts for approximately 1.6% of the world’s oil and gas supply transit volumes. 12.4% croatia 12.7% 3.6% bulgaria kazakhstan 12.8% 15.5% non-performing loans (%), 2017 latest available data stable energy supply and electricity transit hub potential. georgia’s business-friendly environment coupled with its sustainable growth prospects continues to attract foreign investments. georgia’s liberal economic reforms and business-friendly environment supported substantial foreign direct investment (fdi) over the past decade. georgia’s existing free trade deals (with the eu, cis, efta, turkey, and china) enable it to access a market of 2.8 billion customers without customs duties. the prospective free trade agreements with hong kong and india also offer significant upside potential for georgia’s exports. ongoing reforms in various directions – pension reform, capital market development and business enhancing measures – are expected to further support investments, thus reinforcing the country’s economic potential. the group’s current business model is simple and purpose-built to capture growth opportunities in georgia. ability to replace more costly borrowings with cheaper funding also leads to improved funding costs: • lower deposit rates than offered on the market • cost of client deposits and notes 3.5% in 2017 down from 7.5% in 2010 • cost of funds 4.7% in 2017 down from 8.2% in 2010 bgeo’s superior access to capital markets access to capital markets nov 2015 ifc loan to m 2 real estate us$ 23,000,000 and us$

additional information the current low level of insurance market penetration in georgia (1.2%, of which 0.6% relates to p&c insurance and 0.6% to medical insurance) provides enormous potential of growth and aldagi is well equipped to capture these opportunities. aldagi aims to triple its current net profit and become a gel 50 million net profit company by 2022. the company plans to achieve this by strategically focusing on each of its three main business lines set out below: retail customers. the georgian retail insurance market offers ample room for growth, as most of its potential is yet to be unlocked. in 2017, aldagi actively worked on developing new products and introduced livestock insurance to underpenetrated rural areas. although the level of insurance penetration within the corporate segment is relatively high compared to retail and sme segments, a combination of favourable georgian macroeconomic conditions, a good investment climate, stable economic growth and an increase in infrastructure projects will further increase customer demand for insurance products. targets and priorities for three business directions • no mandatory lines, border and local mtpl, also gtpl mandatory insurance to be introduced • develop simple products for mass retail • digitilisation of all processes • more partnership with financial institutions after demerger • underpenetrated market • developing tailored products • digital portal for sme • good investment climate • stable economic growth • increase in infrastructural projects retail | penetration low sme | penetration zero

to customers and finance lease receivables over the same period. other measures, such as various investments in it aimed at optimising of workflow processes and cost centre reporting procedures, represent the cost control measures we continue to deploy across the board in order to keep a tight grip on costs. we have worked to ensure that managing risk is ingrained in our everyday business activities. controls are reviewed to ensure effective management of strategic, financial, operational and compliance, among other risks we face. we will also provide online training focused on the importance of risk management and internal controls. we also identified other risks which, while not necessarily severe in themselves, could escalate when combined with others. we disclose those which we believe are likely to have had the greatest impact on our business at this moment in time and which have been discussed in depth at recent board, audit or risk committee meetings. key drivers/ trends the group’s operations are primarily located, and most of its revenue is sourced from, georgia. the credit quality review process is continuous and provides early identification of possible changes in the creditworthiness of customers, including regular collateral revaluations, potential losses and corrective actions needed to reduce risk, which may include obtaining additional collateral in accordance with underlying loan agreements. the group’s operations are primarily located, and most of its revenue is sourced from, georgia. russia is opposed to the eastward enlargement of nato, potentially, including former soviet republics such as georgia. despite tensions in the breakaway territories, russia has continued to open its export market to georgian exports since 2013. while lower global commodity prices and macroeconomic factors have affected georgia’s regional trading partners, leading to lower exports within the region, georgia has benefited from increased exports earnings from non-traditional markets such as switzerland, china, egypt, saudi arabia, south korea and singapore. during 2017, georgia delivered real gdp growth of 4.8% from 2.8% in 2016. regulatory risk principal risk/ uncertainty the group operates across a wide range of industries, principally banking, but also healthcare services, pharmacy, insurance, real estate, water and energy utility, hydro power, wine and beverages. as part of this process, we engage in constructive dialogue with regulatory bodies, where possible, and seek external advice on potential changes to legislation. our compliance framework, at all levels, is subject to regular review by internal audit and external assurance providers. key drivers/ trends during 2017, we saw a number of major organisations subjected to cyber-attacks, although fortunately, our operations were not materially affected. mitigation we have an integrated control framework encompassing operational risk management, it systems, corporate and other data security each of which is managed by a separate department. key drivers/ trends each investment business – ggu, m 2 , aldagi, teliani, georgia healthcare group – faces their own risks. for each business, we focus on building a strong management team and have successfully been able to do so thus far. we have also sought and continue to seek advice from experienced global professionals in our industries. all exposures to single group borrowers over us$ 25.0 million require approval by the supervisory board. it also detects critical risk areas or groups of operations with an increased risk level and develops internal control procedures to address these risks, through (among other things) business-process redesign schemes, including document circulation, information streams, distribution of functions, permissions and responsibility. the bank also runs worst case scenarios that could arise in light of extreme events. monitoring and controlling of risks is primarily performed based on limits established by the bank. in order to avoid excessive concentrations of risks, the bank focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio. the bank also mitigates its credit risk by obtaining collateral and using other security arrangements. credit committee members have equal voting authority and decisions are approved by a simple majority of votes. the main forms of collateral for corporate lending are charges over real estate properties, equipment, inventory and trade receivables and the main form of collateral for retail lending is a mortgage over residential property. 42 annual report 2017 bgeo group plc provisions are made against gross loan amounts and accrued interest. in accordance with georgian legislation, the bank is obliged to repay such deposits upon demand of a depositor. amounts due to credit institutions and debt securities are taken from a wide range of counterparties. the bank has elaborated a framework, which is in compliance with normative acts defined by georgian legislation and international standards. the index is designed to demonstrate strong environmental, social and governance (esg) practices measured against international standards. these procedures are now being integrated into the bank’s credit risk management process and soon will be routinely applied to all commercial transactions. for environmental and social due diligence of certain high risk projects, the bank contracts independent external experts. through this approximation process, georgia is actively developing and amending its national legislation in the relevant sectors. the plant has an installed capacity of 10.0mw and will contribute on average 43.0gwh to local energy generation annually. in 2017, the bank financed several important projects and among them is caucasus roads project (crp) – a leading georgian construction company with its main focus on core infrastructure. the bank supported atlantic group, a french manufacturer of heating systems and home appliance products, with around us$ 2 million credit line. in 2017, the bank developed web-based application processing tools that enable completion of a full lending cycle remotely. it now offers special discounts on public transport and free distance banking services, among other benefits. we have developed a wide range of financial products to support young people in georgia. examples of such products are student loans with favourable terms that do not require any financial guarantees and collateral. together, we have co-financed agricultural loans at fixed annual interest rates, which are partially subsidised by apma. environmental and social risk management processes of sme clients are embedded throughout the bank’s activities. affordable housing currently, the georgian real estate market is vulnerable to various economic and financial uncertainties. nowadays, m 2 is a major player in georgia’s real estate market, offering its customers turnkey apartments with fine-tuned infrastructure: fire-alarm systems in accordance with international standards, round-the-clock security service, maintenance of elevators, as well as common and green areas. aldagi’s employees are engaged in various programmes that supply socially vulnerable people with food and first aid kits. ghg traditionally participates in the state children’s oncology programme, under which the company offers cancer-related conditions treatment for children with different cancer disorders (leukaemia, tumours, and lymphomas) in ghg’s iashvili paediatric tertiary referral hospital, a multi-profile paediatric medical establishment. bank of georgia university has offered a top quality master’ s degree programme since its foundation in 2014. the university welcomed its fourth intake of mba students in 2017 and simultaneously launched a bachelor’ s degree programme. in 2017, the group provided gbp 89,532 to finance a master’s degree programme for three students. m 2 is in the process of constructing a new specialised family-type home for children with severe disabilities. after construction and renovation works are completed, seven children with severe forms of disability will be moved to live in the house. it is worth noting that all m 2 buildings are friendly to people with special needs. we recognise the importance of observing human rights and are committed to implementing socially responsible business practices. in 2012, bank of georgia established a new format for its traditional internship programme and constantly develops it. the project selects a number of young and talented candidates for various assignments within bgeo group. ggu has been working in collaboration with the country’s leading universities, professional colleges and their career services to attract new talent. following our aspiration to develop strong leaders, we have developed an extensive leadership development programme. employees involved in the programme gained a greater awareness of their leadership strengths and opportunities for future growth. for example, the bank’s mentoring programme is part of a front office training process. the corporate and information security department provides annual online training for employees on anti-bribery issues, which are also included in induction trainings. nevertheless, we undertake a number of measures to reduce electricity, paper, water and fuel consumption. centralised uninterruptible power supply is being installed in the bank’s service centres, which will save considerable energy resources compared to individual systems. special storing rooms were set up in ghg’s hospitals, to place waste before final disposal. all used sharps are placed only in the labelled, hermetic single-use special containers made of hard plastic. data from joint ventures, investments or sub-leased properties have not been included within the reported figures.

feasibility stage and once complete, ggu expects to commence construction works. new tariffs for ggu’s commercial customers, all of which are metered, decreased by 0.4% to gel 4.40 (per m 3 ). effective from 2q17, we are reporting ggu results on a pro-forma basis together with renewable energy business and have retrospectively revised the comparable information accordingly. the y-o-y increase in revenue from water supply to both legal entities and individuals in 2017 reflects enhanced measurement results based on an efficient new metering programme (the new metering programme entails replacement of amortised or obsolete meters for legal entities, metering of residential customers and detection of illegal connections) – revenue from electricity power sales amounted to gel 9.8 million in 2017 (down 3.5% y-o-y). as a result, ggu had only gel 6.9 million overdue receivables outstanding at 31 december 2017. while the georgian water utility sector has historically had low receivables collection rates, as a result of ggu’s arrangement with electricity suppliers since 2011, which allows disconnection of non-paying water customers from the electricity network, ggu’s collection rates remain very strong at around 96%. m 2 targets to meet the unsatisfied demand in tbilisi for housing through its well established branch network and sales force. accordingly, y-o-y

georgia healthcare ecosystem with an aggregated value of gel 3.5 billion. the high level of diversification was achieved through ghg’s entrance and further expansion into the pharmacy business, which is funded almost entirely out-of-pocket and therefore, helped ghg to further diversify its revenue by payment sources. the loss ratio of medical insurance business remained largely flat y-o-y in 2017. as anticipated, healthcare services business margins are temporarily reduced due to launches of new healthcare facilities and services, which are currently in their rapid build-out phase. healthcare services business spent a total of gel 89.3 million in 2017 on capital expenditures, primarily on the extensive renovations of deka and tbilisi referral (formerly sunstone) hospitals, as well as

board can be found on our website, at reserved-for-the-board. we also hold meetings at our london offices, with directors either attending in person or via teleconference. as noted later in this report, the board believes that its size and composition are appropriate. each non-executive director has an ongoing obligation to inform the board of any circumstances which could impair his or her independence. as mentioned earlier in this report, the board nomination committee is responsible for both director and executive management succession planning. similarly, we are clear that diversity of outlook and approach, while inevitably being difficult to measure, may be equally as important. we have also increased our maternity leave benefits and now provide a one-off bonus for newborn or adopted children. • jonathan muir was officially appointed to the board on 20 june 2017 as an independent non-executive director. the audit committee works to a planned programme of activities focused on key events in the annual financial reporting cycle and standing items that it considers regularly under its terms of reference (reviewed and updated on 11 december 2017). attendance at meetings by committee members can be found on page 86 of the corporate governance framework. we also reviewed and monitored management’s responsiveness to the corrective measures through follow-up reports provided by internal audit. in particular, we have developed a whistleblowing policy which allows staff to confidentially raise any concerns about business practices. we keep this policy under review and receive regular updates from management as to any issues raised by employees. based on the above, we are satisfied that our overall internal control framework is effective. in addition to aligning with the period covered by the group’s strategy and financial forecasts, this three-year period seems particularly appropriate for a company whose business model continues to evolve in a rapidly developing frontier market like georgia’s. as reported last year, part of our strategy to achieve a 20%+ return on equity in the banking business included enhancing an already prudent risk management process. we reviewed the committee’s terms of reference and updated them in september 2017 to reflect current best practice. retail banking successfully increased its local currency loans by nearly 68.7% between 2016 and 2017. despite approximately 83.1% of our corporate investment loan book being denominated in dollars, more than 43% of corporate investment customers with dollar loans have income in dollars. the georgian government’s de-dollarisaton initiatives and our ability to attract local currency funding have been primary drivers of this. an overview of our risk management framework is set out on pages 32 to 33. a description of these principal risks and uncertainties, in addition to recent trends and outlook, as well as mitigation efforts can be found on pages 34 to

group plc mr gilauri’s interests in group debt securities, real estate and amex card directors and executive management of the group from time to time will purchase securities or real estate from group entities on an arm’s length basis. in the interest of transparency, such transactions entered into by our sole executive director, mr gilauri, are described below. these key principles have remained the same since 2010. our simple and strategically aligned remuneration structure means that executive directors are completely focused on delivering shareholder value. • the level of base salary for an executive director is fixed in his or her service agreement. • performance-based remuneration is awarded entirely in the form of nil-cost options over bgeo shares which are deferred (no cash bonus). shareholders should note that the cost of providing comparable benefits in different jurisdictions may vary widely. our retention rate of employees is high and in 2017 the survey also confirmed that we remain a competitive employer. shareholders should note that the cost of providing comparable expenses in different jurisdictions may vary widely. • relocation support for an incoming executive director and, where relevant, his or her family may be provided depending on the individual’s circumstances. bgeo has not set a maximum aggregate amount that may be paid in respect of any individual’s relocation support, but it will aim to provide support of an appropriate level and quality on the best terms that can reasonably be obtained. • the group may make a contribution towards legal fees in connection with agreeing employment terms. the directors’ service agreements and letters of appointment are kept for inspection by shareholders at bgeo’s registered office. (ii) mr gilauri will be entitled to: a separation payment of 12 months’ cash salary; accrued and unpaid cash salary; holiday pay; and reimbursement of business expenses upon termination of the service agreement in the following circumstances: • by mr gilauri for “good reason”; • by the bank for any other reason excluding: (a) voluntary termination by mr gilauri; (b) termination for cause; or (c) death or permanent disability (fully covered by insurance); or • if the service agreement is not renewed on substantially similar terms on expiry. directors’ remuneration report continued 111 annual

unvested deferred share remuneration granted in respect of the 2015 work year and all prior work years unvested deferred share remuneration granted in respect of the 2015 work year and all prior work years will vest upon termination of the service agreement, save for in the following circumstances: • if mr gilauri’s service agreement is terminated for cause, unless otherwise agreed with the board, his unvested deferred share remuneration will lapse. if mr gilauri’s service agreement expires and: (i) is not renewed upon substantially similar terms, or (ii) he does not accept a new service agreement, but he continues as a member of the bgeo and/or jsc bgeo group board, 50% of his unvested shares vest immediately and the remaining 50% shall continue to vest as normal. • unvested deferred share remuneration would lapse upon termination of the service agreement by bgeo or material subsidiary of bgeo for cause or if the executive director terminated their employment for any other reason than good reason. further malus applies to discretionary deferred shares if it is determined that there was a material misstatement in the financial results. the rights and obligations attaching to bgeo’s ordinary shares are set out in its articles of association. in accordance with a request issued by bgeo, sanne fiduciary services limited has waived its right to receive any dividends. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. as allowed by the standard, it is applied prospectively from 1 january 2017, with no restatement of comparatives. as with any major new accounting standard, there is a risk that the group does not apply ifrs 15 appropriately. • we agreed transactions on a sample basis in each of the in-scope components to supporting evidence, including underlying contracts and cash receipts to determine whether revenue had been recognised in accordance with the group’s accounting policies and ifrs. the samples used for this testing were increased to reflect that revenue recognition is a significant risk. although the valuations are performed by appropriately qualified valuers, there remains a risk that individual assets might be inappropriately valued. • the group operates across various industries some of which, including banking, insurance, public utilities and healthcare, are highly regulated environments. 126 annual report 2017 bgeo group plc consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 december

financial statement as they reflect the adjustments made for change in the composition of segments as described in note 7 and discontinued operations described in note 6. the accompanying notes on pages 139 to 212 are an integral part of these financial statements. the financial statements are presented in thousands of georgian lari (“gel”), except per-share amounts and unless otherwise indicated. also, fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in note 32. fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. gains and losses resulting from these instruments are included in the consolidated income statement as net foreign currency gain (loss). after initial recognition, borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. amounts due from credit institutions, loans to customers and finance lease receivables for amounts due from credit institutions, loans to customers and finance lease receivables carried at amortised cost, the group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. if the group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risks characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment. future cash flows on a group of financial assets that are collectively evaluated for impairment are estimated on the basis of historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics similar to those in the group. deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences using the liability method. georgia and belarus also have various operating taxes that are assessed on the group’s activities. gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of investment property are recorded in the income statement within net other banking income for banking business companies and within real estate revenue or gross other investment profit for investment business companies, depending on whether the gains derive from active property development or passive appreciation respectively. valuations are performed once every three years, unless there is a sign of material change in fair values on the market. any inadequacy is immediately charged to the consolidated income statement by establishing an unexpired risk provision. where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in equity. treasury shares are stated at par value, with adjustment of premiums against additional paid-in capital. loan commitment fees for loans that are likely to be drawn down and other credit related fees are deferred (together with any incremental costs) and recognised as an adjustment to the effective interest rate on the loan. at each reporting date the group estimates a portion of accumulated points that is expected to be utilised by customers based on statistical data. management believes that current period presentation provides a better view of

with nbg that are pledged due to borrowings from nbg. their liquidation has historically taken place over a longer period than indicated in the tables above. this assumption is also applied to demand deposits, savings accounts without a specific maturity and variable rate financial instruments. the group’s principal sources of liquidity are as follows: • deposits; • borrowings from international credit institutions; • inter-bank deposit agreements; • debt issues; • proceeds from sale of securities; • principal repayments on loans; • interest income; and • fees and commissions income. all transactions with related parties disclosed below have been conducted on an arm’s length basis. the group has not yet completed respective business combination accounting in respect of this
