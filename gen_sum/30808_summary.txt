We will have  created three large groups, all quoted on the  London Stock Exchange, each with their own  Board, management, and strategic logic. The New York Times reported   last year on Russia’s attempts to provoke  Georgia on the boundaries of Abkhazia and  South Ossetia – all true; but we also see that  Russia is doing more business with Georgia,  specifically in terms of transport links and  increased tourism flows. Elsewhere, Turkey  remains Georgia’s largest trade partner, whilst  the development of trading links with Iran   are likely to take more time than we originally  thought. The Bank is repositioning its portfolio away from  straight lending to corporates which require  capital and see their margins diminishing. The Bank has a very good management team  with Kaha Kiknavelidze as its leader, and they  are at work on this strategy. During his tenure at BGEO, Irakli has taken   a Georgia quoted bank and transformed it   into the organisation with multiple businesses  which we have today. The Economic Liberty Act  also requires electorates’ approval through a  nationwide referendum for imposing new taxes  and raising existing tax rates, subject to certain  exceptions. Moreover, Georgia-China economic  ties are increasing and a free trade agreement  signed in 2017 is expected to further expand  the Chinese market for Georgia’s exports. Georgia is a  regional energy corridor that accounts for  approximately 1.6% of the world’s oil and   gas supply transit volumes. Georgia’s existing free trade deals   (with the EU, CIS, EFTA, Turkey, and China)  enable it to access a market of 2.8 billion  customers without customs duties. The  prospective free trade agreements with   Hong Kong and India also offer significant  upside potential for Georgia’s exports. Ongoing reforms  in various directions – pension reform, capital  market development and business enhancing  measures – are expected to further support  investments, thus reinforcing the country’s  economic potential. Two key metrics we use to measure Banking Business performance are: (1) Return on Average Equity (ROAE) targeted at 20%, and (2) 15%-20%  growth of our loan book. This includes American Express Platinum cards, which were also launched in 2017 and are available to Solo Club members  only. • Flexibility to use own shares as acquisition currency n/a n/a 25 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC Strategic Report Overview Strategic Report Strategy Strategic Report Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information GGU – NATURAL MONOPOLY IN THE WATER  BUSINESS, WITH UPSIDE IN ELECTRICITY  GENERATION AND SALES GGU has a significant opportunity to increase its operational cash flow over the next few years from a combination of improving cash collection  rates, growing cost efficiencies from cutting technical and commercial water loss rates, and reducing energy consumption internally to preserve  the supply available for sale to third parties, while also planning the construction of hydro, wind and solar power generation plants. The key elements of GGU’s business strategy  are outlined below: • Reducing water loss rates and  increasing energy efficiency. The company plans to achieve this  by strategically focusing on each of its three  main business lines set out below: Retail customers. The Georgian retail  insurance market offers ample room for growth,  as most of its potential is yet to be unlocked. Although the level of  insurance penetration within the corporate  segment is relatively high compared to   retail and SME segments, a combination  of favourable Georgian macroeconomic  conditions, a good investment climate,  stable economic growth and an increase in  infrastructure projects will further increase  customer demand for insurance products. TARGETS AND PRIORITIES FOR THREE BUSINESS DIRECTIONS • No mandatory lines, border and  local MTPL, also GTPL mandatory  insurance to be introduced • Develop simple products for   mass retail • Digitilisation of all processes • More partnership with financial  institutions after demerger • Underpenetrated market • Developing tailored products • Digital portal for SME • Good investment climate • Stable economic growth • Increase in infrastructural projects Retail | Penetration Low SME | Penetration Zero Corporate | Penetration GEL c.16 MILLION GEL 50 MILLION 2017 2022 ALDAGI PROFIT 28 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC TELIANI – CREATING A LEADING BEVERAGE PRODUCER AND DISTRIBUTOR IN SOUTH  CAUCASUS Teliani Valley aims to become a leading beverage producer and the biggest distribution company not only in Georgia, but in South Caucasus. As part of this process, we engage in constructive dialogue with regulatory bodies, where possible,  and seek external advice on potential changes to legislation. KEY DRIVERS/ TRENDS During 2017, we saw a number of major organisations subjected to cyber-attacks, although fortunately, our operations  were not materially affected. MITIGATION We have an integrated control framework encompassing operational risk management, IT systems, corporate and other  data security each of which is managed by a separate department. For each business, we focus on building a strong management team and have successfully been able to do so thus far. The Bank has elaborated a framework, which   is in compliance with normative acts defined by  Georgian legislation and international standards. These procedures are now being  integrated into the Bank’s credit risk  management process and soon will be routinely  applied to all commercial transactions. In 2017,  the Bank financed several important projects and  among them is Caucasus Roads Project (CRP)  – a leading Georgian construction company with  its main focus on core infrastructure. The Bank supported Atlantic Group, a French  manufacturer of heating systems and home  appliance products, with around US$ 2 million  credit line. Examples of such products are student loans  with favourable terms that do not require any  financial guarantees and collateral. Aldagi’s  employees are engaged in various programmes  that supply socially vulnerable people with food  and first aid kits. After construction and renovation  works are completed, seven children with severe  forms of disability will be moved to live in the  house. GGU has been working in collaboration with  the country’s leading universities, professional  colleges and their career services to attract   new talent. The Corporate and Information  Security department provides annual online  training for employees on anti-bribery issues,  which are also included in induction trainings. Centralised uninterruptible power  supply is being installed in the Bank’s service  centres, which will save considerable energy  resources compared to individual systems. The y-o-y increase in 2017 was  largely driven by a) GEL 1.5 million net gains on derivative financial instruments recorded in 2017, and b) GEL 7.3 million revaluation gain from  investment properties recorded in 2017 OPERATING INCOME BEFORE NON-RECURRING ITEMS; COST OF CREDIT RISK; PROFIT FOR THE PERIOD GEL thousands, unless otherwise noted 2017 2016 Change y-o-y Salaries and other employee benefits (198,213) (168,374) 17.7% Administrative expenses (100,291) (82,113) 22.1% Banking depreciation and amortisation (40,974) (37,207) 10.1% Other operating expenses (3,458) (3,854) -10.3% OPERATING EXPENSES (342,936) (291,548) 17.6% Profit from associate 1,311 – NMF OPERATING INCOME BEFORE COST OF CREDIT RISK 567,710 482,359 17.7% Impairment charge on loans to customers (155,210) (158,892) -2.3% Impairment charge on finance lease receivables (496) (777) -36.2% Impairment charge on other assets and provisions (11,590) (8,083) 43.4% COST OF CREDIT RISK (167,296) (167,752) -0.3% PROFIT BEFORE NON-RECURRING ITEMS AND INCOME TAX 400,414 314,607 27.3% Net non-recurring items (4,300) (45,355) -90.5% PROFIT BEFORE INCOME TAX 396,114 269,252 47.1% Income tax (expense) benefit (26,592) 26,444 NMF PROFIT 369,522 295,696 25.0% • Operating expenses increased to GEL 342.9 million in 2017 (up 17.6% y-o-y). This trend   was largely driven by management’s  decision to introduce transaction fees   on non-banking transactions processed  through Express Pay terminals in 4Q16. The  y-o-y decrease was largely driven by  winding down lending relationships with  several large borrowers in 2017 as a  result of risk de-concentration and loan  portfolio repositioning targets. In 4Q17, GGU commenced  construction of a 2.5MW Bodorna HPP on   its own infrastructure near Tbilisi, which is  expected to become fully operational from  September 2018. Effective  from 2Q17, we are reporting GGU results on a pro-forma basis together with renewable energy business and have retrospectively revised the comparable information accordingly. m 2  targets to meet the unsatisfied demand in Tbilisi for housing  through its well established branch network and sales force. As a result, its portfolio of yielding  assets, including the revaluation gain,  increased by 85.8% y-o-y to GEL 77.2  million at 31 December 2017. Aldagi is working closely with ISSSG to support  drafting of the new law requiring mandatory local  MTPL for all vehicles registered in Georgia. Skills and experience: In 2013, Mr Breach co-founded Gemsstock  Limited, a UK FCA-regulated fund manager,  where he also serves as an Executive Director. Prior to GE Capital,  Mr Bradley held senior executive positions at  Manufacturers Hanover Trust (now part of JP  Morgan) and Dollar Dry Dock Bank. In order to ensure that we meet our responsibilities, specific key  decisions have been reserved for approval by the Board. A full formal  schedule of matters specifically reserved for the Board can be found on  our website, at http://bgeo.com/page/id/67/schedule-of-matters- reserved-for-the-board. Each  Non-Executive Director has an ongoing obligation to inform the Board   of any circumstances which could impair his or her independence. As mentioned earlier in this Report, the Board Nomination Committee   is responsible for both Director and executive management succession  planning. Similarly, we are clear that diversity of outlook and approach, while  inevitably being difficult to measure, may be equally as important. We also reviewed and  monitored management’s responsiveness to the corrective measures  through follow-up reports provided by Internal Audit. As reported last year, part of our strategy to achieve a 20%+ Return on  Equity in the Banking Business included enhancing an already prudent risk  management process. The Georgian government’s  de-dollarisaton initiatives and our ability to attract local currency funding  have been primary drivers of this. Our Directors’ Remuneration Policy has again been included in this report (set out on pages 105 to 111) for the purposes   of clarity and transparency. • Performance-based remuneration is awarded entirely   in the form of nil-cost options over BGEO shares which  are deferred (no cash bonus). Our retention rate of  employees is high and in 2017 the survey also confirmed that we remain a competitive employer. • Relocation support for an incoming Executive Director and, where relevant, his or her family may be provided depending  on the individual’s circumstances. If Mr Gilauri’s service agreement expires and: (i) is not renewed upon substantially similar terms, or (ii) he does not accept a new service agreement,  but he continues as a member of the BGEO and/or JSC BGEO Group Board, 50% of his unvested shares vest immediately and the remaining 50%  shall continue to vest as normal. Further malus applies to discretionary deferred  shares if it is determined that there was a material misstatement in the financial results. In accordance with a request issued by BGEO, Sanne Fiduciary Services  Limited has waived its right to receive any dividends. As with any major new accounting  standard, there is a risk that the Group does   not apply IFRS 15 appropriately. Although the  valuations are performed by appropriately qualified  valuers, there remains a risk that individual assets  might be inappropriately valued. • The Group operates across various industries some of which, including banking, insurance, public utilities and healthcare, are highly regulated  environments. Gains and losses resulting from these instruments are included in the consolidated income  statement as net foreign currency gain (loss). Valuations are performed once every three years,  unless there is a sign of material change in fair values on the market. At each reporting date the Group  estimates a portion of accumulated points that is expected to be utilised by customers based on statistical data. Equity instruments  that are not held for trading may be irrevocably designated as FVOCI, with no subsequent reclassification of gains or losses to the income statement. SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED ANNUAL IMPROVEMENTS 2014-2016 CYCLE IAS 28 INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES – CLARIFICATION THAT MEASURING INVESTEES AT FAIR VALUE  THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS IS AN INVESTMENT-BY-INVESTMENT CHOICE The amendments clarify that: • An entity that is a venture capital organisation, or other qualifying entity, may elect, at initial recognition on an investment-by-investment basis,   to measure its investments in associates and joint ventures at fair value through profit or loss. The interpretation is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, but certain transition reliefs are available. This assumption is also applied to demand deposits, savings accounts without a specific maturity and  variable rate financial instruments.
