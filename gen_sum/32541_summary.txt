For example, at 1 New Street Square smart design choices saved 200 tonnes of carbon and reduced material costs by more than £600,000. Lighting up London At Piccadilly Lights we’re creating Europe’s most technically advanced digital screen, giving customers extraordinary new ways to interact with two million people each week. Multi-channel opportunities Fashionista Missguided opens at Bluewater this summer, part of the trend for online retailers to provide a deeper brand experience through physical stores. 17 new restaurants and three pop-up kiosks are set to open this summer, together with hundreds of alfresco dining seats. Zig Zag – truly world-class 14 Landsec Annual Report 2017 Research tell us that enriching the work environment makes employees happier, healthier and much more productive. In London, our modern, well-located assets are well let, with a weighted average unexpired lease term on offices of 10.3 years. See how we’re responding to these opportunities and challenges on page 21 Our market 1 Evolving customer needs For many London office occupiers, location is no longer the only consideration. In retail, successful operators are generally looking for fewer but larger spaces where they can showcase their entire online range and provide a brand experience. For businesses that have to take new space, there’s generally a combination of good choice and attractive incentives available. Some online brands are moving into physical stores as convergence drives efficiency and they see opportunities to create great brand experiences. Outlook We expect to see consumer caution led by concern about higher cost of living combined with lower wage growth. — Deliver sustainable long-term shareholder value — Maximise the returns from the investment portfolio — Manage our balance sheet effectively — Maximise development performance — Ensure high levels of customer satisfaction — Attract, develop, retain and motivate high performance individuals — Continually improve sustainability performance Go to page 24 for more information Our strategic objectives 21 Landsec Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Relationships Develop close relationships with our customers, communities, partners and employees, so we understand their evolving needs and they trust us to meet their expectations. Being active in these two sectors rather than one provides us with greater financial stability as they work to different cycles. Develop We put strong emphasis on creating attractive, well considered space where people want to spend time and return frequently. For more on our Retail Portfolio see pages 50-53 Develop Starting schemes at the right point in a rising market helps maximise value and minimise risk. Manage Active management of assets through the cycle helps to reduce voids and ensure space meets occupiers’ changing needs. Thinking about sustainability helps us to protect the building from external risks such as price volatility, changing regulation, supply issues and premature obsolescence. 31 Landsec Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Income statement Our income statement has two key components: the income we generate from leasing our investment properties net of associated costs (including finance expense), which we refer to as revenue profit, and items not directly related to the underlying rental business, principally valuation changes, profits or losses on the disposal of properties and exceptional items, which we refer to as capital and other items. Like-for-like net rental income growth was £10m due to rent reviews and higher turnover related rents, together with a reduction in bad debts. This year we introduced a new resilience commitment – ‘assess and mitigate site-specific climate change adaptation risks which are material across our portfolio’ . This year we worked with the Carbon Trust to develop a consistent and transparent way of reporting Scope 3 emissions across our business. We’re now offering more opportunities in customer service – a reflection of our strategic shift from development activity towards asset management. The good news is that, by bringing our many partners together in Customer Improvement Groups, we’ve created a more transparent culture. This saw the launch of Mates in Mind, a programme that shows people how to support colleagues with mental ill health. For the coming year, we have set new objectives to train all our people in physical and cyber security. However, this can partly be explained by the relatively high proportion in these groups of part-time females, whose bonus payments are pro-rated. This is underpinned by some specific initiatives such as the female mentoring programme and a new set of industry-wide recruitment guidelines which we have developed in collaboration with our peers. Executives responsible: Colette O’Shea/Scott Parsons — Large and diversified customer base (no single customer represents more than 5.2% of rents) — Of our total income, 68.0% is derived from occupiers who individually make less than a 1% contribution to rent roll — Clear retail strategy focused on “Everything is experience” — Development programme has delivered a modern office portfolio well suited to occupier requirements — Experienced asset management team — Strong relationships with occupiers. — Shareholder value — Investment portfolio — Development — Customer satisfaction — High performance individuals KPI — Total shareholder return — Total property return — Lettings and sales — Customer satisfaction rates — New ways of working Advances in emerging technologies, such as the merging of the virtual and physical environments, threaten to disrupt organisations’ core business assumptions. New entrants focused on disrupting existing business models are likely to impact most sectors, including ours and those of our customers. It’s occupied by a broad customer base spanning sectors from finance to fashion and we now have our longest ever weighted average unexpired lease term of 10.3 years. Develop At 20 Eastbourne Terrace, W2, we completed a major refurbishment during the year, creating 93,000 sq ft of contemporary space in an 18-storey tower overlooking Paddington Crossrail station. The scheme features two exceptional office buildings, 170 apartments and a fantastic line-up of restaurants, creating London’s newest food destination. The complexities of construction – together with competition for labour in a busy sector – delayed final completion and impacted costs. 52 Landsec Annual Report 2017 Despite uncertainty in the wider market, retail destinations that provide consumers with a great experience held up well. At White Rose, Leeds, the demise of BHS enabled us to deliver a 55,000 sq ft Next store, doubling its previous space. This confirmation is made after having reviewed assumptions about future trading performance, valuation projections, capital expenditure, asset sales and debt requirements contained within the Group’s current five year plan. We have recently completed a detailed third party feedback survey of our shareholders and were reassured by the positive results. Having been a fund manager for many years, he also has an excellent understanding of stock markets and investor expectations. Career Stacey is a Director Emeritus of McKinsey & Company where she served clients in the US and internationally for 24 years. Independent Non-executive Directors Edward Bonham Carter, Kevin O’Byrne, Chris Bartram, Simon Palley, Stacey Rauch, Cressida Hogg CBE and Nicholas Cadbury. There were also meetings with external advisers to the Audit Committee, of which Mr Cadbury will become Chairman later in 2017. The Committee did not see any potential conflict of interest situations arising from Mr. Bartram’s advisory role at OSIM. This year’s internal review of their effectiveness and performance concluded that they continue to operate at a high standard. This evaluation confirmed that the Committee continued to operate at a high standard, with clear priorities, well-defined responsibilities and clarity around its workplan. In terms of Total Shareholder Return, we are measured over a three year period and were disappointed not to outperform our peer group. This reflects increased rents from our successful development programme and lower interest costs, more than outweighing rent lost through disposals last year. The Scheme is open to all qualifying employees (including Executive Directors) and under HMRC rules does not include performance conditions. Measured over a period of three financial years: — The Group’s ungeared Total Property Return (TPR) relative to an IPD benchmark comprising all March- valued properties. — A target has been set around securing permanent employment for an increased number of candidates by extending the programme beyond its current focus on Construction. These assumptions are market standard and accord with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Valuation – Professional Standards UK 2014 (revised April 2015) . The valuations are in accordance with RICS standards and were arrived at by reference to market evidence of transactions for similar properties.

Holding cash in restricted accounts does not prevent the Group from optimising returns by putting these monies on short-term deposit. Bespoke credit facilities are established with banks when required for the Non-restricted Group projects and joint ventures, usually on a limited- recourse basis. Specific interest-rate hedges are also used within our joint ventures to fix the interest rate exposure on limited-recourse debt. Where specific hedges are used in geared joint ventures to fix the interest exposure on limited-recourse debt, these may qualify for hedge accounting. At 31 March 2017, the Group (including joint ventures) had pay-fixed interest-rate swaps in place with a nominal value of £0.5bn (2016: £0.7bn), and its net debt was 88.9% fixed (2016: 94.9%). As it is solely UK based, the Group does not frequently enter into any foreign currency transactions other than in connection with its financing activities. This is with the exception of EPRA measures which represent costs divided by gross rental income including finance leases, after rents payable. It will also determine whether there are specific reasons to award salary increases greater than those for the wider workforce. Deferred or unvested share awards not subject to performance conditions may count towards the ownership levels on a net of tax basis. In line with Group policy, the Executive Directors’ employment can be terminated at any time by either party on giving 12 months’ prior written notice. These are typically from purported ‘brokers’ who offer to buy shares at a price often far in excess of their market value. 4369054 Company Secretary Tim Ashby Group General Counsel and Company Secretary Investor relations Edward Thacker Head of Investor Relations Telephone: +44 (0)20 7413 9000 Email: investor.relations@landsec.com www.landsec.com Registrar Equiniti Group PLC Aspect House Spencer Road Lancing West Sussex BN99 6DA Telephone: 0371 384 2128 Textel: 0371 384 2255 International dialing: +44 (0) 121 415 7049 www.shareview.co.uk Auditor Ernst & Young LLP 1 More London Place London SE1 2AF Telephone: +44 (0)20 7951 2000 www.ey.com External advisers Valuer: CBRE Financial adviser: Citigroup Solicitors: Slaughter and May Joint brokers: JP Morgan Cazenove and UBS Additional information 187 Landsec Annual Report 2017 Glossary Adjusted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS) Earnings per share based on revenue profit after related tax. Consent must be sought and achieved for discharge of all reserved matters within a specified time- limit, normally three years from the date outline planning permission was granted, before building can begin. It is calculated by making an adjustment to net initial yield in respect of the annualised cash rent foregone through unexpired rent-free periods and other lease incentives.
