successful financial and cultural centres. some online brands are moving into physical stores as convergence drives efficiency and they see opportunities to create great brand experiences. london’s strengths attract a large and diverse mix of property investors, many from overseas. outlook we expect to see consumer caution led by concern about higher cost of living combined with lower wage

strategic report our business model creating and protecting value we aim to be a sustainable business through the market cycles by anticipating and responding to the changing needs of our customers, communities, partners and employees. revenue profit and earnings per share are particularly helpful indications of how we’re doing. we also partner and collaborate with others to help raise standards in our industry target — to help a total of 1,200 disadvantaged people secure jobs by 2020 — to ensure the working environments we control are fair and ensure that everyone who is working on our behalf – within an environment we control – is paid at least the living wage by 2020. sustainable design and innovation we think about the long-term appeal, impacts and resilience of our assets, designing with long- term value in mind. 31 landsec annual report 2017 strategic report income statement our income statement has two key components: the income we generate from leasing our investment properties net of associated costs (including finance expense), which we refer to as revenue profit, and items not directly related to the underlying rental business, principally valuation changes, profits or losses on the disposal of properties and exceptional items, which we refer to as capital and other items. like-for-like net rental income growth was £10m due to rent reviews and higher turnover related rents, together with a reduction in bad debts. the value of our retail parks was down 4.2% as lower investor appetite led to yields increasing by 24 basis points. on a consistent basis, net effective rents in london offices were virtually unchanged over the year. this year, we were able to offset taxable gains on non-qualifying activities with brought forward losses. the redemption was funded by our existing short term facilities and is expected to result in an interest saving of £8m in the year to 31 march 2018. our pro forma cost of debt at 31 march 2017, taking into account this transaction, is 3.7%. similarly, selling assets in the current low interest rate environment is likely to be earnings dilutive. in addition to our focus on risk and flexibility when setting the dividend, we also consider underlying cash flows, recognising that these are generally lower than underlying earnings due to the lease incentives we give our customers and refurbishment capital expenditure. taking all these factors together, we anticipate that dividend cover will be in the range of 1.2x to 1.3x. this range is indicative only although it’s unlikely that we would consistently pay a dividend per share in excess of our adjusted earnings per share and, as a minimum, we will satisfy our dividend obligation under the reit legislation. our portfolio top ten assets

this year we introduced a new resilience commitment – ‘assess and mitigate site-specific climate change adaptation risks which are material across our portfolio’ . this year we worked with the carbon trust to develop a consistent and transparent way of reporting scope 3 emissions across our business. this makes the whole industry greener – and in turn helps us hit our carbon targets. 37 landsec

annual report 2017 social review a focus on some of the key activities we carry out to support our customers, communities, partners and employees. we’re now offering more opportunities in customer service – a reflection of our strategic shift from development activity towards asset management. this year we worked with over 400 students between the ages of 12 and 18. projects included girls can do it too, an inspiring partnership with two girls’ schools that challenged students to design, model and pitch a new property development. we then examined our recruitment processes, and trained teams to help them spot the risks of modern slavery. the good news is that, by bringing our many partners together in customer improvement groups, we’ve created a more transparent culture. this saw the launch of mates in mind, a programme that shows people how to support colleagues with mental ill health. for the coming year, we have set new objectives to train all our people in physical and cyber security. the training will help with everything from protecting data when working remotely to staying safe during terrorist incidents. our partnership with mencap helped: 40 landsec annual

our employees diversity getting greater diversity into the company – including gender, ethnicity, social mobility, disability and sexuality – is very important for us. the first disclosures will be

promoting change across our sector. key employee figures: 638 total headcount 20 .4% employee turnover – 12% resignations (stable year-on-year) 50% percentage of senior leader and leader roles filled by internal people 46:54% overall male:female ratio (female representation up 1%) pay element male female % difference mean hourly salary £43.26 £28.86 (33.3) median hourly salary £33.36 £21.27 (36.3) proportion of employees receiving a bonus 79.0% 77.1% mean bonus £42,894 £14,282 (66.7) median bonus £12,741 £4,780 (62.5) while at a headline level, the figures would suggest a significant pay gap between males and females in our business, we are satisfied that the issue is one of female representation in higher- paying roles, rather than of equal pay for equivalent roles. the analysis below, which includes additional data on hourly rate and mean bonus levels by pay quartile, illustrates this more fully: like other companies across our industry, we have a lower proportion of females in senior roles than we would like. however, this can partly be explained by the relatively high proportion in these groups of part-time females, whose bonus payments are pro-rated. encouraging more females into senior roles has become a key priority for us, which is why we have committed to a specific target of improving our female representation at leader level (broadly the lower end of upper quartile) from 20% to 30% by 2020. this is underpinned by some specific initiatives such as the female mentoring programme and a new set of industry-wide recruitment guidelines which we have developed in collaboration with our peers. likelihood unlikely almost certain impact very high low 2 5 3 1 7 4 9 8 6 01 customers — structural changes in customer and consumer behaviours. executives

years. develop at 20 eastbourne terrace, w2, we completed a major refurbishment during the year, creating 93,000 sq ft of contemporary space in an 18-storey tower overlooking paddington crossrail station. this 275,000 sq ft scheme was pre- let in its entirety to deloitte on a 20 year lease. the scheme features two exceptional office buildings, 170 apartments and a fantastic line-up of restaurants, creating london’s newest food destination. the complexities of construction – together with competition for labour in a busy sector – delayed final completion and impacted costs. in the city at 21 moorfields, ec2, we’ve completed demolition and will shortly commence piling and construction of a raft that will sit above the eastern entrance to liverpool street crossrail station, ready for building 522,000 sq ft in two buildings. we have three remaining advertising opportunities and are in discussion with other major brands to complete the line-up. income from our developments contributed an additional £28m this year, principally at 1 new street square, ec4, 20 eastbourne terrace, w2 and nova, victoria, sw1. we also benefited from a full year’s income at the zig zag building, sw1, 1 & 2 new ludgate, ec4 and 62 buckingham gate, sw1. in addition, we’re preparing 1.4 million sq ft of future development opportunities for when conditions are right to proceed. 52 landsec annual report 2017 despite uncertainty in the wider market, retail destinations that provide consumers with a great experience held up well. at white rose, leeds, the demise of bhs enabled us to deliver a 55,000 sq ft next store, doubling its previous space. at gunwharf quays, portsmouth, we introduced armani and coach to build on the centre’s strong aspirational offer. at bluewater, kent, we delivered a 40,000 sq ft flagship for h&m, who had outgrown their existing unit. we started construction of the plaza leisure reconfiguration this year and expect to complete by december. we’ve also continued to invest in the learning shop, which connects retailers and local unemployed people. in this viability scenario, we assume that any uncommitted forecast acquisitions, disposals or developments do not take place. this confirmation is made after having reviewed assumptions about future trading performance, valuation projections, capital expenditure, asset sales and debt requirements contained within the group’s current five year plan. in all these ways, landsec is and will be better placed to address the pace of change. we have recently completed a detailed third party feedback survey of our shareholders and were reassured by the positive results. we work closely with our partners and maintain a safety record that is well ahead of industry benchmarks. nicholas

potential conflict of interest situations arising from mr. bartram’s advisory role at osim. mr bonham carter’s position is such that he is unlikely to be involved in the selection of particular investments and has agreed not to participate in any investment decisions which may involve the group’s securities. this evaluation confirmed that the committee continued to operate at a high standard, with clear priorities, well-defined responsibilities and clarity around its workplan. there are no contractual restrictions in relation to the company’s choice of external auditor. our principal suppliers are required to have similar policies and practices in place within their own businesses. the company secretary also received feedback on governance matters directly from investors

separately in the financial statements have been aggregated. our income statement has two key components: the income we generate from leasing our investment properties net of associated costs (including interest expense), which we refer to as revenue profit, and items not directly related to the underlying rental business, principally valuation changes, profits or losses on the disposal of properties and exceptional items, which we refer to as capital and other items. the group manages its financing structure, with the exception of joint ventures, on a pooled basis and, as such, debt facilities and finance expenses (other than those relating to joint ventures) are not specific to a particular segment. a dividend reinvestment plan (drip) has been available in respect of all dividends paid during the year. deferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in determining the amounts, if any, to be recognised. deferred tax assets are only recognised when management believe they will be recovered against future taxable profits. these assumptions are market standard and accord with the royal institution of chartered surveyors (rics) valuation –

but which is consolidated in the group numbers. if these limits are exceeded, the operating environment becomes more restrictive with provisions to encourage a reduction in gearing. holding cash in restricted accounts does not prevent the group from optimising returns by putting these monies on short-term deposit. in accordance with its treasury policy, the group does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. the fair value of interest-rate and foreign exchange swaps is based on counterparty or market quotes. this is not considered a significant credit risk as the tenants are generally of good financial standing. bespoke credit facilities are established with banks when required for the non-restricted group projects and joint ventures, usually on a limited- recourse

interest rates, availability of credit and foreign exchange movements. specific interest-rate hedges are also used within our joint ventures to fix the interest rate exposure on limited-recourse debt. where specific hedges are used in geared joint ventures to fix the interest exposure on limited-recourse debt, these may qualify for hedge accounting. at 31 march 2017, the group (including joint ventures) had pay-fixed interest-rate swaps in place with a nominal value of £0.5bn (2016: £0.7bn), and its net debt was 88.9% fixed (2016: 94.9%). as it is solely uk based, the group does not frequently enter into any foreign currency transactions other than in connection with its financing activities. at 31 march 2017, the group had issued €307m, $118m and chf35m of commercial paper, fully hedged through foreign exchange swaps. a 10% weakening or strengthening of sterling would therefore have £nil (2016: £nil) impact on the group’s income statement and equity. 144 landsec annual
