performance during 2016/17 , despite two of our key end markets, oil & gas and marine, remaining subdued. the company’s original mission, to develop computer- aided design techniques for use by british industry, has been achieved and indeed greatly exceeded. on a constant currency basis, we delivered good growth with more than 3d (mt3d), owner operators and sales to the power sector. as part of this, i have simplified aveva’s management structure with greater decision-making capabilities and direct accountability for performance being allocated to our regions. i have also added more customer-facing people to our executive team, including a recently recruited chief revenue officer, who will take overall responsibility for leading global sales, partnership management and marketing. however, overall our business there was broadly flat during the year, being impacted by tougher market conditions, particularly in shipbuilding. the sales team has now been equipped to sell these solutions and we have brought on board several major oil owner operators as early adopters. strategic report 19 this is particularly pronounced around materials procurement and construction management, given that many still use in-house systems in these areas. shipyard customers typically prefer an initial licence fee model, because they view software as a longer-term investment rather than being project specific. case study broadening market exposure aveva has a high proportion of recurring revenues at 76.9% in 2016/17 due to our ‘right-to-use’ licensing model. this is typically associated with the implementation of new installations, customisation to meet specific customer requirements and end user training. strategic report 25 the results for the year are summarised as
