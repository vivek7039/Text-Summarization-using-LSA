resilient despite the challenging conditions in our core end markets. on a constant currency basis, we delivered good growth with more than 3d (mt3d), owner operators and sales to the power sector. we have both been in the business for many years and were core to formulating aveva’s strategy. as part of this, i have simplified aveva’s management structure with greater decision-making capabilities and direct accountability for performance being allocated to our regions. i have also added more customer-facing people to our executive team, including a recently recruited chief revenue officer, who will take overall responsibility for leading global sales, partnership management and marketing. • owner operators: oos such as energy and power generation companies currently only account for

grew during the year, increasing 5.4% on a constant currency basis. however, overall our business there was broadly flat during the year, being impacted by tougher market conditions, particularly in shipbuilding. we enjoyed particular success in power where revenue increased 11.4% on a constant currency basis during the year. in april this year, we launched a second saas offering on aveva connect, information standards management. the sales team has now been equipped to sell these solutions and we have brought on board several major oil owner operators as early adopters. aveva e3d is the latest generation 3d product which carries a price premium reflecting its higher productivity and advanced feature set. aveva e3d grew strongly during the year as existing customers continued to

report 19 this is particularly pronounced around materials procurement and construction management, given that many still use in-house systems in these areas. shipyard customers typically prefer an initial licence fee model, because they view software as a longer-term investment rather than being project specific. case study broadening market exposure aveva has a high proportion of recurring

set. sales grew strongly during the year as existing customers continued to migrate towards it and new contracts were won. when it was launched in 2015, engage created a new benchmark in information accessibility through combining ultra-high performance visualisation with application- agnostic access to information via large-format touch devices and it has now become a feature of many of our key new oo customer wins. this will enable greater collaboration between all parties in the supply chain, and better decision making by asset operators. this is typically associated with the implementation of new installations, customisation to meet specific customer requirements and end user training. strategic report 25 the results for the year are summarised as follows: £m 2017 total

flat when compared to the prior year. market conditions in emea have been reasonably stable, but remain challenging for customers with heavy exposure to oil & gas. training and services revenue declined from the prior year as a number of implementation projects were completed. these included restructuring costs of £4.2 million, which were partly offset by factors including an indemnified receivable claim relating to a previous business combination. to aid this process a risk committee comprising senior management from each function of the business was formed in 2015/16. aveva is expanding into other market segments such as power, petrochemical & chemical and construction, albeit from a relatively small base. this will help secure a longer- term income stream that extends beyond the design/build phase of these capital projects. we employ experienced industry professionals within our professional services team and continue to build commercial partnerships with third party systems integrators. we have rigorous processes and controls for the appraisal of potential commercial opportunities prior to any bid being submitted. 1 4 5 strategic report 31 financial risks risk likelihood impact change mitigation strategy foreign exchange risk exposure to foreign currency gains and losses can be material to the group, with more than 80% of the group’s revenue denominated in a currency other than sterling, of which our two largest are us dollar and euro. the overseas subsidiaries predominantly trade in their own local currencies, which acts as a partial natural hedge against currency movements. annually there is a group-wide salary review that rewards strong performance and ensures salaries remain competitive. 1 5 international operations the group operates in over 30 countries globally and must determine how best to utilise its resources across these diverse markets. these updates receive excellent readership rates and feedback has shown they are a great tool to support our employees in their roles. each year, every employee completes the global corporate governance and group it compliance training to ensure that we maintain our high ethical standards. in april 2017 , we introduced a new micro survey tool designed to frequently seek employee feedback and opinions on key topics. between april and june 2016, there were 18 meet-and-greet sessions held in various global locations, reaching nearly 75% of employees. in recognition of our commitment to young talent we are on the uk top 100 apprentice employer list. aveva is also an active member, with our ceo as executive signatory, of the wise (women in science and engineering) ten steps campaign. nearly 50 new dresses were purchased that day which will have made a huge boost to the street seller’s income. briefing papers are distributed by the company secretary to all directors, usually four working days in advance of board and committee meetings. in 2014, an extensive review was externally facilitated by armstrong bonham carter llp , the independent board performance consultants. the senior independent non-executive director, philip dayer, is available to shareholders if they have concerns, which contact through the normal channels of chairman, chief executive or chief financial officer has failed to resolve or if such contact would be inappropriate. james kidd is a chartered accountant and joined aveva in 2004. prior to his appointment to the board, james held several senior finance roles within the group and was head of finance from 2006 until 2011 when he was appointed cfo. he has also been heavily involved in a number of strategically important change projects for the company, including organisation design and information systems transformation. philip aiken chairman time on board: 5 years (appointed 1 may 2012) committees: nominations committee (chairman) james kidd chief executive time on board: 6 years 4 months (appointed 1

experience, most recently as chief information officer at f. hoffmann-la roche in switzerland with responsibility for it strategy and operations for the pharma division and all group it operations from june 2002 to july 2012. prior to roche, she served as technology director at barclaycard with responsibility for fraud operations and it. my induction process involved me meeting senior members of aveva’s financial management team prior to jonathan’s departure and i was closely involved with the half year reporting processes relating to 2016. i have met with key internal employees and representatives of ernst & y oung (ey) to learn more about the workings of the group’s financial reporting and audit process. this has necessitated the committee overseeing a transition of work from ernst & young to alternative professional services firms and advisers. this comprises: • a risk assessment performed by operational management and the board to identify key areas for assurance. the group’s operations are geographically widely spread, which means that in some instances, where assurance over the operation of internal control is considered valuable, there is a clear advantage in such reviews of controls being undertaken by teams with specific local regulatory knowledge and without any local language barrier. audit partners are rotated every five years and a formal statement of independence is received from the auditor each year. aveva’s long-term potential cannot be realised without the expertise and commitment of our senior executive team, now headed by james kidd, following richard longdon’s retirement from the board, with james supported by david ward as our new cfo. note that this is below richard longdon’s salary of £495,000 when he retired as ceo on 31 december 2016. it is intended to further increase james’ salary to £500,000 for 2018/19, but only if james’ performance and the company’s underlying circumstances warrant. • only one metric (adjusted pbt) is currently used for the financial element, whereas it is now common for bonuses to operate with a wider range of financial metrics to encourage performance against a broader range of kpis. therefore, going forward, the executive directors’ entire bonus opportunity will be based on full year performance. • flexibility will be reserved to employ a broader range of financial and non-financial metrics in the bonus, thereby reflecting common practice and also ensuring that the bonus outturn is based on a more rounded assessment of overall performance. therefore it is important that we build these key relationships in order to protect and develop our existing business. indeed, we have been particularly conservative when determining the ‘l tip to restricted shares exchange rate’ by replacing a 75% of salary l tip opportunity with a 35% of salary restricted share award (i.e. lower than the generally accepted 2:1 exchange rate). the enhanced share ownership guidelines and use of two-year post-vesting holding periods also clearly assist in this regard. we appreciate that the restricted share plan is, as practice currently stands, a relatively unusual feature. an advisory resolution will also be tabled in connection with part b of this report which explains how the existing policy was implemented last year. • where an executive director is required to relocate to take-up their role, the committee may provide reasonable assistance with relocation (either via one-off or on-going payments or benefits) taking into account the individual’s circumstances and prevailing market practice. additional fees may also be paid for other board responsibilities or roles if this is considered appropriate. the auditor has reported on certain sections of part b and stated whether, in their opinion, those parts have been properly prepared in accordance with the companies act 2006. those sections of part b which have been subject to audit are clearly indicated.
