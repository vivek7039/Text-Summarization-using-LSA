these strengths are complemented by a highly developed loan servicing platform and through the cycle experience in its senior management team. against a uk backdrop of limited house building, low investment in social housing and mortgage affordability constraints, tenant demand is expected to remain strong. it also funds small scale property developments and has recently launched in the structured lending market, offering senior debt facilities to non-bank lenders. market consolidation amongst debt purchasers combined with improved availability of funding has led to greater competition for individual portfolios. alongside its transition to a banking model, the group has made good progress in delivering improved profits and strong organic new business generation. the sector has proved increasingly popular for both specialist purchasers and credit funds in recent years, with yields reducing as a consequence. idem capital has retained its credit and pricing discipline across the past year, but as a consequence investment levels have reduced year-on-year. most lenders, including the group, were able to adopt these changes without serious disruption • from 1 october 2017, lenders were required to underwrite buy-to-let cases on a much more specialised basis, differentiating between professional and amateur landlords, based on the number of properties owned with buy-to-let finance. the coming year will see development of new product lines, including two already launched, aviation finance and structured lending. overall idem capital’s success rests on understanding assets, strong analytics, advanced servicing capabilities and the efficient use of funding. these, together with debt raisings, financed further investments in loan portfolios, the capital requirements of paragon bank and credit enhancement for mortgage originations. in addition, supplementary underwriting requirements apply for “portfolio landlords” which the pra has defined as borrowers with four or more distinct, mortgaged, buy-to-let properties. in 2017 paragon has, alongside this transition, witnessed strong growth across all products with total lending increasing by 29% to £1.9 billion. in march 2017 the group conducted its first diversity survey to obtain anonymous feedback from employees on their age, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious beliefs and disability. in august one manual handling incident was reported under the reporting of incidents, disease and dangerous occurrences regulations 2013 (‘riddor’). sfs undertake additional aftersales activities that include servicing, maintenance and breakdown support, hence has the most significant potential environmental impacts. alan fletcher will cease to be considered an independent non-executive director in february 2018 on the ninth anniversary of his first appointment. such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against the risk of material misstatement or loss and that assets are safeguarded against unauthorised use or disposition. an external search consultant, gavin orr of lomond consulting, who has previously assisted the group with senior appointments, was used in this process. an initial longlist of 26 potential candidates was produced and the chairman interviewed ten, using a competency-based interview approach. a similar approach is taken to assessing interest on borrowings, where redemption profiles and anticipated refinancing dates influence expense recognition. the policy also makes provision to ensure that no employee making such a disclosure suffers any detriment by doing so. measure threshold performance t arget maximum

executive directors are unchanged at 200% of base salary. the group aims to help its customers by offering financial options which meet individual needs and achieve fair customer outcomes in a well-controlled environment. as a lender and acquirer of credit portfolios the group is inevitably exposed to any material deterioration in economic conditions. the board’s defined strategy is to limit this risk by operating as a specialist lender in carefully chosen markets where its employees have significant levels of experience and expertise. recoverable amounts on loans may also be affected by adverse movements in security values such as house and commercial asset prices. the group has comprehensive policies in place that set out detailed criteria which must be met before loans are approved. credit policies incorporate limits for concentration risks arising from factors such as large exposures to counterparties, geographical areas or types of lending. changes in market interest rates could therefore materially impact the group’s profits as a result of significant mismatches between its assets and liabilities. there is also less historical experience for the newer lending in this segment due to their relatively unseasoned nature. d1.2 consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 30 september 2017 note 2017 2017 2016 2016 £m £m £m £m profit

for the year ended 30 september 2017 1. general informa tion paragon banking group plc is a company domiciled in the united kingdom and incorporated in england and wales under the companies act 2006 with company number 2336032. it adopted its present name on 21 september 2017 and was previously named the paragon group of companies plc. base models have been completed for the group’s most material asset classes and indicative outputs are being provided to credit committee on a business-as-usual basis. similarly, trusts set up to hold shares in conjunction with the group’s employee share ownership arrangements are also treated as subsidiaries. after this point a salvage balance may be held in respect of any further recoveries expected on the loan. these are principally present value calculations based on estimated future cash flows arising from the instruments, discounted using a risk adjusted interest rate. note 2017 2016 earnings per share (p) 29 43.1 40.5 proposed dividend per

they also review and, where authorised to do so, agree or amend policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised in the relevant note. the group calculates its headline arrears measure for buy-to-let mortgages, shown above, based on the numbers of accounts three months or more in arrears, including purchased idem capital assets, but excluding those cases in possession and receiver of rent cases designated for sale. deposit balances raised are typically used to support lending activities where maturity is over a longer period than that of the deposits. the group’s exposure to this risk is a natural consequence of its lending, deposit taking and borrowing activities, as some of its financial assets and liabilities bear interest at rates which float with various market rates while others are fixed, either for a term or for their whole lives. in practice such a change might have wider economic consequences which would themselves potentially affect the group’s business and results. it should be noted that these sensitivities are illustrative only, and much simplified from those used to manage irrbb in practice. all borrowers are required to make monthly payments, except where an initial deferred period is included in the contractual terms. these exercises suggest that the security value of assets under finance leases which are past due or impaired is £12.2m (2016:
