there are a number of factors that could cause actual future financial conditions, business performance, results or developments to differ materially from the plans, goals and expectations expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements and forecasts. it also earns fees from third parties for administering similar loans on their behalf. the group funds its assets using a variety of sources, including savings deposits, securitisation and bond issuance. growing best-known as one of the country’s leading, independent buy-to-let lenders, the group is growing its business by expanding into broader mortgage, consumer and small or medium-sized enterprise (‘sme’) markets through its banking subsidiary. these strengths are complemented by a highly developed loan servicing platform and through the cycle experience in its senior management team. page 13 • strategic report paragon banking group plc • 2017 annual report and accounts operations paragon’s operations are organised into three divisions, each with responsibility for achieving asset and profit growth, with new lending funded principally through an online personal savings operation. figures at 30 september 2017. paragon banking group fast facts mortgages established in 1985 £145.2 million underlying operating profit headquartered in solihull ftse-250 listed over 1,300 employees over 450,000 customer loan accounts managed £12.3 billion of gross assets under management credit quality paragon is a conservative lender. against a uk backdrop of limited house building, low investment in social housing and mortgage affordability constraints, tenant demand is expected to remain strong. it also funds small scale property developments and has recently launched in the structured lending market, offering senior debt facilities to non-bank lenders. in addition, it offers servicing of loan portfolios for clients including banks, private equity houses and specialist lenders. market dynamics idem capital acquires loan portfolios from banks that are either restructuring or refocusing their activities. market consolidation amongst debt purchasers combined with improved availability of funding has led to greater competition for individual portfolios. wholesale funding the group has a core expertise in securitisation and other debt raising. while no wholesale funding was raised in the year, such transactions are a strategically important option. securitisation and other wholesale debt markets will be accessed on an tactical basis, when appropriate. alongside its transition to a banking model, the group has made good progress in delivering improved profits and strong organic new business generation. the group’s portfolio purchase business, idem capital, is an established purchaser of secured and unsecured portfolios. the sector has proved increasingly popular for both specialist purchasers and credit funds in recent years, with yields reducing as a consequence. idem capital has retained its credit and pricing discipline across the past year, but as a consequence investment levels have reduced year-on-year. post 2010 funding by type (£m) 30 september 2011 – 2017 £ million warehouse rmbs retail bond tier 2 bond idem capital retail deposits retail deposits represent the group’s primary source of funding for new lending, with its historical securitisation approach taking a more tactical role as and when conditions in that market are attractive, maintaining a diversified approach to the group’s funding. the group’s share buy-back programme has progressed well, with £165.0 million having been invested to date. gross mortgage lending, however, is also benefitting from growth in remortgaging activity which is being driven by increased levels of maturing products in extant mortgage portfolios as well as increased consumer sensitivity to potentially higher interest rates. most lenders, including the group, were able to adopt these changes without serious disruption • from 1 october 2017, lenders were required to underwrite buy-to-let cases on a much more specialised basis, differentiating between professional and amateur landlords, based on the number of properties owned with buy-to-let finance. the group targets niches within this market where its particular skill sets can be best applied. across all business lines growth has been carefully controlled with credit quality and margins prioritised over expansion. it seeks to be responsive and flexible in addressing the market, but its uk focus means that it is exposed to a downturn in investment amongst uk business as a whole, particularly one affecting its core construction and broadcast sectors. the coming year will see development of new product lines, including two already launched, aviation finance and structured lending. each transaction will be secured on underlying assets and structured using established robust methodologies. overall idem capital’s success rests on understanding assets, strong analytics, advanced servicing capabilities and the efficient use of funding. while idem capital has the most significant experience in secured and unsecured consumer loan transactions, it has access to specialists in other asset classes across the group, enabling it to bid on a wider range of asset classes. securitisation will be used tactically if market conditions are favourable, or where it is appropriate for particular transactions. all were refinanced with retail deposits, releasing significant cash balances for use elsewhere in the group. the remaining warehouse provides a standby capability and an alternative to retail deposit funding. certain legacy assets, principally second charge mortgage balances are also funded through pre-credit crisis securitisation structures. an analysis of the group’s central funding between corporate debt and equity (note 7(c)) is shown below. these, together with debt raisings, financed further investments in loan portfolios, the capital requirements of paragon bank and credit enhancement for mortgage originations. we believe this is due to providing quality development opportunities and creating a place where people want to work, which has meant that knowledge and experience have been retained in each of our specialist areas. we believe our people are well positioned to support the group’s future growth strategy. his experience will enhance the board’s understanding of operational and customer issues in retail banking. this will be of great value to the board in its strategic considerations for future developments. the group’s succession planning strategy has also been an important area of focus during the year, with all board and executive management roles together with their direct reports identified from a leadership and specialist perspective. regular reports on key regulatory developments are received at both executive and board risk committees. in addition, supplementary underwriting requirements apply for “portfolio landlords” which the pra has defined as borrowers with four or more distinct, mortgaged, buy-to-let properties. in 2017 paragon has, alongside this transition, witnessed strong growth across all products with total lending increasing by 29% to £1.9 billion. the group’s planning procedures forecast its profitability, capital position, funding requirement and cash flows. at 30 september 2017 the group had free cash balances of £305.5 million immediately available for use (note 30). in march 2017 the group conducted its first diversity survey to obtain anonymous feedback from employees on their age, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious beliefs and disability. we received a positive response rate of 78% and as expected, the survey illustrated our workforce is diverse. in august one manual handling incident was reported under the reporting of incidents, disease and dangerous occurrences regulations 2013 (‘riddor’). specialist fleet services (‘sfs’), a division of paf , leases refuse collection vehicles to local authorities throughout the uk. sfs undertake additional aftersales activities that include servicing, maintenance and breakdown support, hence has the most significant potential environmental impacts. consumption figures for all the premises occupied whether directly owned or tenanted are actively monitored. these are effectively managed under an environmental management system that is certificated to an international standard – iso14001:2015. sfs has a dedicated health and safety manager with direct responsibility for environmental issues at all of its sites. • ensures that all fluorescent light tubes are disposed of in a safe manner, compliant with appropriate regulations • arranges for paper waste products to be recycled, securely, by third parties the green charter is kept under review by the facilities team. led sensor controlled lighting units are being installed in areas of the site that remain lit all day, effectively reducing consumption in infrequently used areas by dimming, then lights off after 10 minutes until further movement is detected. the group’s paper based stationery is procured from forest stewardship council (‘fsc’) certified suppliers. commitment to our customers the group’s strategic objective is to be a prudent, risk focused, specialist financial services provider with a closely controlled, cost efficient operating model which places the delivery of fair customer outcomes at its core. this year employees have: • delivered workshops in local schools and colleges focussing on financial awareness and employability skills • donated over 100 shoeboxes for local samaritans project ‘operation christmas purse’ • made regular contributions to local food banks the group also supports paragon’s charity committee, consisting of volunteer employees, which organises a variety of fundraising activities throughout the year. alan fletcher stepped down as chairman of the remuneration committee in late september and was succeeded by fiona clutterbuck, with fiona’s position chairing the risk and compliance committee taken by finlay williamson. i would like to thank alan for his work as remuneration committee chairman since july 2011, in particular over the last few years when the focus on this area, and how it is reported, has changed significantly. he joined the group in 1987, shortly becoming treasurer, before being appointed as finance director and then chief executive. prior to joining virgin money, finlay had a long career at royal bank of scotland (rbs), where he held a number of senior finance roles, latterly as finance director for rbs’s manufacturing and retail direct divisions. he has over 43 years’ experience in financial services having carried out a number of senior roles in abbey national, including it director for its retail bank, regional director and ran a number of significant change programmes. alan fletcher will cease to be considered an independent non-executive director in february 2018 on the ninth anniversary of his first appointment. the committee’s members are robert dench, nigel terrington and richard woodman, of which any two can form a quorum but that quorum should include either the chief executive officer or chief financial officer. ongoing development opportunities for all directors will be provided, as required, during the forthcoming year. such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against the risk of material misstatement or loss and that assets are safeguarded against unauthorised use or disposition. internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. the committee also has a general responsibility for oversight of the group’s senior management succession policy and its initiatives on workforce and management diversity, with a particular focus on its participation in external programmes, such as women in finance. an external search consultant, gavin orr of lomond consulting, who has previously assisted the group with senior appointments, was used in this process. an initial longlist of 26 potential candidates was produced and the chairman interviewed ten, using a competency-based interview approach. development work on potential candidates occurs with those employees remaining in their current roles, as this training is undertaken so as to minimise business impact while ensuring that candidates are enabled to undertake a more senior role in due course. a similar approach is taken to assessing interest on borrowings, where redemption profiles and anticipated refinancing dates influence expense recognition. other than services required to be provided by external auditors by legislation or regulation, non-audit services provided by kpmg related to accounting and regulatory advisory work in respect of the group’s preparation for the introduction of ifrs 9 and its irb project and other accounting advice (shown as ‘other services’ in note 24). effectiveness in line with the chartered institute of internal audit (‘ciia’) standards, the committee has agreed to commission an external quality assessment (‘eqa’) in january 2018 to benchmark internal audit activities against best practice and peers. the policy also makes provision to ensure that no employee making such a disclosure suffers any detriment by doing so. the year has seen continued strong growth levels in organic business generation and further debt purchase activity. the review also resulted in similar increases for certain senior staff below executive director level. to ensure equal treatment for everyone in the same situation, where settlement payments were due to other senior managers, similar arrangements were offered (i.e. richard woodman was not treated any more favourably than those below board level). alan fletcher stood down on 20 september 2017 and fiona clutterbuck was appointed chair of the committee from that date.

and compliance committee chairman’s report dear shareholder i am pleased to write to you as chairman of the risk and compliance committee with our report as to how we have discharged our responsibilities in the last year. alco operates within clear delegated authorities, monitoring exposures and providing recommendations on actions required. it also provides guidance and makes recommendations in order to implement the group’s strategic plans for credit. the committee considers key operational risk information such as loss events, emerging risks and control failures. the group aims to help its customers by offering financial options which meet individual needs and achieve fair customer outcomes in a well-controlled environment. as a lender and acquirer of credit portfolios the group is inevitably exposed to any material deterioration in economic conditions. the board’s defined strategy is to limit this risk by operating as a specialist lender in carefully chosen markets where its employees have significant levels of experience and expertise. page 111 • corporate governance paragon banking group plc • 2017 annual report and accounts business risk concentration risk description mitigation lending to customers investing in the uk private rented sector forms a substantial part of the group’s advances and assets. this has been illustrated in recent years through acquisitions and diversification into new product areas. recoverable amounts on loans may also be affected by adverse movements in security values such as house and commercial asset prices. the group has comprehensive policies in place that set out detailed criteria which must be met before loans are approved. credit policies incorporate limits for concentration risks arising from factors such as large exposures to counterparties, geographical areas or types of lending. treasury counterparties are typically highly rated banks and, for all cash deposits and derivative positions held within the group’s securitisation structures, they must comply with criteria set out in the financing arrangements, which are monitored externally. page 113 • corporate governance paragon banking group plc • 2017 annual report and accounts conduct risk customer fair outcomes description mitigation the group provides a broad range of financial services products across a number of brands to consumers and small business customers. page 115 • corporate governance paragon banking group plc • 2017 annual report and accounts liquidity and capit al risk funding risk description mitigation the group relies on access to various sources of funding to finance its operations. the group remains well funded with sufficient liquidity to meet all its financial obligations as they fall due. this new application process is now embedded in the group’s irb project plan. as a result, this risk is considered to have remained stable during the year. changes in market interest rates could therefore materially impact the group’s profits as a result of significant mismatches between its assets and liabilities. the company has one class of ordinary shares which carries no right to fixed income. the company does not have any agreements with any director or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover of the company, except that provisions of the company’s share based remuneration arrangements may cause awards granted to employees under such plans to vest in such circumstances. these have been continually reassessed through our half year review, interim and final audits. audit risk group idem, mortgages and central component commercial component segments idem mortgages central commercial revenue

consolidation adjustments parent company -onl y investments in subsidiaries key: key audit matter significant risks not considered to be key audit matter other areas of audit focus movement in risk compared to prior year the factors that have caused the greatest impact on the changes in audit risk arising from significant risks are the impacts of regulatory and tax changes in the buy-to-let market and the strategic reorganisation of the group. there is also less historical experience for the newer lending in this segment due to their relatively unseasoned nature. based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the other information. the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud or other irregularities is higher than for one resulting from error, as they may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control and may involve any area of law and regulation not just

for the year ended 30 september 2017 1. general informa tion paragon banking group plc is a company domiciled in the united kingdom and incorporated in england and wales under the companies act 2006 with company number 2336032. it adopted its present name on 21 september 2017 and was previously named the paragon group of companies plc. ifrs 9 divides loans into three classes: those where there has been no significant increase in credit risk since advance; those where there has been a significant increase in credit risk; and loans which are impaired. however, it is likely that, subject to conditions at the time of implementation, provisions for loans in this condition will be broadly similar to their existing values • for assets which were credit impaired at origination or acquisition, such as certain of the group’s acquired assets, the required treatment is largely identical under ias 39 and ifrs 9 overall, the introduction of ifrs 9 is likely to result in companies carrying a larger provision balance and recognising losses earlier. base models have been completed for the group’s most material asset classes and indicative outputs are being provided to credit committee on a business-as-usual basis. in accordance with ifrs 10 – ‘consolidated financial statements’ companies owned by charitable trusts into which loans originated by group companies were sold as part of its warehouse and securitisation funding arrangements, where the group enjoys the benefits of ownership, are treated as subsidiaries. similarly, trusts set up to hold shares in conjunction with the group’s employee share ownership arrangements are also treated as subsidiaries. loans acquired from third parties are initially valued at the purchase consideration paid or payable. for loan portfolios acquired at a discount, the discounts take account of future expected impairments. after this point a salvage balance may be held in respect of any further recoveries expected on the loan. interest payable by each segment includes directly attributable funding and the allocated cost of retail deposit funds utilised. these are principally present value calculations based on estimated future cash flows arising from the instruments, discounted using a risk adjusted interest rate. it is therefore appropriate to consider that the market price of these borrowings constitutes a fair value. given the mixture of observable and non-observable inputs, these are considered to be level 2 measurements. given the mixture of observable and non-observable inputs these are considered to be level 2 measurements. there is, therefore, a potential risk that they may be subject to change in future periods. note 2017 2016 earnings per share (p) 29 43.1 40.5 proposed dividend per share in

past due measures cannot be used to monitor credit risk. such counterparties are typically highly rated banks and, for all cash deposits and derivative positions held within the group’s securitisation structures, must comply with criteria set out in the financing arrangements, which are monitored externally. the group has a large exposures policy to mitigate any concentration risk in respect of its cash deposits. credit risk on these balances, and the interest accrued thereon, is considered to be minimal. trade debtors the group’s trade debtors balance represents principally amounts outstanding on unpaid operating lease obligations in the asset finance business, where similar acceptance criteria to those used for finance lease cases apply. deposit balances raised are typically used to support lending activities where maturity is over a longer period than that of the deposits. further liquidity risk in the medium term arises from the group’s corporate and retail bonds which are used to support its general operations and from its participation in central bank funding schemes. this responsibility rests with alco which makes recommendations for the group’s liquidity policy for board approval and uses detailed cash flow projections to ensure that an adequate level of liquidity is available at all times. where assets are funded by non-recourse arrangements, through the securitisation process, liquidity risk is effectively eliminated. it is based on an analysis of its forecast cash requirements and their predicted behaviour in stressed conditions. a minimum level of lcr, the liquidity coverage requirement is set through regulation for all regulated financial institutions. financial liabilities falling due: in one year or less, or on demand in more than one year,

this funding is repaid when assets are securitised or refinanced by an internal asset sale. the group’s exposure to this risk is a natural consequence of its lending, deposit taking and borrowing activities, as some of its financial assets and liabilities bear interest at rates which float with various market rates while others are fixed, either for a term or for their whole lives. this calculation allows only for the direct effects of any change in uk interest rates. in practice such a change might have wider economic consequences which would themselves potentially affect the

(note 32) and retail deposits (note 44) where the appropriate criteria are met. the group has designated a number of derivatives as fair value hedges for accounting purposes. all currency borrowings are swapped at inception using bespoke cross-currency basis swaps with principal amortisation and interest rates linked to the underlying borrowing. analysis of derivative financial instruments the analysis below splits derivatives between those accounted for as part of the portfolio fair value and cash flow hedges described above and those which, despite representing an economic hedge, do not qualify for this treatment. for certain counterparties a credit support annex (‘csa’) has been executed in conjunction with the isda master agreement. the recoverable amount of tbmc used in this impairment testing is determined on a value in use basis using pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the board covering a five year period. it is likely that a
