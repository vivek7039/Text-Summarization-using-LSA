For example, we met our annual leakage reduction target, reduced the number of serious pollution incidents and continued to deliver excellent quality drinking water. We have also appointed Ray O’Toole as senior independent director, filling the vacancy I left after becoming Chairman. Anthony Rabin Chairman 13 July 2017 Page 9 Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Chief Executive’s Overview Good progress This has been a positive year for Yorkshire Water and its customers as we continue to make good progress towards the delivery of our five-year business plan for the period 2015 to 2020. To ensure long-term sustainability, we manage a programme of activity that drives us towards our vision and six Strategic Business Objectives (SBOs). Our SBO programme includes a suite of annual targets on activities that drive us towards medium-term milestones and long-term deliverables. We observe an imperative for change as a company whose core business fundamentally relies on financial, natural and social resources. • Effective health protection and emergency procedures in July 2016 when a third party contaminated water supplies to Thorne, near Doncaster. • Effective health protection and emergency procedures in July 2016 when a third party contaminated water supplies to Thorne, near Doncaster. In parallel, we are developing our latest 25-year Drought Plan and WRMP, which will also be published by the end of 2017/18. Following internal improvements, particularly on diversity and inclusion, we achieved top marks of five stars in 2016/17, achieving our SBO commitment. We also embed contractual requirements throughout our supply chain activities and check compliance through a range of assurance controls. Several physical barriers have since been put in place to prevent future contamination of the water network from this processing plant. Three years into our five-year campaign, we are well ahead of plan having already raised over £730,000 through donations from colleagues, customers, partners and the Company.

Continue delivering our documented five-year plan (2015-2020) of activities to protect and enhance the environment, including working in partnership where mutually beneficial. Testing our process at one site, Humberstone Bank Farm, showed a new approach of ‘Beyond Nature’ would enhance value. Seven of our more than 600 waste water treatment works did not meet their discharge permit conditions in 2016, securing 97.61% compliance. This was a reduced performance compared to 2015 when we had only two failing waste water works or 99.32% compliance. Scarborough South beach has reduced in water quality over the past few years and is currently classified as ‘Poor’. In Summer 2016 we started towards this approach at Humberstone Bank Farm, welcoming a local farmer to take over the tenancy. Following consultation in 2015 we have been enhancing the number and diversity of those able to take recreational value from our land. Our planning enables us to act quickly because preferred options have been assessed for their potential environmental impact, and mitigation strategies developed. We are well placed to manage this threat because water resource management is our most mature area of resilience and planning. • Hosted approximately 250 young female students during Women in Engineering Week to raise awareness of STEM subjects and career opportunities. The average difference between all male and female Kelda Group employees was 13.5% when we last assessed our position on 31 August 2016. Below we provide diversity statistics relating to those directly employed by Yorkshire Water on 31 March of each year shown. These figures are estimated using a standardised UK water industry tool that follows Government reporting guidelines and uses latest emission factors. Scope 1 emissions are those we directly release to the atmosphere, for example from burning fossil fuels on our sites, driving company vehicles, and releasing gasses during treatment processes. #2 Ofwat reporting requirements on credit ratings are that water companies should report a corporate family rating where available. Only Moody’s produces a corporate family rating for Yorkshire Water Services Limited and its financing subsidiaries, so that is shown here. Further detail of our corporate taxation and deferred tax accounting are set out in note 9 to the Financial Statements. We have condensed this structure to remove our inactive companies which exist for legacy reasons but are no longer in use. All material movements in business unit or corporate risks are reported monthly to the Risk Committee and senior leaders. • Responsible leader’s framework sets core and functional competencies for all staff, achievement is monitored through the annual performance management cycle.

The value of this assurance is that those involved will review information for technical accuracy, compliance and against wider company expectations. I look forward to further strengthening the Board’s skills as we welcome a new independent director, Andrew Wyllie, on 1 September 2017. Richard held roles at Ford Motor Company over a 40 year period including Group Vice-President, Global Product Development and Chief Technical Officer. Martin Havenhand stepped down from the Board on 31 March 2017, having served nine years and six months since his appointment. Ensuring appropriate focus on strategy had also been identified as a top priority in terms of improving the Board’s performance. In accordance with standard practice, the Company’s Articles of Association contain provisions which permit those directors who are not conflicted to authorise conflict situations. • B.1.1 As noted above, Martin Havenhand had served on the Board for nine and a half years when he stepped down in March 2017. After Anthony Rabin’s appointment as Chairman in September 2016, the search commissioned by Odgers Berndtson was widened to include a third additional independent non-executive director.

To further promote successful employee relations, collective bargaining arrangements are in place with the Company’s recognised trade unions – UNISON, GMB and Unite. These meetings also provide an opportunity to seek employee views which can then be taken into account in decision making.

In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to: • select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently. • state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 102, have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements.

During 2016/17, all except two executive directors were contributory members of the Kelda Group Pension Plan, a defined benefit scheme. Richard Parry-Jones retired on 31 May 2016, Anthony Rabin was appointed as Chairman of Kelda Holdings Limited with effect from 9 September 2016. Contributions during the year ended 31 March 2017 were paid by members at 5%, 6%, 7% or 8.5% of pensionable pay (depending on benefit category). The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded on an active market is determined using a discounted cash flow valuation technique. Management uses its judgement to make assumptions relating to future cash flows, mainly based on forward interest rates from observable yield curves at the end of the reporting period, counter-party funding adjustments and contract interest rates, discounted at a rate that reflects own or counter-party credit risk.
