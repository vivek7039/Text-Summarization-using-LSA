integrated reporting has become modern best practice for annual reporting, adopted by a growing community of organisations that have recognised that strategy, risk, performance and sustainability are inseparable and are integral to an organisation’s success. throughout this report we provide links to specific webpages or other publications where more detailed information is available. halcrow

continued to deliver excellent quality drinking water. we have also appointed ray o’toole as senior independent director, filling the vacancy i left after becoming chairman. anthony rabin chairman 13 july 2017 page 9 introductions – strategic report – governance – independent auditors’ report – statutory financial statements chief executive’s overview good progress this has been a positive year for yorkshire water and its customers as we continue to make good progress towards the delivery of our five-year business plan for the period 2015 to 2020. our focus has continued to be on the affordable, efficient and safe delivery of excellent customer services, while fulfilling our environmental and social responsibilities. i am pleased to report that the plant is now performing well and we expect to meet our future energy generation targets, and exceed them by 2020. we have gone beyond the simple recovery of our assets. this forms part of a multi-agency response to the flooding issues faced by local communities. however, we were also fined during the year for two pollution incidents that occurred in 2013. these fines served to reinforce our environmental responsibilities, as well as our need for constant vigilance and excellent asset and operational management. to ensure long-term sustainability, we manage a programme of activity that drives us towards our vision and six strategic business objectives (sbos). our sbo programme includes a suite of annual targets on activities that drive us towards medium-term milestones and long-term deliverables. we observe an imperative for change as a company whose core business fundamentally relies on financial, natural and social resources. continue to demonstrate we are a responsible business, for example by improving

particularly on diversity and inclusion, we achieved top marks of five stars in 2016/17, achieving our sbo commitment. we also embed contractual requirements throughout our supply chain activities and check compliance through a range of assurance controls. a detailed review of high hazard site risks was completed across the company, and significant investment was made in process safety management to understand the risks of major accident hazards and implement control measures. looking ahead we will be focusing on the incident rate of ltis per 100,000 hours worked. this is in keeping with the water industry approach and will enable us to compare our performance. however, this was not sufficient improvement to achieve the performance commitment for drinking water quality contacts. several physical barriers have since been put in place to prevent future contamination of the water network from this processing plant. we had three events with corrective actions in 2016/17, achieving our performance commitment for no more than six incidents. while we strive for continual reduction, the performance commitments we agreed with customers and ofwat allows for an annual increase in the number of sewer flooding incidents because of growing pressure from factors including climate change and new development. • in april 2016, we were fined a total of £1.1m for three offences at naburn waste water treatment works. page 25 introductions – strategic report – governance – independent auditors’ report – statutory financial statements adopting private pumping stations ownership and

one site, humberstone bank farm, showed a new approach of ‘beyond nature’ would enhance value. page 27 introductions – strategic report – governance – independent auditors’ report – statutory financial statements reducing pollution and enhancing river water quality we collect, treat and return about one billion litres of waste water safely back to the environment every day. seven of our more than 600 waste water treatment works did not meet their discharge permit conditions in 2016, securing 97.61% compliance. this was a reduced performance compared to 2015 when we had only two failing waste water works or 99.32% compliance. scarborough south beach has reduced in water quality over the past few years and is currently classified as ‘poor’. we are also investigating nitrate and other pollutants that present risks to several of our groundwater sources. in summer 2016 we started towards this approach at humberstone bank farm, welcoming a local farmer to take over the tenancy. following consultation in 2015 we have been enhancing the number and diversity of those able to take recreational value from our land. following our investments, yorkshire has had no service restrictions, such as hosepipe bans, since the drought in 1995/96. our planning enables us to act quickly because preferred options have been assessed for their potential environmental impact, and mitigation strategies developed. we are well placed to manage this threat because water resource management is our most mature area of resilience and planning. by 2020 we will further reduce our leakage target in line with the sell, to no more than 287.1ml/d. one of our customer outcomes is ‘we make sure that you always have enough water’. both documents can be found at www.yorkshirewater.com/ourperformance page 35 introductions – strategic report – governance – independent auditors’ report – statutory financial statements attracting great people and maintaining the skills we need our people are critical to the success of our business and services. • hosted approximately 250 young female students during women in engineering week to raise awareness of stem

directly release to the atmosphere, for example from burning fossil fuels on our sites, driving company vehicles, and releasing gasses during treatment processes. we have also increased the rates of recycling from our offices, construction projects and operational sites. we are working on a range of projects with resource efficiency principles at their core. our policy can be found at:

resources and to enable a cycle of social, economic and environmental improvements. #2 ofwat reporting requirements on credit ratings are that water companies should report a corporate family rating where available. only moody’s produces a corporate family rating for yorkshire water services limited and its financing subsidiaries, so that is shown here. find more information on our credit ratings on page 44. page 41 introductions – strategic report – governance – independent auditors’ report – statutory financial statements ensuring affordable water services and managing customer debt we recognise that many customers struggle with the cost of living. this has been offset by costs associated with the ongoing operational mitigation for damaged assets of £17.9m. more information in relation to our credit ratings is provided on page 44. our executive management team receives regular reports from all areas of the business to enable prompt identification of financial and other risks so that appropriate actions can be taken. negative inflation, without appropriate management, could potentially breach gearing limits despite the company being profitable. the index-linked swaps are an arrangement such that interest is both payable and receivable on a notional amount of £1,289m, with six month libor (london interbank offered rate) receivable and interest payable at fixed amounts plus rpi. the latest published ratings are as follows: on 2 june 2017, s&p affirmed the yorkshire water financing group’s class a rating of ‘a-‘ and class b rating of ‘bbb’ both with a stable outlook. further detail of our corporate taxation and deferred tax accounting are set out in note 9 to the financial statements. we have condensed this structure to remove our inactive companies which exist for legacy reasons but are no longer in use. this means that any profit or loss made by these companies is subject only to uk tax. where necessary, gearing and distribution levels were reduced to ensure the ongoing compliance of financial covenants. yorkshire water has not previously experienced that level of downside cost impacts over a prolonged period. • yorkshire water’s robust solvency position including its likely ability to raise new finance in most market conditions. taking account of this information, the directors have concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that yorkshire water will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the assessment period. page 49 introductions – strategic report – governance – independent

essential for us to manage uncertainties and achieve our objectives. all material movements in business unit or corporate risks are reported monthly to the risk committee and senior leaders. it also indicates whether we perceive the risk to yorkshire water and kelda group is increasing or reducing. in addition, we have established assurance arrangements which are common across all our principal risks. first line assurance is typically provided by operational managers ensuring compliance with established controls, policies and procedures. • the oh&s management system, supported by a suite of good practice policies and procedures. this risk has reduced due to the impact of sustainable improvements we have delivered through capital schemes. we have clarified our 25-year climate change

compliance and against wider company expectations. our decision not to exit this business to a newly created kelda group company required careful consideration and the establishment of the board’s non-household retail committee was key in terms of good corporate governance. anthony was appointed as interim and subsequently permanent chairman on 9 september 2016. he was appointed to the board as a non-executive director with effect from 1 august 2013 and to the role of senior independent director on 25 march 2015. he was also appointed as an independent non-executive director to the kelda holdings board in july 2012. committee membership: nomination (chair); remuneration; corporate responsibility; safety, health and environment. richard held roles at ford motor company over a 40 year period including group vice-president, global product development and chief technical officer. the board composition the composition of the board at 31 march 2017 was as follows: independent non-executive chairman anthony rabin independent non-executive directors martin havenhand (retired 31 march 2017) ray o’toole kath pinnock teresa robson-capps (appointed 1 january 2017) julia unwin (appointed 1 january 2017) executive directors richard flint chief executive liz barber director of finance, regulation and markets charlie haysom director of service delivery nevil muncaster director

following the resignation of richard parry-jones on 31 may 2016, anthony rabin became interim chairman and was subsequently appointed as independent non-executive chairman on 9 september 2016. richard parry-jones had not been involved in anthony’s selection or appointment as chairman. previous chairs have always sat on both the boards of kelda holdings limited and kelda eurobond co limited and consistent with the previous approach taken, anthony rabin was also appointed to both of those boards. this accords with provisions contained within the shareholders’ agreement, to which kelda holdings limited is a party. succession planning has been identified as an area of focus following this year’s board evaluation. briefings are provided to directors on relevant issues, including legislative, regulatory and financial reporting matters. • approval of capital expenditure and investment in accordance with the company’s delegated financial authorities. page 71 introductions – strategic report – governance – independent auditors’ report – statutory financial statements legal committee the duties of the legal committee are to deal with all matters requiring a decision on (i) whether to appeal any judicial decision, and (ii) whether to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty in respect of any prosecution brought by the ea or dwi. this was undertaken in 2016 by lintstock and will next take place during the 2018/19 financial year. ensuring appropriate focus on strategy had also been identified as a top priority in terms of improving the board’s performance. • the introduction of further opportunities for board development such as team building events delivered by an external facilitator. this analysis is then used to draw up communication, engagement and influencing programmes with key stakeholder groups. in accordance with standard practice, the company’s articles of association contain provisions which permit those directors who are not conflicted to authorise conflict situations. after anthony rabin’s appointment as chairman in september 2016, the search commissioned by odgers berndtson was widened to include a third additional independent non-executive director. viu is determined using a discounted cash flows approach to calculate the business enterprise value. it is system generated based on algorithms using historical water consumption and tariff data at a customer account level. no significant failings of internal control were identified during these reviews, limited weaknesses were identified, none of which are significant and all have clear action plans to address them in an appropriate time frame. details of how these have been calculated are provided in the annual report on remuneration. accordingly, a significant proportion of directors’ remuneration is tied to performance through annual and long-term incentive plan awards. page 84 introductions – strategic report – governance – independent
