A separate annual review and notice of meeting (including summary ﬁnancial statements) for the year ended 31 March 2006 has been issued to all shareholders. This is being funded from cash generated over and above that required for servicing our debt, which remains below £8 billion. Your Board has given its backing to targeted acquisitions that will help us conﬁrm our status as a leading player in the global networked IT services market. I would also like to thank Lou Hughes who stepped down as a non-executive director on 31 March 2006 for his excellent contribution over more than six years. We are now, for example, meeting almost all our UK electricity needs from environmentally friendly sources, including wind generation, solar, wave and hydroelectric schemes. We will ensure consumers enjoy a joined-up communications experience, enabling them to communicate anywhere, anytime, using whatever device they choose. A people business only really ﬁres on all cylinders when its top team is on top of its game, which is why we have rigorously deﬁned the capabilities we expect of leaders in this business and developed programmes to help them become even more customer focused. The increase in new wave revenue for major corporate customers globally was driven by networked IT services, broadband and mobility. Under the agreement, we will supply services based on modern, reliable IP communications that take advantage of our 21CN programme to deliver consistent and ﬂexible services which will, we believe, lead to substantial efﬁciencies and new capabilities for the DWP and its clients s in February 2006, we completed an agreement to become Fiat’s supplier of global telecommunications services in 40 countries, in a deal worth approximately E450 million over almost ﬁve years. In total, 5,501 exchanges had been upgraded by 31 March 2006, making broadband available to 99.7% of the UK’s homes and businesses. We are helping to deﬁne next-generation television – which is being made possible by the convergence of digital broadcast TV and broadband technology. We have signed content deals with BBC Worldwide, Paramount, Warner Music Group, Endemol, i-concerts, Eagle Rock, Cartoon Network, National Geographic Channel, HIT Entertainment and Nelvana. The BT Movio service also incorporates Windows Media DRM (digital rights management) technology to ensure secure delivery of premium video and music content. A key area of focus has been enhancing the ways in which customers can deal with BT, simultaneously saving costs and improving customer service. In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, we vacated around 135 buildings and installed an additional 250 ﬂexible workstations which can be shared by multiple users. As at 31 March 2006, our ﬂagship MPLS network service provided coverage and support to over 90 countries from more than 1,200 points of presence. Ultimately, it is expected to support the introduction of many more new services than are currently available, offering greater customer choice. The transaction gave rise to a bond redemption gain of £27 million s in February 2006, we acquired Atlanet, a Fiat subsidiary providing domestic telecommunications services to Fiat and other non-Fiat business customers throughout Italy, for approximately E80 million, further reinforcing our position in the Italian market. Additional conditions relate to issues such as schemes for consumers with special social needs, and the provision of public payphone services. Our charges for a range of interconnect services are controlled by Ofcom, under the NCC (network charge control) regime. BT’s rates were set by the Valuation Ofﬁce after lengthy discussions based on well established principles in a transparent process. This rate is used only as a reference against the regulatory current cost values of BT’s regulated products. IPStream and Datastream In June 2005, we reached agreement with Ofcom that rental prices for IPStream and Datastream – the most popular wholesale ADSL broadband access products currently used by service providers – will not reduce until there are 1.5 million unbundled lines in the UK, with certain exceptions. The company has concluded that it would not be appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such claim. We continue to create a working environment that actively supports all our employees – regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation, religion/beliefs, disability or age. This increase in R&D underpins our increased focus on developing innovative products and services for a converged, networked world. Our objective is to transform the various IT units throughout BT into a single team, rigorously focused on customer requirements. The committee, chaired by Sir Christopher Bland, consists of representatives from BT businesses, three non-executive directors and two independent members who have a reputation for excellence in this ﬁeld. We are working with ChildLine on a campaign to ensure that every child’s call for help is answered. BT is the ﬁrst commercial organisation to provide online information in this format, opening up access for deaf people. Pensions Declining investment returns and longer life expectancy may result in the cost of funding BT’sdeﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme becoming a signiﬁcant burden on our ﬁnancial resources. EBITDA before speciﬁc items is considered to be a good measure of the group’s operating performance because it reﬂects the underlying operating cash costs, by eliminating depreciation and amortisation, and excludes material one off or unusual items that are predominantly related to corporate transactions. The majority of these initiatives were targeted at people related costs, with signiﬁcant savings in billing, IT operations and other support functions. 21CN is being developed using stringent capital return criteria and a rigorous approach to any investment in the narrowband network. Prior to his retirement in May 2001, Clay was executive deputy chairman of CMG having joined the board when it acquired Admiral. These activities are carried out on an even-handed basis related broadly to the major UK political parties’ electoral strength. At 17 May 2006, 22 million treasury shares had been transferred to meet the company’s obligations under its employee share plans. A conﬁdential helpline and dedicated e-mail facility are also available to employees who have questions about the application of these principles. The pension funds’ assets can only be used in accordance with their respective rules and for no other purpose. As a result of regulatory or similar requirements, it may be necessary to employ the company’s external auditors for certain non-audit work. It reviewed the arrangements for dealing, in conﬁdence, with complaints from employees about accounting or ﬁnancial management impropriety, fraud, poor business practices and other matters. Awards will be linked to a sliding scale of BT Global Services’ performance, weighted equally around revenue growth, EBIT and cash generation. The performance measure for outstanding awards and options is TSR (total shareholder return) compared with a relevant basket of companies. Pension provision for all executives is based on salary alone – bonuses, other elements of pay and long-term incentives are excluded.

BT’s rates were set by the Valuation Ofﬁce after lengthy discussions based on well established principles, in a transparent process.

SHARE BASED PAYMENT PLANS continued For options outstanding at 31 March 2006 and 2005, the weighted average exercise prices are shown below. Options granted under BT’s international sharesave, which is a three-year plan, have been valued using the same assumptions. At 31 March 2006, the group had outstanding interest rate swap agreements in cash ﬂow hedges against borrowings with a total notional principal amount of £3.2 billion. Under IFRS 3, ‘Business Combinations’, goodwill is no longer amortised but held at its carrying value on the balance sheet and tested annually for impairment. Under IAS 21, ‘The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchanges Rates’, such forward rate adjustments are required to be disclosed separately and have therefore been reclassiﬁed. Whilst reducing revenue and operating costs, this change has had no impact on reported proﬁt, cash ﬂows or the balance sheet. The assets that were not impaired under US GAAP are continuing to be depreciated over their remaining useful lives.
