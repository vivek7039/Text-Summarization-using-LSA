a separate annual review and notice of meeting (including summary ﬁnancial statements) for the year ended 31 march 2006 has been issued to all shareholders. this is being funded from cash generated over and above that required for servicing our debt, which remains below £8 billion. your board has given its backing to targeted acquisitions that will help us conﬁrm our status as a leading player in the global networked it services market. new wave revenue grew by 38% to £6.3 billion, and accounted for around one-third of our total business. i would also like to thank lou hughes who stepped down as a non-executive director on 31 march 2006 for his excellent contribution over more than six years. i’m pleased that his experience is not lost to us: he has joined our americas advisory board. climate change has been moving inexorably up the social and corporate agendas for a number of years now. we are now, for example, meeting almost all our uk electricity needs from environmentally friendly sources, including wind generation, solar, wave and hydroelectric schemes. chairman’s message chairman’s message bt group plc annual report and form 20-f 2006 3 filename: 824560_01.3d time: 14:32:47 date: 20/05/06 checksum: -1161971776 helping customers thrive in a changing world we enjoy the fantastic privilege of serving around 20 million customers in 170 countries around the world. when so much is changing, companies have to be crystal clear about what they stand for. bt is a mobile virtual network operator in both the business and consumer markets, with more than 340,000 connections. we launched bt fusion, the world’s ﬁrst service enabling customers to switch seamlessly your company is ambitious. we will ensure consumers enjoy a joined-up communications experience, enabling them to communicate anywhere, anytime, using whatever device they choose. a people business only really ﬁres on all cylinders when its top team is on top of its game, which is why we have rigorously deﬁned the capabilities we expect of leaders in this business and developed programmes to help them become even more customer focused. we aim to provide them with networked it services and a complete range of managed solutions. the increase in new wave revenue for major corporate customers globally was driven by networked it services, broadband and mobility. we have a number of agreements with service providers and mobile operators to upgrade their ip capability. in addition, we have used our expertise and geographic reach to provide bespoke data housing solutions. build on our networked it services capability our strategy in the networked it services market is to reinforce bt’s position as a global player capable of competing with the world’s best in selected markets. under the agreement, we will supply services based on modern, reliable ip communications that take advantage of our 21cn programme to deliver consistent and ﬂexible services which will, we believe, lead to substantial efﬁciencies and new capabilities for the dwp and its clients s in february 2006, we completed an agreement to become fiat’s supplier of global telecommunications services in 40 countries, in a deal worth approximately e450 million over almost ﬁve years. in total, 5,501 exchanges had been upgraded by 31 march 2006, making broadband available to 99.7% of the uk’s homes and businesses. we are helping to deﬁne next-generation television – which is being made possible by the convergence of digital broadcast tv and broadband technology. we have signed content deals with bbc worldwide, paramount, warner music group, endemol, i-concerts, eagle rock, cartoon network, national geographic channel, hit entertainment and nelvana. we are also playing a lead role in the development of internet telephony or volp (voice over ip). bt business e-mail was the ﬁrst service to be launched on this platform and provides ‘anywhere access’ to critical business information, supported by advanced security and collaboration features, and there were 12,000 users of this service at 31 march 2006. in january 2006, we launched bt business broadband voice, our ﬁrst ‘ﬂat top’ internet telephone or voip call package for broadband customers. the bt movio service also incorporates windows media drm (digital rights management) technology to ensure secure delivery of premium video and music content. at 31 march 2006, 268,000 bt customers were registered on the service and around 1.2 million text messages were being sent to landlines every week s since autumn 2005, over one million customers have registered to have their friends & family calling circle automatically updated to ensure that the numbers they dial most frequently attract maximum discounts s we manage around 64,000 public payphones, including more than 800 multimedia kiosks and more than 1,000 textphones throughout the uk. a key area of focus has been enhancing the ways in which customers can deal with bt, simultaneously saving costs and improving customer service. we also continued to reduce overheads such as accommodation, using buildings more efﬁciently and introducing ﬂexible working practices. in the 2006 ﬁnancial year, we vacated around 135 buildings and installed an additional 250 ﬂexible workstations which can be shared by multiple users. a number of other programmes are underway, including structural changes in our network management and planning divisions. as at 31 march 2006, our ﬂagship mpls network service provided coverage and support to over 90 countries from more than 1,200 points of presence. an end-to-end, next-generation ip network, 21cn is designed to consolidate bt’s complex network and systems infrastructure to ensure that the delivery of the next generation of converged services is fast, efﬁcient and highly cost effective. following extensive technical trials in the 2006 ﬁnancial year – including successfully carrying more than six million voice calls over a trial ip network – we developed a comprehensive national migration and roll-out plan, which is currently subject to industry consultation. ultimately, it is expected to support the introduction of many more new services than are currently available, offering greater customer choice. the transaction gave rise to a bond redemption gain of £27 million s in february 2006, we acquired atlanet, a fiat subsidiary providing domestic telecommunications services to fiat and other non-fiat business customers throughout italy, for approximately e80 million, further reinforcing our position in the italian market. its application is subject to conditions made by the secretary of state for trade and industry. additional conditions relate to issues such as schemes for consumers with special social needs, and the provision of public payphone services. signiﬁcant market power conditions ofcom is required by the european commission (ec) to deﬁne, analyse and regularly review markets, and to determine whether any communications provider has smp, which is aligned with the competition law concept of dominance. the value of x changed in december 2005 from rpi to zero giving bt a small increase in pricing freedom up to the end of the current control period on 31 july 2006. ofcom is consulting on whether a new retail price control will be required after july 2006. in addition, bt has given an assurance that we will adhere to a rpi + 0% price cap until 30 june 2006 for retail analogue private circuits and 8 mbit/s digital private circuits. our charges for a range of interconnect services are controlled by ofcom, under the ncc (network charge control) regime. depending on the degree of competition, charges are cap-controlled each year by rpi minus x for services ofcom considers unlikely to become competitive in the near future, and safeguard cap-controlled (ie no increases above rpi) for services likely to become competitive. bt must notify ofcom and other operators if it intends to amend existing charges or offer new services. on 1 october 2004, ofcom introduced a ppc charge control to replace the annual determinations previously carried out by oftel. bt does not have universal service obligations outside the uk, although in certain member states we may be required to contribute towards an industry fund to pay for the cost of meeting universal service obligations in those countries. bt’s rates were set by the valuation ofﬁce after lengthy discussions based on well established principles in a transparent process. this rate is used only as a reference against the regulatory current cost values of bt’s regulated products. ipstream and datastream in june 2005, we reached agreement with ofcom that rental prices for ipstream and datastream – the most popular wholesale adsl broadband access products currently used by service providers – will not reduce until there are 1.5 million unbundled lines in the uk, with certain exceptions. the company has concluded that it would not be appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such claim. in march 2006, we upgraded bt academy, our web-based corporate learning portal, to a new platform and renamed it route2learn (r2l). r2l – a group-wide system – is evidence of our continuing investment in lifelong learning and education for all bt people. we continue to create a working environment that actively supports all our employees – regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation, religion/beliefs, disability or age. this increase in r&d underpins our increased focus on developing innovative products and services for a converged, networked world. our objective is to transform the various it units throughout bt into a single team, rigorously focused on customer requirements. the committee, chaired by sir christopher bland, consists of representatives from bt businesses, three non-executive directors and two independent members who have a reputation for excellence in this ﬁeld. procurement through our supply chain initiative, sourcing with human dignity, we seek to ensure that the working conditions in our supply chain meet internationally recognised human rights standards, and to investigate potential social and environmental shortcomings. we requested withdrawal of our certiﬁcation in ireland, pending reorganisation and will seek re-accreditation during the 2007 ﬁnancial year. internationally, our lifelines india initiative helps developing world farmers access essential advice and information over a digital network. we are working with childline on a campaign to ensure that every child’s call for help is answered. our age and disability action website, for example, now includes information about broadband in british sign language. bt is the ﬁrst commercial organisation to provide online information in this format, opening up access for deaf people. all of them have the potential to impact our business, revenue, proﬁts, assets, liquidity and capital resources adversely. most of bt’s ﬁxed network activities in the uk are subject to signiﬁcant regulatory controls. ofcom has promoted competition in the ﬁxed-network area by measures including local loop unbundling, carrier pre-selection (making it easier for bt customers to route some or all of their calls over our competitors’ networks) and the introduction of wholesale access products. we have entered into a number of complex and high-value networked it services contracts with customers. pensions declining investment returns and longer life expectancy may result in the cost of funding bt’sdeﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme becoming a signiﬁcant burden on our ﬁnancial resources. selected financial data bt group plc annual report and form 20-f

external revenue of bt retail from sme (smaller and medium sized enterprise) customers. revenue from business (smaller and medium sized enterprise) customers in the 2006 ﬁnancial year reduced by 5% to £2,324 million. residential broadband connections increased 52% to 2,028,000 at 31 march 2006. traditional consumer revenue declined by 10% reﬂecting the shift towards new wave products. during the 2005 ﬁnancial year albacom contributed post tax losses of £22 million prior to becoming a subsidiary. ebitda before speciﬁc items is considered to be a good measure of the group’s operating performance because it reﬂects the underlying operating cash costs, by eliminating depreciation and amortisation, and excludes material one off or unusual items that are predominantly related to

result of regulatory or similar requirements, it may be necessary to employ the company’s external auditors for certain non-audit work. it reviewed the arrangements for dealing, in conﬁdence, with complaints from employees about accounting or ﬁnancial management impropriety, fraud, poor business practices and other matters. key areas highlighted were: the need for continued focus on board

ebit and cash generation. under his service agreement, the chairman is not entitled to receive annual grants of incentive awards or options. normally, awards vest and options become exercisable only if a predetermined performance target has been achieved. the performance measure for outstanding awards and options is tsr (total shareholder return) compared with a relevant basket of companies. other than for new recruits, the size of option grant is based on corporate and individual performance. tsr will continue to be measured against a comparator group of companies from the european telecom sector.

(x) asset impairment (non-financial assets) intangible assets with ﬁnite useful lives and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment if events or changes in circumstances (assessed at each reporting date) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. goodwill and other intangible ﬁxed assets with an indeﬁnite useful life are tested for impairment at least annually. the group’s net obligation in respect of deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes is calculated separately for each scheme by estimating the amount of future beneﬁt that employees have earned in return for their service to date. the group has applied ifrs 2 ‘share based payment’ retrospectively to all options granted after 7 november 2002 and not fully vested at 1 january 2005. bt group plc annual report and
