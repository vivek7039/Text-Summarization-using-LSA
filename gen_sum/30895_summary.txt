As a result we  have listened to the comments received and  made significant changes which are highlighted  in our Remuneration Report on page 76. 2017 Highlights 22 FEBRUARY 2017 Inmarsat awarded UK Space Agency  grant funding, to develop satellite  application programmes that address  pressing social concerns in Nigeria,  the Philippines and Indonesia. Inmarsat-5 F4 (‘I-5 F4’)  was launched by SpaceX on a Falcon 9 rocket  from historic launch pad 39A at NASA’s  Kennedy Space Center in Florida. RUPERT PEARCE   CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 9 March 2018 24 OCTOBER 2017 Inmarsat is Official  Satellite Communications  Partner to the 2017-18  Volvo Ocean Race. Broadband data is increasingly becoming  a mission-critical enabler of our customers’  businesses, to help drive their commercial  and operational progress. We expect  Inmarsat’s core global maritime, aviation  and government mobility markets will remain  relatively well insulated from this threat. 21  Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report | Business overview  BUSINESS OVERVIEW – MARITIME CONTINUED 1.2m 1.2 MILLION SEAFARERS  RELY ON INMARSAT SAFETY  SERVICES EVERY DAY committed to Fleet Xpress over the coming years,  including both commitments from our key strategic  distribution partners as well as vessels committed  to be migrated from our interim VSAT product,  XpressLink (‘XL’), to Fleet Xpress, ensuring  a strong foundation for growth going forward.

Inmarsat has also extended its innovation in  the high mobility government L -band market  with products and services tailored to specific  customers’ needs, further enhancing military  satellite systems. Consequently, government agencies’  operational reliance on commercially-provided  space-based capabilities is expected to become  an increasingly common feature of the industry.

Over the medium term, we expect  to transition a portion of these customers  onto GX for Aviation IFC services. During the year, several customers made  progress with their GX terminal installation  programmes, including Deutsche Lufthansa  Group, and we continue to support them  in preparation for active service. In recent years, Inmarsat has successfully  established a land-based commercial  mobile satellite services business focused  on providing highly portable satellite  communications services to remote  communities and/or for use when terrestrial  networks are not available, for example,  in diverse sectors such as first response,  media, aid, mining and construction  and other areas. Establishing reliable communications is essential  to coordinating relief efforts and keeping emergency responders safe in dangerous,  sometimes hostile environments. This new satellite technology will be able to  deliver a significant step-up in throughput  and capacity into key regions of high  demand at low cost. The GX network, based on our four Inmarsat-5  satellites in Ka-band, is fully operational and has  been revenue generating since 2016. Our fourth  GX satellite, launched in 2017, provides in-orbit  redundancy and additional capacity and  CENTRAL SERVICES RESULTS Year ended 31 December 2017 $m 2016 $m Change Revenue Ligado Networks 126.7 119.4 6.1% Other 14.5 16.6 12.7% Total revenue 141.2 136.0 3.8% Direct costs (16.7) (3.1) 438.7% Gross margin 124.5 132.9 (6.3%) Indirect costs (275.5) (240.2) 14.7% Adjusted EBITDA (151.0) (107.3) (40.7%) Restructuring (19.9) – EBITDA (170.9) (107.3) (59.3%) Cash capex 414.5 209.6 97.8% Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 37  Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report Strategic Report | Business overview CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW Building a strong financial platform TONY BATES CHIEF FINANCIAL   OFFICER Financial   Statements 104 Inmarsat’s financial results in 2017 , in particular the  delivery of further revenue growth during the year,  supported by our ongoing focus on ensuring the Group  maintains a strong and flexible balance sheet, helped us  to further develop a strong platform for future growth HIGHLIGHTS 5.4% INCREASE IN GROUP REVENUE (5.5)% DECREASE IN ADJUSTED EBITDA  › Adjusted EPS of 0.42 cents  › Net debt to EBITDA of 2.8x  › Nearly $1bn of liquidity GROUP RESULTS Year ended 31 December 2017 $m 2016 $m Change Revenue Satellite services 1,273.5 1,209.6 5.3% Ligado 126.7 119.4 6.1% Total revenue 1,400.2 1,329.0 5.4% Direct costs (207.0) (145.6) (42.2%) Gross margin 1,193.2 1,183.4 0.8% Indirect costs (441.8) (388.6) (13.7%) Adjusted EBITDA 751.4 794.8 (5.5%) Adjusted EBITDA margin % 53.7% 59.8% – Restructuring (19.9) – – EBITDA 731.5 794.8 (8.0%) Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 38 Strategic Report | Chief Financial Officer’s review due to the I-5 F4 and S-band satellites coming  into commercial service in the fourth quarter  of 2017.

FUTURE GUIDANCE We are targeting mid-single digit percentage  revenue growth (excluding Ligado) on average  over the next five years, with EBITDA and free  cash flow generation (both excluding Ligado)  expected to improve steadily as a result of the  combined impact of this growing revenue base,  an improved revenue mix, tightly managed  overhead costs and new, lower cost, satellite  technologies being implemented that we expect  to drive a meaningful moderation in our annual  infrastructure capex over the medium-term. More information relating to these activities  can be found on the CSR and investor relations  sections of our website. In fact, our analysis shows that if we had  equal numbers of men and women at each  organisational level, the gap would be reduced  to 8.5%. Moreover no legal cases relating to corruption  have been brought against Inmarsat or  its employees during the reporting period. In 2017 we expanded our entry routes into  Inmarsat for those at the start or early stages  of their career. Utilising TARGETJobs for graduate hiring  we are partnering with them and other  engineering employers on their Future Female  Engineer days to bring more women into the  sector. The diligence applied by our workforce  to consider risk is reflected in business cases  which are submitted for approval and ongoing  projects have risks reported on a regular basis. › We have launched Fleet One to support smaller fishing  vessels and offer ‘cyber as a service’, both of which provide  additional market opportunities for us. › We will build partnerships with software and application  developers to deliver value added solutions for use on  our platforms. › Through our One IT project we are building a modern computer  infrastructure that enhances protection of critical assets  and data. We must  agree how it is used in coordination with other satellite  operators and need to coordinate its ongoing availability. We may lose highly technical and specialist  employees who have very specific skill sets that are vital to  the business. The Brexit committee has organised briefing  sessions for EU citizen employees and Inmarsat is financially  supporting residency applications. Our Board members  receive drafts of the Annual Report in sufficient  time to facilitate their review and input. The diversity already on our Board allows  us to be culturally aware and respond where there  are areas which need greater focus. During  2017, the Board met eight times, with one  of those meetings being held over two days  in Washington DC. Business plan approval  and procurement process procedures  also strengthen the review of contractual  commitments before any such commitment  is agreed to. Other  members of the Committee are Andrew Sukawaty,  Stephen Davidson (up to his retirement in  January 2017) and Dr Hamadoun Touré. Each Director’s  individual experience and background is taken  into account in developing a programme  tailored to his or her own requirements. Whilst the  Chairman takes ultimate responsibility for this,  each Director is expected to ask about any  specific training needs. In appointing Non-Executive Directors,  the Board’s practice is to use a combination  of external consultants and personal referrals. The Committee’s terms of reference have  been updated to reflect best practice, and  can be found on our website. With several significant changes to IFRS  reporting being implemented, the Committee  received detailed briefings and updates from  management regarding progress. It presents its reports at each meeting  covering updates on Internal Audit activities,  results of audits and follow-up actions required. 500+ MEETINGS OR CONFERENCE CALLS WITH  ANALYSTS AND INSTITUTIONS IN 2017 Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 75  Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance | Relations with shareholders TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN BONUS OUTCOME (% OF SALARY) Chief Financial Officer Inmarsat FTSE 350 xIT Dec 17 Dec 08 0 100 200 300 400 Chief Executive Officer 2017 £1,875k £2,346k 2016 2017 £1,532k £1,807k 2016 CEO 82% 88% CFO DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT 2017 Directors’   Remuneration Policy 79 Annual Report   on Remuneration 85 77 Annual Statement from  Committee Chairman 79 2017 Directors’ Remuneration Policy  (provided in full for information;  as approved in May 2017) 81 Payments from existing variable  pay awards 81 Performance measurement selection 81 Remuneration policy for other employees 81 Shareholding guidelines 81 Pay scenario charts for the CEO and CFO 82 Approach to recruitment remuneration 82 Executive Director service contracts  and exit payment policy 84 Non-Executive Directors 85 External appointments 85 Consideration of conditions elsewhere  in the Company 85 Consideration of shareholder views 85 Annual Report on Remuneration 85 Remuneration Committee  membership in 2017 86 Advisors 86 Summary of shareholder voting   at the 2017 AGM 8 7	 S i n g l e 	 fi g u r e 	 of 	 t ot a l 	 r e m u n e r a t i o n 	 for Executive Directors (audited) 87 Incentive outcomes for the year  ended 31 December 2017 (audited) 90 Additional disclosure of 2016   performance targets (audited) 91 Scheme interests awarded in 2017  (audited) 92 Pension (audited) 9 3	 S i n g l e 	 fi g u r e 	 of 	 t ot a l 	 r e m u n e r a t i o n 	 for Non-Executive Directors (audited) 93 Exit payments made in the year (audited) 93 Payments to past Directors (audited) 93 External appointments for  Executive Directors 93 Implementation of Remuneration   Policy for 2018 95 Non-Executive Director fees 95 Total shareholder return 96 CEO nine-year remuneration history  (audited) 96 Percentage change in CEO remuneration 96 Relative importance of spend on pay 97 Directors’ shareholding (audited) 97 Directors’ interests in shares in  Inmarsat long-term incentive plans  and all-employee plans (audited) 97 Inmarsat Bonus Share Awards (audited) 98 Inmarsat Performance Share  Awards (audited) 98 Inmarsat Sharesave Scheme   (2017 Award) (audited) 2018 SNAPSHOT SHARE PLANS  › Change to BSA operation:  – performance against each measure assessed on an independent basis  – payout for target performance reduced to 80% of maximum; introduction of stretch target,  the achievement of which will result in 100% payout  › No changes in PSA and BSA award opportunities vs. 2017:  – award	 of	 salar y :	 185%	 for	 CEO	 and	 175%	 for	 CFO	 –	 final 	 vesting	 may	 be	 lower	 but	 not higher than these percentages of salary  – two-year hold on PSA awards which was introduced with effect from the 2017 award These changes were implemented in the 2017 award as well.
