report | key performance indicators market trends significant growth opportunities fixed satellite operators’ markets remain under pressure, whilst growth opportunities remain in mobility unlike fixed satellite operators, inmarsat has no exposure to slower growth, structurally challenged markets, in particular video and fixed point telecommunications, and is therefore highly differentiated from these operators. broadband data is increasingly becoming a mission-critical enabler of our customers’ businesses, to help drive their commercial and operational progress. we expect inmarsat’s core global maritime, aviation and government mobility markets will remain relatively well insulated from this threat. this means that a satellite system of just three satellites is enough to achieve global coverage. inmarsat, with a current estimated segment share in ifc of over 30% (excluding north america and based on our signed aircraft under contract for gx aviation services), is targeting to

transforming airborne communications, no more so than at sea where only satellite networks can reach. inmarsat has also extended its innovation in the high mobility government l -band market with products and services tailored to specific customers’ needs, further enhancing military satellite systems. consequently, government agencies’ operational reliance on commercially-provided space-based capabilities is expected to become an increasingly common feature of the industry. in particular, inmarsat’s ability to augment existing military satellite systems through the global availability of its end-to-end l -band and ka-band networks is delivering highly resilient communication capabilities with increased flexibility and robustness in support of mission-critical applications. u.s. government revenues grew by 21.4% in 2017, driven by the impact of short-term higher operational tempo activity during q3, a material new business win in q2 and approximately nine months of revenue

for in-flight broadband is there – 60% of respondents in the 2017 inmarsat in-flight connectivity survey considered it a necessity, not a luxury – but what is passenger connectivity worth to the global airline industry? in the first research study of its kind, the london school of economics and political science (‘lse’), in association with inmarsat, developed an independent forecasting model to predict how broadband-enabled ancillary revenues are set to take off. over the medium term, we expect to transition a portion of these customers onto gx for aviation ifc services. during the year, several customers made progress with their gx terminal installation programmes, including deutsche lufthansa group, and we continue to support them in preparation for active service. in recent years, inmarsat has successfully established a land-based commercial mobile satellite services business focused on providing highly portable satellite communications services to remote communities and/or for

3) activities with the ambition of engaging with our major suppliers to set meaningful and ambitious emissions reductions targets. we are passionate about highlighting the successes of women in this sector and creating inspirational role models. for example, rising sea levels as a result of climate change could impact our satellite access stations and/or land earth stations which are located at strategic points around the world and act as traffic gateways connecting customers using the inmarsat satellites to terrestrial networks. to manage this risk, we have established site selection due diligence processes which incorporate climatic geographical considerations. risks are initially identified and reviewed in each business unit and area, then on a quarterly basis risk reports are formally reviewed by senior management on a central risk committee representing each component part of the business. there will be a balance of risk and opportunity considered as we take our investment decisions. the risk trend for each principal risk at the date of this annual report has been assessed as either stable, increasing or reducing in size, measured in both net impact and net probability and compared to a year ago. the diligence applied by our workforce to consider risk is reflected in business cases which are submitted for approval and ongoing projects have risks reported on a regular basis. principal risks the group faces a number of risks that may adversely affect our strategic and business objectives, operations, liquidity, financial position, reputation or future performance, not all of which are wholly within our control or known to us. we accept risk is an inherent part principal risks and uncertainties reposition l -band for new growth opportunities capture

specialist employees who have very specific skill sets that are vital to the business. the brexit committee has organised briefing sessions for eu citizen employees and inmarsat is financially supporting residency applications. our board members receive drafts of the annual report in sufficient time to facilitate their review and input. we are aware of the financial reporting council report which encourages the board to address culture, encourage discussion and debate how boards and executive management can steer corporate behaviour to create a culture that will deliver sustainable good performance. the diversity already on our board allows us to be culturally aware and respond where there are areas which need greater focus. at each board meeting there is a detailed report on current trading from the chief executive and chief financial officer and detailed papers are provided on matters where the board will be required to make a decision or give approval. during 2017, the board met eight times, with one of those meetings being held over two days in washington dc. key management are invited to attend all board meetings to present on specific business issues which will include an operations update from each of the business units and central services divisions, covering commercial, technology and operational matters. as noted above and happens in practice, should a director become aware that they have an interest, directly or indirectly, in an existing or proposed transaction with the company, they are required to notify this to the company secretary. number of scheduled

framework for identifying and managing risk, both at an operational and strategic level, is set out on pages 50 and 51 in the strategic report. business plan approval and procurement process procedures also strengthen the review of contractual commitments before any such commitment is agreed to. analysis is undertaken of differences between actual results and the annual budget on a monthly basis. the committee also has responsibility for approving any changes to executive directors including senior management appointments. all currently appointed directors will retire at the 2018 agm and offer themselves for election or re-election as appropriate. each director’s individual experience and background is taken into account in developing a programme tailored to his or her own requirements. as part of their annual performance evaluation, directors are given the opportunity to discuss training and development needs. whilst the chairman takes ultimate responsibility for this, each director is expected to ask about any specific training needs. in appointing non-executive directors, the board’s practice is to use a combination of external consultants and personal referrals. non-executive directors are appointed initially for three years and all non-executive directors may not, unless agreed by the board, remain in office for a period longer than six years, or two terms in office, whichever is the shorter. this company was acquired in 2010 and has been operating under the proxy arrangement since that time. the committee’s terms of reference have been updated to reflect best practice, and can be found on our website. with several significant changes to ifrs reporting being implemented, the committee received detailed briefings and updates from management regarding progress. it presents its reports at each meeting covering updates on internal audit activities, results of audits and follow-up actions required. deferred income in respect of phase 1 from ligado continues to be carried on the balance sheet. › how do these compare with the risks that deloitte plan to include in their audit report? a summary is supplied to the audit committee at each meeting where amounts have been committed below £50,000. furthermore, the chairman, andrew sukawaty, and senior independent director, dr abe peled, are available to shareholders if

pension plans and post-employment benefits in respect of employees. however, tax legislation, especially as it applies to corporate taxes, is not always prescriptive and more than one interpretation of the law may be possible. the tax authorities often have a significant period in which to enquire into these returns after their submission. capitalised borrowing costs the group incurs borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. intangible assets
