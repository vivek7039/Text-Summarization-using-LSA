returns from predominantly industrial property. we also assess other more opportunistic and management intensive acquisitions which, although lower yielding, will provide greater potential for capital growth. our strategy is achieved through a detailed assessment of opportunities in the uk and continental europe. we have 15 of ces with experienced management teams across the uk and our regions in continental europe. his knowledge and experience of continental property markets has been exceptionally valuable to the board. full year dividend 4.2% increase on 2013 15 ofﬁces with experienced management teams 7 annual report and accounts 2014 chairman’s review outlook further improvements in both the occupational and investor markets across all three of our core regions have enabled the business to produce another year of record results. hansteen has a very diverse, high yielding portfolio of light industrial property located across germany, the uk and benelux. however, these levers for growth have now been supported and in some areas outstripped by the extraordinarily low interest rate environment within which we are operating and, more recently the weight of capital buying property for yield. all three regions (uk, germany and benelux) made signi cant contributions to the nancial success in 2014. our management platform now comprises 15 of ces spread across europe which is an enormous asset to the business and an acknowledged market leader at managing this type of property. during that period we acquired £1 .6 billion of property and sold £649.0 million from the owned or co-owned portfolio. this is the ninth consecutive year in which hansteen’s normalised income pro t has increased. as a result the group’s epra net asset value at 31 december 2014 was 102p per share (2013: 91p), an increase of 12.1%. our asset managers are focussed primarily on direct tenant relationships and the marketing of vacant units either for sale or to rent. the closing rent at 31 december 2014 was €67 .2 million per annum, £135.8m increase in total portfolio under management 1,776 new leases and lease renewals 12 hansteen holdings plc joint chief executives’ review and finance report a net improvement of €1 .6 million per annum or a 2.4% improvement in the like-for-like rent roll. there is currently 19.0% of good quality, lettable vacant space which presents a signi cant opportunity to increase income and capital values. the assets are all located in regions which we know well and will be managed by our existing regional teams. netherlands, belgium and france at 31 december 2014, benelux accounted for approximately 20.1% of hansteen’s attributable property investments, increased from 14.2% at 31 december 2013 due to the acquisition of the new portfolio announced in june 2014, referred to in more detail below. 2014 has been a very successful year with signi cant increases in like-for-like rent and occupancy. the french portfolio comprises two properties totalling 56,000 sq m with an annual rent roll of €1 .7 million. in addition, the group has hedged €83.5 million of its expected future net euro income with four options expiring at six monthly intervals between 30 june 2015 and 31 december 2016. these options are to put €83.5 million and call for gbp at varying rates from €1 .3/£1 to €1 .45/£1 with an overall weighted average of €1 .366/£1

rising construction costs and rising house prices, providing a positive backdrop to our activities 20 hansteen holdings plc joint chief executives’ review and finance report principal risks and uncertainties the board recognises that risk management is essential for the group to achieve its objectives. there will always be some risk when undertaking property investments but the control process is aimed at mitigating and minimising these risks where possible. rent deposits or bank guarantees are requested where appropriate to mitigate against the effect of tenant defaults. where possible, purchases are achieved at low capital values and with due investigation of tenant nances. as at 31 december 2014, the composition of hansteen’s employees, including both executive and

current year’s presentation. goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost. cash- generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. the group does not classify those land elements that are held under operating leases as investment property. for such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity. exchange differences arising, if any, are classi ed as equity and transferred to the group’s foreign currency translation reserve. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable pro ts will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. dividends on an afs equity instrument are recognised in pro t or loss when the entity’s right to receive payment is established. group revenue result
