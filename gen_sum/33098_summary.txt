Hansteen’s aim is to provide investors with consistent, high and realised returns from predominantly industrial property. We also assess other more opportunistic and management intensive acquisitions which, although lower yielding, will provide greater potential for capital growth. Our strategy is achieved through a detailed assessment of opportunities in the UK and Continental Europe. We have 15 of ces with experienced management teams across the UK and our regions in Continental Europe. His knowledge and experience of continental property markets has been exceptionally valuable to the Board. Full year dividend 4.2% increase on 2013 15 ofﬁces with experienced management teams 7 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Chairman’s Review OUTLOOK Further improvements in both the occupational and investor markets across all three of our core regions have enabled the business to produce another year of record results. Hansteen has a very diverse, high yielding portfolio of light industrial property located across Germany, the UK and Benelux. However, these levers for growth have now been supported and in some areas outstripped by the extraordinarily low interest rate environment within which we are operating and, more recently the weight of capital buying property for yield. All three regions (UK, Germany and Benelux) made signi cant contributions to the nancial success in 2014. During that period we acquired £1 .6 billion of property and sold £649.0 million from the owned or co-owned portfolio. This is the ninth consecutive year in which Hansteen’s Normalised Income Pro t has increased. As a result the Group’s EPRA Net Asset Value at 31 December 2014 was 102p per share (2013: 91p), an increase of 12.1%. Our asset managers are focussed primarily on direct tenant relationships and the marketing of vacant units either for sale or to rent. The closing rent at 31 December 2014 was €67 .2 million per annum, £135.8m increase in total portfolio under management 1,776 New leases and lease renewals 12 HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC Joint Chief Executives’ Review and Finance Report a net improvement of €1 .6 million per annum or a 2.4% improvement in the like-for-like rent roll. The combined terms equated to an all-in average rate of 3.8% per annum, including fees. There is currently 19.0% of good quality, lettable vacant space which presents a signi cant opportunity to increase income and capital values. The assets are all located in regions which we know well and will be managed by our existing regional teams. Netherlands, Belgium and France At 31 December 2014, Benelux accounted for approximately 20.1% of Hansteen’s attributable property investments, increased from 14.2% at 31 December 2013 due to the acquisition of the new portfolio announced in June 2014, referred to in more detail below. 2014 has been a very successful year with signi cant increases in like-for-like rent and occupancy. The French portfolio comprises two properties totalling 56,000 sq m with an annual rent roll of €1 .7 million. In addition, the Group has hedged €83.5 million of its expected future net Euro income with four options expiring at six monthly intervals between 30 June 2015 and 31 December 2016. We have a high yielding, diverse portfolio of properties valued at substantially below replacement cost. Ian Watson Morgan Jones Richard Lowes Joint Chief Executive 6 March 2015 Joint Chief Executive 6 March 2015 Finance Director 6 March 2015 A strong occupational market, a competitive job market, rising construction costs and rising house prices, providing a positive backdrop to our activities 20 HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC Joint Chief Executives’ Review and Finance Report Principal Risks and Uncertainties The Board recognises that risk management is essential for the Group to achieve its objectives. There will always be some risk when undertaking property investments but the control process is aimed at mitigating and minimising these risks where possible. Rent deposits or bank guarantees are requested where appropriate to mitigate against the effect of tenant defaults. Where possible, purchases are achieved at low capital values and with due investigation of tenant nances. As at 31 December 2014, the composition of Hansteen’s employees, including both Executive and Non-Executive Directors, was as follows: 23 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Corporate and Social Responsibility 24 HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC Financial Statements 2014 25 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Financial Statements Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2014 Group Group 2014 2013 Note £m £m Revenue 5 88.1 83.0 Cost of sales 5 (17 .8) (13.8) Gross pro t 5 70.3 69.2 Other operating income 10 6.8 - Administrative expenses 8 (34.7) (19.8) Share of results of associates 19 43.2 32.4 Operating pro t before gains on investment properties 85.6 81 .8 Pro t on sale of investment properties 3.6 6.1 Fair value gains on investment properties 62.9 12.6 Operating pro t 152.1 100.5 Finance income 11 10.8 6.6 Finance costs 11 (31.7) (41 .8) Pro t before tax 131.2 65.3 Tax 12 (12.8) (7 .3) Pro t for the year 8 1 18.4 58.0 Attributable to: Equity holders of the parent 1 18.3 58.0 Non-controlling interests 0.1 - 1 18.4 58.0 Earnings per share Basic 14 17 .6p 9.1p Diluted 14 17 .0p 9.0p All results derive from continuing operations. 27 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Financial Statements Balance Sheets as at 31 December 2014 Group Group Company Company 2014 2013 2014 2013 Note £m £m £m £m Non-current assets Goodwill 15 0.6 2.3 - - Property, plant and equipment 16 0.5 0.3 - - Investment property 17 953.9 834.9 - - Investment in subsidiary undertakings 18 - - 393.5 372.4 Investment in associates 19 156.4 124.7 - - Deferred tax asset 20 2.4 1 .7 1.7 1 .7 Derivative nancial instruments 21 5.1 0.3 5.1 0.3 1,1 18.9 964.2 400.3 37 4.4 Current assets Investment properties held for sale 17 7 .5 4.6 - - Trading properties 22 6.7 10.1 - - Trade and other receivables 23 25.3 63.3 125.5 169.8 Derivative nancial instruments 21 0.5 1 .6 0.5 1 .6 Cash and cash equivalents 24 1 10.3 57 .8 75.5 28.5 150.3 137 .4 201.5 199.9 Total assets 1,269.2 1,101 .6 601.8 57 4.3 Current liabilities Trade and other payables 25 (34.0) (31 .2) (120.8) (132.5) Current tax liabilities (3.2) (2.1) (0.5) (0.4) Derivative nancial instruments 21 - (0.5) - (0.5) Borrowings 26 (29.2) (125.5) - - Obligations under nance leases 27 (0.1) (0.2) - - (66.5) (159.5) (121.3) (133.4) 28 HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC Financial Statements Group Group Company Company 2014 2013 2014 2013 Note £m £m £m £m Non-current liabilities Borrowings 26 (494.6) (364.4) - - Obligations under nance leases 27 (2.6) (2.9) - - Derivative nancial instruments 21 (5.7) (4.5) (21.4) (20.3) Deferred tax liabilities 20 (23.4) (15.3) - - (526.3) (387 .1) (21.4) (20.3) Total liabilities (592.8) (546.6) (142.7) (153.7) Net assets 676.4 555.0 459.1 420.6 Equity Share capital 28 68.6 64.1 68.6 64.1 Share premium 1 14.4 114.1 1 14.4 114.1 Other reserves (0.5) 0.3 (0.8) - Translation reserves 10.9 32.1 - - Retained earnings 482.6 344.1 276.9 242.4 Equity attributable to equity holders of the parent 676.0 554.7 459.1 420.6 Non-controlling interest 0.4 0.3 - - Total equity 676.4 555.0 459.1 420.6 The nancial statements of Hansteen Holdings PLC, registered number 05605371, were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on 6 March 2015.

Certain comparative amounts have been adjusted where relevant to ensure comparability with the current year’s presentation. Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost. Cash- generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. The Group does not classify those land elements that are held under operating leases as investment property. For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classi ed as equity and transferred to the Group’s foreign currency translation reserve. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable pro ts will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Dividends on an AFS equity instrument are recognised in pro t or loss when the entity’s right to receive payment is established. A segment’s result consists of its gross pro t as detailed for the Group in note 5.

Properties classi ed as held for sale at 31 December 2014 represent properties that were actively marketed as at the year end and have subsequently been sold, or agreements for their sale have been entered into. The Group also acquired additional units in Hansteen UK Industrial Property II Limited Partnership, retaining its holding of 33.3%. Hansteen Saltley Unit Trust retained one property before disposing of the remaining portfolio by selling its investment in HPUT . The target for the bonus is that EPRA NAV per ordinary share (after adding back dividends and other returns to shareholders) must exceed a compound growth rate of 10% per annum in a three-year period. It is expected that a bonus share award will be earned for the current performance period. Performance targets are based on Total Shareholder Return and Net Asset Value growth, plus dividends, relative to a peer group of listed UK REITs.

Throughout our audit work we were alert to signi cant non-recurring transactions, in addition to completing a review of legal correspondence and Board meeting minutes, to assess whether the list of these transactions we considered was complete • For all signi cant non-recurring transactions, we assessed whether: o each transaction was accounted for in compliance with IFRS; o each transaction was accurately recorded by agreeing the value to underlying documentation; o the underlying assumptions and judgements in the measurement of each transaction were appropriate; and o each transaction was fairly presented and disclosed in the nancial statements. Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the nancial statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. 89 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Financial Statements Matters on which we are required to report by exception ADEQUACY OF EXPLANATIONS RECEIVED AND ACCOUNTING RECORDS DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT OUR DUTY TO READ OTHER INFORMATION IN THE ANNUAL REPORT Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: • we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or • adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or • the parent company nancial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
