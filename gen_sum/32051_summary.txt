This is the Group’s first full financial year as a public company and we have continued to make great progress by further expanding Joules as a premium lifestyle brand across product categories, distribution channels and geographic markets. NEIL MCCAUSLAND Chairman Chairman’s Statement 9 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STRATEGIC REPORT FY17 was another very exciting year for Joules as the brand continued to expand across distribution channels and product categories both in the UK and internationally. Prior periods are restated to exclude customers registered via third party websites and for data cleansing enhancements. Our financial KPIs, and their rationale, are: • Revenue by channel - delivering balanced growth across our core sales channels • Group gross margin - maintaining overall product level profitability whilst developing international wholesale markets • EBITDA margin – how effectively we are leveraging our cost base and infrastructure • Return on Capital Employed (‘ROCE’) – how we are managing working capital and growth capital investments FY14 FY15 2 FY16 FY17 STORES E - COMMERCE WHOLESALE 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 56.0 55.5 55.0 54.5 54.0 53.5 53.0 52.5 52.0 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 55.0% 53.3% 23.9% 27.3% 31.9% 32.2% 53.5% 55.4% 39.3 23.9 26.9 52.4 25.8 31.6 58.2 68.3 30.1 38.9 37.2 44.8 FY14 FY14 FY14 FY15 FY15 FY15 FY16 FY17 UNDERLYING EBITDA MARGIN % 11.0 10.5 10.0 9.5 9.0 8.5 8.0 9.5% 10.3% 10.8% 9.0% FY14 FY15 FY16 FY17 FY16 FY17 FY17 FINANCIAL KPIs RETAIL: MULTI-CHANNEL PROGRESS Retail sales, which includes stores, e-commerce and shows, grew by an impressive 19.4% during the year (19.4% in constant currency). This reflected good growth from both stores and e-commerce, which increased by 29.4% to now represent 34.8% of total retail revenue (FY16: 32.1%). This expansion was in line with our previous guidance of 10-12 net new stores for the year. This growth was underpinned by our proprietary hand-drawn prints, colour and British character as the Joules brand continues to resonate in international markets. Notable highlights in the year included our colourful ponchos, fun applique tops and beautifully designed dresses. It is an important step to support the next phase of growth whilst solidifying our local roots and heritage. Sales in International markets, which are predominantly Wholesale, increased by 36.2% (29.6% on a constant currency basis) and now represent 11.5% of Group revenues (FY16: 10.1%). Within the Retail segment, gross margin benefited from our increased focus on optimising full price sales and promotional activity. Subsequent to the year-end, this facility was extended by 14 months and now matures in July 2021. The acquisition was part financed through a new £3.5 million, five-year term loan facility arranged with Barclays Bank Plc. A deterioration in the UK economy may adversely impact consumer confidence and spending on discretionary items. In addition, the property portfolio has short lease terms, providing relative flexibility to close or relocate stores should it become necessary. Without mitigation, input costs may fluctuate in the short term, creating uncertainty as to profits and cash flows. A dedicated programme team with significant experience of our business processes and ERP implementation has been established. Each director has responsibility for one element of our Responsibly Joules framework and is supported by a team from across the business. This approach is enabling us to raise the profile of Responsibly Joules and increase employee engagement. This year we ran an employee auction and raffle to raise money for The Prince’s Trust. It’s been great to see so many teams at Joules driving our partnership across stores and engaging customers. In deciding who to partner with, the environmental credentials of these partners are an important factor. Our UK logistics partners have strong commitments in place to continuously improve their environmental performance. “Joules have shown real passion and enthusiasm for giving back to their local communities through our Team Challenge programme. The Listening Groups allow us to gather views on all aspects of working at Joules. We also strive to provide ongoing training, career development and promotion opportunities for all employees. In the unfortunate event that an employee should become disabled we are committed to continuing their employment and for arranging appropriate training. Now a global lifestyle brand, in his current role, Tom is focused on connecting with the Joules customer and category product direction. He has many years experience as a director of companies in the UK retail sector. David is a chartered accountant, having spent the early part of his career with KPMG. Prior to this Colin spent over 10 years at House of Fraser, becoming Commercial Director on the main board. Colin has also held a number of senior positions within the retail sector including at Etam, Laura Ashley and Arcadia. Jill is currently the Senior Non-Executive Director of Shaftesbury plc and previously chaired their remuneration committee. BOARD OF DIRECTORS JOULES GROUP PLC 30 Corporate Governance CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION I have pleasure in introducing the Joules Group plc Corporate Governance Statement, our second since our admittance to trading on AIM on 26 May 2016. GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK JOULES GROUP PLC Directors are aware of their right to have any concerns recorded in the board minutes. The Company Secretary also ensures that any feedback or suggestions for improvement on board papers is fed back to management. Each Committee has written terms of reference setting out its duties, authority and reporting responsibilities, with copies available on the Company’s website (www. He sets the Board agenda and ensures that sufficient time is allocated to important matters, in particular, strategic issues. There has been no change in the Chairman’s other time commitments since his appointment. However, any such system of internal control can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders if they have any concerns which fail to be resolved through normal contact channels of the Chairman, Chief Executive or other Executive Directors or when such contact channels are inappropriate. Whistleblowing is a standing item on the Committee’s agenda, and updates will be provided at each meeting. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing financial statements. The Committee has discretion to amend pay-outs should any formulaic output not reflect their assessment of performance. Stretching performance targets are set each year by the Committee, taking into account a number of different factors. The Committee’s intention is that such awards would be made on a ‘like-for-like’ basis as those forfeited. All Non-Executive Directors have initial fixed term agreements with the Group for no more than three years. Details of the Directors’ service contracts, are set out below: NAME T S Joule C N Porter M S Dench N W McCausland J C Little D A Stead CONSULTATION WITH SHAREHOLDERS The Committee will consider shareholder feedback received on remuneration matters including issues raised at the AGM as well as any additional comments received during any other meeting with shareholders. Annual bonus is subject to the achievement of stretching PBT performance targets, with payment made 50% in cash and 50% deferred into shares (vesting after a further three years). For M S Dench payment will be 33% cash and 67% deferred into shares (vesting after a further three years). LONG-TERM INCENTIVES There were no LTIP awards due to vest in respect of the year ended 28 May 2017. Details of employee involvement are set out in the Social Responsibility Report on pages 24 and 27.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Segment results before exceptional items are used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the performance of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.
