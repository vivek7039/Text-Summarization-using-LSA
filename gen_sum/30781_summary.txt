Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Corero Network Security plc A leader in real-time,   high performance,  DDoS protection. Attackers are continuing to  leverage DDoS attacks as part of  their cyber-threat arsenal to  either disrupt business  operations or provide a  smokescreen while they access  sensitive corporate information,  and they are doing it in  increasingly creative ways that  circumvent traditional security  solutions or reduce the previous  effectiveness of DDoS scrubbing  centres. Operating highlights    • Strong performance of flagship  SmartWall product • Existing customer add-on orders up  320% over the prior year • High customer delight with >95%  renewal rates for support and services • First two $1.0 million customers • Encouraging uptake of DDoS  protection as-a-service (launched in  late 2016) Revenue $8.5m as contribution from   legacy products   reduced as expected   (2016: $8.8 million) *	 	 c ompr is es	the	oper a tin g	loss	less	unr ealis e d	f or eign	e x chan g e	differ enc es	on	an	in ter c ompan y	loan,	  depr ecia tion,	amor tisa tion	and	impairmen t	of	g oodwill.

Corero Network Security plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 06 Operating performance against strategy Our performance against our 2017 strategic objectives is summarised below: • Establish SmartWall as the leading solution for real-time DDoS mitigation:   Continued progress in growing our customer base to 90 customers and the  addition of a number of high profile customers including Corero’s first US  federal government customer, two one million dollar customers, first  Australian customer and first potentially significant revenue share contract  with a Tier 1 service provider. • New products to address the evolving requirements of the target market:   Corero further enhanced its market leading SmartWall product portfolio in  2017 with the deliverables from a two-year development program with a new  SmartWall 100Gbps capable product to capture growth in customer demand  for 100Gbps connectivity and SmartWall virtual software appliance to capture  demand for hybrid on-premises / Cloud DDoS mitigation deployments. In  2017, Corero signed agreements with major global technology companies  including Juniper Networks, Gigamon, and McAfee. The technology alliance  partnership with Juniper Networks, a US based multinational corporation that  develops and markets networking and security products, has provided benefits  in 2017 with the opportunity for Corero to expand its market reach by  leveraging Juniper Networks’ global footprint. In addition, Corero also  expanded its ecosystem of world class partners and introduced an enhanced product  portfolio. Strategic Report Financial Statements Governance Corporate Directory 09 A wide range of critical cyber-security  issues face every Internet connected  enterprise or organisation. The broad range of motivations for  executing a DDoS attack, coupled with  the relative ease with which they can be  performed, means that they are carried  out by a variety of actors, including  criminal gangs, activists, terrorist groups  and nation state “bad actors”. (Source: NetScout  Arbor’s 13th Annual Worldwide  Security Report, October 2017) • Attack sizes have generally risen, but  half average less than 10Gbps which  reveals determined targeting.

Far from being a marketing gimmick,  delivering on customer delight simply  makes good business sense. The science behind this  tool is consistent with that promoted by  Bain Consulting’s Net Promoter Score®  (“NPS”). At Corero, we do not explicitly  track NPS as each customer relationship  is important to us. In turn, the efforts  of our direct and channel sales teams are  focussed upon persuading these  Prospects to become “Customers”. A widespread wave of RDoS threats from the Phantom Squad hacker group  kicked off in September. KEY INSIGHT This extortion campaign launched messages  demanding Bitcoin payment, with a threat to  execute attacks on September 30 unless the  demands were met. It could mean monetary fines for CNI  organisations that experience service outages  due to a cyber-attack. Regulations and compliance KEY INSIGHT Over a third of CNI organisations in the UK (39%)  have not completed basic cyber-security standards. • Freedom of Information data reveals lack of  cyber-resilience among Critical National   Infrastructure (“CNI”) organisations • CNI organisations could be ignoring 90% of  the DDoS attacks on their networks by not  mitigating short duration DDoS attacks, which  are frequently used by hackers to distract from  data theft attempts Corero Network Security plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 16 Corero is dependent on revenue growth to deliver on its strategy. Corero is an emerging player  in the DDoS prevention  market and competes with  much larger organisations. If Corero is not successful in  connecting with the market  and raising its profile this will  compromise growth plans. If Corero is unable  to recruit and retain the right  skills this will compromise  growth plans.

Corero Network Security plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 22 Overview The cyber-security and DDoS market  growth fundamentals remain very strong,  fuelled by rampant cyber-crime and a  growing awareness of the significant threat  posed by cyber-attacks, including DDoS, as  well as pending regulations.

There is  also a procedure in place for any Director to  take independent professional advice if  necessary, at the Company’s expense.

Hardware and Software Products When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as combined hardware and software products, licenses and/or  services, the Group allocates revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy, having evaluated each deliverable in   an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting. The TPE of selling  price is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly  situated customers. 2.7 Cost of sales Cost of sales includes all direct costs associated with revenue generation, including goods directly related to revenue, services  delivery, operation costs, DDoS as-a-service depreciation and amounts charged by external third parties for services. Expenditure not meeting these criteria is expensed in the Statement of Comprehensive Income – Profit and Loss. After initial recognition, internally generated intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any  impairment losses. All other costs are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income – Profit and Loss as incurred. 2.12 Impairment At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that its assets have been impaired. Using the balance sheet liability method, deferred tax liabilities are recognised in full for all taxable temporary differences and  deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible  temporary differences can be utilised. The related funding is shown as a financial liability and accounted for on an amortised cost basis. Analysis includes  grouping similar deals based on qualitative factors such as customer profile, size, and region followed by quantitative  comparison to the then current BESP. Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s single cash-generating unit (“CGU”) Corero Network Security (“CNS”). The recoverable amount for the CNS CGU was determined based on a discounted cash flow calculation to calculate fair values  less costs to sell using cash flow projections over a 10 year period (2016: 10 year period). None of the Company’s trade and other receivables are secured by collateral or credit enhancements. This Equity Fund Raise is subject to shareholder  approval at a general meeting of the Company.
