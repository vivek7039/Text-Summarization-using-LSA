The Company considers this a useful additional  measure to help understand underlying factors  driving revenue in terms of volumes sold and  realised prices. WE SEEK TO CREATE VALUE FOR  STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS PRECIOUS  METAL CYCLES, FOCUSING ON HIGH- POTENTIAL SILVER AND GOLD PROJECTS  THAT CAN BE DEVELOPED INTO LOW  COST, WORLD-CLASS MINES. These include lower  grades, access to land, environmental  demands, social pressures and  growing complexities in the permitting  processes, among others. FOR OUR MARKETS SEE PAGES 14-17 FOR THE FINANCIAL REVIEW SEE PAGES 104-115 CONSISTENT DIVIDEND POLICY Fresnillo plc’s dividend policy is   closely aligned with our focus on  creating value through growth and  returns, and is based on paying out  33-50% of profit after tax each year,  with certain adjustments made to  exclude non-cash effects in the income  statement. There were a number of key  operational developments during the  year, but here I would like to focus on  two in particular . We have  taken a number of corrective steps   to address these issues, including:  strengthening our operational leadership  team; improving contractor efficiency;  and eliminating bottlenecks caused by  inefficient working practices. Contractor staff do not always display   a consistent focus on safety and lack  sufficient training due to frequent  rotation of personnel. While volatility in exchange rates or  precious metals prices may present  short-term challenges, we anticipate  further growth and returns over the  longer term. Q&A WITH THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE CONSISTENT STRATEGY,  CONSISTENT PERFORMANCE KEY POINTS On track to deliver commitments  made at time of IPO New objectives due to be  announced in summer 2018 Silver production up 16.6%,   gold production down 2.6%  Improved performance   at Fresnillo  Phase II at San Julián  commissioned as planned Silver resources up by 6.9%,  gold resources remained stable Silver reserves down by 5.4%,  gold reserves up by 22.7% Improvement in health   and safety A challenging year ahead but we  face the future with confidence I AM DELIGHTED TO REPORT THAT 2017 WAS   ANOTHER GOOD YEAR FOR FRESNILLO. In last year’s report I referred to a  comprehensive review of how IT can be  the springboard for improved efficiency. We  have identified significant opportunities  at Pilarica and expect this to become  our first operational mine outside  Mexico in the medium term. Inflationary pressures are likely to  increase and it is unclear whether  precious metals prices have already  bottomed out or may drift lower . In conclusion, I would like to thank   our people, communities, suppliers,  clients and shareholders for their  continued support during the last year . As  existing mines move towards the end of  their lives, miners will increasingly rely  on lower grade deposits or those with  more complex metallurgy. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FRESNILLO Our strategy has always been to   invest across all price cycles, while  maintaining a strong balance sheet.

These include:  • A permanent effort to reinforce our safety culture,  comprising the following programmes: ‘Rules that Save  Lives’, ‘Operational Discipline’ and ‘Behavioural Change’,  supported by comprehensive accident investigation. Certain groups may also attempt to exploit vulnerabilities  created by the industry’s heavy reliance on operational  automated systems and IT  1 . We do this by providing a healthy, safe,  productive and team-oriented working environment that  not only encourages our people to fulfil their potential but  also supports process improvements.

During his career,  Mr Bordes has held  both senior executive  management roles and  board responsibilities with  companies spanning a  number of different sectors,  particularly within Mexico.

Key external assumptions  used in management’s  estimate of the recoverable  values of mining assets • Working with our valuation specialists we have assessed management’s assumptions   relating to future metals prices and discount rates, comparing these to market data and   also for consistency with other estimates used in the financial statements. For certain procedures, in particular areas  involving significant judgement and heightened audit risk, we performed work ourselves with support where required from the  component team. • In January 2017, we identified that non-audit services related to December 2016 prohibited under the new FRC Ethical  Standard had been undertaken. 186 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 CONSOLIDATED
