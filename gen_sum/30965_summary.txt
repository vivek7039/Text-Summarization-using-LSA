the company considers this a useful additional measure to help understand underlying factors driving revenue in terms of volumes sold and realised prices. we seek to create value for stakeholders across precious metal cycles, focusing on high- potential silver and gold projects that can be developed into low cost, world-class mines. these include lower grades, access to land, environmental demands, social pressures and growing complexities in the permitting processes, among others. for our markets see pages 14-17 for the financial review see pages 104-115 consistent dividend policy fresnillo plc’s dividend policy is closely aligned with our focus on creating value through growth and returns, and is based on paying out 33-50% of profit after tax each year, with certain adjustments made to exclude non-cash effects in the income statement. we have taken a number of corrective steps to address these issues, including: strengthening our operational leadership team; improving contractor efficiency; and eliminating bottlenecks caused by inefficient working practices. contractor staff do not always display a consistent focus on safety and lack sufficient training due to frequent rotation of personnel. while volatility in exchange rates or precious metals prices may present short-term challenges, we anticipate further growth and returns over the longer term. q&a with the chief executive consistent strategy, consistent performance key points on track to deliver commitments made at time of ipo new objectives due to be announced in summer 2018 silver production up 16.6%, gold production down 2.6% improved performance at fresnillo phase ii at san julián commissioned as planned silver resources up by 6.9%, gold resources remained stable silver reserves down by 5.4%, gold reserves up by 22.7% improvement in health and safety a challenging year ahead but we face the future with confidence i am delighted to report that 2017 was another good year for fresnillo. in last year’s report i referred to a comprehensive review of how it can be the springboard for improved efficiency. we have identified significant opportunities at pilarica and expect this to become our first operational mine outside mexico in the medium term. however, that said, our people have worked successfully in similar market environments before and will undoubtedly do so again. in conclusion, i would like to thank our people, communities, suppliers, clients and shareholders for their continued support during the last year . as existing mines move towards the end of their lives, miners will increasingly rely on lower grade deposits or those with more complex metallurgy. the opportunity for fresnillo our strategy has always been to invest across all price cycles, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. 1 world gold council – data from 2017. gold demand by sector 1 (tonnes) jewellery 52% (2,135.5) investment 30% (1,231.9) central banks & other
