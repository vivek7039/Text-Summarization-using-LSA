the company considers this a useful additional measure to help understand underlying factors driving revenue in terms of volumes sold and realised prices. together, these strengths have combined to support a long-established track record of creating value through growth and returns. we are a ftse 100 company, with shares trading on the london and mexican stock exchanges. we seek to create value for stakeholders across precious metal cycles, focusing on high- potential silver and gold projects that can be developed into low cost, world-class mines. 04 fresnillo plc annual report and accounts 2017 04 fresnillo plc annual report and accounts 2017 chairman’s statement ten years of creating value through growth and returns although the group has a history stretching back over a century, fresnillo only became a listed company in 2008. today, as we stand on the brink of our second decade, we can look back on our achievements with justifiable pride. these include lower grades, access to land, environmental demands, social pressures and growing complexities in the permitting processes, among others. key points adjusted revenue +9.2% increased profitability (gross profit +4.9%, profit for the period +32.0%) dividends paid in 2017 of us$236.6 million, up 168.2% strong corporate governance increased gender diversity at board level further growth and returns anticipated 2017: a year of progress 2017 has again proved the importance of a consistent, conservative long-term strategy based primarily on organic growth, developed and implemented by a committed professional team and fully supported by the board. for our markets see pages 14-17 for the financial review see pages 104-115 consistent dividend policy fresnillo plc’s dividend policy is closely aligned with our focus on creating value through growth and returns, and is based on paying out 33-50% of profit after tax each year, with certain adjustments made to exclude non-cash effects in the income statement. we have taken a number of corrective steps to address these issues, including: strengthening our operational leadership team; improving contractor efficiency; and eliminating bottlenecks caused by inefficient working practices. however, it is clear that there remains much work to do, particularly where contractors are concerned. contractor staff do not always display a consistent focus on safety and lack sufficient training due to frequent rotation of personnel. during the year we took decisive steps to engage them in our health and safety culture. our focus will once again be on efficiency and cost control to underpin projects, ongoing performance improvements at fresnillo, increased production at san julián, development of juanicipio and the continued evaluation of the orisyvo gold project. on behalf of the board and shareholders i want to express my gratitude for their efforts. while volatility in exchange rates or precious metals prices may present short-term challenges, we anticipate further growth and returns over the longer term. alberto baillères non-executive chairman throughout 2017, our people again showed the skills and professionalism needed to overcome challenges. our case studies on pages 13, 27, 53 and 73 explain in more detail how san julián has evolved from idea to reality... from a possibility based on geological expertise into a key project that will contribute to the future performance of fresnillo. indeed, this is something that we have seen many of our peers do over the last decade. at the same time, the year saw a significant increase in prices for base metals, which are by-products of our silver and gold production processes, and this upward trend made a positive contribution towards our overall financial performance. our proven ability to perform in all price environments is important, given the unpredictable nature of prices. q&a with the chief executive consistent strategy, consistent performance key points on track to deliver commitments made at time of ipo new objectives due to be announced in summer 2018 silver production up 16.6%, gold production down 2.6% improved performance at fresnillo phase ii at san julián commissioned as planned silver resources up by 6.9%, gold resources remained stable silver reserves down by 5.4%, gold reserves up by 22.7% improvement in health and safety a challenging year ahead but we face the future with confidence i am delighted to report that 2017 was another good year for fresnillo. in last year’s report i referred to a comprehensive review of how it can be the springboard for improved efficiency. for our operational kpis see pages 28-29 q – how have you delivered growth through development projects? we have identified significant opportunities at pilarica and expect this to become our first operational mine outside mexico in the medium term. under this new approach, which we plan to roll out across our other operations in the coming months, our people are encouraged to report each incident within a fixed time frame, no matter how minor and with a full description. a – while we are forecasting that all our operations will perform at their maximum levels, we nonetheless anticipate a challenging year in 2018. inflationary pressures are likely to increase and it is unclear whether precious metals prices have already bottomed out or may drift lower . however, that said, our people have worked successfully in similar market environments before and will undoubtedly do so again. in conclusion, i would like to thank our people, communities, suppliers, clients and shareholders for their continued support during the last year . during 2017, we invested over us$30.9 million in our hsecr initiatives, up 41% compared with the previous year . however, silver production as a by-product of base metal mining is likely to grow, as producers increase activity in response to recent hikes in the prices of lead and zinc (up 22.4% and 30.5%, respectively, for the 12 months ending 31 december 2017). as existing mines move towards the end of their lives, miners will increasingly rely on lower grade deposits or those with more complex metallurgy. the opportunity for fresnillo our strategy has always been to invest across all price cycles, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. this dual focus is a key differentiator for fresnillo – it has enabled us to build a solid business that provides consistently high returns for investors and, at the same time, increase our mineral resources and production profiles. 1 world

lower than in recent times. these events include: • a decrease in precious metal prices, which is the primary driver for this risk. response/mitigation our hedging policy remains guided by the principle of providing shareholders with full exposure to gold and silver prices. • refusal to acknowledge prior land acquisition terms and conditions by members of an agrarian community. • always seeking tri-party cooperation between the government, community and ourselves in securing access to land. such measures include, whenever possible, negotiating with agrarian communities for the outright purchase of land. we remain compliant with all applicable environmental regulations and are fully committed to operating in a sustainable way. although mexico’s mining law does not yet incorporate indigenous consultation, it remains an ongoing issue. key risk indicators • total number of security incidents affecting our workforce (thefts, kidnapping, extortion, etc.).

continued to build on our good relations with unions at national and local levels, and we do not expect an increase in this perceived level of risk. these initiatives include the safety guardians programme, alliances for obtaining certifications, integration of high productivity teams and family activities. during the year, we held six leadership workshops which were attended by 150 key union leaders at our business units. our objectives for 2018 include a budgeted risk capital investment in exploration of approximately us$200 million. during 2017 we slightly increased our land concessions by 13,133 hectares, which are located in areas of interest to fresnillo. certain groups may also attempt to exploit vulnerabilities created by the industry’s heavy reliance on operational automated systems and it 1 . we do this by providing a healthy, safe, productive and team-oriented working environment that not only encourages our people to fulfil their potential but also supports process improvements. based on available information, we did not see a change in this perceived risk level. this is important, given that our business activities cover the full value chain from exploration to mine operation. • ‘potential actions by the government’ which could include a delay in obtaining permits and/or new restrictive regulations. it is currently anticipated that all or part of these us$800 million will be refinanced. this resulted in our current cash balances reducing over time but maintaining ample liquidity throughout the period. at the same time, we have identified and are addressing our gaps in cyber security. continued investment in 2017 the implementation of key technologies has helped us take great strides towards safer and more productive operations. 2017 also saw

indirectly through collaboration and leverage. this involves senior executives delivering seminars throughout the year as a mechanism to engage and mobilise our people. however, while management can establish and promote safety-led processes, the everyday behaviour of workers themselves remains a key factor in reducing incidents. key activities: • ensure that every employee entering the workforce

movements in variables discussed below, give rise to large, albeit non- cash, income or expense amounts in our income statement. there is a risk that related party relationships could be taken advantage of to manipulate earnings or otherwise distort our financial position. variables considered the audit committee considers whether the company continues to have a robust process to ensure that all required legal documentation is completed correctly on acquisition of land titles particularly in light of litigation and ejido activity. these issues are not pervasive throughout the group’s

of less than 10% over 2017, made up from inflation and additional service levels required offset by operational efficiencies. nevertheless, the audit committee, from its own evaluation, identified that there were areas which warranted further review in 2018. the company also attends a full programme of mining conferences in order to meet with current and prospective investors. the chief

been performed for the specific project. 199 fresnillo plc annual report and accounts 2017 fresnillo today strategic report corporate governance financial statements stripping activity costs associated with such development activities are capitalised into existing mining development assets, as mining properties and development cost, within property, plant and equipment, using a measure that considers the volume of waste extracted compared with expected volume, for a given volume of ore production. at each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indications of impairment. after initial measurement, such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment. operating materials and spare parts are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. an allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventories is determined by reference to specific items of stock. a regular review is undertaken by management to determine the extent of such an allowance. 203 fresnillo plc annual report and accounts 2017 fresnillo today strategic report corporate governance financial statements

to the initial estimate of metal content are recorded in revenue once they have been determined. unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. 207

asset. fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in notes 30 and 31. fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability

fresnillo plc annual report and accounts 2017 1. corporate information fresnillo plc (the ’company’) is a public limited company and registered in england and wales with registered number 6344120 and is the holding company for the fresnillo subsidiaries detailed in note 5. the company is a mexican resident for taxation purposes with tax residency in mexico city. these accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated. under ifrs 9, gains and losses accumulated in oci are not recycled to the income statement. notes to the parent company financial statements 249 fresnillo plc annual report and accounts 2017 fresnillo today strategic report corporate governance financial statements impairment ifrs 9 requires the company to now use an expected credit loss model for its trade receivables measured at amortised cost, either on a 12-month or lifetime basis. these amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2019 and earlier application is permitted. the company is working to identify potential uncertainties based on previous resolutions of tax authorities. where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, an assessment is made at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. after initial measurement such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment. revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes. unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in notes 17 and 18. fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. dividends paid that exceed cufin are subject to an income tax payable at a rate of 30%. dividends paid from earnings previously taxed are not subject to any withholding or additional tax payment. (d) corporate income tax (‘impuesto sobre la renta’ or ‘isr’) the company is a mexican resident for taxation purposes. 5. investments in subsidiaries year ended 31 december 2017 us$ thousands 2016 us$ thousands opening balance 6,957,858 5,943,889 reversal of impairment 102,789 997,915 additions 33,484 20,582 return of share capital – (4,528) closing balance 7,094,131 6,957,858 during 2017 and 2016 the company has identified some indicators which have caused management to reverse previously recognised impairment losses on its investments in subsidiaries. the company has calculated the recoverable amount of its investments in subsidiaries as at 31 december 2017 and as a result has recognised a reversal of previously recognised impairment loss amounting to us$102.8 million (2016: us$997.9 million). the following tables provide relevant information in respect of each impaired subsidiary: year ended 31 december 2017 current year impairment reversal us$ thousand cumulative impairment us$ thousand recoverable amount us$ thousands discount rate minera fresnillo, s.a. de c.v.
