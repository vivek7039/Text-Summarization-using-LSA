Previously  coverage was managed through state or  regional representatives, which led to some  inconsistencies in service depending on location. At the end of 2019 the AmesburyTruth manufacturing footprint, excluding the Bilco and Ashland sites, is expected to be as follows: Centres of excellence Satellite sites Juarez, Mexico Cannon Falls, Minnesota Owatonna, Minnesota Fremont, Nebraska Sioux Falls, South Dakota Toronto, Canada Statesville, North Carolina Footprint project financials US$’m Inception to date 2018 Forecast 2019 Estimate 2020 Estimate P&L charge 1 17.3 3.0 2.0 1.5 Operational expenditure 2 10.7 5.5 7.5 1.0 Capital expenditure 12.7 1.5 1.5 — Cash receipts 3 (2.1) (1.4) — — Total cash costs 21.3 5.6 9.0 1.0 Total cumulative cash costs 21.3 26.9 35.9 36.9 Incremental P&L saving — 2.0 3.0 5.0 Cumulative annual P&L saving — 2.0 5.0 10.0 1 P&L charge comprises exceptional items incurred and to be incurred in connection with the footprint project. On  a reported basis, Revenue increased by  10.0 per cent, principally due to the incremental  contributions from Bilco UK and Howe Green. The 2016  comparator margin benefited from currency  hedges put in place at a time when Sterling  was significantly stronger against international  currencies. The Division made further progress in  distribution with incremental listings secured  at both existing and new customers. SchlegelGiesse expects that Continental  European markets will show broad-based  incremental growth in 2018 and is well  placed to take further market share. China and Asia Pacific  markets are likely to remain variable with  opportunities for growth in certain countries. As this credit is  exceptional in nature it has been excluded  from the Group’s Underlying tax charge. This treatment is, however, broadly  dependent on sufficient eligible  taxable profits being generated in  the relevant jurisdiction. Over the past five  years, a period which has seen significant  capital investment made in the Group,  Operating Cash Conversion has averaged  92.9 per cent and each Division remains  targeted on delivery of 100.0 per cent cash  conversion of Underlying Operating Profit. 2018 cash taxation rates are expected to  be broadly in line with the Group’s 2018  Underlying effective tax rate.

The Group aims to minimise the impact of  aggressive pricing by competitors through  a low-cost manufacturing strategy  supported by its programmes of new  product development, continual process  improvements and building long term  relationships with its customers based on  value, quality, service and added value  technical support. Mitigation Each Division develops strategic customer  plans which include high level engagement  through business review meetings to identify  service issues and product development  opportunities on a timely basis. In  response, the Group will increase selling  prices or apply surcharges to recover  unavoidable input cost increases. Tyman, after  undertaking mitigating actions,  should be able to withstand the  impact of these severe but  plausible scenarios. AmesburyTruth continued its  tuition reimbursement programme where  employees can pursue a degree course  which is directly related to their employment. At present, there is no legal  requirement for any one of these employing  companies to publish their pay differential  data. A number of initiatives  are underway, including engagement with  all employees to develop an improved health  and safety culture in this facility. Follow-up facility audits have been carried  out by an external third party at five sites,  with recommended actions being taken. This measurement is used to provide focus  on one of the Group’s key performance  measures, process scrutiny. Emission sources  falling outside the Group’s operational  control and other Scope 3 emissions have  not been collated or reported. Angelika  has also worked as a management  consultant for several years with  The Boston Consulting Group  and Alix Partners GmbH. He was  previously a director in the investment banking  division of Citigroup, having also worked for HSBC  and Ernst & Young. Previous roles include senior management  positions with Pilkington plc, BP Chemicals,  Sentrachem Ltd (South Africa) and Kingspan  Group. Prior to this, he worked  at Datamonitor plc from July 2005 as group  financial controller and company secretary. If thought appropriate, Directors may obtain  independent professional advice in respect  of their responsibilities, at the Company’s  expense. During late October, the Board also visited  two plants in Juarez, Mexico, where they met  local management teams and were able to  make first hand assessments of progress  being made following recent expansion. Presentations were received from Jeff Graby  and his senior management team during  the Board visit to Juarez, Mexico. Feedback from these events, meetings with  shareholders and analysts’ reports are  provided to the Board at each meeting. The website permits users to download  copies of published financial reports,  presentations, press releases and stock  exchange announcements. An annual  schedule of Committee activity is set out a  year in advance, to provide the appropriate  focus on key priorities. It was also recommended that representatives  from BDO should attend the Committee  meetings on a more frequent basis. In light of the Group’s growth and increasing  footprint, a five-year internal audit strategic  plan has been developed, covering all  subsidiaries. Acquisitions during 2017 have been smaller and less  complex than previous years so this is not considered to  be significant. Executive Directors As disclosed in the Group’s half year results  announcement in July 2017, as part of  normal Board succession planning, the  Committee decided that James Brotherton’s  role should be enhanced with exposure  to additional areas of experience,  particularly strategy. Accordingly, it was agreed that  James Brotherton would take Board  responsibility for Group strategy, corporate  development and M&A, in addition to his  existing duties as Chief Financial Officer. Accordingly,  James Brotherton, Helen Clatworthy,  Louis Eperjesi, Mark Rollins and Martin Towers  will offer themselves for re-election at the  2017 AGM. As this is Pamela Bingham’s  first year of appointment, she will offer  herself for election to the Board. The Executive Directors’ salaries are  set having regard to typical pay levels  at companies of a similar size,  internationality and complexity. Details of any payments  to former Directors, where required by relevant regulations, will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise. The majority  will be based on clear financial targets that include a significant weighting towards profit and cash generation as, when combined, these are  often strong indicators of sustainable growth. These measures  align with the Company’s goal of value creation for shareholder through financial growth and above market returns. All Non-executive Directors are required to undertake that they will submit themselves for  re-election at each Annual General Meeting occurring during their term of office and no Non-executive Director will serve more than three  terms of three years without prior shareholder approval. 84% of Group underlying operating profit before taxation  accounted for by the reporting units where full scope audit work performed. Where management’s growth assumptions  were in excess of these external forecasts, we evaluated  management’s rationale, being the benefit of acquisition synergies  and restructuring activities undertaken and as a result, we considered  the forecasts to have been prepared on a supportable basis. There is also a small amount recognised in relation to the write off  of inventory fair value adjustments. Revenue represents the amounts receivable for goods  supplied, stated net of discounts, returns, rebates and value-added taxes. All other centrally  incurred costs and eliminations are disclosed as a separate line item in the segment analysis. Cash flow projections, which have been reviewed and approved by the Board, are derived from five-year forecasts produced by each Division  comprised of a detailed bottom up budget for 2018 and a forecast, based on the Division’s strategic plan for 2019 to 2022. Management assesses the credit quality of  customers taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. Derivatives shown at fair value in the balance sheet have been valued by reference to level 2 techniques described above. This amount is usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of  service and compensation. The fair value of awards  granted under LTIP is measured using a probability model to predict target EPS levels. 1 Brazil Building products Alameda Itatinga, 617 Galpoa 2, Bairro Joapiranga II, CEP13278-480, Cidade Valinhos,   Estado de Sao Paolo Schlegel América Do Sul Vedação Para Construção Civil Ltda.
