through state or regional representatives, which led to some inconsistencies in service depending on location. at the end of 2019 the amesburytruth manufacturing footprint, excluding the bilco and

against international currencies. schlegelgiesse expects that continental european markets will show broad-based incremental growth in 2018 and is well placed to take further market share. as this

competitors through a low-cost manufacturing strategy supported by its programmes of new product development, continual process improvements and building long term relationships with its customers based on value, quality, service and added value technical support. mitigation each division develops strategic customer plans which include high level engagement through business review meetings to identify service issues and product development opportunities on a timely basis. amesburytruth continued its tuition reimbursement programme where employees can pursue a degree course which is directly related to their employment. at present, there is no legal requirement for any one of these employing companies to publish their pay differential data. a number of initiatives are underway, including engagement with all employees to develop an improved health and safety culture in this facility. follow-up facility audits have been carried out by an external third party at five sites, with recommended actions being taken. emission sources falling outside the group’s operational control and other scope 3 emissions have not been collated or reported. angelika has also worked as a management consultant for several years with the boston consulting group and alix partners gmbh. previous roles include senior management positions with pilkington plc, bp chemicals, sentrachem ltd (south africa) and kingspan group. if thought appropriate, directors may obtain independent professional advice in respect of their responsibilities, at the company’s expense. during late october, the board also visited two plants in juarez, mexico, where they met local management teams and were able to make first hand assessments of progress being made following recent expansion. presentations were received from jeff graby and his senior management team during the board visit to juarez, mexico. feedback from these events, meetings with shareholders and analysts’ reports are provided to the board at each meeting. the website permits users to download copies of published financial reports, presentations, press releases and stock exchange announcements. an annual schedule of committee activity is set out a year in advance, to provide the appropriate focus on key priorities. it was also recommended that representatives from bdo should attend the committee meetings on a more frequent basis. in light of the group’s growth and increasing footprint, a five-year internal audit strategic plan has been developed, covering all subsidiaries. acquisitions during 2017 have been smaller and less complex than previous years so this is not considered to be significant. accordingly, it was agreed that james brotherton would take board responsibility for group strategy, corporate development and m&a, in addition to his existing duties as chief financial officer. accordingly, james brotherton, helen clatworthy, louis eperjesi, mark rollins and martin towers will offer themselves for re-election at the 2017 agm. as this is pamela bingham’s first year of appointment, she will offer herself for election to the board. the executive directors’ salaries are set having regard to typical pay levels at companies of a similar size, internationality and complexity. details of any payments to former directors, where required by relevant regulations, will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise. the majority will be based on clear financial targets that include a significant weighting towards profit and cash generation as, when combined, these are often strong indicators of sustainable growth. these measures align with the company’s goal of value creation for shareholder through financial growth and above market returns. 84% of group underlying operating profit before taxation accounted for by the reporting units where full scope audit work performed. where management’s growth assumptions were in excess of these external forecasts, we evaluated management’s rationale, being the benefit of acquisition synergies and restructuring activities undertaken and as a result, we considered the forecasts to have been prepared on a supportable basis. there is also a small amount recognised in relation to the write off of inventory fair value adjustments. all other centrally incurred costs and eliminations are disclosed as a separate line item in
