be on further share gains, leveraging the opportunities offered by era’s new facility, new product introductions and management of costs and overheads. china and asia pacific markets are likely to

2017 despite generally favourable market conditions. the impact of these increases was not fully recovered through price, although amesburytruth expects to resume its usual practice of cost recovery through price in 2018. overheads in the division increased principally due to higher freight costs than usual. previously coverage was managed through state or regional representatives, which led to some inconsistencies in service depending on location. progress with isc has been promising with trading in us tiers three and four during the second half of the year increasing by 4.7 per cent compared with the equivalent period in 2016 and c. us$1.4 million of annualised incremental orders secured to date, which should convert into revenue in 2018. like for like revenue increased by 1.9

cycles have turned, with input costs mainly trending upwards. prior year exceptional items write-off of inventory fair value adjustments in 2016 are non-cash adjustments relating to the ifrs 3 requirement that finished goods held in inventory must be revalued to their market value on acquisition. as this credit is exceptional in nature it has been excluded from the group’s underlying tax charge. this treatment is, however, broadly dependent on sufficient eligible taxable profits being generated in the relevant jurisdiction. • the group does not at present make material use of special incentive arrangements that might impact the tax charge such as research and development tax credits or patent box structures however will keep this under review. over the past five years, a period which has seen significant capital investment made in the group, operating cash conversion has averaged 92.9 per cent and each division remains targeted on delivery of 100.0 per cent cash conversion

267,752 shares in tyman plc at a total cost of £0.8 million to satisfy certain share awards vested in march 2017 as well as future obligations under the group’s various share plans. the net effect of currency translation caused revenue and underlying operating profit from ongoing operations to increase by £21.5 million and £3.7 million respectively compared with 2016. this result is driven by a combination of the increase in the proportion of the group reporting in currencies other than sterling as well as average sterling exchange rates compared with major currencies being lower than in 2016. transactional exposure divisions that purchase or sell products in currencies other than their functional currency will potentially incur transactional exposures. for purchases by era from the far east, these exposures are principally sterling/us dollar or chinese renminbi. the group’s policy is to recover adverse transactional currency movements through price increases or surcharges. tyman’s banking facility allows for funds to be drawn in many different currencies. giesse has made a significant contribution to the group since its acquisition in march 2016 and has materially exceeded the group’s minimum target return threshold on both a run rate and annualised basis. bilco is expected to exceed the minimum run rate target return threshold within two years of acquisition. 2018 cash taxation rates are expected to be broadly in line with the group’s 2018 underlying effective tax rate. these risk registers are reviewed on a regular basis by the functional heads within each division. this is mainly, but not exclusively, comprised of risks after mitigation and above a certain threshold. such systems can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. business integration is no longer considered to be a principal risk as at 31 december 2017 . the group has adopted strategies to reduce these inherent risks to an

construction and residential and commercial rmi markets. the group aims to minimise the impact of aggressive pricing by competitors through a low-cost manufacturing strategy supported by its programmes of new product development, continual process improvements and building long term relationships with its customers based on value, quality, service and added value technical support. mitigation each division develops strategic customer plans which include high level engagement through business review meetings to identify service issues and product development opportunities on a timely basis. where a division identifies a broader category of customer that may be at risk, specific mitigation plans are put in place such as the changes made in 2017 to the amesburytruth route to market for smaller customers. product or raw material may become unavailable from a supplier due to events beyond our control. in 2017 , 77 .7 per cent of the group’s underlying operating profit was derived from north american operations. in response, the group will increase selling prices or apply surcharges to recover unavoidable input cost increases. the group’s digital assets are under increasing risk from hacking, viruses and “phishing” threats. mitigation the group continues to develop and test regularly disaster recovery plans for all sites. decisions relating to major investment projects, including all m&a transactions, are approved by the board. amesburytruth continued its tuition reimbursement programme where employees can pursue a degree course which is directly related to their employment. era supported skills training through the uk apprenticeship schemes for customer services and business administration. at present, there is no legal requirement for any one of these employing companies to publish their pay differential data. however, it is recognised there are benefits to tyman in compiling and publishing this information. a number of initiatives are underway, including engagement with all employees to develop an improved health and safety culture in this facility. follow-up facility audits have been carried out by an external third party at five sites, with recommended actions being taken. divisional ceos report on their health and safety performance to the tyman ceo at weekly tmc meetings. local management report on health and safety performance to divisional ceos at least weekly. each division is responsible for negotiating the terms and conditions of trade with suppliers. a proportion of the group’s products are sourced from third party suppliers, primarily in china. each call was fully investigated, by an appropriate person, independent of the claim being made. this is a measure relating to the reduction in solar gain; • louvres outside office windows to reduce solar gains; • heat recovery ventilation units; • air source heat pumps for heating and cooling of office space; • low energy led lighting; • daylight dimming controls

five-year internal audit strategic plan has been developed, covering all subsidiaries. acquisitions during 2017 have been smaller and less complex than previous years so this is not considered to be

of base salary, with half in cash and half in shares deferred for three years. the personal objectives are to be set in relation to the group’s progress during 2018 in delivering and embedding the group’s plans in relation to strategy deployment (10 per cent of base salary), health and safety (7.5 per cent of base salary) and succession planning (7.5 per cent of base salary). the measurement period for the 2018 awards will be from 1 january 2018 to 31 december 2020. these awards will be subject to two years’ post vesting holding period and three years’, post vesting, recovery provisions. as at 31 december 2017, shares equivalent to 1.6 per cent of the group’s issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) would be required to settle all outstanding awards under employee and executive share plans, assuming maximum vesting. the executive directors’ salaries are set having regard to typical pay levels at companies of a similar size, internationality and complexity. no overall maximum level has been set since some costs may change in accordance with market conditions. to create further alignment with shareholders’ interests via the delivery and retention of deferred equity. annual financial performance targets have historically been focused on profit and cash generation metrics. details of any payments to former directors, where required by relevant regulations, will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise. the majority will be based on clear financial targets that include a significant weighting towards profit and cash generation as, when combined, these are often strong indicators of sustainable growth. these measures align with the company’s goal of value creation for shareholder through financial growth and above market returns. payments will normally be made monthly, although the committee retains discretion to agree settlement terms. all non-executive directors are required to undertake that they will submit themselves for re-election at each annual general meeting occurring during their term of office and no non-executive director will serve more than three terms of three years without prior shareholder approval. executive directors would normally be allowed to retain the fees paid from these appointments. we designed audit procedures at group and significant component level to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. 84% of group underlying operating profit before taxation accounted for by the reporting units where full scope audit work performed. where management’s growth assumptions were in excess of these external forecasts, we evaluated management’s rationale, being the benefit of acquisition synergies and restructuring activities undertaken and as a result, we considered the forecasts to have been prepared on a supportable basis. we focused on this provision as the estimation and timing of costs in respect of future warranty claims requires judgement, and, as such, there is a risk that the provision may be understated. other provisions the provisions for potential tax exposures identified are based on either calculations performed by management considering the potential risks identified and historic settlement values, or specific advice received from external tax advisers. there is also a small amount recognised in relation to the write off of inventory fair value adjustments. the notes on pages 100 to 136 are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. consolidated statement of
