opportunities 1. including share of property joint ventures. outlook the recovery in uk consumer sentiment has continued to strengthen as economic indicators have improved. with diverse regional exposure through our portfolio of prime retailing destinations, i believe that hammerson is well-placed to benefit from this continuing trend. against this backdrop, i am confident that hammerson will continue to deliver strong returns for its shareholders. hammerson’s assets are in the sub sectors of prime shopping centres, retail parks and premium outlet villages. via outlets currently owns six centres which predominantly cater to customers in the mainstream fashion segment. demand for outlet space is driven by retailers’ desire to sell excess inventory while maintaining brand equity. sales growth for outlet centres has been 7-9% per annum over the last five years (source: cushman & wakefield). our research shows they are taking a more ‘considered’ approach: browsing; researching; and comparing for longer. retailers such as john lewis now see more online purchases collected in store than delivered to home. administration levels of uk retailers are running lower than previous years limiting the drag which new vacancies have on rents. forecast muted economic growth across europe and low inflation could mean european property continues to look very attractively priced through into 2015. direct investment in uk shopping centres was at levels not seen since 2006. as well as domestic transactions (70%), asian investors accounted for 13% of total volume and north american investors 10%. of transactions (rhs) uk shopping centre investment volumes were at record levels as shown in the chart above. www.hammerson.com 11 strategic report entertaining & exciting we want to push the

exposure to the premium outlets market which comprises outlet centres of institutional investment quality. the european outlet centre market is highly fragmented, but well managed high-quality centres can deliver high sales densities and annual total returns above 10%. during 2014, la roca village, barcelona opened a 5,800m 2 extension, and this, together with the introduction of sunday trading, has led to significant footfall growth. hammerson enjoys a supportive relationship with vr, whose expansion into china includes villages at shanghai and suzhou. the new venture aims to acquire existing european outlet centres with strong catchments and potential for growth. we actively rotate tenants to ensure the retail offer is optimised and enlivened at each location. the ‘plus’ app, upgraded websites and analytics tools will be rolled out across our shopping centre portfolio in 2015. in addition to the new digital platform, we continue to deliver engaging content across social media channels to more than one million followers, as well as supporting successful physical events that enliven our mall space such as autumn fashion fix, student nights, love food and the big positive weekend. 2 introduction retailers are focusing their space requirements on high-quality, prime shopping centres, conveniently located retail parks and premium outlets of the types invested in by hammerson. our innovation agenda will ensure that the group’s properties are best-in-class and ready to deliver exceptional performance in this new retail environment. the information presented is consistent with our management reporting systems and includes metrics prepared on a proportionally consolidated basis. 2013 figures also exclude the office properties which were sold and treated as discontinued during that year. however, these positive factors were partially offset by the impact of lease expiries and tenant reconfigurations. french occupancy fell marginally during the year as a result of lease expiries, although this will enable future tenant rotation. these figures do not represent a forecast and take no account of void periods, lease incentives or potential changes to future rental values. total portfolio 1 184 57 (4) (35) 237 25 54 2 23 137 64 112 361 86 (10) 437 -50 50 150 250 350 450 3 48 hammerson plc annual report 2014 acquisitions may be financed initially using short-term funds before being refinanced for the longer term when market conditions are appropriate. short-term funding is raised principally through syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions with which we maintain strong working relationships. this strategy has ensured access to a wide range of debt capital markets at competitive pricing. exposure to exchange translation differences on euro-denominated assets is managed through a combination of euro borrowings and derivatives. these were partly offset by higher financing costs associated with reduced levels of floating rate debt. growth of 2.1% in income from the like-for-like portfolio was principally driven by leasing activity at cabot circus and italie deux. we have incurred a net £3.0 million one-off restructuring charge which has been recognised within administration expenses, but excluded from adjusted earnings. table fig 39 administration expenses

the longer term when market conditions are appropriate. short-term funding is raised principally through syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions with whom hammerson maintains strong working relationships. over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings. in relation to financial instruments alone, there would have been no impact on the group’s profit before tax. share options at 31 december 2014, the following options granted to staff remained outstanding under
