with diverse regional exposure through our portfolio of prime retailing destinations, i believe that hammerson is well-placed to benefit from this continuing trend. anchored by printemps, taking their first store outside paris for over 30 years, the centre is home to high-end designers including michael kors, sandro, bose, g-star and maje. since opening, the scheme has had over 8 million visitors with an average dwell time of 92 minutes and we have received extremely positive trading reports from our retail customers. key targets under this theme include establishing a portfolio of “pioneer places” to showcase and test innovative sustainability solutions before successes are mainstreamed across the portfolios. our uk and france senior management teams will attend similar workshops during 2015. we continue to place particular emphasis on gender diversity when recruiting. the company welcomes and fully considers all suitable applications for employment, irrespective of gender, race, ethnicity, religion, age, sexual orientation or disability. 2015 focus eps growth will be driven by new rental income from recent acquisitions and the completion of developments such as les terrasses du port. 2015 focus with retailer demand for new space strengthening, we are focused on delivering tenant rotation to enhance the retail offer across our portfolio. 2015 focus we will continue to drive down carbon emissions across the portfolio, through initiatives such as investment in renewables, energy efficient technology and lighting. completed developments in may, we opened les terrasses du port, marseille, the 62,800m² shopping and leisure destination, which has traded ahead of expectations. our 23,800m² development in le jeu de paume, beauvais is due for completion this year, and
