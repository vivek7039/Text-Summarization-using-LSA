With diverse regional exposure through our portfolio of prime retailing destinations, I believe that Hammerson is well-placed to benefit from this continuing trend. It is anticipated that growing demand from global investors for high-quality retail assets will continue in 2015, potentially compressing yields and boosting capital values further. Forecast muted economic growth across Europe and low inflation could mean European property continues to look very attractively priced through into 2015. Anchored by Printemps, taking their first store outside Paris for over 30 years, the centre is home to high-end designers including Michael Kors, Sandro, Bose, G-Star and Maje. Since opening, the scheme has had over 8 million visitors with an average dwell time of 92 minutes and we have received extremely positive trading reports from our retail customers. Key targets under this theme include establishing a portfolio of “Pioneer Places” to showcase and test innovative sustainability solutions before successes are mainstreamed across the portfolios. The Company welcomes and fully considers all suitable applications for employment, irrespective of gender, race, ethnicity, religion, age, sexual orientation or disability. 2015 focus EPS growth will be driven by new rental income from recent acquisitions and the completion of developments such as Les Terrasses du Port. 2015 focus With retailer demand for new space strengthening, we are focused on delivering tenant rotation to enhance the retail offer across our portfolio. 2015 focus We will continue to drive down carbon emissions across the portfolio, through initiatives such as investment in renewables, energy efficient technology and lighting. Completed developments In May, we opened Les Terrasses du Port, Marseille, the 62,800m² shopping and leisure destination, which has traded ahead of expectations. Our 23,800m² development in Le Jeu de Paume, Beauvais is due for completion this year, and will be anchored by Carrefour Market.

The European outlet centre market is highly fragmented, but well managed high-quality centres can deliver high sales densities and annual total returns above 10%. During 2014, La Roca Village, Barcelona opened a 5,800m 2 extension, and this, together with the introduction of Sunday trading, has led to significant footfall growth. 2 Introduction Retailers are focusing their space requirements on high-quality, prime shopping centres, conveniently located retail parks and premium outlets of the types invested in by Hammerson. Our innovation agenda will ensure that the Group’s properties are best-in-class and ready to deliver exceptional performance in this new retail environment. French occupancy fell marginally during the year as a result of lease expiries, although this will enable future tenant rotation. These figures do not represent a forecast and take no account of void periods, lease incentives or potential changes to future rental values.

Short-term funding is raised principally through syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions with which we maintain strong working relationships. Growth of 2.1% in income from the like-for-like portfolio was principally driven by leasing activity at Cabot Circus and Italie Deux. We have incurred a net £3.0 million one-off restructuring charge which has been recognised within administration expenses, but excluded from adjusted earnings. • We focus on prime shopping centres in the best locations, convenient retail parks and premium outlets, all with experienced management. Business review (page 40) We successfully completed Les Terrasses du Port in May and were on-site with six projects at 31 December 2014. Our three major London schemes have been advanced and this coincides with improving demand from retailers for new prime trading locations. We have also seen cost inflation in the construction sector, fuelled by growing demand for skills and raw materials as economic growth returns. Related strategic priorities 3 • The Board approves future investment requirements and sufficient facilities are put in place with an appropriate maturity profile. In July, we decided that all Non-Executive Directors would become members of the Nomination Committee and so membership increased by three. I am delighted that Terry Duddy has agreed to accept the role and he will be appointed with effect from 22 April 2015. DA VID ATKINS’ PERSPECTIVE Holding this year’s Strategy Day in Les Terrasses du Port, Marseille had a huge impact. The Whistleblowing Policy sets out a procedure by which employees may report suspicion of fraud, financial irregularity or other malpractice. Our TPR relative to an appropriate peer group is a component of both annual bonus (AIP) and long term incentives (LTIP). For consistency and comparison against other Executive Directors, Jean-Philippe Mouton’s remuneration has been converted from euros into sterling in table 52. Subject to re-election at the Annual General Meeting, Gwyn Burr’s appointment has been renewed for a further three year period from 21 May 2015.
