Refinancing In November 2016 we completed the refinancing of our bank facilities which included a £353.5m bank term loan; capital expenditure and working capital facilities, all of which were due to mature in February 2018; together with our liquidity facility. Outlook This is an exciting time for the business with improvements in financial performance and operational efficiency. Combined with the continued leveraging of our critical national infrastructure we are well placed to benefit from emerging market opportunities, such as 5G. Arqiva has invested circa £800 million in the past five years allowing it to develop its communications infrastructure and technology as markets evolve. The Group’s unique site locations and national footprint play a crucial role in supporting these coverage obligations; including our increased exclusive access to municipal street furniture which now covers 14 London Boroughs. Within the T errestrial Broadcast division, Arqiva has a total of circa 1,500 TV and radio transmission sites. Arqiva is a market leader in commercial DTT spectrum, owning the licences for two of the three main national commercial DTT multiplexes, enabling leading broadcasters such as UKTV, Sky, CBS and Turner to deliver broadcasting content using our channel capacity. Arqiva also owns both HD-enabled DTT multiplex licenses that provide services to Freeview and other DTT-related platforms including Youview. Arqiva manages the distribution of more than 1,100 international TV channels including coverage of high profile sporting events, and provides playout services for more than 100 channels for high profile customers including Al Jazeera, Discovery, BT Sport, Sky, NBCU, Sony and Turner. Grow a financially successful business, leveraging existing infrastructure assets and customer relationships with selective investment to maximise value by securing long-term scalable growth opportunities. Help Arqiva’s customers prosper and succeed by delivering superior services in the most cost efficient way. This is a change that will be adopted across Europe, Africa, the Middle East and central Asia. The final sites for this phase will be completed during autumn 2017, taking commercial local DAB coverage to over 91%. Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2017 Arqiva Group Limited 18 Business update 10 4G rollout The four Mobile Network Operators (‘MNOs’) continue to increase their 4G network coverage and Arqiva continues to carry out large volumes of antenna and feeder upgrade projects. Arqiva is targeting the use of its existing M2M networks in key sectors such as utility infrastructure operations, asset management optimisation and smart building enablement. The Group is reviewing all areas of third party spend and progressing with a number of actions; consolidating demand across the Group to ensure best prices, re-negotiating supplier contracts, reducing spare capacity and wherever possible eliminating spend through process optimisation activities. Recurring revenues from the Group’s DTT multiplexes increased mainly as a result of new channel launches and other items. Operating cash flow after capital and financial investment activities was £332.5m, an increase of 46.7% from £226.6m in the prior year. Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2017 Arqiva Group Limited 26 Liquidity T o ensure it has sufficient available funds for working capital requirements and planned growth, the Group maintains cash reserves and access to undrawn committed facilities to cover forecast requirements. Risk in this area is limited further by setting a maximum level and term for deposits with any single counterparty. The Group has sufficient financial resources which, together with internally generated cash flows, will continue to provide sufficient sources of liquidity to fund its current operations, including its contractual and commercial commitments both in terms of capital programmes and financing. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing this financial information. Additionally revenue growth was driven by the Group’s smart energy metering network reaching its operational phase. In addition, a trial at Selkirk was successfully completed which has helped to inform the UK government’s viewer support policy. The Group engages closely with programme stakeholders to ensure any minor delays and remedial plans are actioned in a timely manner. Result - Through careful management Arqiva has consistently been able to achieve excellent levels of network availability. This is a change that will be adopted across Europe, Africa, the Middle East and central Asia.

Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these financial statements. Cash received or invoices raised in advance is taken to deferred income and recognised as revenue when the services are provided. Business combinations, including goodwill Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. Assets in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative purposes, are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash- generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. Borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Fair value measurement IFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these financial statements is determined on such a basis. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. These are amortised over their expected useful life once the product or service has been commercially launched.
