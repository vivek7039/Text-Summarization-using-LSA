driven by excellent operating performances in t errestrial broadcast and t elecoms & m2m” we are focusing on core business activities that drive profitable growth and shareholder value in our quest to become the most efficient and effective provider of communications infrastructure in the uk. outlook this is an exciting time for the business with improvements in financial performance and operational efficiency. combined with the continued leveraging of our critical national infrastructure we are well placed to benefit from emerging market opportunities, such as 5g. arqiva has invested circa £800 million in the past five years allowing it to develop its communications infrastructure and technology as markets evolve. the group’s unique site locations and national footprint play a crucial role in supporting these coverage obligations; including our increased exclusive access to municipal street furniture which now covers 14 london boroughs. 11 arqiva group limited 1 including

licences for two of the three main national commercial dtt multiplexes, enabling leading broadcasters such as uktv, sky, cbs and turner to deliver broadcasting content using our channel capacity.

rollout the four mobile network operators (‘mnos’) continue to increase their 4g network coverage and arqiva continues to carry out large volumes of antenna and feeder upgrade projects. arqiva is targeting the use of its existing m2m networks in key sectors such as utility infrastructure operations, asset management optimisation and smart building enablement. recurring revenues from the group’s dtt multiplexes increased mainly as a result of new channel launches and other items. this increase is owing to lower investment in working capital and the additional ebitda generated. net capital expenditure and financial investment was £138.1m, representing a decrease of 6.7% from the prior year. operating cash flow after capital and financial investment activities was £332.5m, an increase of 46.7% from £226.6m in the prior year. annual report for the year ended 30 june 2017 arqiva group limited 26 liquidity t o ensure it has sufficient available funds for working capital requirements and planned growth, the group maintains cash reserves and access to undrawn committed facilities to cover forecast requirements. risk in this area is limited further by setting a maximum

of liquidity to fund its current operations, including its contractual and commercial commitments both in terms of capital programmes and financing. thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing this financial information. additionally revenue growth was driven by the group’s smart energy metering network reaching its operational phase. in addition, a trial at selkirk was successfully completed which has helped to inform the uk government’s viewer support policy. the group engages closely with programme stakeholders to ensure any minor delays and remedial plans are actioned in a timely manner. result - through careful management arqiva has consistently been able to achieve excellent levels of network availability. included within this business unit is

june 2018 management have performed an impact assessment on the adoption of ifrs 15 and do not expect it to have a material impact on the financial statements. thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these financial statements. cash received or invoices raised in advance is taken to deferred income and recognised as revenue when the services are provided. business combinations, including goodwill acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. assets in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative purposes, are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. when a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash- generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. borrowings interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. fair value measurement ifrs 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these financial statements is determined on such a basis. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. transactions in the income statement of overseas operations are translated using an average exchange rate. the cash flow projections take account of past experience, and are based on management’s best estimates of future developments based on contracted growth and necessary expenditure to maintain the assets required to generate that expected revenue. a reconciliation of the
