we apply world-class materials science and manufacturing expertise to solve technical challenges that our customers face everyday. we work in the electronics, energy, healthcare, industrial, petrochemical, security and transport markets, forming close collaborative relationships with our customers. in addition to these principal product ranges, morgan also offers application-specific products for each of its target markets. the group’s advanced materials offer a wide range of performance characteristics including superior insulating properties, dimensional stability, strength and stiffness. morgan has also continued to invest in research and development (r&d) to support its role in the industrial market, with construction work underway at our new carbon science centre of excellence (coe) at penn state university, pennsylvania, usa. for example, morgan’s carbon brushes and collectors are used extensively in trains, similarly, high-temperature fibre products are widely used for emission control in a wide variety of vehicles, specially engineered to customer requirements. the petrochemical industry operates in demanding environments, creating a requirement for more durable, resistant and efficient materials. morgan’s advanced thermal insulation is used to insulate heat recovery steam generators in power and industrial plants. morgan has developed new carbon material grades for wind generation applications that extend life and reduce service costs. one landmark initiative currently underway within morgan’s metals and joining coe is making traditionally brittle braze alloys available in a flexible wire form. electronics manufacturers are under constant pressure to meet competing demands on component size, functionality and cost. morgan engineers high-purity, high- specification components which are used globally in the fabrication of semiconductor and electronic products. morgan’s ceramic metallisation processes have played a major role in the commercialisation of modern communication, signalling and control technologies, including ultra-high-frequency signal transmission. these adjusted measures are not recognised under ifrs or other generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). aside from this the accident rates in some of our other businesses did not improve. performance objectives of top management continue to place emphasis on causing positive change in this area. our lost time accident rate (accidents per 100,000 hours worked) increased from 0.27 to 0.39 in the year. in part this was the result of a serious road traffic accident in the usa when a minibus carrying members of our thermal products operations team to our plant was hit by another vehicle. through the application of our core skills in these areas we will add value as a group. the group has continued its investment in additional capability and capacity to support future growth. as part of this we have introduced greater balance between short-term (in-year) and long-term (multi-year) incentives. finally, i would like to thank our employees for their hard work and support during 2017. pete raby chief executive officer overview strategic report

financial statements 1. accounting policies, estimates and judgments accounting policies morgan advanced materials plc (the ‘company’) is a company incorporated in the uk under the companies act. foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation since the adoption of ifrs are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. if any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated (see (i) below). a significant or prolonged decline in an available-for-sale financial asset’s fair value below its cost is objective evidence of impairment. these include the financial effect of items which occur infrequently, such as major individual restructuring projects. provisions are made against individual exposures taking into account the specific circumstances of each case, including the strengths of technical arguments, past experience with tax authorities, recent case law or rulings on similar issues and external advice received. amounts provided are the group’s best estimate of exposure based on currently available information. note 1 1 contains information about the assumptions relating to goodwill impairment tests, including a sensitivity analysis. the general loss allowance is estimated based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets. ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018 and introduces a new revenue recognition model that requires the transaction price receivable from customers to be allocated between the group’s performance obligations under contracts on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. overview strategic report governance financial statements annual report 2017 morgan advanced materials 111 2. acquisitions and disposals continued global

the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. the key assumptions that underpin these cash flow projections relate to sales and operating margins, which are based on past experience, taking into account the effect of known or likely changes in market or operating conditions. at 31 december 2017 216,456 shares were held by the morgan general employee benefit trust and are treated as a deduction from equity (2016: 623,127). overview strategic report governance financial statements annual report 2017 morgan advanced materials 129 18. capital and reserves continued after 31 december 2017 the following dividends were proposed by the directors for 2017. these dividends have not been provided for and there are no income tax consequences. depreciation is charged on a basis consistent with similar owned assets or over the lease term if shorter. in a few cases operating subsidiaries have external borrowings but these are supervised and controlled centrally. many of these have purchased the same product for several years and in some cases decades. a specific impairment allowance may be created in respect of an individual trade receivable for which full recovery is doubtful. credit risk is managed by investing liquid assets and acquiring derivatives in a diversified way from high-credit-quality financial institutions. the group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value. neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements. equity securities fair value is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. overview strategic report governance financial statements annual report 2017 morgan advanced materials 139 20. financial risk management continued trade and other receivables/payables for receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value. as such the group’s interpretation is that the current version of ifric 14 does not have an impact and, as a result, any ias 19 surplus can be recognised as an asset and it is not necessary to recognise additional liabilities in respect of contribution agreements reached with the pension scheme trustees, managers or any third party. the two uk schemes provide a benefit based upon an employee’s total service, and their career average earnings (including allowance for consumer price inflation), although historically benefits were based upon an employee’s final salary. funding legislation in the uk requires that schemes are fully
