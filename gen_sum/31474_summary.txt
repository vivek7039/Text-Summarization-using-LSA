We work in the electronics, energy, healthcare, industrial, petrochemical, security and transport markets, forming close collaborative relationships with our customers. The Group’s advanced materials offer a wide range of performance characteristics including superior insulating properties, dimensional stability, strength and stiffness. Morgan’s advanced thermal insulation is used to insulate heat recovery steam generators in power and industrial plants. Morgan has developed new carbon material grades for wind generation applications that extend life and reduce service costs. One landmark initiative currently underway within Morgan’s Metals and Joining CoE is making traditionally brittle braze alloys available in a flexible wire form. Morgan engineers high-purity, high- specification components which are used globally in the fabrication of semiconductor and electronic products. Morgan’s ceramic metallisation processes have played a major role in the commercialisation of modern communication, signalling and control technologies, including ultra-high-frequency signal transmission.

Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 25 Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials Morgan has an established risk management methodology which seeks to identify, prioritise and mitigate risks, underpinned by a ‘three lines of defence’ model comprising an internal control framework, internal monitoring, and independent assurance processes. Trend New risk, no change Changes to operational processes are carefully considered by site, GBU and Divisional management before implementation. Changes to our sales structures and incentives are reviewed at various levels of the organisation, before being launched. The Group continues to deploy and upgrade enhanced enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems in those businesses where a need for improvement is identified. A new Director of Ethics & Compliance has been appointed who will be oversee further improvements to the RBP in 2018. With its extensive applications experience and process knowledge Molten Metal Systems helps customers put together the optimal system for their needs. It also has a comprehensive network of sales offices allowing immediate access to and facilitating direct working with end-users. Some sales, particularly for the insulating fibre and crucible product ranges, are made through a well-established distributor network. > Divisional EBITA margin* was 1 1.9% (2016: 12.1%), with the impacts of divestment broadly offset by improvements in operational execution and volume leverage. These materials help solve the problems associated with use of lubricants in extreme temperatures, corrosive or hygienic environments and where access is restricted. Credit risk is managed by investing liquid assets and acquiring derivatives in a diversified way from high-credit-quality financial institutions. These measures are shown because the Directors consider they provide useful information to shareholders, including additional insight into ongoing trading and year-on-year comparisons. These measures are used as they allow revenue to be compared excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates. The Group is committed to providing effective leadership in pursuit of an injury-free and environmentally responsible work place.

Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation since the adoption of IFRS are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. A significant or prolonged decline in an available-for-sale financial asset’s fair value below its cost is objective evidence of impairment. IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and introduces a new revenue recognition model that requires the transaction price receivable from customers to be allocated between the Group’s performance obligations under contracts on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. This shareholding was held at nil value and, as a result, there is no profit or loss on disposal. Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. At 31 December 2017 216,456 shares were held by The Morgan General Employee Benefit Trust and are treated as a deduction from equity (2016: 623,127). Depreciation is charged on a basis consistent with similar owned assets or over the lease term if shorter. A specific impairment allowance may be created in respect of an individual trade receivable for which full recovery is doubtful. Credit risk is managed by investing liquid assets and acquiring derivatives in a diversified way from high-credit-quality financial institutions. The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value. Funding legislation in the UK requires that schemes are fully funded on a scheme-specific basis as measured, and this must be assessed at least every three years.
