years since i became ceo of mitchells & butlers, and i feel that we have covered a lot of ground. in february 2016, we launched a programme of work designed to meet these priorities, which i believe is now bearing real fruit. these are predominantly short leasehold sites in retail and leisure locations, currently trading below expectations. having reviewed in detail the future trading potential and brand or offer conversion options for these sites this year, we have concluded that several are unlikely to generate a positive return over the remaining life of their lease. we also continue to work on enhancing the amenity of other formats through our remodel programme. for example, we have continued to progress our evolution of harvester through remodels offering a fresh and contemporary design, bringing rotisserie chicken to the fore, as well as a retargeted offer which is delivering sales uplifts of 10% following investment. the four new operating divisions, each containing similar customer types and brands, introduced last year have improved our guest focus and we have made significant progress across a number of initiatives as evidenced by our like-for-like sales improvement. as managers have increased their level of engagement with their guests we have also seen average feedback scores increase over the course of the year with total net promoter score having increased to 7 .8 ppts to 59%. our progress in this area is well advanced with cost chief executive’s business review continued % of sales 1 scotland 5% 2 north west 9% 3 north east 3% 4 yorkshire and humberside

annual report and accounts 2017 the demand for food delivery within the industry has remained in growth and we have been positioning ourselves in order to benefit from customers’ changing habits which we believe provide an opportunity to capture incremental sales. however, the market in which we operate presents us with an unprecedented level of challenge and uncertainty. through this period we shall remain focused on delivering our strategy and give priority to maintaining both the competitiveness of our estate and a strong balance sheet, both of which we believe will leave us well positioned in the long term. the first is a time and attendance labour system which requires team members to clock in and out, ensuring that staff are paid accurately for the time worked, whilst also increasing deployment efficiency through enhanced planning tools. our focus on maximising bookings continues and we have now set up a central bookings team to take calls which are missed at site, with the conversion rate to a booking of these intercepted calls at 47%. this context helps inform our strategic priorities to keep our brands front of mind for the guest through innovation and continuous development, as well as premiumising, in order to take advantage of changing customer behaviour. uncertain economic and political environment our markets we believe that success in our evolving market requires quality brands, offering great experiences at the right price and with high amenity levels, to generate sufficient sales growth to mitigate cost headwinds. estate in total we trade from more than 1,750 pubs and restaurants, of which over 80% are owned under a freehold or long-leasehold. 1 build a more balanced business rationale • to generate maximum value from our estate of largely

accounts 2017 people working with us • over 14,820 employees have received an award recognising their service to the business. • we launched our chefs’ academy, the company’s primary apprenticeship route to grow team member culinary capability. everything we do as a business is built on the enthusiasm and professionalism of our people. following the survey employees in each business or department create an action plan specific to their engagement scores. this highly responsible approach has resulted in our businesses winning a number of best bar none awards. we are achieving this through our partnership with believe in young people by recruiting young people for our work experience opportunities and working with headstart in local communities as part of their programme to drive social integration and youth employability. hospitality is one of the few industries where you can very quickly progress from an apprenticeship into a position of management, therefore helping us develop a talent pipeline and growing our apprenticeship scheme to support our business today and for years to come. to support our strategy internally, in fy 2017 mitchells & butlers launched chefs’ academy, the business’ primary apprenticeship route to grow team member culinary capability; 117 learners were attracted in the first year of which 50% will move into next level roles. the growth of this programme will ensure that kitchen employees at mitchells & butlers have an apprenticeship opportunity that can help elevate them to future head chef roles and provide the business with confidence in our highly capable food workforce. communities local and national fundraising initiatives • over 7 ,700 meals donated to military personnel on armed forces day. corporate social responsibility continued 34 | mitchells & butlers plc | annual report and accounts 2017 in june, toby carvery showed their support for the armed forces by offering all military personnel a free carvery meal on armed forces day. toby carvery has also made the royal british legion its official charity partner for 2017-2018. support for birmingham children’s hospital the company continues to support a local charity, close to many colleagues’ hearts, birmingham children’s hospital. we also use free cellar air cooling systems, which draw in cool air from outside when temperatures drop below 8˚c and turn off the traditional cellar cooling process, saving a huge amount of energy every day. we are currently trialling the use of ‘too good to go’ – an initiative where surplus food, normally thrown away by one of our kitchens, is sold at a discounted rate to ensure it is not wasted. we also use other simple but effective products to reduce the volume of water used in our toilets such as hippo bags. 1 market risks risk category and description controls/mitigating activities movement declining sales performance this risk falls into three main categories: sales: there is a risk that declining sales, concerns around consumer confidence, increased personal debt levels, squeezes on disposable income and rising inflation together may adversely affect our market share and profitability, reducing headroom against securitisation tests. • full reviews have been carried out on key categories to ensure optimum value is achieved in each category. there is a risk that without the right people our customer service levels would be affected. • in addition, during fy 2017 , departmental business continuity plans have been revised, updated and reviewed by the risk committee. this review has been undertaken at a strategic level and seeks to ensure that appropriate mitigating actions are in place, some of which are in relation to how the group carefully manages productivity and efficiency across the estate. indexed) to 2023, with an additional payment of £13m into escrow in 2024 should such further funding be required at that time. after capital expenditure, disposals income, interest and tax, £103m of cash flow was generated by the business. revenue the group’s total revenues of £2,141m were 2.6% higher than last year, with growth in like-for-like sales supported by new site openings. with lower footfall on many of these parks and an uncertain economic outlook, alongside increased cost pressures such as living wage, business rates, apprenticeship levy, sugar tax and food price inflation we believe that a number of sites will now be challenged to achieve a breakeven performance. in addition, the group has conducted an impairment review on short leasehold and unlicensed properties. ron is a nominated shareholder representative of piedmont inc. colin rutherford independent non-executive director aged 58 appointed as an independent non-executive director

resource for all retail roles, has now been used by over 8,800 new team members as an integral part of the businesses induction process. star is supported by coaching material that has been produced for every technical task associated with a job in hospitality, the visual training library enables our teams to access up to date and relevant information from any hand held or desk top device, and a

increasing sales although it should be noted that conversion factors have also reduced, particularly for grid supplied electricity due to a reduction in coal generation which has been balanced by an increase in cleaner gas and renewables generation. mitchells & butlers is keen to encourage greater employee involvement in the group’s performance through share ownership. it will, however, as a precautionary measure to avoid inadvertent breach of the law, seek shareholder authority at its 2018 agm to make limited donations or incur limited political expenditure, although it has no intention of using the authority. real fires fuelled by logs or coal are also used to supplement customer comfort and enhance ambience. scope 1 and 2 emissions from sites with ‘landlord supplies’ are not

| mitchells & butlers plc | annual report and accounts 2017 the board is committed to high standards of corporate governance. our website includes a schedule of matters which have been reserved for the main board. stewart gilliland is available to all shareholders should they have any concerns if the normal channels of chairman, chief executive or finance director have failed to resolve them, or for which such contact is inappropriate. bob ivell was considered to be independent upon his appointment on 9 may 2011 in that he was free from any business or other relationship with the company which could materially influence his judgement and he continues to represent a strong source of advice and independent challenge. there are currently four independent non-executive directors on the board: stewart gilliland, colin rutherford, imelda walsh and dave coplin. those terms of reference are each reviewed annually by the relevant committee to ensure they remain appropriate. all board appointments will be made on merit while taking into account individual competence, skills and expertise measured against identified objective criteria (including consideration of diversity). the system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and, as such, it can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. the agm provides a useful interface with shareholders, many of whom are also guests in our pubs, bars and restaurants. following the appointment of three independent non-executive directors in april and may 2013, committee members were appointed with effect from 11 july 2013, and revised terms of reference were established, in order to comply with code requirements. we remain committed to maintaining an open and constructive dialogue with our shareholders on audit matters. they have been reviewed each year since and no changes were felt to be needed in fy 2017 . during fy 2017 , risk committee meetings continued to include a cross-functional, detailed review of the group’s key risks. the remodel programme in harvester has prioritised higher levels of amenity, demonstrating that a fresh and contemporary design improves investment returns. our people are fundamental to the delivery of great guest experiences and where we have consistently high employee engagement, sales growth is strongest. this reduction in team turnover also delivers a significant saving when the cost of recruitment, training and induction is taken into account. under the proposed new policy at least 50% will be based on financial objectives giving more scope to include strategic measures if appropriate. • since 2015 the leading measure of guest health has been nps and in 2017 a new social media monitoring tool was introduced enabling all social media reviews, including tripadvisor, facebook and google, to be combined into a single review score. each element will have equal weighting and to achieve a maximum payment performance will need to exceed target on at least two elements and be at target or better for the third element. therefore, the committee did not consider it appropriate to determine measures or agree targets for a long-term incentive plan at this time. a two-year holding period will be introduced for all future long-term incentive awards, to strengthen alignment between executives and shareholders. directors will be required to retain all vested shares (net of tax) until the share ownership guideline is met. in addition, each year an employee forum is held, which gives the opportunity for employees to ask questions of senior management, via elected representatives. subsequent demonstration of strong performance may result in a salary increase that is higher than for the wider workforce. deferred bonus, awarded in shares, provides a retention element and additional alignment of interests to shareholders. discretionary awards may be made each year, normally taking the form of nil or nominal cost options. benefits normally include (but are not limited to) private healthcare, life assurance, annual health check, employee assistance programme, use of a company vehicle or cash equivalent, and discounts on food and associated drinks purchased in our businesses. travel and, if relevant, related expenses such as accommodation may be reimbursed on a gross of tax basis. executive directors may become eligible for any new benefits introduced to a wider set of other group employees. fees are normally reviewed annually with any increase usually taking effect from 1 january each year. • if an executive director dies before an award under the prsp has vested, vesting of the award (and associated dividend accrued shares) will occur as soon as practicable based on performance and on a time pro-rated basis. benefits (including pension, company vehicle or cash allowance, healthcare, life assurance, health check and, where applicable, relocation assistance) would be consistent with the principles of the policy as set out on pages 72 and 73. for an internal appointment, his or her existing pension arrangements may continue to operate (which may include participation as an employee deferred member in the defined benefit plan, which is closed to future accrual) and any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role would be allowed to pay out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. the company chairman does not

company scheme. like-for-like sales growth of 1.8% consistently outperformed the market with noticeable improvements across almost our entire brand portfolio. the new survey solicits feedback from guests in several ways, for example via e-mail after booking on line or through one of our brand apps. retail staff employees have been excluded from the comparator group as they are hourly paid, largely part time and do not participate in any bonus plans. although wages and salaries have increased for all employee groups, overall earnings have fallen, as a result of fewer hours being worked on average each week, as the company improves scheduling efficiency across all sites. in assessing our pay ratio versus likely ratios from industry peers, we believe that we are towards the lower end of the range but note that annual and long-term incentive payments have varied considerably amongst this group. our employees are fundamental to the delivery of great guest experiences and therefore a truly engaged workforce is important. for over a decade, mitchells and butlers has sought the views of employees though our annual ‘your say’ employee engagement survey. another important factor is employee recognition, which can take many forms, and the company supports employees in a number of ways, such as our recognition programme which allows managers to reward great performance in the moment and also service milestones, from one year of service upwards. in addition, all employees can benefit from a generous employee discount and become shareholders through our share incentive plans. non-executive directors non-executive directors, including the company chairman, do not have service contracts but serve under letters of appointment which provide that they are initially appointed until the next agm when they are required to stand for election. an agreed food safety score must be achieved for this part of the bonus to pay out and, as an additional check, overall workplace safety will also be taken into account when determining the outcome. the non-profit elements will only become payable if a certain level of operating profit has been achieved. however, retrospective disclosure of targets and performance against them will be provided in next year’s directors’ remuneration report. reflecting good practice in this area, a two-year post-vesting holding period will be introduced for the prsp awards to be made in 2018 and for all future long-term incentive awards, thereby strengthening alignment between executives and shareholders. 1 net debt 118 4.2

in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. loss-making short leasehold properties are reviewed by management to determine whether an onerous lease provision is required. • we assessed the appropriateness of the classification of the £35m of property provisions provided in the period as a separately disclosed item in accordance with ias 1 presentation of financial statements; • we checked that all leasehold sites were considered in management’s process to identify sites which were potentially subject to onerous leases; • where onerous lease provisions have not been recognised, despite historical results indicating that a provision may be required, we obtained evidence to support management’s assertion that properties can be successfully turned around. 96 | mitchells & butlers plc | annual report and accounts 2017 group statement of comprehensive income for

equipment. d. during the period, a review of estate strategy in relation to managed leasehold sites has been completed, with specific focus on the challenges around loss-making sites and those located on retail and leisure parks. the group’s policy is to account for land held under both long and short leasehold contracts as operating leases, since it has no expectation that title will pass on expiry of the lease contracts. total future minimum lease rental payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2017 £m 2016 £m due within one year 54 52 between one and five years 199 194 after five years 440 448 693 694 operating lease receivables – group as lessor the group leases a small proportion of its unlicensed properties to tenants. management also use judgement to determine the most appropriate method of reviewing short leasehold and unlicensed properties for impairment. a. includes assets which are fully depreciated and have been removed from the fixed asset register. 112 | mitchells & butlers plc | annual report and accounts 2017 certain assets with a net book value of £44m (2016 £43m) owned by the group are subject to a fixed charge in respect of liabilities held by the mitchells & butlers executive top-up scheme (mabetus). the value in use calculation uses forecast trading performance cash flows, which are discounted by applying a pre-tax discount rate of 7% (2016 7%). subsequently, £42m of properties have been sold, leaving £1m remaining as held for sale at the balance sheet date. provisions the provision for unavoidable losses on onerous property leases has been set up to cover rental payments of vacant or loss-making properties. b. during the period, a full review of estate strategy in relation to managed leasehold properties has been completed, with specific focus on the challenges around loss-making sites and those located on retail and leisure parks. with lower footfall on many of these parks and the continued uncertain economic outlook, alongside increased cost pressures such as living wage, business rates review, apprenticeship levy, sugar tax and food price inflation, a number of short leasehold sites are now challenged when striving to achieve a break-even profit performance. the remaining increase of £1m is recognised within adjusted profit, as this represents unavoidable losses on unlicensed properties. amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of. computer software computer software and associated development costs, which are not an integral part of a related item of hardware, are capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful life. 120 | mitchells & butlers plc | annual report and accounts 2017 for certain categories of financial assets, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are, in addition, assessed for impairment on a collective basis. the borrowings accounting policy is provided in note 4.2. other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. income is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments other than those financial assets classified as at fvtpl. an explanation of the group’s financial instrument risk management objectives and strategies is set out below. derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate and foreign currency swaps, are used to manage market risk. a combination of cash pooling and zero balancing agreements are in place to ensure the optimum liquidity position is maintained. counterparties may also be required to post collateral with the group, where their credit rating falls below a predetermined level. 122 | mitchells & butlers plc | annual report and accounts 2017 included in other receivables are amounts due from certain group suppliers. included in trade and other payables at the period end are amounts due to some of these suppliers. in managing its capital structure, from time to time the group may realise value from non-core assets, buy back or issue new shares, initiate and vary its dividend payments and seek to vary or accelerate debt repayments. the cross currency interest rate swap is held under a separate agreement and cash movements for this instrument are settled individually. there is no current service cost as all defined
