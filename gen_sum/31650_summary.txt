fun and share the pleasure of good, honest food. stonehouse 82 sites alongside our traditional carvery, we serve up handmade pizza made with fresh dough; plus burgers and pub classics at a great price. in february 2016, we launched a programme of work designed to meet these priorities, which i believe is now bearing real fruit. estate in total we trade from more than 1,750 pubs and restaurants, of which over 80% are owned under a freehold or long-leasehold. • we procure 100% shell-on eggs produced from free range hens, achieving this status six months ahead of our original

2.6% higher than last year, with growth in like-for-like sales supported by new site openings. with lower footfall on many of these parks and an uncertain economic outlook, alongside increased cost

be independent upon his appointment on 9 may 2011 in that he was free from any business or other relationship with the company which could materially influence his judgement and he continues to represent a strong source of advice and independent challenge. there are currently four independent non-executive directors on the board: stewart gilliland, colin rutherford, imelda walsh and dave coplin. all board appointments will be made on merit while taking into account individual competence, skills and expertise measured against identified objective criteria (including consideration of diversity). the agm provides a useful interface with shareholders, many of whom are also guests in our pubs, bars and restaurants. the remodel programme in harvester has prioritised higher levels of

proposed new policy at least 50% will be based on financial objectives giving more scope to include strategic measures if appropriate. therefore, the committee did not consider it appropriate to determine measures or agree targets for a long-term incentive plan at this time. a two-year holding period will be introduced for all future long-term incentive awards, to strengthen alignment between executives and shareholders. directors will be required to retain all vested shares (net of tax) until the share ownership guideline is met. in addition, each year an employee forum is held, which

decade, mitchells and butlers has sought the views of employees though our annual ‘your say’ employee engagement survey. another important factor is employee recognition, which can take many forms, and the company supports employees in a number of ways, such as our recognition programme which allows managers to reward great performance in the moment and also service milestones, from one year of service upwards. in addition, all employees can benefit from a generous employee discount and become shareholders through our share incentive plans. however, retrospective disclosure of targets and performance against them will be provided in next year’s directors’ remuneration report. total future minimum lease rental payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2017 £m 2016

interest basis for debt instruments other than those financial assets classified as at fvtpl. a combination of cash pooling and zero balancing agreements are in place to ensure the optimum liquidity position is maintained. counterparties may also be required to post collateral with the group, where their credit rating falls below a predetermined level. the cross currency interest rate swap is held under a separate agreement and cash movements for this instrument are settled individually. where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, the fair value of any consideration received is also included in shareholders’ equity. this widely used industry measure provides better insight into the trading performance than total revenue which is impacted by acquisitions and disposals.
