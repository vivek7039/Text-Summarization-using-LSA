We would not have been able to achieve our strong performance  without their commitment and effort. I would also like to thank our customers,  suppliers, business partners and shareholders for their continued support in helping AMS  achieve its goals. We continue to grow our  volume market share which is now at 26%, up 2% from June 2017  and 3% over the full year. As reported at the half year, sales growth of LiquiBand ®  Fix8™  has been restricted due to design enhancements we have made  following surgeon feedback. At present, the device is approved for use within Europe and those  markets that accept European approval standards. During 2016, we renegotiated the supply agreement with an OEM  partner for collagen products in order to go direct. Sales were impacted by the pipeline fill of our atraumatic  foam launches in 2016, which we estimate to have been around  £1 million. This completes our major ERP conversions across the Group,  although ongoing improvements to systems will continue.

Reducing the  potential mechanism for pain at dressing changes helped  promote patient comfort and improve clinical outcomes. The Group has elected to adopt IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts  with Customers) in 2017, which has no impact on profit or cash flow  but results in fee income of £0.7 million (2016: £0.6 million) being  recorded as Revenue rather than as Other Income. All prior year values have been restated to reflect IFRS 15 adoption  and the Business Unit restructure.

Our working environment encourages openness,  teamwork, an understanding of others’ needs and the ability ‘to make  a difference’. AMS has introduced compulsory Ethics T raining which all Group  employees must complete to reinforce their understanding of the  policies in place. Specific, site-level  objectives are established to ensure compliance with local legislative  and external management system requirements. We also sponsor a number of local football clubs and school sports  teams including our local ladies football club, Witton Albion Ladies  FC, who receive no other funding and are coached by one of our  employees in their spare time. AMS contributed financially towards her cost of  participating in this event with Gold, Silver and Bronze medals being  achieved. The Board has overall responsibility for  ensuring there is an effective risk management framework, which  underpins our business model.

He is a Swiss national with over  25 years of commercial experience  in Medical Devices and Diagnostics. Having worked throughout Europe  and North America, he has extensive  knowledge of the global medical  devices market. Simon has over 25  years’ experience in IT  infrastructure, systems  implementation and software  development gained from  a number of different  industries.

Becky has more than 13  years’ experience in the  Medical Device sector,  having held various  senior management  roles, most recently as  European Sales Director  for Scapa Healthcare. To achieve  this, the Board reserves certain matters for its own determination including matters relating to Group strategy, approval of interim and  annual financial results, dividends, major capital expenditure, budgets, monitoring performance, treasury policy, risk management, corporate  governance and the effectiveness of its internal control systems. All Non-Executive Directors are expected to devote such time as is necessary for the  proper performance of their duties. The Board further notes that under Code Provision B.1.2 a smaller company (below FTSE 350) must have at least two independent Non- Executive Directors. Peter Allen, Steve Bellamy and Penny Freer own shares in the Company as shown on page 58. While the current economic environment is uncertain, AMS operates in a market whose demographics are favourable, underpinned by an  increasing need for products to treat chronic and acute wounds. When we adjust for this factor, and exclude the impact of share exercises,  our bonus gap drops to 8.7%. e Effective communication: – key audit judgements are communicated at the earliest opportunity to promote discussion and challenge  between the External Auditors and management, informing AMS of audit issues as they arise, so that these can be dealt with in a timely  manner. In September 2014 the FRC issued guidance on ‘Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial & Business Reporting’. They have no personal financial interest, other than as  shareholders, in the matters to be decided. A cohesive reward structure consistently applied with links to  corporate performance is seen as crucial in ensuring attainment of the Group’s strategic goals. The LTIP permits an annual grant of shares that  vest subject to performance and continued  employment. All UK employees are entitled to become  members of the Group Pension and Life  Assurance Scheme which was set up with  effect from 1 February 1999. No Director or Senior Manager shall be involved in any decisions as to their own remuneration. Directors will  be able to impose limits or conditions when giving authorisation if they believe it is appropriate. The Company also operates a Deferred Share Bonus Scheme (DSB) in which employees are invited to participate.

Cash-generating units to which goodwill has  been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs to completion and disposal. IFRS has been applied to all options granted after 7 November  2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2006. The impact, if any, is recognised in  profit or loss with a corresponding adjustment to reserves. IFRS not yet effective and not adopted early New accounting standards not yet applied At the date of authorisation of the Annual Financial Statements, the following new and revised IFRSs that are potentially relevant to the Group,  and which have not been applied in the Annual Financial Statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been  adopted by the EU):  e IFRS 9, Financial Instruments – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.  e IFRIC 22, Foreign Currency T ransactions and Advance Consideration – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.  e Amendments to IFRS 2, Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment T ransactions – effective for accounting periods beginning  on or after 1 January 2018.  e Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2014-16 Cycle, IFRS 1 and IAS 28 Amendments – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after  1 January 2018.  e IFRS 16, Leases – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.  e IFRIC 23, Uncertainty over Income Tax T reatments – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
