compensation reserve reflects the cumulative accounting impact, at the balance sheet date, of the fair value of the share schemes over the vesting periods. ifrs 10 introduced a new definition of control which could affect whether an entity is consolidated into the group accounts. on disposal of a foreign operation any cumulative exchange differences held in shareholders’ equity are transferred to the consolidated income statement. in addition, at each reporting date, the group assesses whether there is any indication that goodwill may be impaired. ifrs 9, “financial instruments”, is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018, and will therefore first apply to carr’s in the year ending august 2019. ifrs 9 requires entities to provide for possible future credit losses on loans and receivables, including trade receivables, even if it is highly likely that the loan or receivable will be fully collectible. ifrs 15, “revenue from contracts with customers”, is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018, and will therefore first apply to carr’s in the year ending august 2019. the group’s agriculture business is not expected to be materially affected by this standard. revenues from external customers: 2017 2016 continuing operations £’000 £’000 uk 296,905 269,109 europe 14,666 13,343 usa 34,457 32,455 new
