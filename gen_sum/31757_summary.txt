consideration of environmental, social, and governance matters. principal risk factors our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. however, we may not be successful in deploying some or all of these mitigating actions. if the circumstances in these risks occur or are not successfully mitigated, our cash flow, operating results, financial position, business and reputation could be materially adversely affected. the group has a comprehensive suite of it security solutions in place, which are reviewed and tested by specialist third parties. we will continue to monitor developments in the brexit process and incorporate steps into our future business planning where these may be required in order to mitigate any potentially adverse consequences including the imposition of any tariffs. post-acquisition reviews are also undertaken to identify any areas for improvement in future transactions. strategic report / corporate governance / financial statements

within the group have a significant proportion of their revenue generated from a small number of key customers. the businesses have established good long term relationships with key customers to ensure that demands and expectations are met. we must attract, integrate, and retain the talent required to fulfil our strategic growth ambitions. inability to retain key knowledge and adequately plan for succession could have a negative impact on the group’s performance. additionally, translational hedging instruments are sometimes used to limit the potential impact of fluctuating currencies on reported earnings from foreign subsidiaries. forecasts for the second and third years are prepared in a similar level of detail. it was determined that none of these individual risks would, in isolation, compromise the group’s viability. the group also considered a number of scenarios that would represent serious threats to its liquidity. the group set down a strategic plan three years ago, which is subject to ongoing monitoring and development as described below. revenues have increased primarily as a result of higher sales volumes in the uk agriculture business. both acquisitions have been subsequently hived up and incorporated into carrs billington agriculture (sales) limited. nuvision engineering, inc. was acquired by the group on 4 august 2017 for a total consideration of up to

overview the group’s governance framework is designed to safeguard its long-term success for the benefit of shareholders and other stakeholders. chris holmes dl chairman 22 november 2017 statement of compliance with uk corporate governance code the uk corporate governance code dated april 2016 and issued by the financial reporting council sets out standards of good practice in relation to issues such as: • board composition and effectiveness; • the role of board committees; • risk management; • remuneration; and • relationships with shareholders. the code stipulates that there should be a clear division of responsibility between board governance and executive management. the board is accordingly satisfied that alistair wannop, ian wood and john worby remain independent. the audit committee comprises three non-executive directors: john worby (chairman), ian wood and alistair wannop. such membership was previously considered appropriate given that two non-executive directors were appointed during 2015. chris holmes is no longer a member of the audit committee which is now comprised solely of non-executive directors considered by the board to be independent. such membership was previously considered appropriate given that two non-executive directors were appointed during 2015. chris holmes is no longer a member of the remuneration committee which is now comprised solely of non- executive directors considered by the board to be independent. in accordance with the auditing practices board ethical standards, pwc has to implement rules and requirements which include that none of their employees working on our audit can hold any shares in carr’s group plc. consideration of shareholder views in formulating this policy, the committee has taken into account guidance issued by shareholders and proxy agencies. the company may reimburse any reasonable business related expenses incurred in connection with their role (including tax thereon if these are determined to be taxable benefits). dividends will accrue on deferral awards over the vesting period and be paid out either as cash or as shares on vesting and in respect of the number of shares that have vested. awards up to and including the 2017 award are based solely upon an eps measure. awards from 2018 onwards will be based on an eps measure and may also include one or more additional measures of performance. two year post-vesting holding period applies to the net of tax shares for awards granted in 2018 and beyond. any varied performance condition would not be materially less difficult to satisfy in the circumstances. the annual bonus is based on performance against a stretching combination of financial and non-financial measures. non-executive directors are engaged for terms of one year subject to appointment and reappointment at the company’s agm. any such payments would be limited to a reasonable estimate of value of remuneration lost when leaving the former employer and would reflect the delivery mechanism (i.e. cash and/or share-based), time horizons and whether performance requirements are attached to that remuneration. any such payment will typically reflect the individual’s salary, benefits and pension entitlements. there will be no automatic entitlement to a bonus if an executive director has ceased employment or is under notice. for good leavers under the deferred bonus plan, unvested awards will usually vest in full upon cessation. no person attends any part of a meeting at which his or her own remuneration is discussed. adjusted pbt is calculated as reported pbt after adding back or deducting amortisation and non-recurring items outside of normal trading that were not anticipated at the time targets were set, such as acquisition related costs. payments are adjusted on a straight line basis between the threshold and maximum pbt targets. • restructure of engineering division underway and integration ongoing in line with strategy following key acquisitions. long term incentive plan the awards made to executive directors in 2014 were subject to average eps growth targets over a three year period ended on 2 september 2017. threshold vesting was set at 3% average annual growth. normal retirement age total contributions to dc-type pension plan £’000 cash in lieu of contributions to dc-type pension plan £’000 tim

matter how our audit addressed the key audit matter receivables provisioning within the agriculture division there are material amounts of trade receivables that are past due and there has historically been a slower collection pattern within this division. there are also a number of overseas subsidiary companies, in the us and germany, which report separately to these divisions. carr’s group plc has been selected as a full scope component due to its significant net assets balance, and the fact that the group pension scheme is recognised within its accounts, which is a key audit matter as noted above. carrs billington agriculture (operations) limited, an associate which the group owns 49% of, has been selected for full scope reporting. we have held planning calls with the component auditors for both carrs billington agriculture (operations) limited and wälischmiller, to understand their planned audit approach and ensure that it provides the comfort we require as part of our group audit. the period of total uninterrupted engagement is 109 years, covering the years ended 31 march 1909 to 2 september 2017. bill macleod (senior statutory auditor) for and on behalf of

£642,000 was transferred from other reserves to retained earnings in respect of previous revaluations of property owned by carr’s flour mills ltd, a subsidiary undertaking which was sold during the prior year. ifrs 10 introduced a new definition of control which could affect whether an entity is consolidated into the group accounts. the group’s investment in associates and joint ventures includes any goodwill arising on acquisition. on disposal of a foreign operation any cumulative exchange differences held in shareholders’ equity are transferred to the consolidated income statement. ifric 14 confirms that where a company has an unconditional right to a refund of surplus from a defined benefit pension plan during the lifetime of that plan or when it winds it up, and where there is expected to be surplus assets, there is no limit on the asset the company can show on its balance sheet. note 26 provides further information on this scheme and how it has been accounted for in the consolidated accounts. items that management consider fall into this category are also disclosed within a note to the financial statements. when construction is complete these assets are reclassified to the appropriate heading within property, plant and equipment. in addition, at each reporting date, the group assesses whether there is any indication that goodwill may be impaired. deferred tax arising from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, is not recognised. ifrs 9, “financial instruments”, is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018, and will therefore first apply to carr’s in the year ending august 2019. ifrs 9 requires entities to provide for possible future credit losses on loans and receivables, including trade receivables, even if it is highly likely that the loan or receivable will be fully collectible. ifrs 15, “revenue from contracts with customers”, is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018, and will therefore first apply to carr’s in the year ending august 2019. the group’s agriculture business is not expected to be materially affected by this standard. in accordance with ifrs 8, entity wide disclosures based on the geography of operations is also presented. revenues from external customers: 2017 2016 continuing operations £’000 £’000 uk 296,905 269,109 europe 14,666 13,343 usa 34,457 32,455 new zealand 196 — 346,224 314,907 carr’s group
