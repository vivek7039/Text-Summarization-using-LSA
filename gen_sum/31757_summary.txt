It also made a number of further recommendations which the Board has already begun to work towards implementing. We always welcome the views of all Carr’s Group plc stakeholders, particularly where it can lead to improvements in our governance framework. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES • Build business value by focusing on markets with growth potential • Grow and diversify our international footprint • Differentiate ourselves through innovation and technology • Lead in our chosen markets TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT PEOPLE ACQUISITIONS INNOVATION SERVICE EXCELLENCE ADDED VALUE AGRICULTURE ENGINEERING Carr’s Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 07 Business Strategies Focused on growth markets We aim to succeed by being selective in what we do.

Case Study: Simarghu® In 2017 the Group’s Workware division launched its Simarghu® range of arborist harnesses and products. The industry response has been extraordinary with arborists providing ongoing positive feedback and endless reviews/ discussions on social media. However, this was partially offset by a recovery in UK Agriculture as farmgate milk prices and farmer confidence improved. *Before amortisation and non-recurring items TIM DAVIES CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER Chief Executive’s Review OPERATING PROFIT* BY SECTOR AGRICULTURE ENGINEERING £8.6m 17.2% DOWN from 2016 £0.7m 74.2% DOWN from 2016 Carr’s Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 11 Strategic Report / Corporate Governance / Financial Statements UK AGRICUL TURE The recovery we witnessed in the first half in UK Agriculture continued into the second half with manufactured feed volumes, which includes compound feed and blends, increasing 10.9% year on year, against a national market rise of 6.6% 1 . On 5 June 2017 we acquired the trade and assets of Mortimer Feeds, a feed merchant business operating principally in Cheshire. On 31 October 2017 we acquired the entire issued share capital of Pearson Farm Supplies Ltd, an agricultural retail business with locations across Yorkshire, Lancashire and North West Wales. However well this is struck, the business will always be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Decisions that could have a material impact on the Group are reviewed as and when required at Board meetings. If the circumstances in these risks occur or are not successfully mitigated, our cash flow, operating results, financial position, business and reputation could be materially adversely affected. The Group has a comprehensive suite of IT security solutions in place, which are reviewed and tested by specialist third parties. The businesses have established good long term relationships with key customers to ensure that demands and expectations are met. Inability to retain key knowledge and adequately plan for succession could have a negative impact on the Group’s performance. Additionally, translational hedging instruments are sometimes used to limit the potential impact of fluctuating currencies on reported earnings from foreign subsidiaries. It was determined that none of these individual risks would, in isolation, compromise the Group’s viability. The Group also considered a number of scenarios that would represent serious threats to its liquidity. The Group set down a strategic plan three years ago, which is subject to ongoing monitoring and development as described below. Revenues have increased primarily as a result of higher sales volumes in the UK Agriculture business. NuVision Engineering, Inc. was acquired by the Group on 4 August 2017 for a total consideration of up to $20m. Management within the Group are also kept informed on issues that may affect employees which enables effective, transparent communication and consultation where appropriate. We intend to continue our successful working relationship with the Brathay Trust on future development programmes. During 2017, that support has taken a variety of forms including charitable monetary donations, fundraising and voluntary work.

The Code stipulates that there should be a clear division of responsibility between Board governance and executive management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) and its predecessor firms have been the Auditor for Carr’s Group plc since 1909. PwC’s current engagement partner is Bill MacLeod, and he has been in place since September 2013. CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS In formulating this policy, the Committee has taken into account guidance issued by shareholders and proxy agencies. The Company may reimburse any reasonable business related expenses incurred in connection with their role (including tax thereon if these are determined to be taxable benefits). Awards from 2018 onwards will be based on an EPS measure and may also include one or more additional measures of performance. Two year post-vesting holding period applies to the net of tax shares for awards granted in 2018 and beyond. Non-Executive Directors are engaged for terms of one year subject to appointment and reappointment at the Company’s AGM. Any such payments would be limited to a reasonable estimate of value of remuneration lost when leaving the former employer and would reflect the delivery mechanism (i.e. cash and/or share-based), time horizons and whether performance requirements are attached to that remuneration. There will be no automatic entitlement to a bonus if an Executive Director has ceased employment or is under notice. For good leavers under the deferred bonus plan, unvested awards will usually vest in full upon cessation. No person attends any part of a meeting at which his or her own remuneration is discussed.

New Bridge Street is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants’ Code of Conduct, which requires that its advice be objective and impartial. We reviewed the composition of future cash flows to ensure that all relevant elements were included or excluded as appropriate. We reviewed the valuations papers produced by management for each acquisition in conjunction with our valuation specialists. Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Carr’s Group plc continued Carr’s Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 51 Strategic Report / Corporate Governance / Financial Statements KEY AUDIT MATTER HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER RECEIVABLES PROVISIONING Within the Agriculture division there are material amounts of trade receivables that are past due and there has historically been a slower collection pattern within this division. There are also a number of overseas subsidiary companies, in the US and Germany, which report separately to these divisions. Carr’s Group plc has been selected as a full scope component due to its significant net assets balance, and the fact that the Group pension scheme is recognised within its accounts, which is a key audit matter as noted above. Carrs Billington Agriculture (Operations) Limited, an associate which the Group owns 49% of, has been selected for full scope reporting. We have held planning calls with the component auditors for both Carrs Billington Agriculture (Operations) Limited and Wälischmiller, to understand their planned audit approach and ensure that it provides the comfort we require as part of our Group audit.

schemes over the vesting periods. The Group has opted to use previous revaluations of property made under UK GAAP as deemed cost. IFRS 10 introduced a new definition of control which could affect whether an entity is consolidated into the Group accounts. On disposal of a foreign operation any cumulative exchange differences held in shareholders’ equity are transferred to the consolidated income statement. Note 26 provides further information on this scheme and how it has been accounted for in the consolidated accounts. Items that management consider fall into this category are also disclosed within a note to the financial statements. When construction is complete these assets are reclassified to the appropriate heading within property, plant and equipment. In addition, at each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that goodwill may be impaired. IFRS 9, “Financial instruments”, is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, and will therefore first apply to Carr’s in the year ending August 2019. IFRS 15, “Revenue from contracts with customers”, is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, and will therefore first apply to Carr’s in the year ending August 2019. IFRS 16, “Leases”, is effective for period beginning on or after 1 January 2019, and will therefore first apply to Carr’s in the year ending August 2020. In accordance with IFRS 8, entity wide disclosures based on the geography of operations is also presented.
