A full 3D seismic survey in southern Puesto Rojas is being processed and interpreted to plan for future drilling. Following more than a decade of domestic policy that stifled investment, the current Macri administration came into power in 2015. Since being elected, the administration has delivered significant advances with regard to foreign policy, economic normalisation and social reform.

This may be through acquisition, farm-in/out opportunities, joint ventures or partnerships in the Neuquina basin and other attractive basins throughout Argentina. This reflected lower levels of investment over the last several years coupled with stronger quota compliance among OPEC member countries continuing to suppress inventories. Argentine shale gas currently attracts a premium of approximately US$3.6 per MMbtu over the prevailing domestic price. We have continued the Vaca Muerta appraisal drilling programme on our Puesto Rojas and neighbouring concessions that we started in late 2016, completing four wells in 2017 and have also drilled an initial well into the tight- Agrio formation, also at Puesto Rojas, with encouraging initial results. Demonstrating the commerciality of our assets and bringing forward production through accelerating asset development is key to creating value.

This activity is expected to de-risk a significant portion of unconventional acreage and also provide the basis for robust production growth going forward.

During this post completion phase, we commissioned a new integrated financial reporting system that was implemented in Q4 2017 and went live on 1 January 2018. Taking these decisions so soon after completion was not easy and placed additional burden on our teams. Prior to that, he was the vice president and director, originating investment opportunities for a multi-billion dollar family office in Houston, USA. He is also a non-executive director of Etrion Corporation, Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd., Panoro Energy ASA and Petropavlovsk plc. He stepped down from Standard Chartered Bank in 2008 to focus on a portfolio career, working more closely with developing companies. Guillaume left ING/BBL Bank in 2000 to become head of credit and finance for Europe with Sempra Oil Trading SARL, Geneva. Additional meetings of the full board or its committees are organised on an ad-hoc basis as required. Similarly, individual members are excused from discussion related to their own appointment as chair of board committees. In accordance with Code provision C.3.1, at least one member of the committee is required to have recent and relevant financial experience. In addition, the scope of individual projects is monitored throughout their delivery to identify any potential conflicts as work progresses. Two- thirds of any bonus earned will be paid in cash, with the remainder being deferred Phoenix shares for a further three-year period, vesting pro-rata annually. In line with our policy, LTIP awards will also be subject to the group’s malus and clawback provisions. n/a 69 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity Performance measures Other benefits To provide non-cash benefits which are competitive in the market in which the executive director is employed. Awards granted under the LTIP to executive directors will have a performance period of at least three years. 50% of any net vested share awards (i.e. after sales to meet tax liabilities) must be retained until the minimum shareholding requirements are met. For these purposes, payments include the satisfaction of variable remuneration awards previously granted, but not vested, to an individual. LTIP performance measures are selected to ensure they align with the group’s strategy and long-term shareholder value creation.

Annual general meeting The company’s AGM will be held at Herbert Smith Freehills LLP, Exchange House, Primrose Street, London EC2A 2EG on 29 June 2018. Management has determined that there were no triggers for impairment in any of the other CGUs, having considered factors such as long term prices, interest rates, reserves and production. We challenged management’s key assumptions used in each valuation model for non-current assets including output volumes, capital expenditure, operating costs and the expected life of the assets, by comparing these assumptions against available external data and obtaining explanations for variances. Consistent with industry practice the group makes sales of crude oil and natural gas which are commodity products. This is because the main international benchmark prices used for pricing crude cargoes, such as Brent and WTI, are quoted in US Dollars. The group’s policy is to monitor goodwill at operating segment level before combining segments for reporting. This allocation is made because the exploration and evaluation asset has no cash inflows of its own. All costs incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of producing hydrocarbons have been demonstrated are capitalised within development assets on a field-by-field basis. Goodwill arising on the action of deferred taxes is allocated to cash generating units and assessed for impairment accordingly. Trade and other receivables are classified as current assets if receipt is due within one year or less. Trade and other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. However, the chief executive officer also receives information about segment revenue and capital expenditure on a monthly basis. Fair value has been assessed on a comparative transaction basis by reference to dollars-per-acre paid in other recent observable market transactions. Consequently there is an increase in the deferred tax provision recorded with a corresponding entry to goodwill. If collection of amounts is expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets. Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity- specific estimates. There is no recent history of credit loss, non-payment or default by YPF in relation to oil and gas sales.
