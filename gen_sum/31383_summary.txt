resources plc strategic report 12 chief executive officer’s statement continued phoenix will also continue to invest in its conventional reserves in the neuquina basin, that provide the company with low risk and high netback production. the company’s initial focus is on appraising, de-risking and developing this large unconventional asset base. this may be through acquisition, farm-in/out opportunities, joint ventures or partnerships in the neuquina basin and other attractive basins throughout argentina. this reflected lower levels of investment over the last several years coupled with stronger quota compliance among opec member countries continuing to suppress inventories. source: argentine ministry of energy source: argentine ministry of energy source: instituto mosconi source:

operated a semi- regulated pricing regime that was removed in october 2017. sales contracts are typically priced by reference to brent with a location/quality discount applied. argentina has little to no coal reserves and relies heavily on gas for power generation. argentine shale gas currently attracts a premium of approximately us$3.6 per mmbtu over the prevailing domestic price. the oil and gas industry in argentina benefits from a degree of natural hedge protection from currency risk as sales contracts for oil are denominated in us dollars by reference to the brent benchmark price. we focus our exploration and appraisal work where we have significant contiguous acreage positions – such as the puesto rojas/malargüe area – and where our acreage is proximate to areas where others have found success – for instance at mata mora, which sits close to a number of successful vaca muerta producing licences, including sierras blancas and loma compana. we have continued the vaca muerta appraisal drilling programme on our puesto rojas and neighbouring concessions that we started in late 2016, completing four wells in 2017 and have also drilled an initial well into the tight- agrio formation, also at puesto rojas, with encouraging initial results. demonstrating the commerciality of our assets and bringing forward production through accelerating asset development is key to creating value.

in january 2018, with an initial rate of approximately 1,200 mscfd. at 31 december 2017, us$162.6 million (including accrued interest) was outstanding under the bridging and working capital facility. in addition to this facility, the group had a total of us$29.9 million borrowings locally in argentina at 31 december 2017. the argentina borrowings are with a small selection of local banks and carry fixed interest rates ranging from 2.2% to 4.25% for us dollar denominated loans and fixed interest rates ranging from 20.0% to 27.0% for argentine peso denominated loans. consideration has been given

personal freedom is a fundamental human right. the reporting processes, most importantly in respect of whistle- blowing, are also dual language, and we provide our staff the opportunity to report concerns or potential non-compliant behaviour through our external legal counsel as an alternative to reporting internally. the majority of our exploration and production operations are located in high-altitude desert areas. this system has helped us to minimise the use of fresh water in our operations. anyone working at, or visiting, a phoenix operational site is provided with personal protective equipment appropriate to the location and will also be allocated to a supervisor or guide who is responsible for their safety while on site. taking these decisions so soon after completion was not easy and placed additional burden on our teams. in conclusion as a board we are committed to continual improvement and enhancement of our governance arrangements. philip also brings a strong understanding of the london market and its attendant governance requirements. finally, guillaume vermersch also joined the board as one of two mercuria appointees alongside matthieu milandri. the continued support of our major shareholder is important in this initial growth stage for phoenix. prior to that, he was the vice president and director, originating investment opportunities for a multi-billion dollar family office in houston, usa. he is also a non-executive director of etrion corporation, gulf keystone petroleum ltd., panoro energy asa and petropavlovsk plc. he stepped down from standard chartered bank in 2008 to focus on a portfolio career, working more closely with developing companies. guillaume left ing/bbl bank in 2000 to become head of credit and finance for europe

take account of individual circumstances such as, but not limited to, payment of tax, financial, and/or legal adviser fees, expatriate allowance, relocation expenses, housing allowance and tax equalisation (including associated interest, penalties or fees plus, in certain circumstances or where the committee consider it appropriate, any tax incurred on such benefits). bonuses will be based primarily on a combination of stretching annual business and individual objectives. awards granted under the ltip to executive directors will have a performance period of at least three years. 50% of any net vested share awards (i.e. after sales to meet tax liabilities) must be retained until the minimum shareholding requirements are met. for these purposes, payments include the satisfaction of variable remuneration awards previously granted, but not vested, to an individual. ltip performance measures are selected to ensure they align with the group’s strategy and long-term shareholder value

director remuneration policy for 2018 non-executive director fees were set on admission taking into account competitive practice for similar roles in other international e&p companies and ftse-listed companies of similar size. the group principally generates cash from its existing conventional oil and gas production operations. management has determined that there were no triggers for impairment in any of the other cgus, having considered factors such as long term prices, interest rates, reserves and production. we challenged management’s key assumptions used in each valuation model for non-current assets including output volumes, capital expenditure, operating costs and the expected life of the assets, by comparing these assumptions against available external data and obtaining explanations for variances. where work was performed by our component auditors in argentina, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work for each reporting unit to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as phoenix global resources plc 90 independent auditors’ report continued a basis for our opinion on the group financial statements as a whole. 3. significant accounting policies 3.1 new accounting standards issued but not yet effective standards issued and relevant to the group, but not yet effective at the date of these group financial statements are listed below. consistent with industry practice the group makes sales of crude oil and natural gas which are commodity products. this is because the main international benchmark prices used for pricing crude cargoes, such as brent and wti, are quoted in us dollars. strategic report governance financial statements other information annual report and accounts 2017 101 4. critical accounting estimates and judgements continued determination of joint control judgement is required to determine when the joint control exists over an arrangement. in addition, the selection of specific valuation methods for individual assets and liabilities requires judgment. where these items represent benefits they are recorded as intangible assets and separately identified. deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences that exist only where it is probable that taxable profits will be generated against which the carrying value of the deferred tax asset can be recovered. the group’s policy is to monitor goodwill at operating segment level before combining segments for reporting. this allocation is made because the exploration and evaluation asset has no cash inflows of its own. all costs incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of producing hydrocarbons have been demonstrated are capitalised within development assets on a field-by-field basis. any periodic reassessment of reserves will affect the depreciation rate on a prospective basis. the increased deferred tax liability is recorded in purchase accounting with a corresponding entry to goodwill. goodwill arising on the action of deferred taxes is allocated to cash generating units and assessed for impairment accordingly. financial assets other than loans and receivables are permitted to be reclassified out of the held for trading category only in rare circumstances arising from a single event that is unusual and highly unlikely to recur in the near term. dividends on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and available for sale equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss as part of revenue from continuing operations when the group’s right to receive payments is established. interest income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is included in net gains/(losses). interest on available for sale securities, held to maturity investments and loans and receivables calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the statement of profit or loss as part of revenue from continuing operations. trade and other receivables are classified as current assets if receipt is due within one year or less. trade and other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. however, the chief executive officer also receives information about segment revenue and capital expenditure on a monthly basis. the accumulated capitalised costs associated with puesto pozo cercado of us$8,238,000 have been expensed accordingly. argentina 97 48 united kingdom 3 – united states of america 2 – 102 48 phoenix global resources plc financial statements 112 notes to the

reference to dollars-per-acre paid in other recent observable market transactions. consequently there is an increase in the deferred tax provision recorded with a corresponding entry to goodwill. if collection of amounts is expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets. in 2016, us$698,000 related to an outstanding receivable from a customer that had entered administration proceedings. under tax plan arrangements taxes due are paid in instalments with interest charged on the outstanding principal. these instruments are included in level 1. level 2: the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity- specific estimates. there is no impact on other components of equity as the group is not party to any financial instruments, such as hedging instruments) where currency gains and losses would be recognised in other comprehensive income (2016: none). there is no recent history of credit loss, non-payment or default by ypf in relation to oil and gas sales. this calculation is done on a first-in/first-out basis by reference to accumulated net income within retained earnings. in addition, all land must be returned to its natural state at the cessation of production operations. there are no contingent payments associated with operating leases that the group is party to. a relationship agreement is in place between the company and mercuria energy group limited. the relationship agreement also requires directors nominated by mercuria to recuse themselves from certain board decisions. as part of the renegotiation integra oil & gas s.a. has agreed to relinquish any interest in these concessions and the company is in discussion with integra oil & gas s.a. to agree an appropriate level of compensation. trade and other receivables are classified as current assets if receipt is due within one year or less. trade and other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from
