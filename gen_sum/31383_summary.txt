interest rates, reserves and production. this is because the main international benchmark prices used for pricing crude cargoes, such as brent and wti, are quoted in us dollars. all costs incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of producing hydrocarbons have been demonstrated are capitalised within development assets on a field-by-field basis. goodwill arising on the action of deferred taxes is allocated to cash generating units and assessed for impairment accordingly. trade and other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. fair value has been assessed on a comparative transaction basis by reference to dollars-per-acre paid in other recent observable market transactions. these instruments are included in level 1. level 2: the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity- specific estimates. there is no recent history of credit loss, non-payment or default by ypf in relation to oil and gas sales. trade and other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. the estimated
