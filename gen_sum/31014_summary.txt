Even more positively, the developments in new technologies such as electric vehicles and improved battery storage should create significant incremental demand for associated materials. As a result, we expect coal prices to be higher for longer than the market consensus (which is rising already). We are pleased to have executed one of these and would hope for more in the current year. We have an undrawn revolving credit facility and believe this can be comfortably expanded whilst retaining low borrowing metrics. Strong earnings have translated directly into cash flow, we are debt free and see many opportunities in what is still a capital constrained sector. A further theme that has supported underlying prices in certain commodities is speculation over future electric vehicle (EV) demand. Cobalt also saw significant price gains (+130% YoY) from a combination of EV demand and long expected structural supply issues. Private equity investors showed a preference for copper, which saw ~70% of investment, with Africa being the most popular jurisdiction, seeing 13 deals, totalling US$1,036m (45%; 2017). A major driver for 2018 will be continued supply-side constraints driven in part by Chinese environmental reform initiatives which should continue to negatively impact supply. A fully diversified portfolio can help to reduce the level of income volatility, stabilising cash flows which contribute towards investment and dividend payments. Exploration success, or lower cut-off grades as a result of rising commodity prices, can serve to increase economic reserves and resources.

It is risks that fall into this category which are primarily outside of management’s ability to either manage or mitigate, other than by monitoring. • Mine collapse • Natural disaster • Destruction of infrastructure • Resource nationalisation • Resource contamination • Failure by royalty counterparty to make payments • Improvement in commodity prices • Inflows into mining funds • Availability of debt • Demand for commodities • Global GDP growth Monitor These risks, by their nature, are difficult to predict or influence. LIKELIHOOD : MEDIUM / LOW The Group has a significant global network of brokers, advisors and consultants who constantly bring deal-flow. • Recovery in the mining sector • Inflows into private equity funds • Low bond yields entice life assurance / pension funds • Change of focus from precious metal peers Continue to scale Anglo Pacific has considerable first mover advantage in a capital-intensive business model, with a highly cash generative portfolio to leverage and facilitate growth. It also has considerable contacts throughout the sector to generate deal-flow along with expertise in terms of appraising and valuing royalty transactions. LIKELIHOOD : MEDIUM / LOW Some direct competition exists but this has not had a material impact on our growth hitherto. • Sudden adverse change in equity market conditions • The Group’s cost of capital makes executing accretive deals more challenging • Production issues or significant price volatility could adversely impact on the Group’s borrowing capacity • Execution risk through inadequate immediate access to finance High quality deal-flow It is managements’ view that high quality, accretive deals should always be capable of being financed.

This was confirmed by Largo on February 9, 2018 which it expected to result in higher demand for high strength low alloy vanadium steel. Longer term, vanadium has also been proven to be highly efficient in the manufacture and performance of large battery storage technology. Anglo Pacific earns a royalty over all throughput from the EVBC process plant and is not restricted to licence geographic boundaries.

VALUATION The Jogjakarta royalty interest is accounted for as an available-for-sale debt instrument at fair value, currently deemed to be £nil. Also included is the fair value movement on our royalty assets which are accounted for as IAS 39 debt instruments. Whitehaven are also experiencing changing roof conditions earlier than expected, which has slowed down the pace of mining. Thermal coal prices were very resilient during 2017 and remained at levels well in advance of most commentators’ expectations. DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS IN NEW ACQUISITIONS When conducting due diligence, environmental, social and governance issues are considered as these are critical to the long-term success of a project and the industry generally, which in turn, is key to Anglo Pacific’s success. Anglo Pacific welcomes this focus as respect for human rights is implicit across the Group’s employment practices. Anglo Pacific is a relatively small organisation, with 10 employees, which means that any emission sources within its operational and financial control, such as business travel, purchase of electricity, heat or cooling by the Group, are not material in their impact. He began his career working for Lord Rothschild as an in-house corporate financier, managing a portfolio of public and private equity investments before co-founding Active Value Advisors Ltd. to invest in undervalued, predominantly UK-listed companies, where he advised on more than US$900.0m of funds over a 12-year period. Mr. Treger holds external Non-Executive Directorships with Mantos Copper S.A., EBT Digital Communications Retail Group, Broadwell Capital and Ilari Exploration OY for which he earned fees during the year. The current Executive Director’s service contract is for an indefinite term and contains a notice period of six months, which is in line with the Company’s continuing policy that service contracts should not have a notice period of more than one year. The service contract of Mr. Treger provides for a six-month notice period and an additional termination payment equivalent to six months’ basic salary. In summary, the contractual provisions for Executive Directors are as follows: Provision Detailed terms Notice period One year or less. Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the Annual Remuneration Report as they arise. For the benefits and bonus per employee, this is based on those employees eligible to participate in such schemes. Where there were indicators of impairment reversal for royalty assets we evaluated whether it was appropriate to reverse previous impairments.

Evaluation expenditure arises from a detailed assessment of deposits or other projects that have been identified as having economic potential. After initial recognition these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. FI N A N C I A L S T A T EM E N T S APG_AR17_28.03.18_BACK_ARTWORK ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 86 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended December 31, 2017 (c) Derivative financial instruments The Group will selectively enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with its Australian dollar denominated royalty income, when considered necessary. Expected future cash flows are determined based on non-observable market data such as commodity price forecasts and estimated production schedules. (h) Borrowings Interest bearing bank facilities are initially recognised at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. Impairment losses relating to available-for-sale equity investments are recognised when the decline in fair value is considered significant or prolonged, which are defined as follows: • Prolonged: a period of greater than 18 months that the interest’s fair value is below cost; or • Significant: a decline in fair value of greater than 25% relative to an individual asset’s original acquisition cost, or its rebased cost post impairment. This dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the AGM and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements. This amount had previously been provided for with a corresponding deferred acquisition cost asset (see note 18) which was transferred to intangibles on payment in the year. There have been no developments at Amapá during the year ended December 31, 2017, that would result in a reversal of management’s assessment. A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses which may be carried forward indefinitely. The Group’s credit risk on foreign exchange forward contracts is mitigated by entering into these agreements with large financial institutions. Fair values for these securities have been determined by reference to their quoted bid prices at the reporting date.
