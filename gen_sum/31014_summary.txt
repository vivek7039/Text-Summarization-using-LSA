(2016: 15.60p) + 235% cash flow from operations this is my first report as chairman, having assumed the role after the 2017 agm. thermal coal and vanadium prices were also strong which contributed to the group’s record performance. basic and diluted earnings per share were 5.88p compared with 15.60p in 2016. stripping out these non-cash items, we present an adjusted earnings measure (refer to note 11 to the accounts) which, we believe, more closely reflects the performance within management’s control. our principal objective, however, remains the acquisition of producing or near production royalty and streaming assets. corporate culture and governance anglo pacific seeks to maintain the highest standards in all areas of its business. even more positively, the developments in new technologies such as electric vehicles and improved battery storage should create significant incremental demand for associated materials. as a result, we expect coal prices to be higher for longer than the market consensus (which is rising already). we are pleased to have executed one of these and would hope for more in the current year. we have an undrawn revolving credit facility and believe this can be comfortably expanded whilst retaining low borrowing metrics. as such, and on a cash basis, shareholders will actually receive 7.375p per share in the next 12 months. a further theme that has supported underlying prices in certain commodities is speculation over future electric vehicle (ev) demand. cobalt also saw significant price gains (+130% yoy) from a combination of ev demand and long expected structural supply issues. a major driver for 2018 will be continued supply-side constraints driven in part by chinese environmental reform initiatives which should continue to negatively impact supply. a fully diversified portfolio can help to reduce the level of income volatility, stabilising cash flows which contribute towards investment and dividend payments. exploration success, or lower cut-off grades as a result of rising commodity prices, can serve to increase economic reserves and resources. increased reserves will extend a mine’s life, or facilitate an expansion of the existing operations. how we create value for our counterparties an investment by anglo pacific, after conducting thorough due diligence, is seen as an endorsement of the project, which can provide other stakeholders with greater confidence and possibly result in a re-rating for the operator. primary royalties alternative form of finance to conventional debt providing greater flexibility and which does not impact on credit ratings royalties and streams do not typically levy interest, nor do they typically require principal repayments or have a maturity date. more importantly, unlike conventional debt arrangements where interest payments tend to start immediately or are capitalised until cash payments can be made from a project’s cash flow, most royalties are payable only once the project comes into production and is generating sales. apg_ar17_28.03.18_front_artwork group overview strategic report governance financial statements other information 13 anglo pacific group plc

guidance accordingly. thermal coal prices were very resilient during 2017 and remained at levels well in advance of most commentators’ expectations. this is due to listing costs being a function of market capitalisation, which increased during the year. elsewhere, the increase is primarily attributable to withholding tax on a higher level of royalty income during 2017. 255 235 215 195 £m 275 175

diligence process in new acquisitions when conducting due diligence, environmental, social and governance issues are considered as these are critical to the long-term success of a project and the industry generally, which in turn, is key to anglo pacific’s success. anglo pacific welcomes this focus as respect for human rights is implicit across the group’s employment practices. anglo pacific is a relatively small organisation, with 10 employees, which means that any emission sources within its operational and financial control, such as business travel, purchase of electricity, heat or cooling by the group, are not material in their impact. mr. meier’s other commitments are shown on page 45, none of which is considered to be significant. mr. meier also served as a director on the board of rbc’s main operating subsidiary in europe. he began his career working for lord rothschild as an in-house corporate financier, managing a portfolio of public and private equity investments

non-executive directors were appointed for an initial three-year term, renewable at the board’s discretion for up to two further three-year periods thereafter, and the board intends that all future non-executive director appointments will be on similar terms. the committee will continue to review its activities in light of any regulatory developments going forward. in addition, the company has introduced a private health insurance scheme on behalf of all staff. as business development is now focused on royalty acquisitions, incentives are heavily weighted towards longer-term performance. currently, for an executive director, this would include a potential annual bonus of no more than 100%. the current executive director’s service contract is for an indefinite term and contains a notice period of six months, which is in line with the company’s continuing policy that service contracts should not have a notice period of more than one year. the service contract of mr. treger provides for a six-month notice period and an additional termination payment equivalent to six months’ basic salary. in summary, the contractual provisions for executive directors are as follows:

general information anglo pacific group plc (the ‘company’) and its subsidiaries (together, the ‘group’) secure natural resources royalties and streams by creating new royalties directly with operators or by acquiring existing royalties. apg_ar17_28.03.18_back_artwork anglo pacific group plc annual report & accounts 2017 81 group overview strategic report governance financial statements other information notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2017 a summary of the group’s accounting approach is set out below: accounting classification substance of contractual terms accounting treatment examples intangible assets • simple royalty with no right to receive cash other than through a royalty related to production • investment is presented as an intangible asset and carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment provision • royalty income is recognised as revenue in the income statement • intangible asset is amortised on a systematic basis • intangible asset is assessed for indicators of impairment at each period end • narrabri • maracás menchen • four mile • salamanca • pilbara • ring of fire available-for-sale debt financial asset • royalty arrangement with a contractual right to receive cash (e.g. through a mandated interest rate or milestones which, if not met, trigger repayment) • financial asset is recognised at fair value on the balance sheet • changes in fair value due to changes in expected future cash flows are recognised within the income statement with other valuation changes taken to reserves • fixed effective interest income recognised in the income statement • royalty receipts reduce the asset’s carrying value • jogjakarta • dugbe 1 • mcclean lake • piauí* available-for-sale equity financial assets • similar in contractual terms to an intangible asset • however, includes a right to convert into equity (noting that for evbc this right was subsequently extinguished) • financial asset is carried at fair value with fair value movements recognised in reserves • royalty income is recognised as revenue in the income statement • asset is assessed for impairment at each reporting period end • evbc investment property • direct ownership of sub-stratum land • returns based on royalty related production • investment property is carried at fair value on the balance sheet • movements in fair value recognised in income statement • royalty income is recognised as revenue in the income statement • kestrel • crinum * due to having one or more embedded options that are not closely related, the group has decided to evoke the fair value option for piauí. this advice involved the interpretation of certain tax legislation for which there is no clear precedent or guidance. it is expected that where applicable, these standards and amendments will be adopted on each respective effective date. once a mining project has been established as commercially viable, expenditure other than that on land, buildings, plant and equipment is capitalised as a producing asset within ‘other assets’ together with any amount transferred from ‘exploration and evaluation costs’ (note 3.6(b)). evaluation expenditure arises from a detailed assessment of deposits or other projects that have been identified as having economic potential. amortisation of capitalised exploration and evaluation costs does not commence until the underlying project commences commercial production. after initial recognition these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. fi n a n c i a l s t a t em e n t s apg_ar17_28.03.18_back_artwork anglo pacific group plc annual report & accounts 2017 86 notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2017 (c) derivative financial instruments the group will selectively enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with its australian dollar denominated royalty income, when considered necessary. upon initial recognition an effective interest rate is computed based on the estimated future cash flows. expected future cash flows are determined based on non-observable market data such as commodity price forecasts and estimated production schedules. (h) borrowings interest bearing bank facilities are initially recognised at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. impairment losses relating to available-for-sale equity investments are recognised when the decline in fair value is considered significant or prolonged, which are defined as follows: • prolonged: a period of greater than 18 months that the interest’s fair value is below cost; or • significant: a decline in fair value of greater than 25% relative to an individual asset’s original acquisition cost, or its rebased cost post impairment. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established. under this scheme the group makes contributions to personal pension plans of individual directors and employees. this dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the agm and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements. the net royalty income from this investment is currently taxed in australia at a rate of 30%. there have been no developments at amapá during the year ended december 31, 2017, that would result in a reversal of management’s assessment. fi n a n c i a l s t a t em e n t s apg_ar17_28.03.18_back_artwork anglo pacific group plc annual report & accounts 2017 100 notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2017 17 mining and explor ation interests group £’000 company £’000 fair value at january 1, 2016 10,898 8,259 mining and exploration interests received in lieu of payment 47 – disposals (3,431) (3,326) revaluation adjustment 9,534 8,928 foreign currency translation 14 – at december 31, 2016 17,062 13,861 disposals (2,424) (2,424) revaluation adjustment 1,737 1,836 foreign currency translation 56 – at december 31, 2017 16,431 13,273 the current strategy of the group is to obtain royalties by other means, and as such, these assets, which have historically been acquired with a view to negotiating royalty acquisitions, have been gradually disposed of as they are now non-core to the group’s primary business. a deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses which may be carried forward indefinitely. the credit risk on bank deposits is mitigated by banking with household name financial institutions in reputable jurisdictions. the group’s credit risk on foreign exchange forward contracts is mitigated by entering into these agreements with large financial institutions. this is expected to be a less significant part of the group’s strategy going forward. fair values for these securities have been determined by reference to their quoted bid prices at the reporting date. 897608 telephone: +44 (0)20 3435 7400 fax: +44 (0)20 7629 0370 website www.anglopacificgroup.com shareholders please contact the respective registrar if you have any queries about your shareholding. readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements may not be appropriate other than for purposes outlined in this annual report. if any such risks actually occur, they could materially adversely affect the group’s business, financial condition or results of operations. the group’s management relies upon this forward- looking information in its estimates, projections, plans and analysis.
