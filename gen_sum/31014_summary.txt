positively, the developments in new technologies such as electric vehicles and improved battery storage should create significant incremental demand for associated materials. as a result, we expect coal prices to be higher for longer than the market consensus (which is rising already). a major driver for 2018 will be continued supply-side constraints driven in part by chinese environmental reform initiatives which should continue to negatively impact supply. a fully diversified portfolio can help to reduce the level of income volatility, stabilising cash flows which contribute towards investment and dividend payments. exploration success, or lower cut-off grades as a result of rising commodity prices, can serve to increase economic reserves and resources.

report & accounts 2017 80 consolidated statement of cash flows and company statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2017 1 general information anglo pacific group plc (the ‘company’) and its subsidiaries (together, the ‘group’) secure natural resources royalties and streams by creating new royalties directly with operators or by acquiring existing royalties. evaluation expenditure arises from a detailed assessment of deposits or other projects that have been identified as having economic potential. expected future cash flows are determined based on non-observable market data such as commodity price forecasts and estimated production schedules. this dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the agm and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements. there have been no developments at amapá during the year ended december 31, 2017, that would result in a reversal of management’s assessment. the group’s credit risk on foreign exchange forward contracts is mitigated by entering into these agreements with large financial institutions. readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements may not be appropriate other than for purposes outlined in this annual report. if any such risks actually occur, they could materially adversely affect the group’s business, financial condition or results of operations.
