fractured basements are a global phenomenon which have been produced successfully for extended periods in multiple locations around the world. hurricane’s licences are focussed on the rona ridge, a

the ukcs. this allows uncertainties associated with the reservoir to be removed whilst commencing a phased development and generating cash flow. following first oil, with data from the eps being generated and no imminent funding hurdles, we will be in a strong position to move towards establishing the value that can be ascribed to our overall acreage holdings. our focus has extended beyond drilling additional exploration and appraisal wells, when funding allows, to transitioning towards organic cash generation. as john van der welle sets out in his report as chairman of the lgc, we have taken a number of those steps already and will continue to ensure that your company becomes and thereafter remains code compliant. lancaster eps – the key to delivering our strategy overview • 2-well

plc annual report and group financial statements year ended 31 december 2017 overview strategic report governance financial statements the year was marked by the significant progress made on the eps, the first stage of development of our rona ridge assets. efficient development of a resource base as large as ours will necessarily involve significantly greater surface infrastructure than included for the eps, and associated investment that exceeds the funding capacity currently available to hurricane on a sole basis. fractured basements are a global phenomenon which have been produced successfully for extended periods in multiple locations around the world. in addition, a further 486.1 million stock tank barrels of oil were assigned as 2c contingent resources. in december 2017, we published a further cpr, incorporating the results of our lincoln and halifax exploration wells. the group has contracted transocean’s paul b. loyd jr., a harsh environment semi-submersible rig for this work. as we look beyond the eps, our challenge is to ensure that appraisal and development costs reflect ongoing oil price uncertainty and strive to deliver value throughout the cycle as either sellers or holders of our rona ridge assets. hurricane has shown that, using appropriate contract structures, a sufficiently attractive project can take advantage of these conditions and proceed to development on an independent basis. analysis to date suggests target production rates are well within capacity of two eps wells. initial planning work for future stages of development through infrastructure investment and potentially tying back appraisal wells has commenced – see 2018 kpis. performance targets are separate and distinct from vcp milestones, which represent longer term hurdles in delivering the group’s strategy. maintain eps progress on schedule and budget to achieve first oil in h1 2019, including obtaining required permits. 16 17 strategic report financial

condition and operations. contingency is built into all project plans to allow for unexpected delays and cost overruns. analysis of gas isotope data indicated that the encountered hydrocarbon is sourced from the same ‘kitchen’ area as lancaster and is therefore most likely to be a light oil of a similar api gravity to lancaster. further appraisal work will also be required to test the company’s exploration model that halifax and lancaster are part of a single hydrocarbon accumulation. “ the well was a discovery, encountering a hydrocarbon column of approximately 1km tvt” increase

including the whirlwind and strathmore discoveries as reported in 2013. rps has agreed with hurricane’s view that halifax has comparable reservoir properties to lancaster. halifax water properties are also comparable to lancaster, indicating the potential for a common aquifer. in another example of innovative contracting, bluewater is incentivised to reach first oil and deliver stable production through an incentive tariff. hurricane has shown that it has an effective working relationship with petrofac facilities management limited and transocean on previous drilling campaigns, and is looking forward to using the paul b. loyd jr. rig for well completions later this year. these charges were partially offset by a fair value gain on derivative financial instruments related to the convertible bond and foreign exchange gains. to this end the group raised a total of $547 million in two fund raises (before expenses). upon receipt of fdp approval in september 2017 , for tax purposes, the group

related areas. we provide a clear feedback structure, establish appropriate operating practices and implement training programmes to ensure effective delivery on our policies. we continually work with them, sharing best practice and seeking out synergies to improve performance. finding workable solutions both for our business, and the oil industry as a whole, is important to us. the hsem committee ensures that an effective system of standards, policies, procedures and practices are in place. we aim to create an inclusive culture where employees of any background can be themselves and fulfil their potential. we provide opportunities both formally and informally for people to share their views with senior management. our focus is on making accountabilities and responsibilities clear so that everyone can contribute positively to the safety culture we are building at hurricane. risks are monitored through a hierarchy of control where safety performance is reviewed in accordance with the incident reporting procedure. safety performance across the business is measured against a range of internal targets which are continually monitored and revised. hurricane requires that our offshore contractors’ operations (well, pipeline and installation operators) are fully certified under iso 14001 environmental management system or equivalent. sustainability report continued board

annual compensation to drive delivery of near-term targets, with an additional overarching long-term incentive plan to maintain a longer-term focus on generating value for shareholders. element link

be unlikely to make significant changes except in cases where an individual’s responsibility or role had changed, or if it became evident that a realignment with market rates was required. performance measures are separate and distinct from vcp milestones which represent longer term hurdles in delivering the group’s strategy. the performance measures are ambitious and not expected to be fully achieved in every year. no specific on-target level of performance is formally communicated below the maximum amounts for full achievement. 50 51 overview strategic report governance financial

remuneration charts: 1. minimum performance includes only base salary, benefits and cash in lieu of pension. dr robert trice participated in this plan and has 225,000 options outstanding at an exercise price of £1.00. these options are exercisable from 25 january 2014 to 31 december 2020 although currently they have no intrinsic value. the maximum value to executive directors and employees is therefore zero at current share prices or using any recent average, as required under companies act illustrations. without a maturity event, the maximum vesting based on milestone scoring to date would be 65%. the size and scope of hurricane’s operations at this stage in its development would make any consultation process ineffective. as outlined above, the vcp is structured so that it cannot

does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivatives, for speculative purposes. this is because the derivatives themselves are not traded on an active market and their fair values are determined by a valuation technique that uses one key input that is not based on observable market data, being share price volatility. this is because the foreign currency swaps themselves are not traded on an active market. however, their fair values are determined by valuation techniques that use observable market data, e.g. foreign exchange rates. 28. subsequent events 28.1. share incentive
