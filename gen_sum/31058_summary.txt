group financial statements year ended 31 december 2017 10 11 hurricane energy plc annual report and group financial statements year ended 31 december 2017 overview strategic report governance financial statements the year was marked by the significant progress made on the eps, the first stage of development of our rona ridge assets. fractured basements are a global phenomenon which have been produced successfully for extended periods in multiple locations around the world. hurricane has shown that, using appropriate contract structures, a sufficiently attractive project can take advantage of these conditions and proceed to development on an independent basis. initial planning work for future stages of development through infrastructure investment and potentially tying back appraisal wells has commenced – see 2018 kpis. performance targets are separate and distinct from vcp milestones, which represent longer term hurdles in delivering the group’s strategy. if this fails, or is not available on reasonable commercial terms, it may result in delays to field development, production and cash generation. further appraisal work will also be required to test the company’s exploration model that halifax and lancaster are part of a single hydrocarbon accumulation. in another example of innovative contracting, bluewater is incentivised to reach first oil and deliver stable production through an incentive tariff. these charges were partially offset by a fair value gain on derivative financial instruments related to the convertible bond and foreign exchange gains. upon receipt of fdp approval in september 2017 , for tax purposes, the group is considered to have commenced trading. a potential ring fence expenditure supplement claim could also be made which would result in additional trading losses of 65.0 million. we provide a clear feedback structure, establish appropriate operating practices and implement training programmes to ensure effective delivery on our policies. finding workable solutions both for our business, and the oil industry as a whole, is important to us. we aim to create an inclusive culture where employees of any background can be themselves and fulfil their potential. our focus is on making accountabilities and responsibilities clear so that everyone can contribute positively to the safety culture we are building at hurricane. risks are monitored through a hierarchy of control where safety performance is reviewed in accordance with the incident reporting procedure. safety performance across the business is measured against a range of internal targets which are continually monitored and revised. hurricane requires that our offshore contractors’ operations (well, pipeline and installation operators) are fully certified under iso 14001 environmental management system or equivalent. sustainability report continued board approval this strategic report was approved by the board on 9 april 2018 and signed on its behalf by: dr robert trice chief executive officer during the year, we did not have any significant environmental incidents and we were not subject to any fines arising out of our activities. previously he was managing director of consulting at rps energy ltd, a leading upstream technical consultancy and reserve auditor. as our institutional shareholder base increased, the company’s engagement and consultation with its shareholders have both been strengthened. it is anticipated that full compliance with these code provisions will be attained later in the 2018 financial year. any potential or actual conflicted matters are identified and acted upon accordingly, via a conflict of interest policy. each director must retire at the third agm following their last appointment or re-appointment in a general meeting. a formal tender process should be considered at least every five years and the committee will keep this under review. audit and risk committee chairman’s report continued name

for all other board members to meet with any potential candidates. element link to strategy operation maximum limit performance assessment base salary supports recruitment, retention and motivation of

financial statements hurricane energy plc annual report and group financial statements year ended 31 december 2017 element link to strategy operation maximum limit performance assessment long-term share based incentive plans – vcp incentivises management to achieve the company’s strategy of de-risking and monetising its resource base. on 18 december both dr david jenkins and john van der welle forfeited their awards for nil consideration, in order that they could be deemed independent under the code. the maximum value to executive directors and employees is therefore zero at current share prices or using any recent average, as required under companies act illustrations. the size and scope of hurricane’s operations at this stage in its development would make any consultation process ineffective. as outlined above, the vcp is structured so that it cannot lead to dilution of greater than 8.4% upon successful vesting. independence of committee members name independence dr david jenkins no (will revert to being independent upon appointment of the new chairman) john van der welle yes dr robert arnott* deemed independent on appointment as company chairman roy kelly** no * resigned 8 november 2017. key observations we are satisfied that it is appropriate to fully impair the tempest / typhoon and strathmore assets. we highlight however that successful development of these assets is dependent on additional (currently uncommitted) funding being received. group statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 31 december 2017 independent auditor’s report
