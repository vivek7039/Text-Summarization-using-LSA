at gr oup and significant component level to r espond to the risk, r ecognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one r esulting fr om err or , as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misr epr esentations, or thr ough collusion. • w e scoped the audit based on entities that significantly contribute to underlying pr ofit befor e tax (gr eater than 15%), ther eafter based on material components in or der to obtain suf ficient coverage of the gr oup. we focused on the following key audit matters: • complex and judgemental areas of revenue recognition. • post r etir ement mortality: scheme specific base tables ar e used with an allowance for future improvements in life expectancy based on recent projections. these projections will depend on future expectations of improvements in life expectancy and are therefore uncertain. the dir ectors ar e also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the pr eparation of financial statements that ar e fr ee fr om material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. this may mean that amounts previously recognised in other compr ehensive income ar e r eclassified to pr ofit or loss. development costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique softwar e pr oducts contr olled by the gr oup, and that will generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year , are recognised as intangible assets. proper ty , plant and equipment assets ar e stated at their net book amount (historical cost less accumulated depreciation). they are included in curr ent assets, except for maturities gr eater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. these advances ar e r eflected in the consolidated balance sheet as part of trade receivables. full actuarial valuations of the gr oup’ s defined benefit schemes ar e carried out at least every three years. items classified as exceptional items may include, but ar e not limited to: gains or losses arising fr om the sale of businesses and investments; closur e costs for businesses; r estructuring costs; pr ofessional fees in r espect of acquisitions; post acquisition integration costs; post acquisition adjustments to balance sheet items; and other cr edits and charges of a non-recurring nature that require inclusion in order to provide additional insight into the underlying business performance. the carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values. significant judgement is r equir ed in determining the worldwide pr ovision for income taxes. this enables the group to determine a best estimate of life expectancy that is appropriate for accounting purposes. ifrs 15 includes pr escriptive guidance to deal with specific scenarios and requires more extensive disclosures. the group will also defer revenue in respect of other performance obligations that are separate and distinct, which is not expected to be significant. business segment analysis the group is organised on a worldwide basis into three main segments:
