Serica’s target over the past two/three years has been to diversify the risk associated with being reliant on Erskine as a single production source and grow into a profitable mid-tier independent oil and gas producer through an acquisition led strategy, concentrating on assets where we believed that we could add value through our own expertise. These fields hold significant potential which Serica believes it can unlock as a focused, low cost and innovative operator under the leadership of Mitch Flegg who joined us as Chief Executive upon announcement of the transaction. However, we will also continue to seek ways in which we can add new assets through selective acquisition to complement our strong production base and build a robust and exciting portfolio with further potential for value-generating growth. Antony Craven Walker Executive Chairman 9 April 2018 The Company had a very strong finish to what was an excellent year. Net production of 722,000 boe (2016 – 597,000 boe) and operating profits of US$14.1 million (2016 – US$3.4 million) represent Serica’s strongest annual performance to-date even though wax control in the condensate export pipeline restricted Erskine second half volumes. Serica remains committed to exploration and the forthcoming Rowallan well, on which Serica is fully carried, is one of the few significant UK exploration wells due to be drilled in 2018 targeting gross reserves over 100 million boe. It should also be emphasised that output restrictions during 2017 were almost entirely related to the oil offtake pipelines. 7 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REPORT CONTINUED New Lomond operator, Chrysaor Holdings Limited, after reviewing the various wax management measures employed in recent years, has concluded that the best long-term solution is to bypass the area of wax build- up by replacing a 26 km section of line, a proposal that Serica fully supports. BP has entered into a contract for a rig to carry out the re-entry and re-completion of the previously drilled (but STRATEGIC REPORT 8 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 not yet producing) Rhum R3 well. Serica intends to continue targeting exploration opportunities where an attractive balance can be struck between financial commitment and risked commercial return and has participated in three applications for new licences in the UKCS 30th Offshore Licensing Round. On 21 November 2017 Serica announced that it had reached agreement to conditionally acquire the BKR Assets from BP. The Lomond option has been engineered in detail and is capable of being fully implemented. The prospect is located within Serica’s core Central North Sea area, close to Erskine and Columbus. Licence 1/09 contains a large, clearly defined structural prospect, which is also analogous to the Dooish discovery. Results for 2016 were adversely impacted by a six-month Erskine field shut-in running from March until August of that year. The 2016 comparative gross profit of US$6.6 million reflected performance impacted by a six-month field shut-in. Foreign exchange Serica retains certain non-US$ cash holdings and other financial instruments relating to its operations. The Group held approximately US$146 million of UK ring fence tax losses as at 31 December 2017. Long-term financial liabilities of US$3.8 million as at 31 December 2017 comprise drawings under the BKR prepayment facility. Serica’s share of estimated decommissioning costs relating to its 18% Erskine field interest will be met by BP up to a level of £31.3 million, adjusted for inflation, with Serica being responsible for any costs beyond that.

There is no formal Board performance appraisal system in place but the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee considers this as part of its remit. * Chairman § Invitee Amanda Bateman Company Secretary 9 April 2018 29 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 DIRECTORS’ BIOGRAPHIES Antony Craven Walker Executive Chairman Tony Craven Walker started his career with BP and has been a leading figure in the British independent oil industry since the early 1970s.

Serica Energy plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England & Wales with its registered office at 52 George Street, London, W1U 7EA. The Erskine asset acquisition, completed in early June 2015 brought to Serica a producing interest capable of generating robust positive cash flow at current oil and gas prices. The Group determines whether E&E assets are impaired at an asset level and in regional cash generating units (‘CGUs’) when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of a regional CGU may exceed its recoverable amount. As recoverable amounts are determined based upon risked potential, or where relevant, discovered oil and gas reserves, this involves estimations and the selection of a suitable pre-tax discount rate relevant to the asset in question. This requires an estimate of amounts recoverable from oil and gas assets within the underlying subsidiaries (see note 16). Exchange gains and losses arising from translation are charged to the income statement as an operating item. These costs are directly attributed to regional CGUs for the purposes of impairment testing; UK & Ireland and Africa. E&E assets are not amortised prior to the conclusion of appraisal activities but are assessed for impairment at an asset level and in regional CGUs when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of a regional cost centre may exceed its recoverable amount. Costs of licences and associated E&E expenditure are expensed in the income statement if licences are relinquished, or if management do not expect to fund significant future expenditure in relation to the licence. If commercial reserves have not been discovered then the costs of such assets will be written off. Changes in reserve quantities and cost estimates are recognised prospectively from the last reporting date. For oil and gas properties when there are such indications, an impairment test is carried out on the cash generating unit. A corresponding tangible item of property, plant and equipment equivalent to the provision is also created. After initial measurement loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, less any allowance for impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition over the period to maturity. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Revenue from oil and natural gas production is recognised on an entitlement basis for the Group’s net working interest. Estimated associated national insurance charges are expensed in the income statement on an accruals basis. Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differences except for: 49 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2. This listing of standards and interpretations issued are those that the Group reasonably expects to have an impact on disclosures, financial position or performance when applied at a future date. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted. It establishes a single comprehensive model that will apply to revenue arising from contracts with customers. Although IFRS 15 does not generally represent a change from Serica’s current practice, and the impact review is ongoing, the accounting for certain contracts, such as those for underlifts and overlifts, have been identified as areas of potential change. Segment Information The Group’s business is that of oil & gas exploration, development and production. There are no transactions with Directors other than their remuneration as disclosed above and those described in Note 30. This will replace the 18% UK corporation tax rate that is currently legislated to take effect. This was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016 and reduced the headline rate of tax to 40% for ring-fenced trading profits. Management considers that there are no unreasonable concentrations of credit risk within the Group or Company. The current fair value estimated provision for these amounts is US$2.7 million which has been capitalised as an asset acquisition cost (see note 15). In the event of non payment, operating agreements typically provide recourse through increased venture shares. ■ Serica retains certain non US$ cash holdings and other financial instruments relating to its operations. Management believes that this mitigates most of any actual potential currency risk from financial instruments. ■ It is management’s opinion that the fair value of its financial instruments approximate to their carrying values, unless otherwise noted. During 2016, 9% of the Group’s gas production was sold at fixed prices under a contract which expired on 30 September 2016.
