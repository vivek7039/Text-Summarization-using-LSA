and implementing operational efficiencies – targeting investment to further enhance the value of its assets – seeking complementary acquisitions with a continuing focus on the uk north sea. 3 serica energy plc annual report and accounts 2017 executive chairman’s statement dear shareholder i am delighted to report that serica made strong progress in 2017. with the announcement in late november of serica’s acquisition of operated interests in the bruce, keith and rhum fields (bkr assets), the company had a very strong finish to what was an excellent year. serica’s target over the past two/three years has been to diversify the risk associated with being reliant on erskine as a single production source and grow into a profitable mid-tier independent oil and gas producer through an acquisition led strategy, concentrating on assets where we believed that we could add value through our own expertise. however, we will also continue to seek ways in which we can add new assets through selective acquisition to complement our strong production base and build a robust and exciting portfolio with further potential for value-generating growth. antony craven walker executive chairman 9 april 2018 the company had a very strong finish to what was an excellent year. serica remains committed to exploration and the forthcoming rowallan well, on which serica is fully carried, is one of the few significant uk exploration wells due to be drilled in 2018 targeting gross reserves over 100 million boe. equipment procurement has commenced and the installation is expected to be completed in q3 2018. so, although field production is again being curtailed during early 2018, serica has confidence that the bypass solution will assist delivery of full field potential in future years and pay for itself many times over. completion is targeted for late q3 2018. during q1 2018, bkr production has remained strong, routinely exceeding 20,000 boe per day net to bp. on 21 november 2017 serica announced that it had reached agreement to conditionally acquire the bkr assets from bp. the lomond option has been engineered in detail and is capable of being fully implemented. the prospect is located within serica’s core central north sea area, close to erskine and columbus. the 2016 comparative gross profit of us$6.6 million reflected performance impacted by a six-month field shut-in. long-term financial liabilities of us$3.8 million as at 31 december 2017 comprise drawings under the bkr prepayment facility. risk mitigation the group’s income is currently derived from a single

2017 notes to the financial statements 1. authorisation of the financial statements and statement of compliance with ifrs the group’s and company’s financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2017 were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 9 april 2018 and the balance sheets were signed on the board’s behalf by antony craven walker and mitch flegg. serica energy plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in england & wales with its registered office at 52 george street, london, w1u 7ea. the erskine asset acquisition, completed in early june 2015 brought to serica a producing interest capable of generating robust positive cash flow at current oil and gas prices. the group determines whether e&e assets are impaired at an asset level and in regional cash generating units (‘cgus’) when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of a regional cgu may exceed its recoverable amount. this requires an estimate of amounts recoverable from oil and gas assets within the underlying subsidiaries (see note 16). exchange gains and losses arising from translation are charged to the income statement as an operating item. these costs are directly attributed to regional cgus for the purposes of impairment testing; uk & ireland and africa. e&e assets are not amortised prior to the conclusion of appraisal activities but are assessed for impairment at an asset level and in regional cgus when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of a regional cost centre may exceed its recoverable amount. costs of licences and associated e&e expenditure are expensed in the income statement if licences are relinquished, or if management do not expect to fund significant future expenditure in relation to the licence. if commercial reserves have not been discovered then the costs of such assets will be written off. changes in reserve quantities and cost estimates are recognised prospectively from the last reporting date. for oil and gas properties when there are such indications, an impairment test is carried out on the cash generating unit. a corresponding tangible item of property, plant and equipment equivalent to the provision is also created. after initial measurement loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, less any allowance for impairment. amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition over the period to maturity. after initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. revenue from oil and natural gas production is recognised on an entitlement basis for the group’s net working interest. estimated associated national insurance charges are expensed in the income statement on an accruals basis. this listing of standards and interpretations issued are those that the group reasonably expects to have an impact on disclosures, financial position or performance when applied at a future date. ifrs 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018, with early application permitted. ifrs 15 will supersede the current revenue recognition guidance including ias 18 revenue and related interpretations when it becomes effective, for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018. although ifrs 15 does not generally represent a change from serica’s current practice, and the impact review is ongoing, the accounting for certain contracts, such as those for underlifts and overlifts, have been identified as areas of potential change. it replaces the previous leases standard ias 17 leases and is effective from 1 january 2019. under the new standard all lease contracts, with limited exceptions, are recognised in financial statements by way of right of use assets and corresponding lease liabilities. there are no transactions with directors other than their remuneration as disclosed above and those described in note 30. in march 2016 it was announced that the rate of sc would be reduced from 20% to 10% with effect from 1 january 2016. this was substantively enacted on 6 september 2016 and reduced the headline rate of tax to 40% for ring-fenced trading profits. notes to the financial statements continued financial statements 58 serica energy plc annual report and accounts 2017 12. taxation continued f) unrecognised deferred tax liability in 2017 and 2016 there are no material temporary differences associated with investments with subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised. management considers that there are no unreasonable concentrations of credit risk within the group or company. the current fair value estimated provision for these amounts is us$2.7 million which has been capitalised as an asset acquisition cost (see note 15). in the event of non payment, operating agreements typically provide recourse through increased venture shares. ■ serica retains certain non us$ cash holdings and other financial instruments relating to its operations. management believes that this mitigates most of any actual potential currency risk from financial instruments. ■ it is management’s opinion that the fair value of its financial instruments approximate to their carrying values, unless otherwise noted. the company is not obliged to meet other joint venture partner shares of these programmes. the resources of the columbus field in the uk north sea have been classified as contingent
