BUSINESS MODEL IN ACTION Strategy formation and planning Our industry insight across multiple markets holds the key to solving complex problems. If the end market is more fragmented, we focus on delivering platform products that can be used across a broad range of customers, with some personalisation. 12 Laird PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2017 Chairman’s statement The business now has much more robust foundations and is better placed to take advantage of future opportunities. This year we have made progress across all three divisions, as a result of the actions taken to improve performance. In addition to the operational improvements, I have strengthened Laird’s executive team signiﬁcantly and embedded a new, simpliﬁed divisional structure. 14 Laird PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2017 Chief Executive’s review Our goal is to deliver long-term, sustainable revenue and earnings growth. In PM, we are working to establish a model that can deliver earnings growth, year-on-year, through the smartphone cycle. Outlook Laird made signiﬁcant progress and delivered a much improved performance this year, underpinned by our resolute focus on operational excellence. Focus investment on delivering differentiated solutions in high growth segments, which allow us to capture a premium price and create real value for our shareholders. Return on capital employed 10.8% +1.3% (2016: 9.5%) Deﬁnition: Underlying operating proﬁt divided by average equity attributable to owners of the parent company and net debt. It’s an approach that works well for both parties – our sales with Continental have trebled in the last three years and at any time we will have around 20 different projects underway together.” One such project has involved PM producing innovative electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding for a network control module that manages a car’s engine and some safety systems. “Our challenges included incorporating an in-line cleaning module into the manufacturing process, to help ensure product cleanliness,” adds Stefan. “This project has been an excellent demonstration of partnership in action – thanks to its success, PM now supplies shields to more than 10 European locations of Continental.” 18 Laird PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2017 As vehicles become more automated and the systems they rely on increase in technical complexity, successful product development can sometimes be based on qualities that are decidedly less high tech – old fashioned human interaction and teamwork, for example. Liberec The division creates industry-leading solutions which protect electronics by conducting harmful waste energy streams (e.g. heat and electrical noise) safely away from important components within devices. This, combined with customer obsessed deployment across our huge portfolio of application solutions, has been a critical contributor to the improved performance. We offer a complete set of products that integrate smart devices into the vehicle, including wireless charging systems, USB hubs and compensers. A new development by our Wireless and Thermal Systems (WTS) division has the potential to drastically reduce those industrial accidents. Our Thermal segment is diversifying beyond its medical core into new markets, where heat loads and demand for active cooling systems are accelerating. WTS is leveraging its product and service portfolio to bring tangible solutions for these Enterprise Internet of Things (EIoT) challenges. We measure our progress by monitoring non-ﬁnancial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) which are detailed on pages 30 to 35 within this section.

We aim to achieve this by creating a safe, stimulating work environment which offers great opportunities and competitive remuneration. The Group’s policy is to manage a conservative Balance Sheet gearing position, with appropriate levels of debt for our business risk.

Recent political events in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have signalled increasing vocal support for a move toward protectionist international trade policies. Major business interruption incidents such as natural catastrophes, or a site ﬁre, can have an immediate and enduring operational impact. She has extensive experience leading strategic human resources teams in the areas of talent management, compensation/beneﬁts, culture creation and employee engagement. A schedule of meetings and principal matters to be discussed is normally set out at least 12 months in advance. Two additional ad- hoc meetings were held on short notice to discuss new business proposals for which Board approval was required under the Company’s Delegated Authorities. Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the Company’s share or bonus schemes and their service is non-pensionable. In addition, as part of the annual performance review, each Director is asked about their individual training needs so that this can be factored into forthcoming programmes. These announcements also appear on the Company’s website, along with other press releases, presentations, webcasts, informative videos and business case studies. While a programme of co-ordinated activity is followed throughout the year, where appropriate we also respond to ad-hoc requests for meetings. At Laird, diversity encompasses experience, skills, education, tenure, age, geographical expertise, gender, ethnicity, professional background, disability and sexual orientation. I am pleased that this year we have been able to pay bonuses under our Annual Performance Incentive Scheme. This was strongly linked to Laird achieving a stretching underlying Proﬁt Before Tax target and the Executive Directors meeting key strategic goals. Further details are set out on page 88 of this report and I would like to thank shareholders for their strong support. Annual performance incentive scheme (‘APIS’) • Cash • Deferred share award Tony Quinlan (CEO): Maximum opportunity up to 150% of base salary. It should be noted that both Executive Directors are recent appointments and have not yet had the opportunity of building up their shareholdings. If a contract is to be terminated, the Committee will determine such mitigation as it considers fair and reasonable in each case. In 2017 salary increases for management level employees ranged from zero to 15.5 % depending on several factors, including the region where they work and individual performance. Peter Hill ceased to be a Director with effect from 25 November 2011 but remained an employee on ill-health leave until 10 August 2012.

Payments to directors for loss of office Sir Christopher Hum stood down as a Non-Executive Director at the 2017 AGM. Loss of a key customer part way through 2018 leading to materially lower group revenue and proﬁt over the forecast period; Scenario 2 – Risk considered: Protectionism/Trade War. Laird continues to develop its technology capabilities, with research and development expenditure during the year running at 9.7% of sales (2016: 8.7%). For those entities where no component auditor was engaged, we undertook review procedures over the balances to identify any unusual transactions or indicators of misstatement. Issues can take many years to resolve and assumptions on the likely outcome have therefore been made by management. Intangible assets arising in this manner are amortised over their useful economic lives, from the product launch date, which is typically around four years. An asset’s net book value is its cost less any depreciation (including impairment, if required) charged to date. An asset’s net book value is its cost less any amortisation (including impairment, if required) charged to date. These operations, which are expected to be sold within 12 months, have been classiﬁed as a disposal group held for sale and presented separately in the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position. This purchase has been accounted for as an acquisition and all intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values. Included in the goodwill recognised above are certain assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature. 2017 £m 2016 £m Raw materials and consumables 42.6 32.7 Work in progress 2.9 4.7 Finished goods 67.2 62.0 112.7 99.4 Expenses relating to inventories written down during the period totalled £1.7m (2016: £1.1m). Dividends are not payable on shares prior to vesting and this is taken into account in calculating the fair value. This strategy takes account of the scheme’s liability proﬁle whilst aiming to minimise long-term costs by maximising return. Provisions are made when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to recover balances in full. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised on capital losses of £3.6m (2016: £3.6m) where it is unlikely that future relief would be available at the balance sheet date.
