authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with ifrs explanatory note: simplifying the numbers these notes provide additional detail and explanations on the disclosures within our annual report and accounts. a provision is recognised where, based on the group’s legal views and, in some cases, independent advice, it is considered probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle a present obligation that can be measured reliably. issues can take many years to resolve and assumptions on the likely outcome have therefore been made by management. exchange differences arising from retranslating opening net investments and the retained proﬁts for the period of overseas subsidiaries, less exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against overseas investments, are shown as movements in equity. non-market company performance and service conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value. the estimated useful life of an intangible asset ranges between ﬁve and twenty years depending on its nature. intangible assets arising in this manner are amortised over their useful economic lives, from the product launch date, which is typically around four years. issues can take many years to resolve and assumptions on the likely outcome have therefore been made by management. 113 overview strategic

december 2017, did not hold any ordinary shares (2016: 6,843). for all other property, plant and equipment depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to allocate cost less residual values of the assets over their useful lives as follows: computer equipment 5 years or less other plant and machinery 10 years or less a proportion of one year’s depreciation is charged in the year the asset comes into service or is sold. deferred taxation deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but which have not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, or to receive more tax subject to the following: (a) deferred tax is not recognised on the revaluation of non-monetary assets such as property unless a binding sale agreement exists at the balance sheet date. provisions are made when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to recover balances in full. notes to the ﬁnancial statements of parent company continued for the year ended 31 december 2017 162 laird plc annual report & financial
