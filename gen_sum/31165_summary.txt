We have a clear focus to deliver organic growth, by continually investing in and developing our brands. We look at bolt-on opportunities where this can help accelerate entry into a new sector niche or geography. This ensures they take a longer term view and aligns the interests of all shareholders, to build businesses that can deliver sustainable returns. Management can create a meaningful capital value over time if they grow the profit in their business.

We see this having good potential for future growth as agencies in established markets look to manage their cost base and increase operational flexibility by outsourcing certain parts of the recruitment process. Why this is important Temporary staffing in key markets As a Group we have an overall bias towards contract and temporary recruitment, providing workers with the flexibility to work when they want and also helping people to enter the working environment.

Our business model and strategy is delivering consistently, with 18 quarters of year-on-year net fee income growth for the period to December 2017 . We play a vital role in helping client companies find the right resources they need to grow. See page 2 We leverage our resources Through our four strategic pillars Strategic report Governance Financials 13 Investors We aim to deliver sustainable returns for shareholders with growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share and a progressive dividend policy in line with trading performance. The labour markets are reacting to this with people becoming more mobile and working outside their country of birth. Advances in technology and automation are reducing the requirement for a number of low skilled jobs, making them obsolete. Changes in market regulations and new technologies Market regulations can be a driver of growth, with well-regulated markets encouraging temporary employment by protecting the rights of temporary workers, for example by providing the right to equal pay and conditions.

Our strategic objectives • Focus on professional and specialist job levels where there are the greatest talent shortages. ConSol Partners increases our presence in high growth IT sectors, operating across the UK, Continental Europe and US markets. In Professional services the Mansion House insurance brand was merged into LMA, adding a further specialism to their offering. Whilst this remains higher than our target of 25%, it only represents 1.5 times adjusted net debt to EBITDA. We have not made any external investments in 2017, with a focus to reduce the Group debt level.

The Group has also seen average staff numbers increase by 7% as we continue to invest in line with our leading brands strategy. The fact that we were able to deliver a record result in 2017, despite difficulties in certain markets, underlines the benefit of our strategy to be diversified across sectors and geographies and so not being reliant on any single market. This was an accounting loss only and meant we did not need to make any further cash injections. Diluted earnings per share was down 15% to 7.9p (2016: 9.3p), also impacted by the higher amortisation charges and loss on disposal. KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR Strategic report Governance Financials 21 Focus into 2018 Organic growth has always been a core part of our business model and despite the low overall organic growth in the year, this remains a key focus of management. Joost Kreulen Chief Executive Officer 13 March 2018 DEBT AS A % OF DEBTORS This demonstrates how leveraged the Group is. However, excluding this the underlying movement in net fee income was a reduction of 2%, due to lower sales within our insurance and technical & industrial brands. With this division operating at lower pay brackets, these changes have increased pressure on margins and projects are being managed to meet client service period restrictions. We expect there will be a continuing impact into 2018 as clients get used to the new rules. A key focus in the year has been on setting up new pilot bases for their largest client. There were additional bad debt write offs for historic issues and the UK base has been closed down. There is no legal restriction over this cash, but given the requirement to repay it over a three year period, when calculating our ‘debt to debtors’ ratio we exclude the cash held as pilot bonds, giving an adjusted net debt of £19.5m (2016: £15.7m) at year end. During a downturn there is typically an unwinding of working capital as trade receivables are collected, so reducing the financing requirement and subsequent interest cost. An interest optimisation model allows currency balances (including overdrafts) to be included within the cash pooling arrangement.
