see this having good potential for future growth as agencies in established markets look to manage their cost base and increase operational flexibility by outsourcing certain parts of the recruitment process. why this is important temporary staffing in key markets as a group we have an overall bias towards contract and temporary recruitment, providing workers with the flexibility to work when they want and also helping people to enter the working environment. in the established staffing markets we have a high proportion of temporary and contract recruitment. penetration rate by country (2015)

delivering consistently, with 18 quarters of year-on-year net fee income growth for the period to december 2017 . we play a vital role in helping client companies find the right resources they need to grow. see page 2 we leverage our resources through our four strategic pillars strategic report governance financials 13 investors we aim to deliver sustainable returns for shareholders with growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share and a progressive dividend policy in line with trading performance. the world economy is increasingly inter-connected with businesses operating in global markets across international boundaries. the labour markets are reacting to this with people becoming more mobile and working outside their country of birth. advances in technology and automation are reducing the requirement for a number of low skilled jobs, making them obsolete. changes in market regulations and new technologies market regulations can be a driver of growth, with well-regulated markets encouraging temporary employment by protecting the rights of temporary workers, for example by providing the right to equal pay and conditions. populations (millions) china india usa indonesia japan

diversified by sector and geography is working, with adjusted profit before tax growing 20% to £11.0m (2016: £9.2m). group performance in the year we are pleased to have delivered another record year of profit, further demonstrating that our strategy of being diversified by sector and geography is working, with adjusted profit before tax growing 20% to £11.0m (2016: £9.2m). the decision was taken to incur professional fees to support the set-up of new bases of operations for key clients, which are already generating profitable returns and further consolidate their position as a key business partner. the group has also seen average staff numbers increase by 7% as we continue to invest in line with our leading brands strategy. the fact that we were able to deliver a record result in 2017, despite difficulties in certain markets, underlines the benefit of our strategy to be diversified across sectors and geographies and so not being reliant on any single market. progress: at 1.75 in 2017 we have seen a small decline on 1.79 in 2016, but this remains above all other years since 2013. staff productivity 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 1.73 1.72 1.73 1.79 1.75 key performance indicator

executive’s review continued within our english speaking brands we have started to use our offshore recruitment outsourcing business in india to take over certain internal accounting processes, to deliver consistency, build scale and manage costs. this was an accounting loss only and meant we did not need to make any further cash injections. key performance indicator strategic report governance financials 21 focus into 2018 organic growth has always been a core part of our business model and despite the low overall organic growth in the year, this remains a key focus of management. joost kreulen chief executive officer 13 march 2018 debt as a % of debtors this demonstrates how leveraged the group is. however, excluding this the underlying movement in net fee income was a reduction of 2%, due to lower sales within our insurance and technical & industrial brands. with this division operating at lower pay brackets, these changes have increased pressure on margins and projects are being managed to meet client service period restrictions. we expect there will be a continuing impact into 2018 as clients get used to the new rules. a key focus in the year has been on setting up new pilot bases for their largest client. there were additional bad debt write offs for historic issues and the uk base has been closed down. there is no legal restriction over this cash, but given the requirement to repay it over a three year period, when calculating our ‘debt to debtors’ ratio we exclude the cash held as pilot bonds, giving an adjusted net debt of £19.5m (2016: £15.7m) at year end. the £10.0m revolving credit facility is with hsbc bank plc, entered into for investment funding in 2016. connected to this facility is a £5.0m accordion arrangement which has been agreed in principle by the bank, but would need new credit approval for any draw down from this amount. during a downturn there is typically an unwinding of working capital as trade receivables are collected, so reducing the financing requirement and subsequent interest cost. an interest optimisation model allows currency balances (including overdrafts) to be included within the cash pooling arrangement. finance costs were £0.7m (2016: £0.7m), which related to interest payable on invoice discounting, bank loans and overdrafts. the group’s uk and german overdraft facilities were renewed in march 2018 for a further 12 months. risk register this is reviewed by the board at each meeting with risks added, amended or removed as appropriate and actions updated. risk matrix chart 1 political and social

sentiment in each of their locations. social changes impact how people search for jobs and where they are likely to live. new office openings increase the risk of lower returns than planned if costs are not managed well. the group finances its operations by a combination of cash reserves from retained profit, bank borrowings and issuing new equity. there have been a number of high profile cyber- attacks around the world in 2017. the threat from this is always changing and as we grow our brands in size, they are more likely to be a target for hackers and criminals. this will lead to changes in how the group companies operate and deal with data. the board gives due consideration to risks arising from social, environmental and ethical issues as part of its ongoing risk review process.
