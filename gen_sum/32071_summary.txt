WHAT WE DO Our 20MW ‘FlexGen’ sites – which can generate power within 30 seconds of being switched on remotely – provide a vital, low cost solution to assist in balancing the UK’s energy supply on a moment by moment basis. UK power prices have seen recent peaks above £1,500 per MW hour due to outage and generation imbalances; there is therefore a need for a reliable source of power that can be accessed quickly and flexibly during periods when demand exceeds available supply. Our model is built upon the ability to earn revenue from multiple markets for flexible power, as well as from secured management contracts read more on pages 14 to 17: • Short Term Operating Reserve (STOR) • Firm Frequency Response (FFR) • Triad • Merchant power sales • Capacity Market – on 15 year contracts Finally, we have begun to develop battery projects through our partnership with London & Devonshire Trust (LDT), which represents c.80MW in our pipeline. Focusing on these projects has allowed the Company to quickly establish a solid revenue and investment base. OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 05 PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 KEY AREAS OF FOCUS With the commissioning of our inaugural project in Plymouth in November 2016, I am delighted to report that we generated a maiden profit at the half year and a trading profit at the year end, before write offs with regard to irrecoverable disbursements for sites that are not going ahead for various reasons. As a complement to our green diesel projects, the group is now diversifying into gas fuelled power generation and battery powered energy storage projects, which may also be used in conjunction with SolarFlex and gas-powered generation sites. We retain complete flexibility in financing projects going forward but aim to ensure that all future gas sites operated via new companies, typically holding 20MW each as before, are able to be consolidated in our accounts. Over winter 2016/17, Attune Energy Ltd (our site in Plymouth) could have earned c.£1.5-£1.8m by taking advantage of market prices when these spiked. It also gives us additional flexibility in funding our various project types going forward including Gas, SolarFlex and Battery Power Storage. We have the remaining three Rockpool sites with planning and anticipate having these built in time for next winter. 08 PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 National Grid launched a review in June of all markets which seeks to make the balancing markets in which we compete more dynamic and closer to real-time. Additionally, some suppliers are starting to develop innovative solutions, such as using existing energy market contracts to hypothecate or match up demand and supply, so consumers can be more certain of the price in a highly volatile market. OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY Our original objective was to have 200MW of generating capacity within three years. OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 09 PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Chief Executive’s Review continued With gas engines, the economics are such that they are able to run merchant to take advantage of peak prices as well as assist suppliers in managing volatility in their retail power books. Looking back over history, peak energy prices suggest these facilities would need to run in the range of 1200-1400 hours per year. We are beginning to look at hybrid technologies whereby both the gas and green fuel sites would be fitted with a storage (or exhaustible) capability, such as batteries. Phil Stephens Chief Executive Officer 13 September 2017 10 PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Sustainability Our flexible, standby sites facilitate the UK’s increasing reliance on renewable energy. Our flexgen facilities are anticipated to run for no more than 150 hours per year in 60 minute blocks of time during peak demand, and may not exceed 300 hours as a result of the commitments made in the planning permission process. Despite providing valuable standby generating capacity, each facility is expected to be switched off for more than 97% of the time, ensuring that annualised emissions are minimal. Battery storage remains markedly higher cost than other short-term generation solutions and has technological limitations. As a result, this new market is likely to complement, rather than remove demand from existing frequency response markets. HOW WE OPERATE Proven, modular generation tech- nology We use established, reliable technology based on containerised generators, fired with renewable green fuel and – going forward – gas, and possibly in conjunction with battery storage or independent battery storage projects. Non-dilutive finance model By setting up a dedicated entity for each site, we have limited medium-term dilution to existing holding Company shareholders. Land owners: we are able to secure attractive sites through our relationships with land owners such as London & Devonshire Trust, with whom we also have a battery storage Joint Venture, and Associated British Ports. We are also entering T-1 CM auction for the 6 facilities that will be operational by 1st October 2018. The capacity obligation means providers must be available to deliver energy when needed or face penalties. Financial projections for 10 new gas sites funded from £50m bond or other funding (100% owned) FULL YEAR NO OF SITES EBITDA 1 3 £3,576,689 2 6 £10,511,445 3 9 £18,034,178 4 10 £24,567.293 The potential for the Group to generate excellent returns and cash flow is clearly demonstrated above. FFR: Via our subsidiaries and investee companies, we intend to build power generation units which reach full response within 30 seconds and can sustain supply for 30 minutes, allowing us to compete in the static FFR market. Under these agreements, PPG receives monthly payments equivalent to £150,000 per annum for each investee company. Continue to pursue our limited dilution investment model, holding majority stakes in non-EIS funded, standalone flexible generation sites with outside investors where attractive We intend to own majority stakes (typically 80%) in individual entities for future development sites. Throughout the year we had nine management contracts in place with Rockpool investee companies, each generating £150,000 per annum of fee income which represented an annualised fee income of £1,350,000 for the year ended 30 April 2017. We will be in a good financial position to develop the majority owned portfolio of gas powered, solarflex and battery storage sites. These fees are expected to continue under current management contracts at an annualised rate of £1.35 million in future periods. In addition, a new Group share option scheme was implemented after the financial year end. 15,000,000 Options were granted to each of Paul Lazarevic, James Longley, Phil Stephens and Charles Tatnall on 18 The Group has achieved considerable growth in fees received during the year, contributing materially to substantially reduced losses and attributable losses per share. Charles Tatnall and James Longley also each hold 4,770,000 existing share options, which were awarded prior to the reverse acquisition of Plutus Energy. The Directors have based their opinions on a cash flow forecast, which assumes that sufficient revenue will be generated for working capital purposes and that operating costs will be kept to a minimum until adequate revenue streams are secured. In addition future plans for the Group will be funded externally through a mix of debt and equity financing. The multiple revenue streams of each site mean that financial returns, even excluding Triad will remain attractive. Each 20MW gas project requires capex of circa £12.5m, and will be placed in a newly formed company. Until 2005 he was consultant to Bolton Group, identifying potential investment and acquisition opportunities in a broad range of industry sectors. His projects included main Board and Operational strategy development, including assessment of diversification opportunities, the development of the world’s first nodal electricity market in Singapore and advice on asset management plans to energy regulators. His earlier career was with Arthur Andersen, Creditanstalt-Bankverein Merchant Banking and Touche Ross Corporate Finance. He was also a co-founder, Director and CFO of PhotoBox Limited, Europe’s leading photo finishers. He is CEO of Kinloch Corporate Finance who are a corporate advisory company based in London and Leeds which specialises in capital raising, private equity, venture capital and M&A activities within the SME sector dealing with transaction sizes from £1m to £50m. The Board intends, so far as is practicable for a Company of its size, to implement certain corporate governance recommendations. ** The remuneration of James Longley includes £145,500 fees, which were invoiced by Dearden Chapman Accountants Limited. ***** The remuneration of Tim Cottier includes £13,133 which was invoiced by Kinloch Corporate Finance Limited. 10,000,000 warrants each were exercised by James Longley and Charles Tatnall on 1 February 2016 at 0.9p per share. The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. These sites are equity funded by Rockpool Investments LLP and in which we have a 44.5% interest.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Available for sale investments Investments are designated as available-for-sale financial assets if they do not have fixed maturities and fixed or determinable payments, and management intends to hold them for the medium to long-term. 38 PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Investments are initially measured at fair value plus incidental acquisition costs. Unquoted investments are valued by the Directors using primary valuation techniques such as recent transactions, last price or net asset value. Level 3 – valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data. Retained losses include all current and prior period results as disclosed in the statement of comprehensive income. The Directors have based their opinions on a cash flow forecast, which assumes that sufficient revenue will be generated for working capital purposes and that operating costs will be kept to a minimum until adequate revenue streams are secured. Where the future cash flows are less than expected, a material impairment loss may arise. Given that there is only one continuing class of business, operating within the UK, no further segmental information has been provided.
