But the skies are increasingly busy, and our balance of services means we have much to offer. Economic uncertainty may pose challenges to our standard broking business, but we can balance that by meeting out-of-the-ordinary commercial requirements, helping support disaster relief and, of course, offering the safety management services without which aeroplanes could not fly. “ We’vehadagreatyear– beingpartofaplcgives usgreatercredibility.”  TONY WHITTY, Managing Director, Air Partner Remarketing (formerly Cabot Aviation) “ 2016hasbeenayearofdeliveringa profitablefirstfullyearwiththeGroup.”  JUSTIN SCARBOROUGH, Interim Managing Director, Baines Simmons “ Mostofourpeople’sraison d’êtreistosavelives.”  BOB SIMMONS, Founder, Baines Simmons “ We’redevelopingnewwaysof deliveringexcellentexperiencefor ourcustomers–andrepositioning ourbrandtohighlightourstrengths.”  JULIA TIMMS, Group Marketing Director “ We’resucceedingin maintainingourunique culture–alwaysachallenge whenyou’reintegratingnew businesses,butessentialfor ourlong-termsuccess.”  RACHEL THRIPP, Group Head of Human Resources “ WehavereallystrengthenedtheIT infrastructureofAirPartnerthisyear.”  LEE PYLE, Group Head of Technology Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements 3 Air Partner plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 3 Air Partner plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 “ It’sbeenagoodyear,and thestrengthofthefinancial contributionfromournewly acquiredbusinessesisproving ourstrategy.”  MARK BRIFFA, Chief Executive Officer “ Ahighlightof2016,wasflying theHillaryClintoncampaignand buildingourpresenceintheUS.”  RICHARD SMITH, Head of Product, Air Partner Broking “ Ourbrokingbusiness hasdonereallywellin achallengingmarket andagainstachallenging politicalbackdrop.”  NEIL MORRIS, Chief Financial Officer 4 Air Partner plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Overview Chairman’s statement The Group has a clear long-term strategy to become a world-class global aviation services group. Indeed, it has perhaps been the most active and successful period we have experienced during my 12 years at Air Partner. 8 Air Partner plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Explaining our business Market overview We have been in aviation services for more than 55 years. Unlike other providers who may, or often may not, offer just a standard carbon offset scheme based on their own limited fleet (which could be ill-suited to the mission in any case), Air Partner offers a totally bespoke solution every time. The global air charter market is highly fragmented, with low barriers to entry and little or no regulation. Clockwork Research acquired in December 2016, is a world-leading fatigue risk management consultancy that delivers innovative solutions for clients across various sectors of the aviation industry. • Enhance and extend our offer Air Partner’s aim is to become a global aviation services provider. • Maintain and enhance our brand identity With a track record of over 55 years, Air Partner is well-known in the aviation industry. Ramping up our investment 2016 has seen Air Partner investing significantly in technology as a necessary counterpart to efficient, long-term growth. We also began the development of a new customer relationship management (CRM) system, set to go live later in 2017. This will enable us to identify opportunities for cross-selling, which are an integral part of our strategy. As a result, Commercial Jets liaised with Baines Simmons and asked them to carry out an audit of the two operators that our client would be using. ‘Considerable mutual benefit’ ‘We’ve been going for 12 years and have built up a very good reputation among the big aviation operators,’ she says. ‘We weren’t looking to sell necessarily, but could see that there was a much larger need for our service with the increasing awareness of performance safety and health. However, both of these political events could present opportunities, and we are continuing to evaluate the situation. Forward bookings can be impacted very suddenly by changes in financial markets, political instability and natural events affecting the movement of people or cargo from one country to another. Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements 19 Air Partner plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Risk Change in risk assessment Strategic initiatives potentially impacted Potential impact Controls/processes to mitigate Market conditions/ cost structure Forward visibility into air charter bookings is often measured in days or weeks, rather than months and can be materially affected by changes in financial markets, political instability and natural events affecting the movement of people or cargo from one country to another. Customers Maintaining brand value Limited visibility into future bookings may result in a cost structure that does not align with market conditions. Further diversification of the client base of the aircraft chartering business across governments and non-governmental organisations, commercial enterprises and individuals, as well as across geographic regions, allows for some smoothing when there are seasonal or sectorial changes in demand. Regular review of remuneration and other incentives to ensure we remain on par with our competitors. We have a dedicated integration team to ensure that benefits arising from an acquisition are maximised while maintaining control over operations.

I am very pleased with this maiden performance, and excited that the division is well positioned for future success. A common platform for growth We have maintained our commitment to organic investment in core systems and controls. It enabled our latest upgrades, which began in February and should be finalised by the end of 2017. In the years ahead, we will address these strategic gaps by either building a market-leading position organically or acquiring suitable businesses and platforms. Our newly acquired businesses have delivered strong operational performance and made an excellent first full-year financial contribution to the Group.

The lower rate being due to a reduction in amounts disallowable for tax purposes included within ‘other items’. This year, we have introduced a set of strategic indicators to help us measure progress against our strategy. The integration of Air Partner Remarketing into our offices at Gatwick has been very smooth and successful. Mixed results from ad hoc business, with corporate customers flying less often, was offset by JetCard, which had another record year. Customer First gives us an edge The private jet market is extremely competitive but we believe our Customer First strategy, which delivers an unrivalled level of service, particularly for JetCard, together with our financial stability, transparency and security, means we have a unique proposition. By putting our customers first, we continue to provide an unrivalled service, together with a value for money proposition. Furthermore, and as discussed, we went into partnership with Camper & Nicholsons, the luxury yacht specialists, in April 2017. However, overall, Freight’s performance reflected the high prior year comparable, boosted by one key contract, which was not renewed.

Relations with shareholders E.1 Shareholder contact The Board values opportunities to meet with shareholders and is kept informed of shareholder views.

Executive directors can receive life assurance, health insurance, car allowance, income protection, critical illness cover and sports club or gym membership.

For these we evaluated management’s assessment on whether Air Partner is an agent using the criteria of IAS 18. Key observations From the work performed above, we are satisfied that revenue recognition has been appropriately applied in accordance with IAS 18. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. Amounts receivable in respect of such inspections are recognised as revenue once the aircraft has been inspected. Amounts in respect of unbilled services provided to clients are recognised as revenue at balance sheet date. The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. 93 Air Partner plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements 2 Accounting policies continued p) Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense in the period in which the employees render service.
