accounts 2017 overview chairman’s statement the group has a clear long-term strategy to become a world-class global aviation services group. indeed, it has perhaps been the most active and successful period we have experienced during my 12 years at air partner. 8 air partner plc | annual report and accounts 2017 explaining our business market overview we have been in aviation services for more than 55 years. unlike other providers who may, or often may not, offer just a standard carbon offset scheme based on their own limited fleet (which could be ill-suited to the mission in any case), air partner offers a totally bespoke solution every time. the global air charter market is highly fragmented, with low barriers to entry and little or no regulation. other than direct competitors, there are also competitors offering similar services with a different business model, particularly in the private jet sector (eg fractional ownership, charter of their own aircraft or charter of aircraft under their management). clockwork research acquired in december 2016, is a world-leading fatigue risk management consultancy that delivers innovative solutions for clients across various sectors of the aviation industry. • enhance and extend our offer air partner’s aim is to become a global aviation services provider. • maintain and enhance our brand identity with a track record of over 55 years, air partner is well-known in the aviation industry. as we grow and offer our customers new aviation services, this only becomes more important. and even our most senior leaders make sure they connect with employees on a day-to-day basis. recruitment and retention people tend to stay with air partner for a good length of time. integrating new businesses successful integration is a key and necessary objective of any acquisition or merger. ramping up our investment 2016 has seen air partner investing significantly in technology as a necessary counterpart to efficient, long-term growth. this will enable us to identify opportunities for cross-selling, which are an integral part of our strategy. “ technologyisakey platformforgrowth: weneedtobeableto integrateouracquisitions easilyintooursystems.” lee pyle, group head of technology strategic report corporate governance financial statements 15 air partner plc | annual report and accounts 2017 expanding our services in pursuit of our vision to become a global aviation services company, we’re broadening our offer to encompass a full range of aviation services, and expanding where we operate to become truly global. as a result, commercial jets liaised with baines simmons and asked them to carry out an audit of the two operators that our client would be using. ‘considerable mutual benefit’ ‘we’ve been going for 12 years and have built up a very good reputation among the big aviation operators,’ she says. we’re very hands on and spend a lot of time with clients, building relationships. ‘we weren’t looking to sell necessarily, but could see that there was a much larger need for our service with the increasing awareness of performance safety and health. however, both of these political events could present opportunities, and we are continuing to evaluate the situation. forward bookings can be impacted very suddenly by changes in financial markets, political instability and natural events affecting the movement of people or cargo from one country to another. strategic report corporate governance financial statements 19 air partner plc | annual report and accounts 2017 risk change in risk assessment strategic initiatives potentially impacted potential impact controls/processes to mitigate market conditions/ cost structure forward visibility into air charter bookings is often measured in days or weeks, rather than months and can be materially affected by changes in financial markets, political instability and natural events affecting the movement of people or cargo from one country to another. customers maintaining brand value limited visibility into future bookings may result in a cost structure that does not align with market conditions. further diversification of the client base of the aircraft chartering business across governments and non-governmental organisations, commercial enterprises and individuals, as well as across geographic regions, allows for some smoothing when there are seasonal or sectorial changes in demand. regular review of remuneration and other incentives to ensure we remain on par with our competitors. non-financial counter party risk reliance on third parties for delivery of services to end clients. we have a dedicated integration team to ensure that benefits arising from an acquisition are

offset by jetcard, which had another record year. customer first gives us an edge the private jet market is extremely competitive but we believe our customer first strategy, which delivers an unrivalled level of service, particularly for jetcard, together with our financial stability, transparency and security, means we have a unique proposition. we continue to monitor technology platforms in the private jet space, but we fundamentally believe – and our customers seem to agree – that until technological capabilities have further developed, complex travel scheduling is better handled by people rather than machines. by putting our customers first, we continue to provide an unrivalled service, together with a value for money proposition. furthermore, and as discussed, we went into
