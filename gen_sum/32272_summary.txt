new executive management team in place to deliver medium‑term growth plans • group revenue up 10.2% on a like‑ for‑ like basis* (11.3% on a gaap basis of 53 weeks in fy17 compared to 52 weeks in fy16), driven by significant increase in customer numbers at express gifts • adjusted profit before tax* of £22.2m, down by £2.6m, following investment for future growth and digital transformation in both businesses • strong cash generation and core net debt* down by £4.8m to £80.8m, despite significant growth in express gifts’ credit receivables • individually significant items totalling £82.2m leading to a reported loss before tax of £59.4m express gifts • strong growth in customer recruitment at express gifts underpinning product revenue growth of 15.6% on a like‑ for‑ like basis* to £260.0m (16.6% on a gaap basis of 53 weeks in fy17 compared to 52 weeks in fy16) • financial services revenue on a like‑ for‑ like basis* increased by 12.6% to £99.2m • customer base now stands at 1.6m, up by over 229,000 on prior year, with further growth seen in early weeks of the new financial year as we move to all‑ year‑ round recruitment • increase in online customer ordering to 63% (fy16: 56%) with over 71% of new customers placing their first orders online • first‑ time investment in recruitment during final months of the financial year supressed near‑ term profitability, but is expected to produce significant medium‑ term returns • customer redress programme proceeding to plan, with approximately £8m refunded to date • new bad debt provisioning model introduced to provide more granular estimation. no impact on business operations or cash flow, but results in an individually significant charge of £35.2m. minimal impact expected in fy18 findel education • fall in education revenue of 3.3% on a like‑ for‑ like* basis (2.8% on a gaap basis of 53 weeks in fy17 compared to 52 weeks in fy16) driven entirely by loss of market share in our schools brands where sales were down 10.6% against the prior year on a like‑ for‑ like* basis • the rest of the business showed growth of 2.4% on a like‑ for‑ like* basis against the backdrop of an overall market decline • intangible assets impaired by £20m due to longer profit recovery period than previously anticipated, although no cash impact • warehouse consolidation project completed on time and on budget, anticipated to deliver annual savings of £2‑ 3m in 2017/18 • future strategy based around delivering value, service, digital solutions and improved profitability is to be rolled out in the coming months * this is an alternative performance measure, for which the reconciliation to the equivalent gaap measure can be found on page 21. since joining the group in january 2017, i have spent time getting to know our two businesses, express gifts and findel education. i’m excited about the opportunity for sustainable growth in a marketplace for value‑ conscious customers who are rapidly moving their purchases online, although there is a significant amount of further work required to achieve that goal. we have seen good progress in the last financial year, with express gifts moving its customer recruitment programme to be all‑ year‑ round through a focus on great‑value products and tv advertising. as such, the company does not have plans to reinstate dividend payments at this stage. stuart caldwell became the acting cfo, with chris mahady remaining as managing director of findel education. we are planning now for the investment and transformation required to keep pace with this digital evolution. this was logical at a time when the smaller business units may have been under consideration for disposal. secondly, we are encouraging findel education to make greater use of our own far east sourcing offices, which have increasingly moved away from their hong kong heritage in favour of the chinese industrial recent years have seen findel make significant progress in restructuring and simplifying the group. • how can we encourage them to spend a greater proportion of their wallet with us? our business models are adapting to cater for a marketplace that is increasingly moving online. however, we also know that increasingly they want to shop areas where goods are manufactured. by revisiting that opportunity, findel education has identified a number of new suppliers who can provide better quality products at significantly lower prices, allowing us to pass savings onto our customers whilst protecting margins. however, we have addressed a number of judgemental issues in these results and, whilst the increased provisions for past financial services matters are necessary, it is right that we address these issues now for the benefit of our customers. where that exposure is seen directly, namely where we buy in us$ or euros which represents around a third of total purchases, we are well‑placed with hedging policies in place to cover planned purchases on a rolling 12‑ month basis. at express gifts we are focused on further growth in customers and share of wallet, while at findel education we will continue to address market share losses through better use of great value product, service and its new online channels. we then saw the level of subsequent ordering and credit take‑ up in line with our expectations. however, for new customers, over 71% placed their first order online last year, with significant growth coming from the use of mobiles and tablets. we therefore can foresee a time in the future where virtually all orders are made online and need to plan now for that. as part of that work, we have reviewed all the historical credit and insurance products sold after 2005. we identified those products that were flawed and have put in place programmes to refund affected customers over the next few months. moving forward, express gifts is well advanced in its implementation of a new credit account management system. this will provide a number of customer benefits, including improved statements (and e‑ statements), and will allow new financial services products to be offered to customers, ensuring this part of the business remains relevant for our customer base. however, the growth of 17% in our customer base provides sales momentum as we move into fy18. 14 findel plc annual report and accounts 2017

allowing a one‑ stop shop for schools both in the uk and internationally. “ we have a clear strategy based on value, service and digital solutions underpinned by cost reduction.” kpis – measuring our progress how it is measured? to show trends in the business’s reputation with its customers and indicate customer loyalty. the business continues to maintain its strong relationship with sainsbury’s plc, having successfully delivered their active kids programme for 12 years. market conditions schools are typically funded based on an annual sum per pupil, which must cover costs such as buildings, staff, it, utilities and educational resources. the market has also continued to see strong movement towards more commercially focused multi academy trusts (mats) who are driving value through aggregated procurement. during the year, we have strengthened our business development team who are entirely focused on winning new mat contracts through strong commercial and service led propositions. we have a clear strategy based on value, service and digital solutions underpinned by cost reduction our strategy is simple – we need to deliver a one‑ stop shop where value and service are guaranteed. the value we gain through this will be reinvested in lower prices for customers, whilst protecting our product margins. our existing solutions were poor by comparison, which gives us confidence that online customer frequency and average order values will increase significantly over the coming months. this will deliver £2‑ 3m of annual cost benefits from fy18, whilst also improving our operational service levels. as noted above, this has been driven entirely by our school brands which were 10.6% down against the prior year on a like‑ for‑ like* basis. £4.0m was repaid to customers during fy17 and a further £3.6m has been paid since the year end. 20 findel plc annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report i finance review cash flow and borrowings a part of management’s variable incentive plans relates to the generation of free cashflow, as defined in the table below. the group’s hedging policy aims to cover anticipated future exposures on a rolling 12‑

set based on graduated scales that take account of internal planning and external market expectations for the company. only modest rewards are available for delivering threshold performance levels with maximum rewards requiring substantial out-performance of the challenging plans approved at the start of each year over one and up to three year time periods. consideration is given to the overall salary increase budget and general employment conditions, when setting executive director base salaries. how employee’s views are taken into account the committee does not directly consult with employees on executive remuneration. contracts will not include liquidated damages clauses guaranteeing a specified level of remuneration on termination. while this provision is not considered part of ‘normal’ policy, it is considered appropriate to retain flexibility should exceptional circumstances arise which would be detailed in the annual report on remuneration at the relevant time. new contracts will not provide enhanced protection in relation to contractual terms on a change of control. mr kowalski left the board on 5 april 2017. his service contract, dated 2 october 2010, was

directors. as part of mr kowalski’s departure terms, which are consistent with the remuneration policy, he will receive monthly payments equal to 12 months’ salary and benefits which will be subject to a reduction if alternative employment is found. mr kowalski will receive no bonus in respect of 2016/17 and his outstanding psp awards have lapsed. 4. ian burke joined the board as executive

designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failing to achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. secondly, the bad debt provisioning model within express gifts was becoming insufficiently robust, with manual overlays being required. the new granular model that has now been introduced is expected to overcome those issues in fy18. capability, impacting the ability to operate flexibly and at speed, in a competitive digital environment. express gifts carry out the same checks for all collections staff giving confidence to customers. all areas of the business operate a twelve-month rolling risk assessment programme run by qualified health and safety professionals. appropriate safety certification is obtained (backed by independent third party testing where necessary) and each division has a team dedicated to maintaining these standards. express gifts require new suppliers to produce an ethical trading statement as part of the set-up process from a recognised third party auditor. express gifts has seen the importance it places on safety and quality of products translated into a reduction in its returns rate by 0.4%. there has been an 18% reduction in credits, returns and replacements over the last three years, and customer queries have reduced by 48% over the last five years, this clearly demonstrates that findel education are fulfilling their mission of being ‘easy to do business with’ through an ongoing commitment to continuous improvement. the nottingham logistics centre recently installed a self-learning energy management system with an anticipated decrease in gas usage of 20%. calculation complexity the group has a significant level of trade receivables which are due to be recovered by instalments as a result of extended credit terms offered to customers by the express gifts limited business. there is a risk that any non-compliance with these principles could trigger the need for significant customer redress programmes. estimation is then involved in arriving at a provision against cost in respect of slow moving and obsolete inventories so that inventory is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. our procedures included: — tests of detail: comparing inventory levels to historical sales data to corroborate whether slow moving and obsolete inventories have been appropriately identified, and challenging the group’s categorisation as obsolete or slow moving. 77 strategic report 1—25 governance 26—72

profitability information and forecasted operating results based on approved business plans. notes to the company financial statements company financial statements i notes to the company financial
