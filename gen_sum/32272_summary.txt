since joining the group in january 2017, i have spent time getting to know our two businesses, express gifts and findel education. we have seen good progress in the last financial year, with express gifts moving its customer recruitment programme to be all‑ year‑ round through a focus on great‑value products and tv advertising. secondly, we are encouraging findel education to make greater use of our own far east sourcing offices, which have increasingly moved away from their hong kong heritage in favour of the chinese industrial recent years have seen findel make significant progress in restructuring and simplifying the group. by revisiting that opportunity, findel education has identified a number of new suppliers who can provide better quality products at significantly lower prices, allowing us to pass savings onto our customers whilst protecting margins. however, for new customers, over 71% placed their first order online last year, with significant growth coming from the use of mobiles and tablets. we therefore can foresee a time in the future where virtually all orders are made online and need to plan now for that. 14 findel plc annual report and accounts 2017

allowing a one‑ stop shop for schools both in the uk and internationally. “ we have a clear strategy based on value, service and digital solutions underpinned by cost reduction.” kpis – measuring our progress how it is measured? the business continues to maintain its strong relationship with sainsbury’s plc, having successfully delivered their active kids programme for 12 years. market conditions schools are typically funded based on an annual sum per pupil, which must cover costs such as buildings, staff, it, utilities and educational resources. the market has also continued to see strong movement towards more commercially focused multi academy trusts (mats) who are driving value through aggregated procurement. during the year, we have strengthened our business development team who are entirely focused on winning new mat contracts through strong commercial and service led propositions. our existing solutions were poor by comparison, which gives us confidence that online customer frequency and average order values will increase significantly over the coming months. as noted above, this has been driven entirely by our school brands which were 10.6% down against the prior year on a like‑ for‑ like* basis. no person has any special rights of control over the company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. targets are generally set based on graduated scales that

as detailed in the strategic report, fy17 has been a challenging year for findel education with strong revenue and customer number growth from express gifts, however, after taking into account a number of individual significant items the net profit is lower than expectations. whilst a number of key strategic objectives were completed successfully, the committee determined that no bonus would be payable to executive directors. due to a prolonged close period awards could not be made to a select group of senior executives until 1 march 2016 board report on directors’ remuneration i

importance it places on safety and quality of products translated into a reduction in its returns rate by 0.4%. there has been an 18% reduction in credits, returns and replacements over the last three years, and customer queries have reduced by 48% over the last five years, this clearly demonstrates that findel education are fulfilling their mission of being ‘easy to do business with’ through an ongoing commitment to continuous improvement. the fair value of brand names with finite useful economic lives is amortised on a straight-line basis over that period. provisions for impairment of
