Since joining the Group in January 2017, I have spent time getting to know our two businesses, Express Gifts and Findel Education. We have seen good progress in the last financial year, with Express Gifts moving its customer recruitment programme to be all‑ year‑ round through a focus on great‑value products and TV advertising. We are planning now for the investment and transformation required to keep pace with this digital evolution. This was logical at a time when the smaller business units may have been under consideration for disposal. Secondly, we are encouraging Findel Education to make greater use of our own Far East sourcing offices, which have increasingly moved away from their Hong Kong heritage in favour of the Chinese industrial Recent years have seen Findel make significant progress in restructuring and simplifying the Group. By revisiting that opportunity, Findel Education has identified a number of new suppliers who can provide better quality products at significantly lower prices, allowing us to pass savings onto our customers whilst protecting margins. However, for new customers, over 71% placed their first order online last year, with significant growth coming from the use of mobiles and tablets. We therefore can foresee a time in the future where virtually all orders are made online and need to plan now for that. Express Gifts has operated on an interim permission since that date, but in October 2016 we were granted our full authorisation. As part of that work, we have reviewed all the historical credit and insurance products sold after 2005. We identified those products that were flawed and have put in place programmes to refund affected customers over the next few months. “ We have a clear strategy based on value, service and digital solutions underpinned by cost reduction.” KPIs – measuring our progress How it is measured? The business continues to maintain its strong relationship with Sainsbury’s PLC, having successfully delivered their Active Kids programme for 12 years. Market conditions Schools are typically funded based on an annual sum per pupil, which must cover costs such as buildings, staff, IT, utilities and educational resources. The market has also continued to see strong movement towards more commercially focused Multi Academy Trusts (MATs) who are driving value through aggregated procurement. During the year, we have strengthened our Business Development team who are entirely focused on winning new MAT contracts through strong commercial and service led propositions. The value we gain through this will be reinvested in lower prices for customers, whilst protecting our product margins. Our existing solutions were poor by comparison, which gives us confidence that online customer frequency and average order values will increase significantly over the coming months. As noted above, this has been driven entirely by our School brands which were 10.6% down against the prior year on a like‑ for‑ like* basis. 2017 2016 Change £000 £000 £000 Adjusted operating profit*: Express Gifts 30,432 31,747 (1,315) Findel Education 1,417 3,214 (1,797) Overseas sourcing (699) (284) (415) Total continuing operations 31,150 34,677 (3,527) Net finance costs* (8,921) (9,901) 980 Adjusted profit before tax* 22,229 24,776 (2,547) Individually significant costs (82,152) (26,456) (55,696) Fair value movement on derivative financial instruments 556 — 556 (Loss)/profit before tax from continuing operations (59,367) (1,680) (57,687) * this is an Alternative Performance Measure, for which the reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measure can be found on page 21. It monitors developments and changes to regulatory standards internally and in conjunction with advisors It is also required to conduct its business and develop operating cultures that mitigate against the risk of its customers receiving a poor outcome from its financial services activities Failure to manage this conduct risk may lead to customers seeking appropriate levels of redress or refund, as well as the potential withdrawal of its FCA permissions The Group monitors compliance with applicable financial services and consumer credit regulations by taking advice from industry‑ recognised third party professionals, where appropriate. The Group monitors potential new threats from cyber‑ attack and deploys appropriate levels of resource to close emerging loopholes. No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. Targets are generally set based on graduated scales that take account of internal planning and external market expectations for the Company. Consideration is given to the overall salary increase budget and general employment conditions, when setting Executive Director base salaries. How employee’s views are taken into account The Committee does not directly consult with employees on executive remuneration. New contracts will not provide enhanced protection in relation to contractual terms on a change of control. Performance and Remuneration for 2016/17 As detailed in the Strategic Report, FY17 has been a challenging year for Findel Education with strong revenue and customer number growth from Express Gifts, however, after taking into account a number of individual significant items the net profit is lower than expectations. Whilst a number of key strategic objectives were completed successfully, the Committee determined that no bonus would be payable to Executive Directors. Stepped down as Chief Executive in September 2010 (figures are the total annual remuneration received during each full financial year). Due to a prolonged close period awards could not be made to a select group of senior executives until 1 March 2016 Board Report on Directors’ Remuneration I Governance STRATEGIC REPORT 1—25 GOVERNANCE 26—72 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 73—123 COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 124—134 53 Findel plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Compensation for loss of office (subject to audit) On 12 January 2017 Mr Sugden stood down from the Board and left the Company on 31 January 2017. In line with his service agreement and the approved remuneration policy, Mr Kowalski will receive monthly payments of salary and benefits in lieu of his notice period subject to a reduction if alternative employment is found while payments are being made. Mr Kowalski will not receive a bonus in respect of 2016/17 performance and his outstanding PSP awards as set out above shall lapse. CAGR or higher Any incentive payments will be subject to recovery and withholding provisions as set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. Secondly, the bad debt provisioning model within Express Gifts was becoming insufficiently robust, with manual overlays being required. All areas of the business operate a twelve-month rolling risk assessment programme run by qualified Health and Safety professionals. Appropriate safety certification is obtained (backed by independent third party testing where necessary) and each division has a team dedicated to maintaining these standards. Express Gifts require new suppliers to produce an Ethical Trading statement as part of the set-up process from a recognised third party auditor. Express Gifts has seen the importance it places on safety and quality of products translated into a reduction in its returns rate by 0.4%. There has been an 18% reduction in credits, returns and replacements over the last three years, and customer queries have reduced by 48% over the last five years, this clearly demonstrates that Findel Education are fulfilling their mission of being ‘easy to do business with’ through an ongoing commitment to continuous improvement. The Nottingham Logistics Centre recently installed a self-learning energy management system with an anticipated decrease in gas usage of 20%. There is a risk that any non-compliance with these principles could trigger the need for significant customer redress programmes. Their adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated. Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives of three to seven years. The cost of intangible assets with finite useful economic lives is amortised on a straight-line basis over that period. The fair value of brand names with finite useful economic lives is amortised on a straight-line basis over that period. An emergence period is incorporated to provide the estimated level of incurred losses at each reporting date. Provisions for impairment of receivables within Express Gifts are established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due. In each case, these key assumptions have been made by management reflecting past experience, current trends, and where applicable, are consistent with relevant external sources of information. Sensitivity analysis to potential changes in operating cash flows and risk adjusted discount rates has therefore been reviewed. If a further 10% of SKUs were assessed as being slow moving, then the provision required would increase by approximately £200,000. Provisions for impairment of receivables within Express Gifts are established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due. An emergence period is incorporated to provide the estimated level of incurred losses at each reporting date. Trade receivables are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods, determined by reference to past default experience. During the current period, overdue receivables with a gross value of £25,993,000 (2016: £108,217,000) were sold to third party debt collection agencies. All bank loans are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
