In Manchester we now have four assets (one acquired post year-end) with a potential capital value, after all refurbishment works and lettings are concluded, approaching £100m. Annual office take up is consistently in excess of 1m sq ft with high profile new occupiers coming to the city on a frequent basis. The key areas of focus going forward for Helical are London, Manchester offices and logistics units. We now have a portfolio of multi-let, flexible and desirable properties which also provide ongoing asset management opportunities to add value. EPRA earnings per share fell from 17.1p to 0.5p, reflecting growing net rental income offset by reduced development profits. This growth has been financed through an increase in secured debt borrowed primarily from UK high street banks and, since 2013, through the use of unsecured debt in the form of a Retail Bond and a Convertible Bond. Locate sites where complexity presents opportunity to add significant value through innovative development and asset management. PERFORMANCE The diluted net asset value per share, excluding trading stock surplus, at 31 March 2017 increased by 6.4% to 431p (2016: 405p). We incentivise management to outperform the Group’s competitors by setting appropriate levels for performance indicators against which rewards are measured.

In May 2014, Helical signed a joint venture agreement with HOOPP (Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan) to redevelop the site. The top two floors, totalling 12,200 sq ft, have been let to Anomaly at £75.00 psf for a ten year lease term. 11 DRURY LANE & DRYDEN STREET COVENT GARDEN WC2 The existing buildings, which are in office and retail use, sit on an island site of approximately 0.5 acres. A further planning consent for an alternative office led scheme was submitted in December 2016 and is currently being considered by Westminster City Council.

These units generally have few bespoke features making them straightforward to re-let if vacancies occur with minimal capital expenditure required. We concluded 12 retail leases representing over £400,000 pa in rental income which included two tenants upsizing within the estate. Since the year end this asset has been sold for £55m, a net initial yield of 5.9% in line with its March 2016 book value.

Mitigation/action The Group’s property portfolio is diverse in asset type, location and tenant industries, reducing over-exposure to one sector. The Group may forego opportunities if it does not maintain sufficient cash to take advantage of them as they arise. Management carries out sensitivity analysis to assess the likelihood of future breaches based on significant changes in property values or rental income. An endorsement of Helical’s commitment to managing environmental and social impacts is its continued listing in the FTSE4Good Index. MANAGING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY Each year Helical reviews and updates its environmental management system, which has been in place since 2003. Collectively, our people spent 1,148 hours on training and development during the year, an average of 5.3 days per employee. This is due in part to improved energy efficiency, light fittings and a greater awareness of responsibilities regarding personal impact on consumption. A quarterly online newsletter, City Life, has also been introduced which circulates articles on the Group’s projects, occupiers and contributing partners. Helical has delivered over two million hours of construction during the year with no fatalities or major accidents and only seven RIDDOR reportable incidents. Overall Health and Safety performance using Lost Time Accident Frequency Rate is a 61% improvement over last year. We have also held several events for our tenants that have involved partnerships with local businesses, organisations and musicians; • Helical continues to be a member of The Aldgate Partnership (“TAP”), formed in 2014 to help drive a powerful agenda for change. This review reaffirmed the Company’s principal objective of combining investment and development activity to ensure maximum shareholder returns whilst managing risks appropriately. Skills and experience Matthew Bonning-Snook, BSc (Urb Est Surveying) MRICS, was appointed to the Board as an Executive Director in 2007. Prior to joining Helical in 1995 he was a Development Agent and Consultant at Richard Ellis (now CBRE). He has also been a Non-Executive Director of P&O, Debenhams, Tomkins, Qinetiq Group, Kidde Hiscox and Morrisons. Through his company, Ebbtide Partners, he acts as a consultant to, and investor in, private companies. As a consequence, the Board has ensured that there are safeguards in place to counter any concerns regarding his independence status. Engagement with shareholder representative bodies suggests that the overall quantum of remuneration remains a concern for them. In February 2017, Susan Clayton informed the Board that she had been appointed Chairman of Barwood Property Fund, which is to launch this year. It is common practice at Helical for Audit and Risk Committee meetings to be attended by all Board members, whether or not they are members of the Committee, so that their contribution to the matters discussed may be obtained. The FRC assessed that Grant Thornton’s audit procedures in respect of investment property valuations could be significantly improved. Given their period of tenure as the incumbent auditor, Grant Thornton will not be included in this process.

In these cases neither party has control over the entity and therefore it is considered appropriate to account for our interest as a joint venture. The Convertible Bond is included at its fair value of £99,774,000 (2016: £102,747,000) in borrowings repayable within two to three years. The Retail Bond is included at its amortised cost of £79,408,000 (2016: £79,225,000) in borrowings repayable within three to four years. During the year two interest rate swaps were novated to a subsidiary company of Helical plc. If Bondholders do not exercise their conversion right, the obligation is settled by a cash payment of £100,000,000. The Group is not reliant on any major customer for its ability to continue as a going concern. The above contracted liabilities assume that no loans are extended beyond their current facility expiry date. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible timing differences can be utilised. In accordance with IAS 40, investment properties held under leases are stated gross of the recognised finance lease liability. Lease payments are allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant financing rate. 31.3.17 £000 31.3.16 £000 In parent and subsidiaries – gross borrowings less than one year 2,517 885 – gross borrowings more than one year 671,184 733,178 Total gross borrowings in parent and subsidiaries 673,701 734,063 In joint ventures – gross borrowings less than one year – – – gross borrowings more than one year 55,282 34,626 Total gross borrowings in joint ventures 55,282 34,626 In parent and subsidiaries – Cash and cash equivalents (99,262) (74,670) In joint ventures – Cash and cash equivalents (9,745) (12,177) See-through net borrowings 619,976 681,842 HELICAL PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 142 APPENDIX 1 CONTINUED SEE-THROUGH ANAL YSIS RATIOS Interest cover 31.03.17 £000 31.03.16 £000 31.03.15 £000 31.03.14 £000 31.03.13 £000 Net rental income 46,993 43,434 38,645 29,839 24,459 Trading profits/(losses) – – 2,503 252 (1) Development profits (before provisions) 7,108 33,923 18,028 64,472 7,616 Gain/(loss) on sale of investment properties 1,337 43,938 3,571 8,580 (2,388) Net operating income 55,438 121,295 62,747 103,143 29,686 Finance costs 21,211 22,637 24,799 12,360 10,893 Interest cover 2.6x 5.4x 2.5x 8.3x 2.7x Balance sheet Property portfolio 1,205,216 1,240,003 1,021,362 801,712 626,425 Net borrowings 619,976 681,842 531,897 365,059 283,350 Shareholders’ funds 516,897 480,721 404,363 340,527 253,768 Loan to value 51% 55% 52% 46% 45% Gearing 120% 142% 132% 107% 112% APPENDIX 3 FIVE YEAR REVIEW Income Statements 31.3.17 £000 31.3.16 £000 31.3.15 £000 31.3.14 £000 31.3.13 £000 Revenue 99,934 116,500 106,341 123,637 65,439 Net rental income 46,162 42,164 34,233 24,402 19,578 Development profit 7,143 30,700 16,126 62,273 7,616 Provisions against stock (6,300) (6,448) (452) 552 (660) Trading profit/(loss) – – 2,503 252 (1) Share of results of joint ventures (6,528) 50,469 27,497 16,448 3,854 Other income/(expense) 982 20 368 230 (547) Gross profit before gain/(loss) on investment properties 41,459 116,905 80,275 104,157 29,840 Gain/(loss) on sale of investment properties 1,391 2,385 2,480 8,611 (2,388) Revaluation surplus on investment properties 39,152 47,441 66,904 20,714 3,723 Impairment of available-for-sale investments (3,352) (1,370) (773) (88) – Administrative expenses excluding performance related awards (10,800) (10,716) (10,156) (8,816) (8,092) Performance related awards (7,572) (15,387) (16,374) (17,860) (6,828) Finance costs (25,598) (24,113) (23,678) (13,983) (9,577) Finance income 3,156 5,128 2,480 4,135 887 Movement in fair value of derivative financial instruments 789 (6,860) (8,389) 5,312 (2,573) Convertible Bond adjustment 2,973 516 (3,263) – – Foreign exchange (losses)/gains (3) 100 (2,061) (501) 17 Profit before tax 41,595 114,029 87,445 101,681 5,009 Tax (2,471) (9,146) (12,669) (14,126) 815 Profit after tax 39,124 104,883 74,776 87,555 5,824 GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT HELICAL PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 143 APPENDIX 2 Balance Sheets 31.3.17 £000 31.3.16 £000 31.3.15 £000 31.3.14 £000 31.3.13 £000 Investment portfolio at fair value 1,003,000 1,041,100 701,521 493,201 312,026 Land, developments and trading properties 86,680 92,035 92,578 98,160 92,874 Group’s share of investment properties held by joint ventures 13,907 11,552 88,305 107,504 94,962 Group’s share of land, trading and development properties held by joint ventures 89,115 75,904 102,715 75,368 76,698 Group’s share of land, trading and development stock surpluses 12,514 19,412 36,243 27,479 49,685 Group’s share of total properties at fair value 1,205,216 1,240,003 1,021,362 801,712 626,425 Net debt 574,439 659,393 477,248 312,849 222,878 Group’s share of net debt of joint ventures 45,537 22,449 54,649 52,210 60,472 Group’s share of net debt 619,976 681,842 531,897 365,059 283,350 Shareholders’ funds 516,897 480,721 404,363 340,527 253,768 EPRA shareholders’ funds 565,973 540,731 469,128 370,062 313,733 Dividend per ordinary share paid/payable 3.12p 12.60p 6.85p 5.70p 5.25p Dividend per ordinary share declared 8.60p 8.17p 7.25p 6.75p 5.55p EPRA earnings per ordinary share 0.5p 17.1p 2.4p 33.3p 2.4p EPRA net assets per share 473p 456p 385p 313p 264p APPENDIX 4 PROPERTY PORTFOLIO London Portfolio Address Held as Description Area sq ft (NIA) Vacancy rate The Shepherds Building, W14 Investment Multi-let office building.
