frequent basis. we now have a portfolio of multi-let, flexible and desirable properties which also provide ongoing asset management opportunities to add value. epra earnings per share fell from 17.1p to 0.5p, reflecting growing net rental income offset by reduced development profits. performance the diluted net asset value per share, excluding trading stock surplus, at 31 march 2017 increased by 6.4% to 431p (2016: 405p). we incentivise management to outperform the group’s competitors by setting appropriate levels for performance indicators against which rewards are measured. total

information strategic report helical plc annual report and accounts 2017 51 dividends helical follows a progressive dividend policy increasing its dividends in line with its results, whilst retaining the majority of funds generated for investment in growing the business. mitigation/action the group’s property portfolio is diverse in asset type, location and tenant industries, reducing over-exposure to one sector. the group may forego opportunities if it does not maintain sufficient cash to take advantage of them as they arise. management carries out sensitivity analysis to assess the likelihood of future breaches based on significant changes in property values or rental income. an endorsement of helical’s commitment to managing environmental and social impacts is its continued listing in the ftse4good index. collectively, our people spent 1,148 hours on training and development during the year, an average of 5.3 days per employee. this is due in part to improved energy efficiency, light fittings and a greater awareness of responsibilities regarding personal impact on consumption. a quarterly online newsletter, city life, has also been introduced which circulates articles on the group’s projects, occupiers and contributing partners. helical has delivered over two million hours of construction during the year with no fatalities or major accidents and only seven riddor reportable incidents. overall health and safety performance using lost time accident frequency rate is a 61% improvement over last year. this review reaffirmed the company’s principal objective of combining investment and development activity to ensure maximum shareholder returns whilst managing risks appropriately. he has also been a non-executive director of p&o, debenhams, tomkins, qinetiq group, kidde hiscox and morrisons. as a consequence, the board has ensured that there are safeguards in place to counter any concerns regarding his independence status. engagement with shareholder representative bodies suggests that the overall quantum of remuneration remains a concern for them. in february 2017, susan clayton informed the board that she had been appointed chairman of barwood property fund, which is to launch this year. the frc assessed that grant thornton’s audit procedures in respect of investment property valuations could be significantly improved. given their period of tenure as the incumbent auditor, grant thornton will not be included in this process. for good leavers, individuals would cease to accrue future amounts into the bonus award pool although would continue to receive deferred share awards and any remaining amounts held in the bonus award pool for a period of two years after cessation. annual report on remuneration application of

ventures where the group has an equity interest of less than 50%. in these cases neither party has control over the entity and therefore it is considered appropriate to account for our interest as a joint venture. the convertible bond is included at its fair value of £99,774,000 (2016: £102,747,000) in borrowings repayable within two to three years. the retail bond is included at its amortised cost of £79,408,000 (2016: £79,225,000) in borrowings repayable within three to four years. if bondholders do not exercise their conversion right, the obligation is settled by a cash payment of £100,000,000. the group is not reliant on any major customer for its ability to continue as a going concern. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible timing differences can be utilised. in accordance with ias 40, investment properties held under leases are stated gross of the recognised finance lease liability. lease payments are allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant financing rate. 31.3.17 £000 31.3.16 £000 in parent and subsidiaries – gross borrowings less than one year 2,517 885 – gross borrowings more than one year 671,184 733,178 total gross borrowings in
