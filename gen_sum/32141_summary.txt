bond. locate sites where complexity presents opportunity to add significant value through innovative development and asset management. build cash reserves to weather current climate and take advantage

of public real estate companies clearer, more transparent and comparable across europe. a key measure of a company’s operational performance and the extent to which its dividend payments to shareholders are underpinned by earnings is the level of recurring income arising from operational activities. unrealised changes in valuation, gains or losses on disposals of properties and certain other items do not necessarily provide an accurate picture of the company’s underlying operational performance and are, therefore, excluded from the epra performance measures. similarly, trading properties and developments are adjusted to their fair value under the epra measure. in the year under review the company made progress at its retirement village portfolio, increasing sales to £40.0m, including the sale of land, (2016: £29.9m) helical plc annual report and accounts 2017 50 financial review continued total dividend declared pence 2017 2016 2015 5.55 2014 2013 6.75 7.25 8.17 8.60 3

revolving credit facilities which enable the group to acquire, refurbish, reposition and hold significant parts of our investment portfolio. due to the group’s small management team, changes in strategy can be implemented quickly. property values decline/reduced tenant demand for space risk description the property portfolio is at risk of revaluation falls through changes in market conditions, including under-performing sectors or locations, lack of tenant demand or general economic uncertainty. mitigation/action the group’s property portfolio is diverse in asset type, location and tenant industries, reducing over-exposure to one sector. availability of bank borrowing and cash resources risk description the inability to roll over existing facilities or take out new borrowing would impact on the group’s ability to maintain its current portfolio and purchase new properties. the group may forego opportunities if it does not maintain sufficient cash to take advantage of them as they arise. management carries out sensitivity analysis to assess the likelihood of future breaches based on significant changes in property values or rental income. management actively monitors these parties to ensure they are delivering the required quality on time. an endorsement of helical’s commitment to managing environmental and social impacts is its continued listing in the ftse4good index. collectively, our people spent 1,148 hours on training and development during the year, an average of 5.3 days per employee. • scope 2 - indirect energy emissions includes purchased electricity throughout the group’s operations within landlord controlled parts. this is due in part to improved energy efficiency, light fittings and a greater awareness of responsibilities regarding personal impact on consumption. a quarterly online newsletter, city life, has also been introduced which circulates articles on the group’s projects, occupiers and contributing partners. helical has delivered over two million hours of construction during the year with no fatalities or major accidents and only seven riddor reportable incidents. overall health and safety performance using lost time accident frequency rate is a 61% improvement over last year. we have also held several events for our tenants that have involved partnerships with local businesses, organisations and musicians; • helical continues to be a member of the aldgate partnership (“tap”), formed in 2014 to help drive a powerful agenda for change. this review reaffirmed the company’s principal objective of combining investment and development activity to ensure maximum shareholder returns whilst managing risks appropriately. executive committee gerald kaye - chairman matthew bonning-snook tim murphy duncan walker

2011. prior to joining helical, duncan led edinburgh house estate’s investment team. skills and experience matthew bonning-snook, bsc (urb est surveying) mrics, was appointed to the board as an executive director in 2007. prior to joining helical in 1995 he was a development agent and consultant at richard ellis (now cbre). he has also been a non-executive director of p&o, debenhams, tomkins, qinetiq group, kidde hiscox and morrisons. through his company, ebbtide partners, he acts as a consultant to, and investor in, private companies. as a consequence, the board has ensured that there are safeguards in place to counter any concerns regarding his independence status. in addition, shares representing 2.1% of the company’s shareholders withheld their vote on this resolution. engagement with shareholder representative bodies suggests that the overall quantum of remuneration remains a concern for them. in february 2017, susan clayton informed the board that she had been appointed chairman of barwood property fund, which is to launch this year. helical plc annual report and accounts 2017 76 nominations committee report succession planning by strengthening our board evaluation process in employing an external assessor the company has sought to improve its processes with regard to succession at all levels. the frc assessed that grant thornton’s audit procedures in respect of investment property valuations could be significantly improved. given their period of tenure as the incumbent auditor, grant thornton will not be included in this process. i hope that shareholders will support the committee and vote in favour of these resolutions. in addition, the committee considered a number of other matters during the financial year as follows: • new service contracts were introduced for all executive directors, which included a reduction in notice periods from 12 to six months. the committee believes it has struck the right balance between fixed annual remuneration and an incentive structure with challenging targets which seek to reward outperformance with a mixture of cash-based bonus payments and longer term share awards. i trust that shareholders will support the committee and vote in favour of this resolution. in determining such policy, the committee takes into account all factors which it deems necessary. element purpose and link to
