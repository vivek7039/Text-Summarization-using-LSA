The new US Sarbanes-Oxley legislation and other similar initiatives are requiring changes to corporate governance processes in a number of areas, which will further reinforce good practice. After a successful merger, it has been important for AstraZeneca to continue productivity improvements throughout the Company in R&D, production, sales and administration.

Success with these is essential to replace our more mature brands which are experiencing generic competition following patent expiry . Over the last three years, we have increased our delivery of candidate drugs (CDs) by 20% and on average one quality CD now enters pre- clinical development each month. I would like to thank them and the Senior Executive T eam for their continued contribution throughout what was undoubtedly a challenging year . The pharmaceutical industry is in a fascinating period of great change, characterised by exciting new opportunities and significant challenges. Pricing pressure is also exerted by the issue of access to affordable medicines for all those who need them. In a number of countries, including some major markets, patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates have been granted for the active ingredient. Galida (previously known as AZ242) is a treatment for insulin resistance related glucose and lipid abnormalities associated with type 2 diabetes/metabolic syndrome. Our further research in thrombosis aims to deliver an oral, anti-platelet therapy and AZD6140 has now entered clinical develop- ment. It is also approved for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in post- menopausal women based on demonstrated advantages over tamoxifen and megestrol acetate. ZD4054 is an endothelin antagonist in phase 2 development that works by inhibiting the ETA receptor , responsible for tumour cell proliferation. Key products Growth product Symbicort, inhaled combination of anti- inflammatory and fast onset long-acting bronchodilator in a single inhaler . Sales are also growing strongly in major European markets and Japan (where it is sold under licence by Fujisawa). Zomig Nasal Spray is a new formulation in an easy-to-use and convenient device to deliver fast pain relief for migraine sufferers. Prevalence of Alzheimer’ s disease set to increase exponentially over the next 15 years unless new effective treatments are found. Pipeline includes projects addressing mechanisms such as G-protein coupled receptors and novel ion channel blockers, aimed at delivering first-in-class therapies. Productivity gains have also been realised through a more strategic approach to purchasing and outsourcing arrangements across the whole drug development process. We remain focused on meeting our principal R&D performance target of delivering new, medically important and commercially successful products to the market every year .

AstraZeneca’ s principal competitors are other international, research- based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which also sell branded, patent- protected, prescription pharmaceuticals. Device presentations of inhalation products present manufacturing challenges and where appropriate, like other manufacturers, we keep these under review with relevant regulators. Our aim is continuous improvement, learning from incidences of non-compliance to ensure that we meet both the regulatory requirements and current good practice standards. Positive results have already been achieved with significant lead-time reductions on several key products supported where necessary by improved process reliability . During the marketing of a product, strict procedures must be in place to monitor , evaluate and report any potential adverse reactions. Federal legislation mandates minimum discounts to US government agencies purchasing drugs for senior citizens, the poor and other populations with special needs. In addition, certain states have taken action to require further manufacturer rebates on Medicaid drug utilisation and for other state pharmaceutical assistance programmes. The therapy area focus of our R&D operating model allows appropriate intellectual property strategies to be formulated and regularly updated from an early stage in product development. Generally , if the US pricing environment remains unchanged, these regulations are likely to have a positive impact on pharmaceutical prices in Japan. We believe good CR performance depends on achieving an appropriate balance between the economic, environmental and social priorities of sustainable development. AstraZeneca’ s business is focused on delivering shareholder value by maintaining a flow of new medicines that benefit society through improved healthcare. Prilosec sales declined 21% as a result of patients switching to Nexium during the year and competition from other products. Y ear to 31 December 2002 Growth rates described in this section exclude the effects of exchange rate movements (unless noted otherwise). This is consistent with our internal management reporting and we believe it provides a better understanding of underlying trends than using actual growth.

Future operating cash flows may be affected by a number of factors as outlined in the business background section on page 30. Operating units benefit from local currency billing which has the effect of consolidating their foreign exchange exposures back into central T reasury . Industry practice in the US allows wholesalers and pharmacies to return unused inventories within six months of shelf-life expiry . Our returns provisions are based on actual experience over the preceding 12 months, although in certain situations, for example, a new product launch or at patent expiry , further judgement may be required. A further feature of the US market is that sales can also be significantly influenced by wholesaler buying patterns. These estimates, which may differ from actual sales, do not result in a material impact on reported other operating income. We also own acquired intangible assets which may be included on the balance sheet (see “Research and development” below). Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of these proceedings, we do not expect them to have a materially adverse effect on our financial position or profitability . We also have significant commitments which are not currently recognised in the balance sheet arising from our relationship with Merck. Under FRS17, the disclosures on page 95 highlight a deficit of $637 million, after deferred tax, for all Group post-retirement defined benefit schemes. Y ear to 31 December 2001 Growth rates described in this section exclude the effects of exchange rate movements (unless noted otherwise). The Company also has a variety of constructive relationships with trade unions across its worldwide operations including formal recognition and active dialogue where appropriate. Some Directors and officers were also granted options to subscribe for Ordinary Shares under the Company’ s share option plans. 30 January 2003 KPMG Audit Plc Chartered Accountants Registered Auditor 8 Salisbury Square London EC4Y 8BB The above opinion is provided in compliance with UK requirements. Intangible assets, including patents acquired, are capitalised and amortised over their estimated useful lives (generally not exceeding 20 years), in line with the benefits accruing. T o the extent that dividends remitted from overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are expected to result in additional taxes, appropriate amounts have been provided. The Group has a standby letter of credit covering these financial liabilities which is collateralised by high grade government securities. Exercise of options An option will normally be exercisable between three and 10 years following its grant provided any relevant performance condition has been satisfied. Commitments AstraZeneca is required to pay approximately $800m over at least a five-year period which commenced in 1999, under the terms of an agreement with Schering-Plough. More than 20 brand name prescription drug manufacturers and eight wholesalers have been named defendants in some or all of these suits. Most of these suits have been consolidated with the Massachusetts action for pre-trial purposes pursuant to federal multi-district litigation procedures. Also, all significant actions arising from a restructuring and their completion dates must be identified by the balance sheet date. The 2002 market share figures included in this report are based primarily on data obtained from an online IMS database. Movements in the exchange rates used to translate foreign currencies into US dollars may therefore have a material adverse effect on AstraZeneca’ s financial condition and results of operations. The notional principal amount of financial instruments used to hedge these exposures, principally forward foreign exchange contracts and purchased currency options, at 31 December 2002 was $47 million. In addition, certain states have taken action to require further manufacturer rebates on Medicaid drug utilisation and for other state pharmaceutical assistance programmes. On the other hand, outpatient prescription drug coverage could improve access to pharmaceutical products for senior citizens, albeit at potentially lower realised prices. Substantial product liability claims that are not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on AstraZeneca’ s financial condition and results of operations. Any delay to the anticipated launch dates may therefore impact AstraZeneca’ s business and operations in a number of ways. In some circumstances, such liability could have a material adverse effect on AstraZeneca’s financial position and results of operations.
