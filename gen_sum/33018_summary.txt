manufacturing effectiveness enhanced, with significant lead time reductions on several key products, supported by improved process reliability . astrazeneca has always taken corporate governance very seriously and this positions us well in today’ s demanding environment. the new us sarbanes-oxley legislation and other similar initiatives are requiring changes to corporate governance processes in a number of areas, which will further reinforce good practice. the demand for modern medicines continues to grow, driven by demographic changes, expanded geographic markets and new technologies. after a successful merger, it has been important for astrazeneca to continue productivity improvements throughout the company in r&d, production, sales and administration. a stronger market position in these fast- growing countries will support astrazeneca’s long term growth ambition. astrazeneca relative share performance 31 december 1999 – 31 december 2002 astrazeneca major international pharmaceutical

our cr policies, commitment and performance are available in the separate 2002 corporate responsibility summary report. success with these is essential to replace our more mature brands which are experiencing generic competition following patent expiry . we are appealing this judgement, but meanwhile the company concerned chose to launch a generic omeprazole product in december 2002. symbicort also progressed well, recording sales of $299 million. over the last three years, we have increased our delivery of candidate drugs (cds) by 20% and on average one quality cd now enters pre- clinical development each month. i would like to thank them and the senior executive t eam for their continued contribution throughout what was undoubtedly a challenging year . the pharmaceutical industry is in a fascinating period of great change, characterised by exciting new opportunities and significant challenges. however , meeting this demand within the constraints of satisfying all stakeholders is proving increasingly difficult for pharmaceutical companies. pricing pressure is also exerted by the issue of access to affordable medicines for all those who need them. > increasing consolidation – major merger and acquisition activity has been a recent feature of the maturing pharmaceuticals industry. in a number of countries, including some major markets, patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates have been granted for the active ingredient. galida (previously known as az242) is a treatment for insulin resistance related glucose and lipid abnormalities associated with type 2 diabetes/metabolic syndrome. further information on crestor required by fda is planned for submission q1 2003. atacand achieves global market share, excluding japan, of 10% (9% in the us). arimidex is the world’ s leading aromatase inhibitor , with a global market share in excess of 50%. early breast cancer represents a major new market for arimidex and is expected to drive significant growth. it is also approved for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in post- menopausal women based on demonstrated advantages over tamoxifen and megestrol acetate. iressa is a novel anti-cancer agent that acts to block signals for cancer cell growth and survival. early studies have shown encouraging anti-tumour activity or disease stabilisation in non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc). zd4054 is an endothelin antagonist in phase 2 development that works by inhibiting the eta receptor , responsible for tumour cell proliferation. key product merrem (meronem) is an intravenous carbapenem antibiotic for the treatment of serious hospital acquired infections. further launches are planned in 2003. pulmicort is a corticosteroid anti- inflammatory inhalation drug that helps prevent symptoms and improves the control of asthma. accolate is an oral leukotriene receptor antagonist for the treatment of asthma available in most markets. key products growth product symbicort, inhaled combination of anti- inflammatory and fast onset long-acting bronchodilator in a single inhaler . sales are also growing strongly in major european markets and japan (where it is sold under licence by fujisawa). continuing strong sales growth of seroquel is anticipated through new indications and increasing penetration in the schizophrenia market. available in over 80 countries, it is the leading second-generation triptan with a global market share of 16%. zomig nasal spray is a new formulation in an easy-to-use and convenient device to deliver fast pain relief for migraine sufferers. prevalence of alzheimer’ s disease set to increase exponentially over the next 15 years unless new effective treatments are found. pipeline azd3582 is the first compound in a new class of drugs called cox-inhibiting nitric oxide donators (cinods). azd4282 (oral glycine) is an n-methyl-d- aspartate (nmda) antagonist under development as a treatment of neuropathic pain. pipeline includes projects addressing mechanisms such as g-protein coupled receptors and novel ion channel blockers, aimed at delivering first-in-class therapies. as a result, about 4,200 employees are now based at the wilmington facility , over 40% of our total us workforce. the oncology group had another successful year with sales growth of 13%, driven largely by zoladex and casodex. astrazeneca sales of nexium were $61 million with total brand market share including licensees reaching 21%, seven months after launch. during 2002, a further 11 cds were selected and, in addition, six early development projects reached volunteer dosing. our advanced science and technology activity has introduced a variety of new enabling technologies for drugs search programmes. productivity gains have also been realised through a more strategic approach to purchasing and outsourcing arrangements across the whole drug development process. we remain focused on meeting our principal r&d performance target of delivering new, medically important and commercially successful products to the market every year . line extensions symbicort inhaled steroid/fast onset, copd filed turbuhaler long-acting beta 2 -agonist single

www.astrazeneca.com operational review commercialisation and portfolio management our products are marketed primarily to physicians (both general and specialist) as well as to other healthcare professionals. in addition, more than 50 studies are currently supported by internet tools, such as document exchange sites and extranets. e-marketing has been integrated into our worldwide commercial operations to improve marketing effectiveness and offer new customer value. astrazeneca’ s principal competitors are other international, research- based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which also sell branded, patent- protected, prescription pharmaceuticals. device presentations of inhalation products present manufacturing challenges and where appropriate, like other manufacturers, we keep these under review with relevant regulators. there were several successful pre-approval inspections by regulatory authorities during the year including those for iressa and faslodex. our aim is continuous improvement, learning from incidences of non-compliance to ensure that we meet both the regulatory requirements and current good practice standards. further information about our she performance can be found in the separate 2002 corporate responsibility summary report. positive results have already been achieved with significant lead-time reductions on several key products supported where necessary by improved process reliability . additionally , shc has continued its development of an innovative clinical research network to improve patient care and cancer treatment. during the marketing of a product, strict procedures must be in place to monitor , evaluate and report any potential adverse reactions. this can result in large price differentials between markets, which may be further aggravated by currency fluctuations. federal legislation mandates minimum discounts to us government agencies purchasing drugs for senior citizens, the poor and other populations with special needs. in addition, certain states have taken action to require further manufacturer rebates on medicaid drug utilisation and for other state pharmaceutical assistance programmes. several bills have been introduced in congress that could provide limited financial help to the elderly for prescription drugs. obtaining adequate protection for the intellectual property associated with these activities continues to be a key business imperative. the therapy area focus of our r&d operating model allows appropriate intellectual property strategies to be formulated and regularly updated from an early stage in product development. we vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, including taking appropriate infringement action in various courts throughout the world. this is an ongoing process that puts a downward pressure on pricing and reimbursement of medicines in europe. generally , if the us pricing environment remains unchanged, these regulations are likely to have a positive impact on pharmaceutical prices in japan. we also use a two-yearly global employee survey to identify areas of both satisfaction and concern. we believe good cr performance depends on achieving an appropriate balance between the economic, environmental and social priorities of sustainable development. astrazeneca’ s business is focused on delivering shareholder value by maintaining a flow of new medicines that benefit society through improved healthcare. they also relieve pressure on healthcare systems by reducing incidence of disease or the time needed for treatment. in addition, they help to improve productivity by reducing the time taken off work through illness. prilosec sales declined 21% as a result of patients switching to nexium during the year and competition from other products. r&d spend was particularly focused on completing the development programmes for crestor, iressa and exanta. y ear to 31 december 2002 growth rates described in this section exclude the effects of exchange rate movements (unless noted otherwise). this is consistent with our internal management reporting and we believe it provides a better understanding of underlying trends than using actual growth. a regulatory submission in europe is planned for the first quarter of 2003. central nervous system cns sales increased by 53% to $1,505 million. excluding prilosec, sales growth was 33%, with excellent performances in nexium, seroquel, toprol-xl, pulmicort respules and arimidex. expenditure on exceptional items was $275 million lower than in 2001 as the integration and synergy programmes reach their conclusion. undrawn committed and uncommitted bank facilities at 31 december 2002 totalled $0.5 billion with maturities ranging from one to two years. financial policies insurance our risk management processes are described in the directors’ report on page 46. an outcome of these processes is that they enable us to identify risks which can be partly or entirely mitigated through use of insurance or which we can self-insure. we negotiate best possible premium rates with insurance providers on the basis of our extensive risk management procedures. operating units benefit from local currency billing which has the effect of consolidating their foreign exchange exposures back into central t reasury . interest rate risk is managed according to a benchmark reflecting 90 days’ duration of net liquid funds. our debt has an average maturity of 10 years and the majority is denominated in us dollars. funding risk we have significant net funds to finance ongoing working capital requirements for our operations. industry practice in the us allows wholesalers and pharmacies to return unused inventories within six months of shelf-life expiry . our returns provisions are based on actual experience over the preceding 12 months, although in certain situations, for example, a new product launch or at patent expiry , further judgement may be required. management believes that it has been reasonable in its estimate for future rebates using similar methodology to that of 2001. inevitably , however , such estimates involve judgements on future sales levels and the extent to which customers will access different incentive levels. a further feature of the us market is that sales can also be significantly influenced by wholesaler buying patterns. management tracks wholesaler inventory levels by product using its own and third party estimates and, where we believe such distortions occur , we disclose in the financial review for each product where shipments may be out of line with underlying prescription trends. these estimates, which may differ from actual sales, do not result in a material impact on reported other operating income. we also own acquired intangible assets which may be included on the balance sheet (see “research and development” below). there have been no material capitalisation of or charges for such items during 2002. goodwill and intangible assets. further details of these are set out in note 34 on page 101. although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of these proceedings, we do not expect them to have a materially adverse effect on our financial position or profitability . we also have significant commitments which are not currently recognised in the balance sheet arising from our relationship with merck. if the second option is exercised, merck will have no further rights to contingent payments from us. in keeping with local terms and conditions, most of these plans are defined contribution in nature where the resulting profit and loss account charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees’ pay . under frs17, the disclosures on page 95 highlight a deficit of $637 million, after deferred tax, for all group post-retirement defined benefit schemes. y ear to 31 december 2001 growth rates described in this section exclude the effects of exchange rate movements (unless noted otherwise). other operating income, which included gains from product rationalisation, increased to $368 million for the full year (2.3% of sales). the taxation charge for continuing operations before exceptional items was $1,214 million representing an effective rate of 28% (2000 35%). also at the annual general meeting, shareholders elected jane henney and john buchanan as non-executive directors. all of the directors retire at each annual general meeting and may offer themselves for re-election by shareholders. the company has frequent discussions with institutional shareholders on a range of issues affecting its performance. the company also has a variety of constructive relationships with trade unions across its worldwide operations including formal recognition and active dialogue where appropriate. the company also takes all reasonable steps to ensure that its working environments can accommodate special needs. other stakeholders the company aims to set, promote and maintain high standards of corporate responsibility wherever it operates. remuneration of individual directors was as follows: salary taxable total total total and
