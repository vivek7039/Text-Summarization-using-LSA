Its business model focuses on out-licensing  drug candidates after early proof-of-principle and  efficacy trials. ValiRx plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 WELCOME T O V ALIRX PLC Operational Highlights • Period of substantive and encouraging development across  drug portfolio taking lead compounds to significant value  inflection points; • Phase l/ll Clinical Trial of VAL201 has continued to demonstrate  high safety and tolerability and has received MHRA approval  to extend and expand the scope of the clinical trial to treat  prostate cancer; • Completion of VAL401’s Phase II Clinical Trial in patients   with lung cancer - with trial data offering palliative stage  patients an improvement in symptoms alongside improved  survival prospects; • Period saw the optimized, commercially viable, 2 nd  generation  development of the VAL101molecule derived from ValiRx’s  proprietary GeneICE platform to shut down rebellious genes  causing cancer and potentially some neurological disorders –  preparation is underway for the compound’s entry into the clinic; • VAL301 is in late pre-clinical phase initially for the treatment of  the gynaecological condition, endometriosis – a reformulation  of VAL201, which pre-clinical studies suggest does not  compromise bone density or fertility. • The integration of our clinical in-house  team with a board of oncologists and  clinical nurse specialists has been providing  valuable insight into how we can more  rapidly bring safe, efficacious, therapeutic  and palliative medicines to cancer patients  to meet hitherto unmet needs in rapidly  growing markets. ValiRx plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 02 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT In my report for the year ended  31 December 2016, I informed  our shareholders that we were  making important strides in  growing our internal R&D  capabilities, such that we remain  at the forefront of personalised  and precision medicine. The  integration of our in-house team with an  advisory board of oncologists and clinical   nurse specialists has been providing valuable  insight into how we can more rapidly bring   safe, efficacious, therapeutic and palliative  medicines to cancer patients to meet hitherto  unmet needs. We look forward  to reporting on the clinical trial as it progresses  throughout this current year. Oliver de Giorgio-Miller Chairman 5 April 2018 support systems, has advocated the therapeutic  potential for VAL401 as a single therapy in  treating this cancer. Palliative stage patients could   expect to see improvements in symptoms  with the added benefit of improved survival  prospects. VAL201 now has five patents families  in its portfolio, four of which have been fully  granted and with one allowed. This marked reduction  in our loss was attributable to a decrease in  clinical trial expenditure as the manufacturing  costs for both of the investigational medicinal  products, VAL201 and VAL401, that were incurred  for their respective trials, were borne during 2016. The progress of our  core clinical products,  VAL201and VAL401 has  been substantial and both  have reached significant  value inflection points. The Company’s  programmes are developed to meet clear unmet medical need in large  and growing markets and ValiRx’s management is actively in dialogue  with key players within the Bio/Pharmaceutical industry. Reduce risk in  new product  development  through rigorous  clinical and  commercial due  diligence. This is a gynaecological condition,  characterised by endometrial-like tissue found outside of  the uterine cavity. Pre-clinical data suggests that VAL301 will  provide protection from the oestrogenic effects on uterine  tissue, whilst maintaining bone density and fertility. Continue promising testing   in VAL101 ValiRx’s proprietary GeneICE technology enables selective  silencing of overzealous, rebellious or inappropriate activity  by specific genes, which contribute to many disease states  including cancers and inflammatory conditions, Alzheimer’s  and auto-immune diseases. • VAL301 is currently in mid-stage pre-clinical  development as a non-invasive, effective  treatment for the non-cancerous, but hugely  debilitating gynaecological condition,  Endometriosis. • Pre-clinical work is currently being   conducted with our partners, DKFZ,   Heidelberg and Pharmatest in Finland   and the compound continues to be   tested to decide the most promising   cancer types for further development.

The Company’s programmes are  developed to meet clear unmet medical need  in large and growing markets and ValiRx’s  management is actively in dialogue with key  players within the Bio/Pharmaceutical industry. This cancer  begins with an uncontrolled growth of  cells and develops slowly, sometimes  never causing a problem. University College London Hospital Out-sourced contractor to run clinical   trial since: 2015 University College London Hospitals  NHS Foundation Trust (UCLH) is one of  the most complex NHS trusts in the UK,  serving a large and diverse population. In  July 2004, UCLH was one of the first NHS  trusts to achieve Foundation Trust status. UCLH is committed to delivering  top-quality patient care, excellent  education and world class research. It has a turnover of £882m and  contracts with over 70 primary care trust  commissioning bodies to provide services. Strategic Report THERAPEUTICS 1 VAL201 1 VAL301 Our portfolio Prostate Cancer  The Company’s leading anti-cancer therapeutic VAL201is  currently in clinical trials for the treatment of prostate cancer  and potentially other indications of hormone induced  cancers. Due to its  low toxicity profile, the compound may also have a potential  for preventative treatment. In pre-clinical trials, VAL201 also reduced the prostate  cancer model’s metastatic growth by up to 50%. VAL201 has been shown though to  reduce abnormal endometrial growth, whilst leaving other  hormone-induced activities working normally. ValiRx’s initial  in-vitro results show a reduction in endometrial lesion size  directly related to dose and two generations of offspring  produced by treated animals. VAL101 VAL101 is a novel therapeutic based on the Company’s  proprietary GeneICE (Gene Inactivation by chromatin  engineering) platform. ValiRx plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 14 This excellent and very positive breakthrough  was boosted after the period end, when further  collected data showed that the VAL401 treatment  has also measurable improvement on patient’s  quality of life. The results seen in this first  all-comer trial, provides a strong foundation for  VAL401’s next stage of clinical testing. VAL201 Excellent Safety and tolerability data together  with early efficacy data leads to enhancement of  the VAL201 Dose Escalation Clinical Study During 2017, the VAL201 clinical trial has  demonstrated an excellent safety and tolerability  profile. The period also saw ValiRx’s VAL201 compound  showing good safety, tolerability and early  efficacy in clinical trials. Following analysis, ValiSeek announced positive  formal data on the VAL401 compound and of its  disease impact. Pre-clinical work during the period under  review has been conducted with our partners,  DKFZ, Heidelberg and Pharmatest in Finland,  to generate a commercially viable molecular  structure for VAL101. I very much look forward to the future further  development of ValiRx and its therapeutic assets. Dr Satu Vainikka Founding Director & Chief Executive Officer 5 April 2018 This approval allows for a substantial increase  in the amount and frequency of VAL201 being  administered to patients, thereby allowing  treatment to more speedily reach its full  therapeutic potential and potential anti-cancer  impact. Results from this  stage can be taken forward by the Company  or a partner into subsequent, larger, outcomes- oriented clinical trials. VAL201 specifically targets the association of  androgen receptor with Src,SH3 domain, a signal  that is important in tumour cell proliferation  without suppressing other Src-AR induced  activities. Earlier pre-clinical work on VAL201  has highlighted the compound’s potential to  protect women from Endometriosis, with a  minimal impact on bone density or fertility, which  are major drawbacks frequently encountered  with the current commonly used drugs and  therapies for this condition. There are patent applications currently pending in many other territories and covering various aspects of the programme. The Group utilises a range of external scientific,  regulatory and clinical experts to help guide its development  programmes. ValiRx has products in clinical trials and is dependent on  successfully advancing these lead candidates. The business model is to ensure future partnering   of these compounds with larger co-development partners. The internal controls are  designed to manage rather than eliminate  risk and provide reasonable but not absolute  assurance against material misstatement   or loss.
