• the integration of our clinical in-house team with a board of oncologists and clinical nurse specialists has been providing valuable insight into how we can more rapidly bring safe, efficacious, therapeutic and palliative medicines to cancer patients to meet hitherto unmet needs in rapidly growing markets. valirx plc annual report and accounts 2017 02 chairman’s statement in my report for the year ended 31 december 2016, i informed our shareholders that we were making important strides in growing our internal r&d capabilities, such that we remain at the forefront of personalised and precision medicine. the integration of our in-house team with an advisory board of oncologists and clinical nurse specialists has been providing valuable insight into how we can more rapidly bring safe, efficacious, therapeutic and palliative medicines to cancer patients to meet hitherto unmet needs. we look forward to reporting on the clinical trial as it progresses throughout this current year. oliver de giorgio-miller chairman 5 april 2018 support systems, has advocated the therapeutic potential for val401 as a single therapy in treating this cancer. palliative stage patients could expect to see improvements in symptoms with the added benefit of improved survival prospects. val201 now has five patents families in its portfolio, four of which have been fully granted and with one allowed. this is a gynaecological condition, characterised by endometrial-like tissue found outside of the uterine cavity. pre-clinical data suggests that val301 will provide protection from the oestrogenic effects on uterine tissue, whilst maintaining bone density and fertility. • val301 is currently in mid-stage pre-clinical development as a non-invasive, effective treatment for the non-cancerous, but hugely debilitating gynaecological condition, endometriosis. this cancer begins with an uncontrolled growth of cells and develops slowly, sometimes never causing a problem. university college london hospital out-sourced contractor to run clinical trial since: 2015 university college london hospitals nhs foundation trust (uclh) is one of the most complex nhs trusts in the uk, serving a large and diverse population. it has a turnover of £882m and contracts with over 70 primary care trust commissioning bodies to provide services. due to its low toxicity profile, the compound may also have a potential for preventative treatment. in pre-clinical trials, val201 also reduced the prostate cancer model’s metastatic growth by up to 50%. val201 has been shown though to reduce abnormal endometrial growth, whilst leaving other hormone-induced activities working normally. valirx’s initial in-vitro results show a reduction in endometrial lesion size directly related to dose and two generations of offspring produced by treated animals. val101 val101 is a novel therapeutic based on the company’s proprietary geneice (gene inactivation by chromatin engineering) platform. the results seen in this first all-comer trial, provides a strong foundation for val401’s next stage of clinical testing. the period also saw valirx’s val201 compound showing good safety, tolerability and early efficacy in clinical trials. following analysis, valiseek announced positive formal data on the val401 compound and of its disease impact. pre-clinical work during the period under review has been conducted with our partners, dkfz, heidelberg and pharmatest in finland, to generate a commercially viable molecular structure for val101. i very much look forward to the future further development of valirx and its therapeutic assets. dr satu vainikka founding director & chief executive officer 5 april 2018 this approval allows for a substantial increase in the amount and frequency of val201 being administered to patients, thereby allowing treatment to more speedily reach its full therapeutic potential and potential anti-cancer impact. results from this stage can be taken forward by the company or a partner into subsequent, larger, outcomes- oriented clinical trials. val201 specifically targets the association of androgen receptor with src,sh3 domain, a signal that is important in tumour cell proliferation without suppressing other src-ar induced activities. earlier pre-clinical work on val201 has highlighted the compound’s potential to protect women from endometriosis, with a minimal impact on bone density or fertility, which are major drawbacks frequently encountered with the current commonly used drugs and therapies for this condition. there are patent applications currently pending in many other territories and covering various aspects of the programme. the group utilises a range of external scientific, regulatory and clinical experts to help guide its development programmes. valirx has products in clinical trials and is dependent on successfully advancing these lead candidates. the business model is to ensure future partnering of these compounds with larger co-development partners. as at 31 december 2017, the group had sufficient cash resources to finance its operational activities until at least q2 2018. mitigation change 1 2
