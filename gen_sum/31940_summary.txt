consulting activity accounts for around 80% of group revenue and underlying operating profit primarily in the automotive, rail and environmental consulting markets. china remains a key market for the technical consulting business and this year we secured a number of contracts in the automotive sector, some of which are being delivered locally through our technical centres in shanghai and beijing. in the defence sector, ricardo defense systems has won a number of new contracts primarily in land defence, including further contracts to develop safety of the us army’s iconic high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle (‘hmmwv’). our teams’ multi-industry knowledge, deep technical expertise and management consulting skills offer a unique proposition to customers in the sectors that we serve. ricardo’s rail and strategic consulting businesses have global teams operating from a number of different locations. demand has also increased for cross- discipline environmental services from infrastructure-focused customers beyond water and energy, such as airports. we believe this trend will continue, driven by requirements for compliance with global regulations and more sustainable business growth. in the renewable energy business our strategic consulting team is delivering another substantial programme to improve manufacturing output, efficiency and quality for a world-leading wind turbine manufacturer. a ricardo-run climate change commitments workshop for rwanda’s government ministries emelia holdaway (centre), international climate change policy manager for ricardo energy

additional information strategic report case studies delivering excellence through innovation & technology 29 since the celebration of our centenary year drew to a close, we have been focusing on our vision for the start of ricardo’s second century. at ricardo, people are respected for their contribution: integrity is demonstrated in all that we do. the very nature of ricardo energy & environment’s consultancy work provides a further significant environmental benefit: we work with businesses, governments and international organisations to help find solutions to some of the most pressing environmental challenges. operational environmental impact and greenhouse gas emissions ricardo is committed to keeping the environmental impact of the group’s facilities and activities to a minimum as well as ensuring that our services have positive impacts on society. we focus our operational carbon footprint improvements on underlying energy efficiency prior to use of fuels for testing. we continue to use tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (‘tco 2e’) per employee as an intensity measure. this year we also calculated our market-based scope 2 emissions in the uk, as well as our location-based emissions, which have been reported on page 35 using government and international energy agency (‘iea’) factors in accordance with the ghg protocol’s scope 2 guidance. this means that, when using the market-based approach, our scope 34 ricardo plc annual report & accounts 2017 corporate responsibility and sustainability 2 emissions are reduced by around 45%. many of ricardo’s clients require certification to the environmental management system standard iso 14001 for their key suppliers. under our ethics policy we do not permit bribery, anti-competitive or corrupt business

most of our uk graduates are automatically enrolled as stem ambassadors when they join the business; • sponsorship of regional ‘big bang’ stem events where over 1 1,000 students attended to experience opportunities from many employers; and • ricardo software supports university teaching with its products in 200 locations across 38 countries. contract risks are managed through a project management process which is closely linked to measurement of financial performance. non-contract risks are owned by the leaders of global product groups, group functions and divisional managing directors. this is complemented by the internal audits required as part of maintaining certifications to international standards for management systems. failure or poor performance of a supplier could disrupt delivery to clients and increase operating costs. our r&d programmes are developed through a mixture of client consultation, long-range forecasting, thought leadership and deep technology roadmap development. financing the group is in a net debt position, having drawn on available facilities primarily to fund acquisitions. this risk is managed by robust cash management, regular improvement initiatives, monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, maintaining good relationships with the group’s bankers and ensuring sufficient borrowing facilities are in place at all times to support the group’s requirements, with additional headroom available to meet possible downside scenarios. the group also considered a number of scenarios that would represent serious threats to its liquidity, including reverse stress testing. ricardo is spearheading research into the measurement and control technologies that will enable future regulation to address this emerging pollutant of concern tackling emissions n a nop a r t i c l e t ackling nanoparticle emissions 44 ricardo plc annual report & accounts 2017 t ackling nanoparticle emissions group overview corporate governance financial statements additional information strategic report case studies delivering excellence through innovation & technology 45 the control of particulate emissions in vehicle exhausts has been something of a success story for the automotive industry in recent years. this particle number limit is based on (non- volatile) pn measurement above a size threshold of approximately 23 nanometres (‘nm’). this work is aimed at monitoring and regulating particle emissions down to sizes in the region of just 10 nm. this concern relates to a fundamental change in the way that non- combustible compounds are emitted. these rde measurements were then duplicated in the vehicle test laboratory yielding two sets of highly accurate pn measurements, taken at sizes down to just 7 nm and above 23 nm, both with and without a gasoline particulate filter (‘gpf’) fitted to the vehicle. the consequence of this high cost of battery systems is that bevs are at present restricted to exploiting market niches – in particular the markets for small, urban commuting vehicles, and for larger, high-end sedans and suvs equipped with high- capacity batteries whose costs are more readily absorbed within these luxury vehicle types. for bevs to break out beyond these niches is likely to require the development and refinement of battery technology based on entirely new, more affordable, and lighter-weight cell chemistries than those used in today’s lithium-ion (‘li-ion’) based battery packs. ricardo engineers led a team of suppliers in conjunction with tti, integrating their hardware and developing software that would be deployed on the two class 8 trucks. such is the intensity of shipping around britain, through the english channel and around some uk ports, that emissions that occur at sea are likely to have a significant effect on air quality in coastal communities on land; they can make a sizeable contribution further inland too. what is more, levels of shipping activity are forecast to rise significantly in the coming years as global trade expands. ricardo’s new analysis, in conjunction with project partner university college london consultants, has addressed several drawbacks to the existing uk maritime inventory – principally that they were based on estimated rather than actual routes taken by ships, that they did not take account of variation in vessels’ engine loads or speeds, and that they failed to capture certain types of craft, especially fishing vessels, offshore fleet and service vessels. and in contrast to domestic traffic, which has remained roughly level since 2009, international movements are on an upward trend. group overview corporate governance financial statements additional information strategic report case studies delivering excellence through

speeds and longer distances are involved, is achieved via high-voltage overhead line equipment (‘ole’), where trains pick up their power through roof-mounted pantographs tipped with contacts that slide along the underside of an overhead contact wire. such damage can be caused by vandalism or where maintenance equipment has been erroneously left in place. this prestigious contract follows on from previous high- profile projects which have seen the performance products division create high-performance transmissions for bugatti, ferrari, jaguar, mclaren and porsche. conforming to the hypercar’s ultimate performance 66 ricardo plc annual report & accounts 2017 ethos of minimal mass and maximum efficiency, and led by red bull advanced technologies’ simulation work, ricardo will deploy intelligent engineering solutions to achieve the vehicle’s uncompromising goals. the result is a transmission that is a state-of- the-art blend between race-car performance and road-car manners; the design’s seven sequentially shifted forward ratios have been closely matched through real-world lap time simulation to give optimum performance. ultimate performance group overview
