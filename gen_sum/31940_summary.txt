People I would like to thank all of our employees for their hard work and professionalism over the last year. In addition, Ricardo Performance Products has been nominated by Aston Martin to design, develop and supply an advanced transmission for the ground- breaking Valkyrie hypercar, which is being created as a result of a unique collaboration between Aston Martin and Red Bull Advanced Technologies. I would also like to congratulate all those individuals and team members who have won awards under the various Ricardo recognition programmes during the year, together with those members of staff who have gained academic success or peer group recognition in their chosen career paths. We achieve this through carefully selected diversification to avoid any undue dependence on individual clients, markets or regions of the world. This is delivered by Ricardo’s dedicated and talented team of people who are recognised for their expertise within the industries we serve. Our teams’ multi-industry knowledge, deep technical expertise and management consulting skills offer a unique proposition to customers in the sectors that we serve. Demand has also increased for cross- discipline environmental services from infrastructure-focused customers beyond water and energy, such as airports. We believe this trend will continue, driven by requirements for compliance with global regulations and more sustainable business growth. In the renewable energy business our strategic consulting team is delivering another substantial programme to improve manufacturing output, efficiency and quality for a world-leading wind turbine manufacturer.

The majority of our activities in this industry have been based around failure analysis, investigations, specialist design and development.

Contract risks are managed through a project management process which is closely linked to measurement of financial performance. This is complemented by the internal audits required as part of maintaining certifications to international standards for management systems. Our R&D programmes are developed through a mixture of client consultation, long-range forecasting, thought leadership and deep technology roadmap development. Financing The Group is in a net debt position, having drawn on available facilities primarily to fund acquisitions. This risk is managed by robust cash management, regular improvement initiatives, monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, maintaining good relationships with the Group’s bankers and ensuring sufficient borrowing facilities are in place at all times to support the Group’s requirements, with additional headroom available to meet possible downside scenarios. The Group also considered a number of scenarios that would represent serious threats to its liquidity, including reverse stress testing. This particle number limit is based on (non- volatile) PN measurement above a size threshold of approximately 23 nanometres (‘nm’). This work is aimed at monitoring and regulating particle emissions down to sizes in the region of just 10 nm. The consequence of this high cost of battery systems is that BEVs are at present restricted to exploiting market niches – in particular the markets for small, urban commuting vehicles, and for larger, high-end sedans and SUVs equipped with high- capacity batteries whose costs are more readily absorbed within these luxury vehicle types. Ricardo engineers led a team of suppliers in conjunction with TTI, integrating their hardware and developing software that would be deployed on the two Class 8 trucks. Such is the intensity of shipping around Britain, through the English Channel and around some UK ports, that emissions that occur at sea are likely to have a significant effect on air quality in coastal communities on land; they can make a sizeable contribution further inland too. What is more, levels of shipping activity are forecast to rise significantly in the coming years as global trade expands. And in contrast to domestic traffic, which has remained roughly level since 2009, international movements are on an upward trend. According to estimates from the International Maritime Organisation (‘IMO’), shipping accounts for between 2 and 3 per cent of global man-made CO 2.

This prestigious contract follows on from previous high- profile projects which have seen the Performance Products Division create high-performance transmissions for Bugatti, Ferrari, Jaguar, McLaren and Porsche. These will undergo exhaustive mechanical test and control system development prior to the final design released for series production in 2018. We have a formal schedule of matters reserved for our approval which are not delegated to the executive team. The Senior Independent Director also provides an additional point of contact for our shareholders should they have concerns that communication through normal channels has failed to resolve their enquiry or where these contacts are inappropriate.

We think three-year performance periods remain appropriate for a company like Ricardo where business cycles tend to be short. Certain other employees are eligible for the same or similar benefits described above depending on their role, seniority and geographical location. A significant majority (at least 50%) of the bonus opportunity will normally be determined by reference to performance against Group KPIs such as: • PBT; and • cash balance. They also receive reimbursement for travel and incidental costs (including any associated personal tax charges) incurred in furtherance of company business.

The Board’s policy on setting notice periods for directors is that these should not exceed one year. (1) There is an obligation on directors to mitigate any loss which they may suffer if the Company terminates their service contract. Executive directors will also be entitled to a payment in respect of accrued but untaken holiday and any statutory entitlements on termination. This measure was chosen in order to give greater context for the scale of key management remuneration within Ricardo.

We also considered whether payments received in advance were recognised where the related work had not yet been done. We found that management was able to provide reasonable explanations and appropriate supporting evidence for the various judgements taken. We challenged management on the specific opportunities tested and found that a number of these have started to realise future economic benefit.

The provision for impairment of receivables has been calculated based on past experience and is in relation to specific customers. Exposure to this form of risk is mitigated as material transactions are only undertaken with bank counterparties that have high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
