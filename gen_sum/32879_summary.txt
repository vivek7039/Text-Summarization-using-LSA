We have delivered a significant amount of cost savings by merging administrative processes across the Group whilst ensuring that the existing recurring revenue book continues to perform in a predictable and solid manner. The Board’s objective is to address and minimise any risk in this area. However, after seven years of service I have made the decision to retire and enjoy more time with my family, and I therefore will not be standing for re-election at the forthcoming AGM in May 2018, with my retirement becoming effective on 23 May 2018. I would like to take this opportunity to personally thank all of the Group’s Directors, executive and staff for their efforts in making 2017 such a success, and will avidly follow STM’s continued success in the future. STM’s acquisition of London & Colonial Holdings Limited (LCH) in late 2016 has played a key part in helping us to adapt and widen our product offerings to the expatriate market; which was a necessity following the UK Spring Budget that announced an Overseas Tax Charge of 25% on certain overseas pension transfers. As part of this move, it allows the Group Executive function to recruit from a larger population and will also see some additional appointments to our PLC Board which will further strengthen our depth of knowledge and capabilities. Overall, it is very clear that our underlying business continues to perform according to plan, demonstrating the quality and predictability of our recurring revenue streams which are key component parts of any robust business model. As predicted since the UK Spring Budget, our Gibraltar operation has seen almost no new business with regards to ROPS, whilst Malta is now only receiving new business from the EEA. To put this in context, for the nine months following the Budget, new business numbers were 217 ROPS (2016: 1,224) administered by our Malta and Gibraltar offices and 755 SIPPs (2016: 162) administered from our UK operations. But this is a one-off and as profits in Malta become consistent year on year, the position will stabilise and the Group’s effective rate will remain at circa 15%. Expectations are that 2018 new business volumes and client retention rates will remain in line with those of 2017 post the UK Budget. INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRSs) These financial statements were prepared under IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

We have challenged management’s assumptions by reviewing contracts to understand and verify the performance obligations detailed within these. KEY OBSERVATIONS Based on our work performed, we observed that the judgements applied were appropriate and recoverability of trade debtors & accrued income appears reasonable.

This opinion is derived at from financial and cash projections for the forthcoming twelve months. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt. Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to Pound Sterling (£) at exchange rates at the reporting date. After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost. A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset. The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics. If any such indication exists then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill which has an indefinite life, the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date. However, following consideration and review they are believed to either not be relevant to the Group or do not have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements apart from additional disclosures: • IAS 7 (amended) Disclosure Initiative • IAS 12 (amended) Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses • Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle - various standards In addition a number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2017, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. As such it could change how and when revenue from contracts with customers is recognised. Where awards have a market based performance condition attached the accounting charge reflects the expected achievement against targets and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes (Note 18). Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. Property, plant and equipment The fair value of property, plant and equipment recognised as a result of a business combination is based on carrying values which approximates its fair value at acquisition date. It also benefited from cost synergies, economies of scale and a good quality management team that has been retained by the Company. The financial performance and balance on the long term fund for each respective Company is as follows: STM LIFE ASSURANCE PCC PLC Technical Account – Long term business Year ended 31 December 2017 £000 Year ended 31 December 2016 £000 Gross premiums written 132,821 173,876 Policy withdrawals (42,063) (23,245) Net operating expenses (10,101) (85,268) Change in long term business provisions — (3) Increase in long term reserves (77,324) (63,574) Surplus on long term fund 3,333 1,786 Assets held to cover liabilities 31 December 2017 £000 31 December 2016 £000 Open market value 315,119 239,435 Cost 304,959 255,644 For the year from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 39 8.
