compared to 2016 a year in review i feel that the business becoming more uk orientated will further build investor confidence, improve efficiency, and open further uk business opportunities for the group. we have delivered a significant amount of cost savings by merging administrative processes across the group whilst ensuring that the existing recurring revenue book continues to perform in a predictable and solid manner. the board’s objective is to address and minimise any risk in this area. i would like to take this opportunity to personally thank all of the group’s directors, executive and staff for their efforts in making 2017 such a success, and will avidly follow stm’s continued success in the future. despite some unexpected and significant challenges, it is a proud feeling to be able to state that we have delivered record profits during 2017, significantly up on 2016. stm’s acquisition of london & colonial holdings limited (lch) in late 2016 has played a key part in helping us to adapt and widen our product offerings to the expatriate market; which was a necessity following the uk spring budget that announced an overseas tax charge of 25% on certain overseas pension transfers. overall, it is very clear that our underlying business continues to perform according to plan, demonstrating the quality and predictability of our recurring revenue streams which are key component parts of any robust business model. to put this in context, for the nine months following the budget, new business numbers were 217 rops (2016: 1,224) administered by our malta and gibraltar offices and 755 sipps (2016: 162) administered from our uk operations. expectations are that 2018 new business volumes and client retention rates will remain in line with those of 2017 post the uk budget. this opinion is derived at from financial and cash projections for the forthcoming twelve months. issued ordinary share capital of the company at 6 march 2018 % cf miton uk smaller companies
