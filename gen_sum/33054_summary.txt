cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward- looking statements, which speak only at their respective dates. there are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. this standard of performance must be achieved with world- class productivity and overall business efficiency to achieve satisfactory financial results. description of business geographic focus ici’s headquarters is in the uk, where it also has several significant manufacturing sites. national starch’s high performance curing adhesives are used to laminate plastic films, metal foils and paper for numerous flexible packaging applications. ‘pure delivery’ (an encapsulation technology) continued to be rolled out across the globe and gained adoption by a major key account. the hyprol protein hydrolysates for sports drinks has been successfully launched and is supported by a dedicated web site: www.hyprol.com. uniqema supplies innovative customised effect chemicals for purposes such as dispersion, wetting, emulsification, polymer modification, adjuvancy, lubrication, emolliency and defoaming. in pakistan and india, ici operates through non wholly- owned subsidiary companies whose share capital is quoted on the local stock exchanges. specialty hybrid corn (high amylose and waxy seeds) is planted under contract for national starch to guarantee supply of these special strains. the group’s prime technology areas, namely biosciences, chemistry and materials, have been established to support its goals in selected growth markets. nowhere is this more evident than in ici’s ability to offer products with a multisensory (touch, taste, fragrance and colour) dimension. as yet, legal proceedings 19 have not been commenced by ineos chlor but it is possible that they will be in the near future. ici has received reports that ineos chlor may seek to close part or all of its business if this financial support is not forthcoming. an analysis of employee numbers by business and geographical area may be found in note 36 to the consolidated financial statements. the group selectively hedges its anticipated future trading cash flows up to 12 months ahead using forward contracts and purchased currency options. the fair values for interest rate risk are calculated by using a standard zero coupon discounted cash flow pricing model. provision for these costs are made when expenditure on remedial work is probable and the cost can be estimated within a reasonable range of possible outcomes. in europe, sales were slightly ahead for the year, with a strong second half performance stemming from new contract wins. sales and trading profits were also lower in polyester fibre, although the soda ash business continued to perform well. there is a process in place which requires post event reviews to be undertaken following the completion of all major investments. since 1 january 2002, the committee has received material advice from towers perrin, mercer human resource consulting and new bridge street consultants. the performance period relating to these awards ended on 31 december 2002. mr powell will receive no payment in respect of his units. consistent with the policy on personal shareholding, no directors have disposed of shares acquired via company share-based plans except to meet consequent income tax liabilities. the group considers its derivative financial instruments to be “hedges” (i.e. an offset of foreign exchange and interest rate risks) when certain criteria are met. provisions for these costs are made when expenditure on remedial work is probable and the cost can be estimated within a reasonable range of possible outcomes. group profit and loss account for the year ended 31 december 2002 52 ici annual report and accounts and form 20-f 2002 2002 continuing operations discontinued total operations before

operating units, manufacturing and selling over 50,000 products in more than 55 countries, an ici career can offer a great diversity of work experience. central and eastern europe is buoyant, all our businesses report, with household appliance manufacturing showing particular strength for uniqema. uniqema’s ‘cirrasol’ polypropylene ﬁbre- ﬁnish developed for disposable nappies (diapers) helps to keep the baby dry and comfortable. in countries where educational provision is limited, such programmes beneﬁt everyone, including ici, by improving the availability of skilled talent. pressurised carbon dioxide (co 2 ) used with uniqema’s chemical detergent booster gives excellent cleaning results on fabrics and leather. in 2002, the local ici paints business launched a new formula elastomeric waterprooﬁng paint that was tough enough to walk on and pleasantly springy underfoot. a low-salt alternative to monosodium glutamate (msg), yeast- based ‘umamex-xlm’ enriches the taste and mouthfeel of savoury dishes, particularly asian favourites. from dairy desserts to thermal interface materials used in space satellites, what keeps customers coming back is the combination of innovation, practical problem solving and responsive service. there is a process in place which requires post event reviews to be undertaken following the completion of all major investments. consistent with the
