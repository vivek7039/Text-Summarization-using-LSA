Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward- looking statements, which speak only at their respective dates. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. This standard of performance must be achieved with world- class productivity and overall business efficiency to achieve satisfactory financial results. ICI is focused on growth and we have an increasing number of people in the regions with significant potential. description of business Geographic focus ICI’s headquarters is in the UK, where it also has several significant manufacturing sites. National Starch’s high performance curing adhesives are used to laminate plastic films, metal foils and paper for numerous flexible packaging applications. ‘Pure Delivery’ (an encapsulation technology) continued to be rolled out across the globe and gained adoption by a major key account. The Hyprol protein hydrolysates for sports drinks has been successfully launched and is supported by a dedicated web site: www.hyprol.com. Uniqema supplies innovative customised effect chemicals for purposes such as dispersion, wetting, emulsification, polymer modification, adjuvancy, lubrication, emolliency and defoaming. ICI believes that Uniqema is also a leader in synthetic refrigeration lubricants, to which it provides worldwide technical support. In Pakistan and India, ICI operates through non wholly- owned subsidiary companies whose share capital is quoted on the local stock exchanges. Specialty hybrid corn (high amylose and waxy seeds) is planted under contract for National Starch to guarantee supply of these special strains. The Group’s prime technology areas, namely biosciences, chemistry and materials, have been established to support its goals in selected growth markets. Nowhere is this more evident than in ICI’s ability to offer products with a multisensory (touch, taste, fragrance and colour) dimension. As yet, legal proceedings 19 have not been commenced by Ineos Chlor but it is possible that they will be in the near future. ICI has received reports that Ineos Chlor may seek to close part or all of its business if this financial support is not forthcoming. An analysis of employee numbers by business and geographical area may be found in note 36 to the consolidated financial statements. There were also no exceptional losses from associates (2001 £9m loss relating to a restructuring programme in Huntsman International Holdings LLC; 2000 nil). Capital expenditure, of £219m, was also £16m lower, while other cash items, including exceptional outflows against restructuring provisions, were at a similar level to 2001. The Group’s commercial paper programmes and other short- term borrowings are used to fund these working capital fluctuations. The Group selectively hedges its anticipated future trading cash flows up to 12 months ahead using forward contracts and purchased currency options. The fair values for interest rate risk are calculated by using a standard zero coupon discounted cash flow pricing model. Provision for these costs are made when expenditure on remedial work is probable and the cost can be estimated within a reasonable range of possible outcomes. In Europe, sales were slightly ahead for the year, with a strong second half performance stemming from new contract wins. Sales and trading profits were also lower in polyester fibre, although the Soda Ash business continued to perform well. There is a process in place which requires post event reviews to be undertaken following the completion of all major investments. Since 1 January 2002, the Committee has received material advice from Towers Perrin, Mercer Human Resource Consulting and New Bridge Street Consultants. Mr C Miller Smith retired on 31 December 2001 and Lord Trotman was appointed Non-Executive Chairman of the Company with effect from 1 January 2002. Consistent with the policy on personal shareholding, no Directors have disposed of shares acquired via Company share-based plans except to meet consequent income tax liabilities. KPMG Audit Plc Chartered Accountants Registered Auditor London 12 February 2003 The above opinion is provided in compliance with UK requirements. The Group considers its derivative financial instruments to be “hedges” (i.e. an offset of foreign exchange and interest rate risks) when certain criteria are met. Provisions for these costs are made when expenditure on remedial work is probable and the cost can be estimated within a reasonable range of possible outcomes. group profit and loss account for the year ended 31 December 2002 52 ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20-F 2002 2002 Continuing operations Discontinued Total operations Before Exceptional exceptional items items notes £m £m £m £m Turnover 4,5 6,125 – 6,125 Operating costs 3,5 (5,652) – – (5,652) Other operating income 5 23–– 23 Trading profit (loss) 3,4,5 496 – – 496 After deducting goodwill amortisation 4 (37) –– (37) Share of operating profits less losses of associates 3,6 18–– 18 514 – – 514 Fundamental reorganisation costs 3 ––– Profits less losses on sale or closure of operations 3 40 10 50 Profits less losses on disposals of fixed assets 3 3– 3 Amounts written off investments 3 (99) – (99) Profit (loss) on ordinary activities before interest 4 514 (56) 10 468 Net interest payable 3,7 Group (123) – – (123) Associates (28) – – (28) (151) – – (151) Profit (loss) on ordinary activities before taxation 363 (56) 10 317 Taxation on profit (loss) on ordinary activities 8 (115) 1 3 (111) Profit (loss) on ordinary activities after taxation 248 (55) 13 206 Attributable to minorities (21) (6) – (27) Net profit (loss) for the financial year 227 (61) 13 179 Dividends 9 (88) Profit (loss) retained for the year 24 91 Earnings (loss) per £1 Ordinary Share 10 Basic 20.4p (5.5)p 1.2p 16.1p Diluted 20.3p (5.5)p 1.2p 16.0p statement of group total recognised gains and losses for the year ended 31 December 2002 2002 £m Net profit (loss) for the financial year Parent and subsidiary undertakings 192 Associates (13) 179 Currency translation differences on foreign currency net investments and related loans (91) Taxation on translation differences on foreign currency loans 34 (57) Total recognised gains and losses for the year 122 Prior year adjustment (note 1) (81) Total gains and (losses) recognised since last annual report 41 53 2001 2000 (as restated – note 1) (as restated – note 1) Continuing operations Discontinued Total Continuing operations Discontinued Total operations operations Before Exceptional Before Exceptional exceptional items exceptional items items items £m £m £m £m £m £m £m £m 6,425 – 6,425 6,415 1,333 7,748 (5,935) (143) – (6,078) (5,876) – (1,350) (7,226) 46 –– 46 43 – 12 55 536 (143) – 393 582 – (5) 577 (37) – – (37) (35) –– (35) 57 (9) – 48 91 – 9 100 593 (152) – 441 673 – 4 677 ––– (14) – (14) (11) 18 7 16 (531) (515) 8 –810111 (22) – (22) ––– 593 (177) 18 434 673 12 (526) 159 (162) –– (162) (201) 16 (1) (186) (67) –– (67) (60) –– (60) (229) –– (229) (261) 16 (1) (246) 364 (177) 18 205 412 28 (527) (87) (116) 48 (29) (97) (145) (4) 53 (96) 248 (129) (11) 108 267 24 (474) (183) (26) (2) – (28) (24) –– (24) 222 (131) (11) 80 243 24 (474) (207) (116) (232) (36) (439) 25.5p (15.0)p (1.3)p 9.2p 28.0p 2.7p (54.5)p (23.8)p 25.5p (15.0)p (1.3)p 9.2p 28.0p 2.7p (54.5)p (23.8)p 2001 2000 (as restated – note 1) (as restated – note 1) £m £m 72 (196) 8 (11) 80 (207) (59) (15) (12) (39) (71) (54) 9 (261) balance sheets at 31 December 2002 54 ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20-F 2002 Group Company 2002 2001 2002 2001 (as restated (as restated note 1) note 1) notes £m £m £m £m Assets employed Fixed assets Intangible assets – goodwill 11 574 613 – – Tangible assets 4,12 1,961 2,186 78 69 Investments Subsidiary undertakings 13 11,357 9,072 Participating and other interests 14 69 374 1 58 2,604 3,173 11,436 9,199 Current assets Stocks 15 651 753 29 29 Debtors 16 1,695 1,913 2,689 3,985 Investments and short-term deposits 17 285 159 – – Cash 33 267 301 21 13 2,898 3,126 2,739 4,027 Total assets 5,502 6,299 14,175 13,226 Creditors due within one year Short-term borrowings 18 (226) (418) – – Current installments of loans 20 (500) (1,250) (270) (1) Other creditors 19 (1,692) (1,933) (7,768) (8,458) (2,418) (3,601) (8,038) (8,459) Net current assets (liabilities) 480 (475) (5,299) (4,432) Total assets less current liabilities 4 3,084 2,698 6,137 4,767 Financed by Creditors due after more than one year Loans 20 1,363 1,705 136 420 Other creditors 19 32 49 1,573 884 1,395 1,754 1,709 1,304 Provisions for liabilities and charges 21 1,121 1,257 171 194 Minority interests – equity 69 51 Shareholders’ funds – equity Called-up share capital 23 1,191 728 1,191 728 Reserves Share premium account 933 589 933 589 Associates’ reserves 11 22 Profit and loss account (1,636) (1,703) 2,133 1,952 Total reserves 24 (692) (1,092) 3,066 2,541 Total shareholders’ funds (page 55) 499 (364) 4,257 3,269 3,084 2,698 6,137 4,767 Included within Group net current assets (liabilities) are debtors of £545m (2001 £552m) which fall due after more than one year.

(iii) Performance Specialties – programmes to improve cost effectiveness in Uniqema Europe including the harmonisation of business processes and systems. During 2002, revisions were made to the estimated costs of this programme resulting in £3m being charged as an exceptional loss. Any borrowings, cash or short-term investments held by subsidiaries in their capacity as trustee of a Group pension fund are excluded from the calculation. A portfolio approach is adopted to create the Group’s target proportion of fixed and floating rate debt by currency. Related party: Irish Fertilizer Industries Ltd, an equity accounted associate in Ireland, which went into liquidation during the year. As yet, legal proceedings have not been commenced by Ineos Chlor but it is possible that they will be in the near future. ICI has received reports that Ineos Chlor may seek to close part or all of its business if this financial support is not forthcoming. Prior to that date such goodwill arising on acquisitions by the Group was and remains eliminated against retained earnings. Upon adoption, the Group’s management decided not to designate any of its derivative instruments as hedges for US GAAP accounting purposes. Upon adoption of SFAS No.142 an impairment test must be carried out on all intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and goodwill. In addition, some of ICI’s competitors in certain markets are larger and have greater financial resources than the Group, which may enable them to deliver products on more attractive terms or to invest larger amounts of capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development. Recently disposed businesses may expose ICI to costs that could have an adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. As yet, legal proceedings have not been commenced by Ineos Chlor but it is possible that they will be in the near future. The Group has received reports that Ineos Chlor may seek to close part or all of its business if this financial support is not forthcoming. A substantial proportion of the Group’s assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling. definitions 124 ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20-F 2002 125 Term used in annual report US equivalent or brief description Accounts Financial statements Acquisition accounting Purchase accounting Allotted Issued Associate 20–50% owned investee Called-up share capital Ordinary shares, issued and fully paid Capital allowances Tax term equivalent to US tax depreciation allowances Class of business Industry segment Closing rate method Current rate method Creditors Accounts payable/payables Creditors: Amounts falling due after more than one year Long-term debt liabilities Creditors: Amounts falling due within one year Current liabilities Debtors Accounts receivable/receivables Finance lease Capital lease Financial year Fiscal year Fixed tangible assets Property, plant and equipment Freehold Ownership with absolute rights in perpetuity Gearing Leverage Group, or consolidated accounts Consolidated financial statements Interest receivable Interest income Interest payable Interest expense Loan capital Long-term debt Net asset value Book value Nominal value Par value Pension scheme Pension plan Profit Income (or earnings) Profit and loss account (reserve) Retained earnings Profit and loss account Income statement Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders Net income Reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds Statement of changes in stockholders’ equity Reserves Stockholders’ equity other than capital stock Share capital Ordinary shares, capital stock or common stock issued and fully paid Share premium account Additional paid-in capital relating to proceeds of sale of stock in excess of par value or paid-in surplus (not distributable) Shares in issue Shares outstanding Shareholders’ funds Stockholders’ equity Stocks Inventories Tangible fixed assets Property, plant and equipment Turnover Revenues (or sales) glossary The information in this document that is referenced below is included in the Annual Report on Form 20-F for 2002 (2002 Form 20-F) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

This standard of performance must be achieved with world-class productivity and overall business efﬁciency to achieve satisfactory ﬁnancial results. ICI is focused on growth and we have an increasing number of people in the regions with signiﬁcant potential. We believe that this, in combination with improved operational effectiveness, will provide the basis for consistent, longer-term proﬁt growth. With some 100 operating units, manufacturing and selling over 50,000 products in more than 55 countries, an ICI career can offer a great diversity of work experience. Central and Eastern Europe is buoyant, all our businesses report, with household appliance manufacturing showing particular strength for Uniqema. Uniqema’s ‘Cirrasol’ polypropylene ﬁbre- ﬁnish developed for disposable nappies (diapers) helps to keep the baby dry and comfortable. In countries where educational provision is limited, such programmes beneﬁt everyone, including ICI, by improving the availability of skilled talent. Pressurised carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) used with Uniqema’s chemical detergent booster gives excellent cleaning results on fabrics and leather. In 2002, the local ICI Paints business launched a new formula elastomeric waterprooﬁng paint that was tough enough to walk on and pleasantly springy underfoot. A low-salt alternative to monosodium glutamate (MSG), yeast- based ‘Umamex-XLM’ enriches the taste and mouthfeel of savoury dishes, particularly Asian favourites. From dairy desserts to thermal interface materials used in space satellites, what keeps customers coming back is the combination of innovation, practical problem solving and responsive service. There is a process in place which requires post event reviews to be undertaken following the completion of all major investments. Consistent with the policy on personal shareholding, no Directors have disposed of shares acquired via Company share-based plans except to meet consequent income tax liabilities. Capital expenditure, of £219m, was also £16m lower, while other cash items, including exceptional outflows against restructuring provisions, were at a similar level to 2001.
