at their respective dates. there are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. in addition, the group generated a net operating cash inflow of £99m, £164m better than for 2001. trading profit, profit before tax and earnings per share figures are quoted before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items throughout this report, including pages 7 to 9, unless otherwise stated. this standard of performance must be achieved with world- class productivity and overall business efficiency to achieve satisfactory financial results. we believe that our extensive product and technology base provides us with a solid foundation on which to build. it received excellent and much appreciated support, with shareholders taking up more than 91% of the rights. chief executive’s statement uniqema made a weak start to the year, with industrial demand down. we believe that this, in combination with improved operational effectiveness, will provide the basis for consistent, longer-term profit growth. ici is focused on growth and we have an increasing number of people in the regions with significant potential. description of business geographic focus ici’s headquarters is in the uk, where it also has several significant manufacturing sites. national starch’s high performance curing adhesives are used to laminate plastic films, metal foils and paper for numerous flexible packaging applications. pressure sensitive adhesives are used to manufacture self-adhesive tapes, labels, decals, and transdermal drug delivery patches. the eem division is comprised of five business units, each focused on specific product lines and end-use markets. they also contribute additional technical characteristics, such as deodourisation or insect repellence, to the finished compound. ‘pure delivery’ (an encapsulation technology) continued to be rolled out across the globe and gained adoption by a major key account. the hyprol protein hydrolysates for sports drinks has been successfully launched and is supported by a dedicated web site: www.hyprol.com. uniqema supplies innovative customised effect chemicals for purposes such as dispersion, wetting, emulsification, polymer modification, adjuvancy, lubrication, emolliency and defoaming. ici believes that uniqema is also a leader in synthetic refrigeration lubricants, to which it provides worldwide technical support. ici paints expects to further develop its strategy by: • building its business in high growth areas such as china, india and elsewhere in asia, • capitalising on supply chain rationalisation opportunities, • utilising best practice throughout the business to reduce costs. the decorative paints business has well-established brands such as ‘dulux’, ‘glidden’, ‘valentine’, ‘coral’, ‘alba’ and ‘color your world’. major manufacturing facilities are located in the usa, uk, brazil, argentina, germany, netherlands, france, china, india and malaysia. in pakistan and india, ici operates through non wholly- owned subsidiary companies whose share capital is quoted on the local stock exchanges. ici alta inc. holds ici’s 30% equity interest in hih and a contract for the sale of this equity interest in hih to huntsman specialty chemicals corporation (“hscc”), as announced on 21 december 2001 (see “material contracts” on page 122). these products are either marketed directly or through independent merchants, wholesalers and distributors who resell to small users. specialty hybrid corn (high amylose and waxy seeds) is planted under contract for national starch to guarantee supply of these special strains. in 2002, expenditure on r&d by continuing operations excluding technical service, amounted to £148m (2001 £151m; 2000 £157m – both as restated). the group’s prime technology areas, namely biosciences, chemistry and materials, have been established to support its goals in selected growth markets. nowhere is this more evident than in ici’s ability to offer products with a multisensory (touch, taste, fragrance and colour) dimension. ici is responding to this by ensuring that each business has a “product stewardship” programme in place. fees due under these arrangements are being claimed against polyprima who, in response, has claimed damages totalling up to $130m for alleged breach of contract, alleged fraud, deceit, misrepresentation and concealment, allegations which c&p rejects and intends to resist vigorously. as yet, legal proceedings 19 have not been commenced by ineos chlor but it is possible that they will be in the near future. ici has received reports that ineos chlor may seek to close part or all of its business if this financial support is not forthcoming. an analysis of employee numbers by business and geographical area may be found in note 36 to the consolidated financial statements. however, comparable trading profit was 23% lower for quest, which was impacted by supply chain problems, and 24% lower for performance specialties, with uniqema being particularly affected by rising raw material prices in the second half of the year. the group continued to focus on better utilisation of both fixed and working capital, and average working capital as a percentage of sales in the international businesses was reduced by over 1% on a comparable basis. the group’s commercial paper programmes and other short- term borrowings are used to fund these working capital fluctuations. total payments due by period less 1-3 4-5 after

sheet can be significantly affected by currency movements. the group selectively hedges its anticipated future trading cash flows up to 12 months ahead using forward contracts and purchased currency options. the fair values for interest rate risk are calculated by using a standard zero coupon discounted cash flow pricing model. provision for these costs are made when expenditure on remedial work is probable and the cost can be estimated within a reasonable range of possible outcomes. provisions were established at the time of each disposal and are regularly reviewed based on latest available

comparable basis with growth in all main markets. higher profits from pakistan and argentina were offset by the loss of profits from divested businesses and the impact of a £5m provision in relation to a continuing european court case involving ici’s former soda ash business. sales and trading profit were lower in polyester fibre, although the soda ash business continued to perform well.

starch national starch’s sales in 2001 of £1,853m were 4% behind 2000 with trading profit of £218m, 12% lower for the same period, both on a comparable basis. specialty synthetic polymers specialty synthetic polymers sales for 2001 were 2% below 2000. margins were impacted early in the year by high raw material costs, but improved as the year progressed as a result of aggressive cost reduction efforts and more favourable raw material costs. the vinamul polymers business experienced lower demand in many applications, and pressure on pricing remained strong. sales were down 5% on a comparable basis, although the health and personal care business continued to grow. in july 2001, uniqema also completed the sale of its ester manufacturing plant at baleycourt, france to ineos chlor. performance in asia was excellent, with 11% comparable sales growth and trading profit well ahead over prior year. this simplification of supply chain infrastructure is expected by management to deliver both cost and working capital reductions. sales and trading profits were also lower in polyester fibre, although the soda ash business continued to perform well. all executive directors are employed on rolling contracts subject to no more than one year’s notice. he also has regional oversight responsibilities for group activities in europe, the middle east and africa. in this position he promotes discussion at appropriate times about the company chairmanship and succession to it. there is a process in place which requires post event reviews to be undertaken following the completion of all major investments. a code of business conduct which provides guidance in this area has been communicated throughout the group. since 1 january 2002, the committee has received material advice from towers perrin, mercer human resource consulting and new bridge street consultants. this measure is based on profit after tax, less a charge for the use of capital. economic profit encourages both profitable growth and the efficient use of capital to generate sustainable shareholder value. mr c miller smith retired on 31 december 2001 and lord trotman was appointed non-executive chairman of the company with effect from 1 january 2002. all amounts reported for individuals are in respect of the part year for which they were employed as directors. tsr has been selected as a performance condition to align the interests of executive directors and shareholders. the shares required to make awards under this plan are provided via a trust funded by ici. 41 performance growth plan (continued) awards under the performance growth plan (continued) (3) prior to being appointed directors, mr w h powell and mr t a scott participated in cash based long-term incentive plans operated by the group. the performance period relating to these awards ended on 31 december 2002. mr powell will receive no payment in respect of his units. they also take into account changes in the actuarial assumptions, particularly those related to equity and bond returns. as a result, changes in transfer values may be positive or negative, depending on investment conditions. (6) dr j d g mcadam and mr t a scott participate in the ici specialty chemicals pension fund. he also participates in two defined contribution plans, for which the employer’s contributions are set out above. consistent with the policy on personal shareholding, no directors have disposed of shares acquired via company share-based plans except to meet consequent income tax liabilities. non-executive directors, apart from lord trotman, have no right to compensation on the early termination of their appointment. exceptional items exceptional items are material items which derive from events or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the group and which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the financial statements are to give a true and fair view. exchange differences on all other balances, except relevant foreign currency loans, are taken to trading profit. the group considers its derivative financial instruments to be “hedges” (i.e. an offset of foreign exchange and interest rate risks) when certain criteria are met. 51 financial derivatives (continued) forward currency contracts (continued) those contracts used to change the currency mix of net debt are revalued to balance sheet rates with net unrealised gains/losses being shown as part of the debt they are hedging. currency options option premia are recognised at their historic cost in the group balance sheet as ‘other debtors’. they are not revalued to fair value or shown on the group balance sheet at period end. provisions for these costs are made when expenditure on remedial work is probable and the cost can be estimated within a reasonable range of possible outcomes. group profit and loss account for

issues task force – accounting for post-retirement benefits other than pensions. a portfolio approach is adopted to create the group’s target proportion of fixed and floating rate debt by currency. fees due under these arrangements are being claimed against polyprima who, in response, has claimed damages totalling up to $130m for alleged breach of contract, alleged fraud, deceit, misrepresentation and concealment, allegations which c&p rejects and intends to resist vigorously, c&p’s claim against polyprima was heard before an arbitration tribunal in singapore in may 2002 and the decision of the tribunal is awaited. 105 41 related party transactions 40 commitments and contingent liabilities (continued) the following information is provided in accordance with frs no. related party: irish fertilizer industries ltd, an equity accounted associate in ireland, which went into liquidation during the year. as yet, legal proceedings have not been commenced by ineos chlor but it is possible that they will be in the near future. ici has received reports that ineos chlor may seek to close part or all of its business if this financial support is not forthcoming. this is required to be amortised on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of employees. prior to that date such goodwill arising on acquisitions by the group was and remains eliminated against retained earnings. intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually in lieu of being amortised. (d) derivative instruments and hedging activities in june 1998 the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued sfas no. 138 require that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values. 138 on 1 january 2001. in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no.133, the group recorded, at 1 january 2001, a net-of-tax cumulative-effect-type increase of £4m in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders’ equity to recognise at fair value all derivatives that were previously designated as cash flow hedging instruments. upon adoption, the group’s management decided not to designate any of its derivative instruments as hedges for us gaap accounting purposes. the synetix disposal does not meet these requirements and has been classified as continuing under uk gaap. additionally, under us gaap, the group has continued to account for its equity investment in hih under the equity method of accounting, and therefore has continued to recognise its proportionate share of hih’s operating results. under us gaap, such shares are treated as treasury stock and included in shareholders’ equity at historic cost. under us gaap, such dividends are only deducted from shareholders’ equity upon declaration of the dividend. 123 accounting for stock-based compensation, the group’s net income of £9m in 2002 would have been reduced to £3m. upon adoption of sfas no.142 an impairment test must be carried out on all intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and goodwill. the test for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and of goodwill must be carried out annually. 144 from 1 january 2002 but there were no events or changes in circumstances which indicated that the carrying values of assets might not be recoverable nor components of the group’s operations disposed of (by sale, abandonment, or in a distribution to owners) or classified as held for sale which required to be disclosed except as disclosed in section (g). the maximum potential amount of future undiscounted payments under all ici’s guarantees as defined by fin no. changes to uk tax law in relation to dividends paid on or after 6 april 1999 result in no effective repayment of any part of the tax credit associated with a dividend paid on or after 6 april 1999 being available under the current convention. in addition, some of ici’s competitors in certain markets are larger and have greater financial resources than the group, which may enable them to deliver products on more attractive terms or to invest larger amounts of capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development. recently disposed businesses may expose ici to costs that could have an adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. as yet, legal proceedings have not been commenced by ineos chlor but it is possible that they will be in the near future. the group has received reports that ineos chlor may seek to close part or all of its business if this financial support is not forthcoming. these lawsuits relate to alleged injury caused by lead related products or for the costs of removing lead-based paint. it is the group’s policy to require that its subsidiaries comply with relevant laws, regulations and standards. this could have an adverse impact on the group’s results of operations and cash flow. registrar and transfer office lloyds tsb registrars the causeway worthing west sussex bn99 6da telephone: 0870 600 3993 dividend mandate any shareholder wishing dividends to be paid

executive our mission is to be the vital ingredient for our customers, consumers, employees, communities, and the environment, making ici a vital part of our investors’ portfolio. this standard of performance must be achieved with world-class productivity and overall business efﬁciency to achieve satisfactory ﬁnancial results. we believe that our extensive product and technology base provides us with a solid foundation on which to build. it received excellent and much appreciated support, with shareholders taking up more than 91% of the rights. ici is focused on growth and we have an increasing number of people in the regions with signiﬁcant potential. we believe that this, in combination with improved operational effectiveness, will provide the basis for consistent, longer-term proﬁt growth. ici’s know-how created innovative new products and improved existing ones to help customers achieve their goals. with some 100 operating units, manufacturing and selling over 50,000 products in more than 55 countries, an ici career can offer a great diversity of work experience. she is currently acting as an ambassador for the uk chemical industry in addition to her ici work. central and eastern europe is buoyant, all our businesses report, with household appliance manufacturing showing particular strength for uniqema. uniqema’s ‘cirrasol’ polypropylene ﬁbre- ﬁnish developed for disposable nappies (diapers) helps to keep the baby dry and comfortable. our ‘dynamx’ polymers from national starch, now being incorporated into styling products, give hair “shape memory”. 15 sensory science that colour, scent, taste and texture are powerful feel-good factors has been known since time began. fast chemistry high throughput experimentation is a technique, adopted by ici three years ago, that uses miniaturised, automated equipment to accelerate screening the properties of thousands of chemical formulations, enabling chemists to explore many more possibilities at much lower cost than formerly. chosen for jewellery because it doesn’t corrode or tarnish, gold is an almost inert metal. in countries where educational provision is limited, such programmes beneﬁt everyone, including ici, by improving the availability of skilled talent. we are developing social investment equivalents for our highly regarded safety, health and environmental (she) performance metrics. we recently adopted sense, representing people who are both deaf and blind, as our corporate relationship charity. part of ici argentina’s business transforms wine industry by-products into ingredients for foods, drinks and pharmaceuticals. pressurised carbon dioxide (co 2 ) used with uniqema’s chemical detergent booster gives excellent cleaning results on fabrics and leather. with dry cleaners almost everywhere in europe and america, there’s an opportunity for uniqema to clean up. creative marketing, detailed local or customer knowledge, in-depth application understanding and advanced technology are the other vital ingredients. in 2002, the local ici paints business launched a new formula elastomeric waterprooﬁng paint that was tough enough to walk on and pleasantly springy underfoot. a low-salt alternative to monosodium glutamate (msg), yeast- based ‘umamex-xlm’ enriches the taste and mouthfeel of savoury dishes, particularly asian favourites. from dairy desserts to thermal interface materials used in space satellites, what keeps customers coming back is the combination of innovation, practical problem solving and responsive service. he also has regional oversight responsibilities for group activities in europe, the middle east and africa. all executive directors are employed on rolling contracts subject to no more than one year’s notice. in this position he promotes discussion at appropriate times about the company chairmanship and succession to it. there is a process in place which requires post event reviews to be undertaken following the completion of all major investments. a code of business conduct which provides guidance in this area has been communicated throughout the group. this measure is based on profit after tax, less a charge for the use of capital. economic profit encourages both profitable growth and the efficient use of capital to generate sustainable shareholder value. for the executive directors, the plan makes conditional awards of ici shares linked to performance over a fixed three year period measured as follows: • chief executive and chief financial officer: total shareholder return (tsr) vs ici’s peer group (see below). the shares required to make awards under this plan are provided via a trust funded by ici. consistent with the policy on personal shareholding, no directors have disposed of shares acquired via company share-based plans except to meet consequent income tax liabilities. profit before tax, but after goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was £317m compared to £205m in 2001. during 2002 the adverse currency translation effect compared to last year on the group’s reported profit before tax, goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was £11m. the group continued to focus on better utilisation of both fixed and working capital, and average working capital as a percentage of sales in the international businesses was reduced by over 1% on a comparable basis. the group’s commercial paper programmes and other short-term borrowings are used to fund these working capital fluctuations. the next triennial actuarial valuation is due to take place at 31 march 2003. frs 17 retirement benefits the group continues to report on employee retirement benefits in accordance with ssap 24. however, in 2002, additional analysis is also provided in accordance with frs 17. this standard sets out revised requirements for the accounting and disclosure of an employer’s retirement benefit obligations and related funding. copies of the annual report and accounts and form 20-f may
