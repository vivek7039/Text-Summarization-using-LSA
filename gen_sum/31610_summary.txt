governance financial statements shareholder information strategic report maintaining a strong portfolio of businesses chairman’s statement i am pleased to present the annual report for 2017, a year in which dmgt demonstrated once again the benefits of maintaining a strong portfolio of businesses that have the potential to deliver attractive long-term returns for our shareholders. this has been a year of transformation as we have made significant changes across the group. the strategic focus on operational execution under paul zwillenberg, your ceo, resulted in dmgt maintaining a double-digit adjusted operating margin. we saw encouraging signs of growth from investments in several initiatives designed to deliver long-term organic returns, albeit with reduced expectations for some b2b businesses that are facing particularly challenging market conditions and which resulted in impairments that adversely affected our statutory results. our mail titles, in print and online, have continued to produce highly valued content for their global audience. our european property information businesses are using their modelling expertise with large data sets to launch new products which will enable faster decision-making in the insurance and banking sectors. continued investment in our events business has supported a strong launch programme where innovative organic growth is being pursued internationally. beyond operational execution and enhancing financial flexibility, one of the main considerations of the board is to ensure our portfolio is in optimal shape to harness market growth dynamics, as well as withstand market volatility. dmgt has benefited from the resilience provided by its diversified portfolio, during continued challenging market conditions. sadly, following a short illness, nicholas berry, non-executive director, died in december 2016. nicholas had served on the dmgt board for nine years, providing invaluable advice and insights across a wide range of areas, particularly our leadership programmes. through harnessing our growth opportunities and investing in the best ideas we remain confident that dmgt will deliver good long-term returns to

delivering against clear strategic priorities ceo review overview in spite of challenging market conditions dmgt has delivered a resilient performance in a year of transformation at the company. adjusted operating and pre-tax profits declined year-on-year, mainly due to the reduced stake in euromoney. this work has begun as part of our company-wide performance improvement programme, which we are rolling out to better position us for consistent long-term growth. we have delayered management, reduced overheads, enhanced our talent and refocused each business’s priorities. i am confident that our programme of action will deliver long-term sustainable growth and shareholder returns. we are building on strong foundations, as shown by aspects of our performance in the past financial year. operating profit declined by an underlying 2%, primarily due to our investments in the b2b businesses and amortisation costs at rms. there was encouraging underlying profit growth at dmg media, driven by good cost control and increasing mailonline profitability. key performance indicators (kpis) are used to measure dmgt’s performance at a group level and there is an update on how these have progressed during the reporting period on pages 14 and 15 of the strategic report. while there is much more to do, we have made good, clear progress with the launch of our performance improvement programme. these areas will help us deliver on our investments, ultimately driving value creation across the group. as a part of this, we remodelled and strengthened our central management team, drawing heavily on existing dmgt talent. from a business perspective, the operational improvements have driven significant progress in three particular areas. looking forward, we are optimistic about the future growth prospects for its naviance, intersect and starfish products. firstly, in b2b sectors, customers increasingly expect to have the same quality of user interface as they do with consumer products. secondly, the most successful consumer products are built on robust use of data and analytics to gain insight. the agility, speed to market, user engagement and audience understanding demonstrated by mailonline can be applied within our b2b businesses. at the year end, net debt was £464 million with a net debt to ebitda ratio of 1.4 times, the lowest it has been in over 20 years, as a result of disposal proceeds and continuing healthy cash generation. in pursuing a balanced capital allocation approach, we remain committed to increasing shareholder returns through sustainable real dividend growth. we have begun to execute on the performance improvement programme, which will deliver results against our three key strategic priorities. despite challenging market conditions, we nevertheless expect b2b to deliver modest underlying revenue growth, reflecting the benefits of increased focus. we aim to position dmgt for the future and, in particular, for what we refer to as a ‘digital 4.0’ world, where artificial intelligence, machine learning on big data and the use of predictive analytics play an increasingly important role. it includes expenditure on product development, whether capitalised or expensed directly, and the adjusted operating losses from early-stage businesses. there continues to be a focus on improving operational execution, combined with laying the foundations for long-term growth. the pipeline includes high definition models, which provide increased granularity, as a key differentiated offering. • the carrying values of

real estate due diligence, was adversely impacted by lower real estate transaction volumes and the business experienced an underlying decline in revenues in the year. in europe, landmark expects to

were received on proposed developments in the systems for financial control and reporting. amendments were made to adopt a three-year cycle and maintain compliance with evolving best practice. the audit & risk committee is satisfied that its requirements were met with some improvement actions in respect of communications being noted. this included the group-wide risks and local statutory

authority or on the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. goodwill arising on business combinations also includes amounts corresponding to deferred tax liabilities recognised in respect of acquired intangible assets. the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each period end date, and is reduced or increased as appropriate to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered, or it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available. the recoverable amount is determined by discounting future cash flows to

statements shareholder information strategic report valuation techniques and assumptions applied for the purpose of measuring fair value the following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: • level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; • level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and • level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). the recoverable amount is determined by discounting future cash flows to present value using market interest rates. there are a number of reasons for this – the actuarial valuation is as at the schemes’ year end date of 3 1 march and is calculated triennially based on more prudent assumptions including those covering discount rates and mortality. 161 daily mail and general trust plc annual report 2017 governance financial statements shareholder
