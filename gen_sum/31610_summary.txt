Statutory Results † Adjusted Measures Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information DMGT is an international business built on entrepreneurialism and innovation. The strategic focus on operational execution under Paul Zwillenberg, your CEO, resulted in DMGT maintaining a double-digit adjusted operating margin. Our European property information businesses are using their modelling expertise with large data sets to launch new products which will enable faster decision-making in the insurance and banking sectors. Continued investment in our events business has supported a strong launch programme where innovative organic growth is being pursued internationally. Nicholas had served on the DMGT Board for nine years, providing invaluable advice and insights across a wide range of areas, particularly our leadership programmes. Through harnessing our growth opportunities and investing in the best ideas we remain confident that DMGT will deliver good long-term returns to shareholders.

Amount donated to charity FY 2017 £817k Entrepreneurialism As a home for entrepreneurs, working at the cutting edge of technology, DMGT fosters constant innovation, growth and talent development across our international businesses. In many instances, the uncertainty of changing political and regulatory norms presents commercial opportunities, as we help our customers anticipate implications for their business. Our approach • As an entrepreneurial Group focused on digital growth, DMGT stays ahead by continually fostering innovation and embracing new ideas. This work has begun as part of our Company-wide Performance Improvement Programme, which we are rolling out to better position us for consistent long-term growth. Operating profit declined by an underlying 2%, primarily due to our investments in the B2B businesses and amortisation costs at RMS. While there is much more to do, we have made good, clear progress with the launch of our Performance Improvement Programme. As a part of this, we remodelled and strengthened our central management team, drawing heavily on existing DMGT talent. Firstly, in B2B sectors, customers increasingly expect to have the same quality of user interface as they do with consumer products. The agility, speed to market, user engagement and audience understanding demonstrated by MailOnline can be applied within our B2B businesses. In pursuing a balanced capital allocation approach, we remain committed to increasing shareholder returns through sustainable real dividend growth. We have begun to execute on the Performance Improvement Programme, which will deliver results against our three key strategic priorities. Despite challenging market conditions, we nevertheless expect B2B to deliver modest underlying revenue growth, reflecting the benefits of increased focus. It includes expenditure on product development, whether capitalised or expensed directly, and the adjusted operating losses from early-stage businesses. US Trepp, the securitised mortgage data and analytics business, delivered another year of underlying revenue growth, reflecting continued investment in its core services.

The Financial Review details DMGT’s performance during a year of transition, where new strategic priorities were established and investment to drive long-term growth continued. This was, however, largely offset by declining transaction revenues from European Property Information and Genscape’s solar business, reflecting challenging market conditions.

Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Valuation techniques and assumptions applied for the purpose of measuring fair value The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: • Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; • Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and • Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
