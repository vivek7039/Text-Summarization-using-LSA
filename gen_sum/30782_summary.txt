our 5x5 strategy on page 2 intertek group plc annual report and accounts 2017 16 strategic report chief executive officer's review ceo's review continued a customer-centric organisation intertek is uniquely positioned to deliver atic solutions with a truly global network: over 1,000 laboratories and offices in more than 100 countries across the world, providing fast and efficient services to customers on a local basis. the best way of explaining that breadth is to describe in some detail how our services can be applied to the sourcing, production and distribution of a simple product – such as a t -shirt, for example. other assurance services include: d a m ag e s u r v e y i ng : we can inspect cotton for any damage that might have been sustained during transit mill qualification programme: under this key service, we can evaluate a manufacturing supplier’s quality, environmental and social performance, and certify the mill’s own in-house lab. this is a particularly important aspect of the quality assurance process, as it provides peace of mind that suppliers are abiding by international standards and legislation on modern-day slavery and child labour e n v ir o n m e nt a l ch e mi c a l management solutions: we ensure proper chemical management by undertaking thorough testing of wastewater and sludge as well as onsite auditing and training ethical supply chain assessments: we can certify garment factories against a wide range of international standards, including worldwide responsible accredited production (wrap), sa8000 (a leading social accountability certification standard) and our own widely recognised workplace conditions assessment (wca) standard s u p p l ie r q u al i fi c at io n programme: this is a wide-ranging programme that supports a coherent and truly world-class standard enabling corporations to drive continuous improvement in their benchmarking. this covers areas ranging from product and process quality to site management and training custom and trade partnership against terrorism: we help importing businesses set up policies that improve not only their own security practices but those of their supply chain partners too c o u n t e r fe i t i ng a s s u r a n c e : integrating our intellectual property (ip) expertise into our family of assurance services enables us to determine whether partners in the supply chain pose a risk of counterfeiting our customers' products b e n c hm ar ki n g : by comparing the features and quality of our customers' products to industry norms, we can enable informed decision-making on factors such as performance claims, design and pricing cyber security assurance: our cutting edge cyber security solutions, strengthened by our acquisition of ewa-canada, provide protection against ransomware, increasingly sophisticated phishing scams, distributed denial-of-service attacks and more l i f e c y c l e a ss e ss me n t s : we use cloud-based technology to deliver a sustainability assurance solution that enables customers to compute the carbon footprint of their products, processes and business operations. but while our service portfolio includes services that are specific to individual industries and sectors, intertek’s reach is industry- agnostic. we can demonstrate this by taking another example – a highly appropriate one given our historical connections to thomas edison. so, at the mine, physical testing and chemical analysis can be underpinned by a damage survey, for example. the emerging picture is complex enough when we consider relatively simple products like a t-shirt or led lightbulb. but we are every bit as capable of delivering an end-to-end, integrated tqa service in greatly more complex industries, including automotive manufacturing. we clearly demonstrate our flexibility when it comes to factors like emissions and fuel consumption – for this sort of assurance work does not take place in the laboratory, but out on the road in ordinary driving conditions. but they would not be so effective without a clearly defined organisational structure based around an operating model that always puts the customer first. in short, i am very excited about what the future holds for intertek, its employees, shareholders and customers. assured is providing our clients with the peace of mind they need to grow their business. alex has

world. we delivered robust organic revenue growth performance across our main markets of china, hong kong, india and vietnam. innovation we continue to invest in innovation to deliver a superior customer service in our products-related businesses: i2q • customer insight: customers value fast reports and insights from supplier inspections with differing reporting requirements by client. • softlines innovation: intertek has introduced a six-axis robot in its fibre content tests, which can be used to speed up processes where there is chemical contamination risk, improving safety for technicians and allowing them to focus on more analytical work. 2018 outlook we expect our products division to benefit from robust organic revenue growth at constant currency. intertek group plc

areas offering the latest technologies and quality assurance services. our vision is “t o be the world’s most trusted partner for quality assurance”. andré lacroix chief executive officer i am delighted that so much of what we do for our customers is helping them with their own sustainability strategies, whilst internally we also continue to make progress on our sustainability initiatives." in this report we are using the un sdgs as a third party, independent framework to track our country and business line progress in sustainability, and from 2018 onwards, each of our major business lines and countries will provide quarterly updates on the progress they are making toward the un sdgs with which they have chosen to align. to date, 30 products from 10 categories have been verified and awarded with the intertek green leaf mark. the use of biocides in paint reduces barnacle attachment, whilst effectively maintaining aqua-dynamics and reducing overall emissions resulting from shipping activities. intertek assists clients in navigating complicated regulatory approvals for their new, innovative and sustainable alternative products. with the availability of these products, consumers can select brands that reduce their impact to life under water, and minimise wasteful production processes. at intertek we recognise the importance of gender diversity not only in management, but across our business. those concerned are encouraged to report any conduct, compliance, integrity or ethical concerns using the hotline. this ensures effective resolution both of individual issues and any systemic or process improvements that can be made to address them. integral to this is our internal risk, control, compliance and quality programme which we call "doing business the right way". where relevant, all employees and contractors are provided with personal protection equipment when performing work for the company. this systematic approach facilitates a decrease in the number of incidents and ultimately less disruption to business. caring company recognition intertek hong kong has been continuously recognised as a caring company by the hong kong council of social service (hkcss) and this year is the 6th consecutive year that we received this acclaim. a total of 30 participants took part, aged 7 to 10, and the feedback received was overwhelmingly positive. over 1,000 vehicles have been donated through the national auto body council’s recycled rides programme since its inception in 2007 . in 2017 , intertek implemented a global sustainability environmental software platform, which is optimised specifically to provide intertek with the financial grade reporting, analytics, and auditability to support its site level sustainability initiatives and corporate reporting going forward. as a result of this renewed approach, we have already witnessed a material uplift in the level of engagement across the business regarding greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, with each site now being able to access their own, bespoke ghg data dashboard. for example, we perform tests for automotive manufacturers on their engines, to help them improve efficiency, performance and reduce emissions, however in doing so we will burn fuel both in stationary and mobile environments. the outcomes of each toxicity assessment are then used by our clients to ensure environmental protection. the strategy behind pollution prevention planning is to address hazardous chemicals that are found in freshwater resources and landfills. additionally, intertek is also working with a global supplier of laboratory equipment, to identify pollution prevention planning requirements in various countries world-wide so their products can meet customer demand and reduce their contribution of pollutants discharged to the environment. we are therefore using the un sdgs as a third party, independent framework to track our country and business line progress in sustainability. by taking this approach, we aim to increase engagement across our business by providing our people with a framework upon which they can clearly demonstrate the wider positive sustainability contribution that they are making through their daily activities. psi is a member of the us green building council intertek group plc annual report and accounts 2017 59 strategic report during 2017 we established a set of five group sustainability priorities, linked to our 5x5 differentiated strategy for growth. one of our five priorities is to make continuous progress in sustainability through appropriate organisational focus. two networks were created: • country network: – seeking opportunities to act sustainably, through energy efficiency and cost reductions across energy, water and waste usage – engaging with people locally to drive positive behaviours throughout the organisation, but also through encouraging sustainability engagement with local stakeholders – maintaining best in class internal labour and human rights practices, activity monitoring, and liaising with hr colleagues regarding social sustainability metrics improvements • business line network: – taking the lead on engaging the sales organisation within the business line to ensure they are aware of all the sustainability services that can be offered to customers – working with colleagues globally to help develop our suite of sustainability service offerings – help generate new and innovative ways of offering sustainability services to our customers the sustainability champions meet monthly to discuss progress against our group priorities and share best practice. supporting our clients in supply chain risk assessments our sustainability value proposition also supports our clients in their supply chain risk assessments: workplace conditions assessment the intertek developed workplace conditions assessment (wca) program provides a powerful, cost-effective solution for companies and facilities seeking to improve workplace conditions efficiently and in accordance with widely accepted industry standards and best practices. anchored in intertek’s extensive social compliance expertise, wca has emerged as an industry-leading tool for evaluating, benchmarking and continuously improving supplier workplace conditions. we noted the proposals with interest and are reviewing these to ensure any changes can be implemented in due course and strengthen the governance framework as we continue to operate in an ever-evolving environment. gurnek’s expertise is in the areas of culture change, executive coaching, board and strategic talent development while jean-michel brings dear shareholder as reported in the chief

loss model are trade receivables and accrued income. long-term projects consist of two main types: – time incurred is billed at agreed rates on a periodic basis, such as monthly – the current recognition approach is based on timesheets evidencing work done – this is consistent with the “over time” recognition criteria under ifrs 15 using those timesheets as the input basis; or – staged payment invoicing occurs, requiring an assessment of percentage completion, based on services provided and revenue accrued accordingly – assessment of percentage completion will continue in the same way – this is in line with the “over time” recognition under ifrs 15. ifrs 16 leases (effective 1 january 2019) – ifrs 16 requires lessees to recognise a lease liability reflecting future lease payments and a right-of-use asset for lease contracts, subject to limited exceptions for short-term leases and leases of low value assets. a number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2017 , but do not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the group. further details and
