Moving forward, the growth opportunities  are highly attractive for Intertek as we  further leverage our high-quality,  cash-generative earnings model, built on  the local expert delivery of Assurance,  Testing, Inspection and Certification  services on a global scale, that together  define our unique Total Quality Assurance  (TQA) value proposition. This covers  areas ranging from product and  process quality to site  management and training  Custom and Trade Partnership  against Terrorism: we help  importing businesses set up policies  that improve not only their own  security practices but those of their  supply chain partners too  C o u n t e r fe i t i ng A s s u r a n c e :  integrating our Intellectual Property  (IP) expertise into our family of  Assurance services enables us to  determine whether partners in the  supply chain pose a risk of  counterfeiting our customers'  products  B e n c hm ar ki n g : by comparing the  features and quality of our customers'  products to industry norms, we can  enable informed decision-making on  factors such as performance claims,  design and pricing  Cyber Security Assurance: our  cutting edge cyber security  solutions, strengthened by our  acquisition of EWA-Canada, provide  protection against ransomware,  increasingly sophisticated phishing  scams, distributed denial-of-service  attacks and more  L i f e c y c l e A ss e ss me n t s : we use  cloud-based technology to deliver a  sustainability Assurance solution that  enables customers to compute the  carbon footprint of their products,  processes and business operations. But  while our service portfolio includes services  that are specific to individual industries and  sectors, Intertek’s reach is industry- agnostic. We can demonstrate this by taking  another example – a highly appropriate  one given our historical connections to  Thomas Edison. So, at the mine, physical testing and  chemical analysis can be underpinned by a  Damage Survey, for example. The emerging picture is complex enough  when we consider relatively simple  products like a T-shirt or LED lightbulb. But  we are every bit as capable of delivering  an end-to-end, integrated TQA service in  greatly more complex industries, including  automotive manufacturing. But they would not be so effective  without a clearly defined organisational  structure based around an operating  model that always puts the customer  first. Ann-Michele   is Chief Information Officer and joined  Intertek from Ernst & Young consulting  where she led shared services  transformation programmes. Before joining the company he held senior  financial positions at BT Group plc and  other technology services organisations,  having started his career with PwC. But this mammoth  operation, involving more than 100,000  international drop-off points, uses several  different ‘pathways’ in numerous countries  across the world. We delivered robust organic  revenue growth performance across  our main markets of China, Hong Kong,  India and Vietnam. That has now all changed, following Intertek’s  innovative application of ‘MALDI-TOF’ mass  spectrometry technology – previously used  only in the microbial area – to identify fish  species by their protein pattern. STRATEGIC REPORT  INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 27 STRATEGY Our Total Quality Assurance value  proposition allows us to help customers  gain peace of mind that their projects will  proceed on time and their assets will  continue to operate with a lower risk of  technical failure or delay.

The  use of biocides in paint reduces barnacle attachment, whilst  effectively maintaining aqua-dynamics and reducing overall  emissions resulting from shipping activities. With the availability of these products, consumers can  select brands that reduce their impact to life under water, and  minimise wasteful production processes. This ensures effective  resolution both of individual issues and any systemic or process  improvements that can be made to address them. Integral to this is our internal risk, control, compliance  and quality programme which we call "Doing Business the  Right Way".
