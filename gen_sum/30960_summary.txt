• GMS is well-placed to capitalise   on a recovering market with its  modern fleet, industry-leading  operational expertise and  technological capability. Our SESVs are four-legged vessels that   move independently, with no requirement   for anchor handling or tug support. They   have a large deck space, crane capacity and  accommodation facilities that can be adapted  to the requirements of our clients. During 2017, the  Group secured five new contracts with a  total charter period of just under eight years. Vessel age has become increasingly   relevant, with our clients currently able   to demonstrate a preference for modern  tonnage. The  performance of our Large and Mid-Size  Class vessels in particular is notable, with  these achieving above 70% utilisation. This has been a validation of the investment  in these two vessel classes through our new  build programme, and it is reassuring to see  this demand continuing, with contracts in  place for six of the seven vessels for charters  from Q2 2018 onwards. 9 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT As our new build programme is now  complete, we have scaled down the   number of construction personnel at GMS  substantially, whilst still retaining a small  complement of staff with the necessary   key technical expertise to support ongoing  vessel modification and maintenance  projects. The tower enables the  movement of personnel to and from transfer  vessels while they are working at various  satellite locations; so our clients benefit from  a safer and more time-efficient method of  boarding their personnel than was previously  available to them. As wind   farm projects are now being located further  offshore, frequent personnel transfers to and  from the shore have become impractical. Outlook We would expect the improving oil price  environment to have a positive influence   on clients’ activity levels in our markets. I am confident that with our modern fleet,  industry-leading operational expertise and  technological capability we are well-placed  to capitalise on a recovering market. We charter these vessels to our global  clients, providing them with cost-effective  and safe offshore support solutions. Generate   long-term  shareholder  value Disciplined cost and  balance sheet management  We seek to maintain a prudent financial   policy with appropriate levels of liquidity. A GMS SESV provides Benefits to our clients Independent self-propelled  four-legged design for safe   and efficient operations,   with rapid move capability. SESVs do not require additional tug support or anchor handling vessels and can therefore move more  efficiently around a client’s field of assets than conventional jackups without self-propulsion. With no need for additional support vessels resulting in quicker vessel moves between locations, clients   can reduce their project costs and increase productivity. The new build programme announced  in 2014 has been fully completed and  future fleet expansion will be subject   to market demand. The Group incurred zero TRIR   and LTIR incidents in 2017 which  demonstrates our commitment   to delivering industry leading  standards of safety. The Group is capable of  modifying assets to satisfy client requirements and can do so in   its own yard where appropriate. The Group’s robust operating standards result in minimal downtime  which helps ensure that clients are not given cause to cancel contracts  through non-performance. This has enabled the Group to  retain key technical skills and expertise in our fleet of high quality vessels. We have a fundamental  obligation to protect our people and  recognise the implications of poor  safety procedures. Failure to deliver the  expected operational performance  could result in reputational damage,  litigation, reduced profit margins or  loss of clients. The Group may not be able to deploy  stacked vessels timely for new  contracts which could limit operational  readiness. A significant achievement in 2017 was the  team’s completion and installation of our  innovative cantilever system for GMS  Evolution. The Group’s business continues to be heavily  weighted towards clients’ opex-based  activities, with 71% of our total 2017 revenue  coming from this segment. The cantilever system allows our vessel to  supplant higher cost non-propelled drilling rigs   on well workover projects by offering greater  operational efficiencies, quicker servicing times  and lower costs. GMS Evolution, complete with the cantilever,   has now relocated to Europe where it has been  chartered by a new client to support a renewable  energy project from Q2 this year, however, the  cantilever system will become available after  completion of this long-term contract. This  in-house training resource ensures we can mobilise  our vessels in a timely manner as new contracts   are awarded. It is noted that the 2016 comparative figures  presented reflect better trading levels  compared to more recently as a significant  portion of revenue in 2016 (H1 2016 in  particular) was derived from contracts   that had been signed prior to the market  downturn and lower oil prices. Cost of sales  reduced less than the decrease in revenue,  as vessels that were ‘warm stacked’  between contracts at our own yard still incur  certain operating costs to be ready for rapid  redeployment. We would expect  general and administrative expenses to be   at a higher level going forward as operating  levels increase. Dividends  As discussed in the Chief Executive’s  Review, dividend payments have been  suspended while we focus on reducing   our bank debt. Any further  capital expenditure would relate to contract  specific requirements that may be required  as new work is secured. In addition, EBITDA based  covenants are now to be calculated on a  proforma EBITDA basis (further explanation  is contained within the Glossary) with the  intention to provide a more forward-looking  assessment of trading rather than reporting  on an historic basis. GMS operates responsibly in accordance with the formal legal and  regulatory disclosure requirements expected of a UK listed company. We support the personal and professional development of all our  employees, so they can reach their full potential within GMS.

Chairman Chief Executive Officer  • Providing strategic insight from his wide-ranging business  experience and contacts built up over many years. • Providing a sounding Board for the Chief Executive Officer   on key business decisions, challenging proposals where  appropriate. • Making himself available to shareholders if they have concerns  that cannot be addressed through normal channels. The Board believes  that these evaluations can provide a valuable opportunity to highlight  recognised strengths and identify any areas for development. Additional  meetings are held in the intervening periods to keep existing and  prospective investors updated on our latest performance. We met  five times during the financial year and attendance at those meetings  is set out on page 31. In 2017, this included an assessment of whether the Annual  Report taken as a whole was fair, balanced and understandable. We will  continue to review our Remuneration Policy and targets for future  variable pay awards so that we can remain confident that our policy  reflects the Company’s strategic objectives and to take account of  any feedback received from shareholders. We shall be seeking your support for each part  of this report at the forthcoming AGM on 22 May 2018. The Company is required to prepare, and seek shareholder  approval for an updated Directors’ Remuneration Policy at least once every three years. Targets are set on sliding scales that take account of internal strategic planning   and external market expectations for the Group. Christopher Foll was appointed as an Alternate Director on 27 February 2014; he receives no remuneration for this appointment. Members may remove a Director by passing an ordinary  resolution of which special notice has been given, in accordance   with the Companies Act 2006. 60 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017 DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED Employees and policies  The Group operates an equal opportunities policy that aims to treat  individuals fairly and not to discriminate on the basis of sex, race,  ethnic origin or disability or on any other basis. The amendments clarify how an entity should evaluate whether there will be sufficient  future taxable profits against which it can utilise a deductible temporary difference. 75 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16, which has not yet been endorsed by the EU, introduces a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and  accounting treatments for both lessors and lessees. IFRS 16 distinguishes leases and service contracts on the basis of whether an identified asset is controlled by a customer. Capital work-in-progress Properties and vessels under the course of construction, are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes professional  fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs under capitalised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. When a reasonable   and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise   they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. 2017 US$’000 2016 US$’000 Saudi Arabia 41,830 8,858 United Arab Emirates 19,542 109,740 Qatar 18,119 14,401 Total – Middle East and North Africa 79,491 132,999 United Kingdom 16,338 24,455 Netherlands 13,602 16,708 Rest of Europe 3,450 5,248 Total – Europe 33,390 46,411 Worldwide Total 112,881 179,410 86 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017 6 Presentation of adjusted non-GAAP results The following table provides a reconciliation between the Group’s adjusted non-GAAP and statutory financial results:  Year ended 31 December 2017 Year ended 31 December 2016 Adjusted  non-GAAP results US$’000 Adjusting items US$’000 Statutory total US$’000 Adjusted  non-GAAP results US$’000 Adjusting items US$’000 Statutory total US$’000 Revenue 112,881 – 112,881 179,410 – 179,410  Cost of sales  – Operating expenses (39,096) – (39,096) (52,435) – (52,435) – Depreciation and amortisation (30,500) – (30,500) (31,326) – (31,326) – Impairment charge* – (7,327) (7,327) – (21,307) (21,307) Gross profit 43,285 (7,327) 35,958 95,649 (21,307) 74,342  General and administrative – Depreciation (1,391) – (1,391) (1,451) – (1,451) – Other administrative costs (15,330) – (15,330) (20,185) – (20,185) Operating profit 26,564 (7,327) 19,237 74,013 (21,307) 52,706  Finance income 47 – 47 75 – 75  Finance expense (23,327) – (23,327) (20,181) – (20,181) Expensing of loan arrangement and facility  fees** – (11,021) (11,021) – – –  Costs to acquire new bank facility*** – (5,891) (5,891) – – –  Fair value gain on financial liabilities held at  amortised cost**** – 1,279 1,279 – – – Other income 75 – 75 88 – 88  Loss on disposal of asset (575) – (575) (847) – (847) Foreign exchange gain/(loss), net 1,856 – 1,856 (1,023) – (1,023) Profit/(Loss) before taxation 4,640 (22,960) (18,320) 52,125 (21,307) 30,818  Taxation credit/(charge) 167 – 167 (1,377) – (1,377) Profit/(Loss) 4,807 (22,960) (18,153) 50,748 (21,307) 29,441  Profit/(Loss) attributable to  Owners of the Company 4,395 (22,960) (18,565) 50,816 (21,307) 29,509  Non-controlling interests 412 – 412 (68) – (68) Earnings/(Loss) per share 1.26 (6.57) (5.31) 14.54 (6.10) 8.44  Supplementary non-statutory  information Operating profit 26,564 (7,327) 19,237 74,013 (21,307) 52,706  Add: Depreciation and amortisation charges 31,891 – 31,891 32,777 – 32,777  Non-GAAP EBITDA 58,455 (7,327) 51,128 106,790 (21,307) 85,483  * The impairment charge on certain vessels has been added back to operating profit to arrive at adjusted profit for the year. • Restricted reserve includes reserves maintained by certain subsidiaries in compliance with the relevant UAE Companies Law applicable  (note 17). ****  Costs to acquire new loan facility including arrangement, advisory and legal fees which were accrued as at 31 December 2017. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy  counterparties which have been determined based on credit checks and other financial analysis, such that significant revenue is generated  by dealing with high profile well known customers, for whom the credit risk is assessed to be suitably low. Electronic communication facilities for the receipt of any document or information on  proxies are open to all shareholders and those who use them will not be disadvantaged. Normal system timings and limitations will, therefore,  apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its powers   as a member provided that no more than one corporate representative exercises powers relation to the same shares. However, this additional information  presented is not uniformly defined by all companies including those in the Group’s industry. Such measures should not be viewed in isolation or as an  alternative to the equivalent GAAP measure.
