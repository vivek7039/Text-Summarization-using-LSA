• no dividend to be paid for 2017 as the group focuses on reducing bank debt. • a long-term contract extension awarded in early 2018 for an additional 16 months (including option periods). • gms is well-placed to capitalise on a recovering market with its modern fleet, industry-leading operational expertise and technological capability. 4 gulf marine services plc annual report 2017 gms at a glance a world leader in sesvs gulf marine services is the operator of the world’s largest fleet of advanced self-propelled self-elevating support vessels (sesvs). our sesvs are four-legged vessels that move independently, with no requirement for anchor handling or tug support. they have a large deck space, crane capacity and accommodation facilities that can be adapted to the requirements of our clients. this system, complete with a well workover unit, allows gms to deliver a greater range of services from its sesvs and to carry out work that would otherwise be performed by more expensive non-propelled drilling rigs. our continued focus on cost management has enabled us to achieve an adjusted ebitda margin of 52% (2016: 60%). during 2017, the group secured five new contracts with a total charter period of just under eight years. vessel age has become increasingly relevant, with our clients currently able to demonstrate a preference for modern tonnage. the performance of our large and mid-size class vessels in particular is notable, with these achieving above 70% utilisation. a good example of how we use our operational experience and technological expertise to provide tailored solutions for our clients is the crew transfer system we developed for one of these projects, which is discussed later in this report. the group’s continued focus on cost management helped to deliver an adjusted ebitda margin of 52% (2016: 60%). this has been a validation of the investment in these two vessel classes through our new build programme, and it is reassuring to see this demand continuing, with contracts in place for six of the seven vessels for charters from q2 2018 onwards. two eight-month charters for large and mid-size class vessels were also secured in the mena region. 9 gulf marine services plc annual report 2017 financial statements governance strategic report as our new build programme is now complete, we have scaled down the number of construction personnel at gms substantially, whilst still retaining a small complement of staff with the necessary key technical expertise to support ongoing vessel modification and maintenance projects. i would like to thank everyone at gms for their hard work during the year. the tower enables the movement of personnel to and from transfer vessels while they are working at various satellite locations; so our clients benefit from a safer and more time-efficient method of boarding their personnel than was previously available to them. market commentary middle east we are seeing increasing levels of both enquiries and tender activity for all our vessel classes in the middle east, although the conversion of certain tenders into contracts continues to be a protracted process. as wind farm projects are now being located further offshore, frequent personnel transfers to and from the shore have become impractical. outlook we would expect the improving oil price environment to have a positive influence on clients’ activity levels in our markets. i am confident that with our modern fleet, industry-leading operational expertise and technological capability we are well-placed to capitalise on a recovering market. we charter these vessels to our global clients, providing them with cost-effective and safe offshore support solutions. maintain highest levels of hse performance we seek to maintain the highest levels of hse performance as we protect our clients, employees and contractors, and minimise our impact on the environment. expand our capability stakeholder relationships manage key 12 gulf marine services plc annual report 2017 we have the right business model and strategy in place to ensure we are well-positioned to secure new contracts as the market recovers. we provide bespoke training for key personnel and train our staff to the highest operational standards. generate long-term shareholder value disciplined cost and balance sheet management we seek to maintain a prudent financial policy with appropriate levels of liquidity. topside maintenance well intervention commissioning and accommodation wind-farm installation, maintenance and accommodation during the industry downturn of recent years, our strategy has been to ensure the innovative solutions we provide can help our clients to realise meaningful cost efficiencies in their own operations, and this has helped us to maximise our vessel utilisation in the challenging market environment. a gms sesv provides benefits to our clients independent self-propelled four-legged design for safe and efficient operations, with rapid move capability. sesvs do not require additional tug support or anchor handling vessels and can therefore move more efficiently around a client’s field of assets than conventional jackups without self-propulsion. our vessels are ideally suited to well intervention activities that require frequent changes in location. the four-legged design allows our vessels to jack up and down securely, in shorter weather windows. sesvs have integrated cranes, which means that clients do not require additional costly crane barges. with no need for additional support vessels resulting in quicker vessel moves between locations, clients can reduce their project costs and increase productivity. the adjusted ebitda margin declined as a result of lower utilisation and lower day rates reflecting challenging trading conditions which was partly offset by effective cost management and a continued focus on operational efficiency. adjusted net profit declined reflecting the reduction in revenue with operating costs reducing by less than the revenue as vessels that were ‘warm stacked’ between contracts still incurred certain operating costs to be ready for rapid redeployment. large class vessel evolution was delivered on time and within budget against the original design plans. the vessel subsequently underwent modifications to install a well intervention cantilever system, which was commissioned in q3 2017. the new build programme announced in 2014 has been fully completed and future fleet expansion will be subject to market demand. the group incurred zero trir and ltir incidents in 2017 which demonstrates our commitment to delivering industry leading standards of safety. the group is capable of modifying assets to satisfy client requirements and can do so in its own yard where appropriate. opex v capex the group provides cost-effective services mainly in the opex phase of oil companies’ budgets, supporting long-term oil production which historically has tended to be less cyclical than capex phase work. the group’s robust operating standards result in minimal downtime which helps ensure that clients are not given cause to cancel contracts through non-performance. this has enabled the group to retain key technical skills and expertise in our fleet of high quality vessels. we have a fundamental obligation to protect our people and recognise the implications of poor safety procedures. failure to deliver the expected operational performance could result in reputational damage, litigation, reduced profit margins or loss of clients. the group may not be able to deploy stacked vessels timely for new contracts which could limit operational readiness. the scenario analysis performed specifically considered the potential impact on our business of a sustained period of low oil prices, primarily through reducing revenues and cash inflows by incorporating prolonged reductions in charter day rates and utilisation levels. further information on the gms fleet can be found in the gms at a glance section on page 4. the table below provides a summary of our key performance metrics: small class (6 units*) 2017 2016 average

following its impairment in 2017. hsseq health, safety and the environment continue to be our top priority and we delivered an excellent safety performance in the year, with a total recordable injury rate** of zero (0.20 in 2016) and zero lost time injuries** (one lost time injury in 2016). a significant achievement in 2017 was the team’s completion and installation of our innovative cantilever system for gms evolution. during the year, we continued to achieve efficient mobilisations and a high level of client satisfaction. we also ensured that gms is well-positioned to react quickly as the market recovers by keeping our off-hire vessels in a state of readiness, at a relatively low cost, for rapid deployment when new charters are awarded. sesv charter rates, utilisation and operating costs while 2017 continued to be a challenging year in our sector, utilisation of our core sesv fleet improved 15 percentage points on q4 2016, with a rate of 61% delivered for the year. demand has been relatively good for both the large class and mid-size classes, which each achieved utilisation above 70% for 2017. the group’s business continues to be heavily weighted towards clients’ opex-based activities, with 71% of our total 2017 revenue coming from this segment. the cantilever system allows our vessel to supplant higher cost non-propelled drilling rigs on well workover projects by offering greater operational efficiencies, quicker servicing times and lower costs. gms evolution, complete with the cantilever, has now relocated to europe where it has been chartered by a new client to support a renewable energy project from q2 this year, however, the cantilever system will become available after completion of this long-term contract. world first sesv cantilever system during the year we also developed an innovative crew transfer system for one of our large class sesvs that will be providing mobile accommodation for our client’s personnel working on a wind farm project. this in-house training resource ensures we can mobilise our vessels in a timely manner as new contracts are awarded. financial statements governance strategic report 23 gulf marine services plc annual report 2017 markets middle east we are seeing improvements in levels of enquiries and tender activity for all our vessel classes in the middle east, with this region being our largest market in 2017. it is now reassuring to see a re-emergence of longer-term charter requirements from our noc clients, as over the past few years the majority of contracts have been of a shorter term nature and originated from epc contractors. the vessels can also move rapidly between in-field locations, which helps to increase our clients’ operational uptime. for example, our vessels are ideally suited to support asset life extension projects on ageing oil producing infrastructure in south east asia, where factors such as water depth and weather conditions present no difficulties for our fleet. we will continue to manage our costs appropriately with cash conservation and deleveraging being key priorities. cost of sales reduced less than the decrease in revenue, as vessels that were ‘warm stacked’ between contracts at our own yard still incur certain operating costs to be ready for rapid redeployment. certain costs previously capitalised through our new build programme activity will now also be expensed and there will be increased costs arising from the expansion of our operations in both saudi arabia and europe. any further capital expenditure would relate to contract specific requirements that may be required as new work is secured. in addition, ebitda based covenants are now to be calculated on a proforma ebitda basis (further explanation is contained within the glossary) with the intention to provide a more forward-looking assessment of trading rather than reporting on an historic basis. gms operates responsibly in accordance with the formal legal and regulatory disclosure requirements expected of a uk listed company. we support the personal and professional development of all our employees, so they can reach their full potential within gms. we are also pleased to provide student placements at our head office in abu dhabi as part of our commitment to the development and promotion of work opportunities for young people in the uae. as we noted

sufficient future taxable profits against which it can utilise a deductible temporary difference. under ifrs 9, financial assets can be designated as at fvtpl to mitigate an accounting mismatch. based on the group’s preliminary assessment, there will be no impact on the classification and measurement of financial assets and all financial assets will continue to be classified at amortised cost. there will be no change in the classification and subsequent accounting treatment for any financial liabilities. 75 gulf marine services plc annual report 2017 financial statements governance strategic report ifrs 16 leases ifrs 16, which has not yet been endorsed by the eu, introduces a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and accounting treatments for both lessors and lessees. furthermore, the classification of cash flows will also be affected because operating lease payments under ias 17 are presented as operating cash flows; whereas under the ifrs 16 model, the lease payments will be split into a principal and an interest portion which will be presented as financing and operating cash flows respectively. for acquired or newly built vessels, a notional dry dock cost is allocated from the vessel’s cost based on experience of similar vessels, and (if material) depreciated on a straight-line basis to the next anticipated dry docking. capital work-in-progress properties and vessels under the course of construction, are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs under capitalised in accordance with the group’s accounting policy. the amortisation expense on intangibles is included as a part of general and administrative expenses. when a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. the provision relating to end of service benefits is disclosed as a non-current liability. deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. the new facility will subsequently be recognised as a financial lability at amortised cost. 2017 us$’000 2016 us$’000 saudi arabia 41,830 8,858 united
