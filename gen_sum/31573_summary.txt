consideration paid for alligator on 1 november 2017 was £56.0 million, and is subject to customary working capital adjustment. total group revenue increased by 12.6% (10.0% at cer 1 ) with a strong performance across the uk (+11.6%) and continued strength in paris (+5.1%). our property portfolio valuation, including investment properties under construction, increased in the year by 6.2% on a constant currency basis. 3 the consideration paid for alligator on 1 november 2017 was £56.0m, and is subject to customary working capital adjustment. we remain focused on further optimising the group’s operational performance whilst our balance sheet strength and flexibility provide us with the opportunity to actively consider further selective development and acquisition opportunities in our key markets. our continued focus will be on ensuring that we drive occupancy to utilise this capacity at carefully managed rates. all new recruits receive individual performance targets within four weeks of joining the business and are placed on the “pay-for-skills” programme, which allows accelerated basic pay increases dependent on success in demonstrating specific and defined skills. in 2017 we delivered a further 22,500 hours of training through face-to-face sessions and via our internally developed online learning tool. these modules are continually updated to target the areas of most opportunity and maintain colleague engagement. amendment and extension of bank facilities — the previous uk and euro revolving credit facilities were extended by two years from june 2020 to june 2022, with an option (on an uncommitted basis) to extend for a further year; the previous £126 million term loan was cancelled. this ltv and interest cover ratio of 6.7x for the year ended 31 october 2017 provide us with significant headroom compared to our banking covenants. however, investments will only be made if they comply with our disciplined and strict investment criteria. the ssshl business, which had provisional net assets of £56.7 million at 31 october 2017, was acquired on a debt and cash-free basis. this is particularly the case for paris and its first belt, which inhibits new development possibilities. from 1 november 2017, the portfolio includes alligator self storage and the pro forma regional splits and occupancy figures are as follows: (including alligator self storage) london and south east rest of uk uk total paris group total number of stores 67 53 120 26 146 let square feet (m sq ft) 1.91 1.74 3.65 0.89 4.54 maximum lettable area (m sq ft) 2.58 2.53 5.11

represents the pro forma 31 october 2017 position (including alligator). while capacity increased significantly between 2007 and 2010 with respondents to the survey opening an average of 32 stores per annum, new additions have been limited to an average of 19 stores per annum between 2011 and 2016 (including container storage openings). the remaining circa 1,000 self-storage outlets (including 317 container-based operations) are independently owned in small chains or single units. safestore has estimated that uk owner-occupied housing transactions drive around 8–13% of the group’s storage revenue. the ssa survey confirmed that only 28% of domestic self-storage customers stored for reasons related to a property move and this would include people renting accommodation. although our property valuation for leaseholds is conservatively based on future cash flows until the next contractual lease renewal date, safestore has a demonstrable track record of successfully regearing leases several years before renewal whilst at the same time achieving concessions from landlords. local staff have certain levels of discretion to flex the system-generated prices but this is continually monitored. our group head office comprises business support functions such as yield management, property, marketing, hr, it and finance. strategic report 12 safestore holdings plc | annual report and

£0.2 million. frederic vecchioli chief executive officer 8 january 2018 notes 1 underlying ebitda is defined as operating profit before exceptional items, corporate transaction costs, change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment properties, contingent rent and depreciation. — continuing focus on yield management with regular review of demand levels and pricing at each individual store. property investment and development acquisition and development of properties that fail to meet performance expectations or overexposure to developments within a short timeframe may have an adverse impact on the portfolio valuation, resulting in loss of shareholder value. therefore, the board considers that there has been no significant change to this risk since last year. principal risks continued financial statements governance overview strategic report 15 annual report and financial statements 2017 | safestore holdings plc risk current mitigation activities developments since 2016 valuation risk value of our properties declining as a result of external market or internal management factors. — current gearing levels provide sizeable headroom on our portfolio valuation and mitigate the likelihood of covenants being endangered. occupancy risk a potential loss of income and increased vacancy due to falling demand, oversupply or customer default, which could also adversely impact the portfolio valuation. 2017 £’m 2016 £’m operating profit 109.6 109.3 adjusted for: – gain on investment properties (39.2) (41.7) – depreciation 0.5 0.4 – contingent rent 0.6 0.5 exceptional

foreign operations. these policies have been consistently applied to each of the years presented, unless otherwise stated. there has been no significant impact from the adoption of these accounting standards and ifric interpretations. no revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due. the fair value of investment properties and investment properties under construction reflects, among other things, rental income from current leases and assumptions about rental income from future leases in the light of current market conditions. some of these outflows are recognised as a liability, including finance lease liabilities in respect of leasehold land and buildings classified as investment properties; others, including contingent rent payments, are not recognised in the balance sheet. 79 annual report and financial statements 2017 | safestore holdings plc financial statements governance overview strategic report 2. summary of significant accounting policies continued impairment of tangible assets (excluding investment property) at each balance sheet date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. bank overdrafts that cannot be offset against other cash balances are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet. borrowings interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. after initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 81 annual report and financial statements 2017 | safestore holdings plc financial

as an expense as they fall due. — underlying ebitda is defined as operating profit before exceptional items, corporate transaction costs, change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment properties, contingent rent and depreciation. a reconciliation of statutory operating profit to underlying ebitda can be found in the financial review on page 18. a reconciliation of statutory basic earnings per share to adjusted diluted epra eps can be found in note 10. the basis of calculation, including a reconciliation to reported net assets, is set out in note 13. the freehold and leasehold investment properties have been valued as at 31 october 2017 by external valuers, cushman & wakefield llp (“c&w”). cash flow projections have been prepared for all of the properties reflecting estimated absorption, revenue growth and expense inflation. — the net operating income in future years is calculated assuming either straight line absorption from day one actual occupancy or variable absorption over years one to four of the cash flow period, to an estimated stabilised/mature occupancy level. if an assumption of no rental growth is applied to the external valuation, the net initial yield pre-administration expenses for mature stores (i.e. excluding those stores categorised as “developing”) is 7.84% (31 october 2016: 7.98%), rising to a stabilised net yield pre-administration expenses of 8.80% (31 october 2016: 8.99%). the weighted average annual discount rate adopted (for both freeholds and all leaseholds) is 10.55% (31 october 2016: 10.75%). epra diluted net assets per

policies, the group will utilise derivative instruments, but only for risk management purposes. interest rate risk the group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, issued share capital and bank borrowings. short term bank deposits are executed only with a-rated or above authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies. overall, the group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk. at 31 october 2017, if sterling had weakened by 10% against the euro with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been unchanged (fy2016: unchanged), as a result of foreign exchange gains and losses on translation of euro-denominated receivables. the group is not exposed to significant transaction foreign exchange risk as purchases are invoiced in either sterling or euros. the group obtains such valuations from counterparties who use a variety of assumptions based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. 102 safestore holdings plc | annual report and financial
