Total Group revenue increased by 12.6% (10.0% at CER 1 ) with a strong performance across the UK (+11.6%) and continued strength in Paris (+5.1%). Our property portfolio valuation, including investment properties under construction, increased in the year by 6.2% on a constant currency basis. Our continued focus will be on ensuring that we drive occupancy to utilise this capacity at carefully managed rates. Over this period, our customer satisfaction score has averaged above 96% and we have achieved a Feefo Gold Service Merchant rating every year since its introduction. In 2017 we delivered a further 22,500 hours of training through face-to-face sessions and via our internally developed online learning tool. Amendment and extension of bank facilities — The previous UK and Euro revolving credit facilities were extended by two years from June 2020 to June 2022, with an option (on an uncommitted basis) to extend for a further year; the previous £126 million term loan was cancelled. This LTV and interest cover ratio of 6.7x for the year ended 31 October 2017 provide us with significant headroom compared to our banking covenants. The SSSHL business, which had provisional net assets of £56.7 million at 31 October 2017, was acquired on a debt and cash-free basis. The SSA survey confirmed that only 28% of domestic self-storage customers stored for reasons related to a property move and this would include people renting accommodation. Our Group Head Office comprises business support functions such as Yield Management, Property, Marketing, HR, IT and Finance. The four recently opened stores (Wandsworth, Chiswick, Birmingham and Altrincham) are all performing at least in line with their business plans. Frederic Vecchioli Chief Executive Officer 8 January 2018 Notes 1 Underlying EBITDA is defined as operating profit before exceptional items, corporate transaction costs, change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment properties, contingent rent and depreciation. — Current gearing levels provide sizeable headroom on our portfolio valuation and mitigate the likelihood of covenants being endangered. Occupancy risk A potential loss of income and increased vacancy due to falling demand, oversupply or customer default, which could also adversely impact the portfolio valuation. We are developing contingency plans; however, until the terms of Brexit become clearer, limited progress can be made.

Non-Executive Directors must retire annually once they have been in office for a period of more than eight years. We also reported on revenue recognition, but this was no longer considered a key audit matter in the current year. Underlying EBITDA is defined as operating profit before exceptional items, corporate transaction costs, change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment properties, contingent rent and depreciation. Bank overdrafts that cannot be offset against other cash balances are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet. Borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. — Underlying EBITDA is defined as operating profit before exceptional items, corporate transaction costs, change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment properties, contingent rent and depreciation. A reconciliation of statutory operating profit to underlying EBITDA can be found in the financial review on page 18. A reconciliation of statutory basic earnings per share to Adjusted Diluted EPRA EPS can be found in note 10. Operating profit The following items have been charged/(credited) in arriving at operating profit: Notes 2017 £’m 2016 £’m Staff costs 25 22.0 20.0 Inventories: cost of inventories recognised as an expense (included in cost of sales) 14 0.9 0.8 Depreciation on property, plant and equipment 12 0.5 0.4 Gain on investment properties 11 (39.2) (41.7) Contingent rent payable under finance leases 0.6 0.5 6. The freehold and leasehold investment properties have been valued as at 31 October 2017 by external valuers, Cushman & Wakefield LLP (“C&W”). Cash flow projections have been prepared for all of the properties reflecting estimated absorption, revenue growth and expense inflation. If an assumption of no rental growth is applied to the external valuation, the net initial yield pre-administration expenses for mature stores (i.e. excluding those stores categorised as “developing”) is 7.84% (31 October 2016: 7.98%), rising to a stabilised net yield pre-administration expenses of 8.80% (31 October 2016: 8.99%). Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, issued share capital and bank borrowings. Short term bank deposits are executed only with A-rated or above authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies. The Group is not exposed to significant transaction foreign exchange risk as purchases are invoiced in either Sterling or Euros. The Group obtains such valuations from counterparties who use a variety of assumptions based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
