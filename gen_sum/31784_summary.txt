Chief Executive’s review Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 09 Travel delivered a strong revenue performance across all channels, with trading profit 1 increasing by ten per cent to £96m, including £9m (2016: £7m) from our growing International business. This process has, over the years, led to a significant evolution of our formats and ranges. International We have built a successful Travel business based on the different operating models applied in each channel. Gross margin improved by around 110 bps, through rebalancing the mix of our business, better buying and markdown management. These trials have ranged from lower cost initiatives that deliver key benefits, to additional space with new features, such as a dedicated pen shop and digital area, through to a complete store refurbishment, as we have done in Reading. For example, spoof humour titles over Christmas and our book clubs where we continue to drive good results. 2017 £m 2016 £m Group operating profit 142 133 Depreciation, amortisation and amounts written off fixed assets 42 41 Working capital (7) (8) Employers’ payroll tax on exercised share awards (2) (2) Capital expenditure (48) (42) Net tax paid 2 (25) (23) Net interest paid (1) (1) Movement in provisions (1) 2 Other items 5 8 Free cash flow 105 108 2 Excludes £13m repayment on account made in 2016.

Our risk management framework is therefore designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and, as such, can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against these principal uncertainties impacting on business performance. The Group has contractual and other arrangements with numerous third parties in support of its business activities. The Group also conducts extensive customer research and analysis to gather feedback on changing consumer requirements which is shared with landlords as part of this ongoing relationship management programme. Closure of travel routes both planned and unplanned, such as the disruption caused by natural disasters or weather- related events, may also have a material effect on business.

All of our Munch Better lines are under 400 Kcals and amber or green on the traffic light system. Initiatives like this, together with our improved ranges, have contributed to healthier snacking sales growing by over 30 per cent within Travel last year . We have an in-house ethical audit team based in China who conduct audits of our own-brand suppliers in Asia at least every two years assessing compliance with our Code of Conduct and grading suppliers Black, Bronze, Silver and Gold. We have set certified (FSC/PEFC) or recycled as a minimum standard, which gives additional assurance that pulp is from low risk sources. We have used data gathered to fulfil our requirements under the GHG Protocol, and recommended DEFRA conversion factors. Our partnership is now award-winning, having been recognised with a bronze award for Most Effective Long Term Programme at the Corporate Engagement Awards 2017.

Our audit work included obtaining management’s impairment assessment and discussing the basis for their decision whether or not to impair store assets.

IFRS 16, ‘Leases’ is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 (subject to endorsement by the EU). At each balance sheet date, property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling (GBP), which is WH Smith PLC’s functional and presentation currency. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value (being proceeds received, net of direct issue costs), and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Actual results could differ from these estimates and any subsequent changes are accounted for with an effect on income at the time such updated information becomes available. Value-in-use calculations require the use of estimates in relation to future cash flows and suitable discount rates.
