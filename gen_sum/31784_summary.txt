of stationery , books, magazines and gifts. strategic report corporate governance financial statements other information 07 chairman’s statement “this performance would not be possible without the ongoing commitment and hard work of our employees across our stores, distribution centres and head offices.” henry staunton chairman it is with great pleasure in this, our 225th anniversary year , that i report another year of strong performance to 31 august 2017. we have seen a good sales performance across our travel businesses both in the uk and internationally , driven by our key initiatives and growth in passenger numbers, some strong performances from recently opened stores in international locations; and a high street performance equal to the particularly strong result from last year . chief executive’s review strategic report corporate governance financial statements other information 09 travel delivered a strong revenue performance across all channels, with trading profit 1 increasing by ten per cent to £96m, including £9m (2016: £7m) from our growing international business. see glossary on page 105 for an explanation of the group’s alternative performance measures. this process has, over the years, led to a significant evolution of our formats and ranges. international we have built a successful travel business based on the different operating models applied in each channel. gross margin improved by around 110 bps, through rebalancing the mix of our business, better buying and markdown management. we also create value through improving margins, reducing costs and driving third party income opportunities. these trials have ranged from lower cost initiatives that deliver key benefits, to additional space with new features, such as a dedicated pen shop and digital area, through to a complete store refurbishment, as we have done in reading. this additional space, combined with our range development initiatives drove good like-for-like revenue growth over the christmas period (in categories such as calendars, single christmas cards, wrap, diaries and decorations), and at ‘back to school’. revenue profit 1 total revenue (5)%

drive good results. outlook the distinct strategies for each of our businesses continue to deliver a good performance. most airports are forecasting increases in passenger numbers although the forecasts remain variable by location. stephen clarke group chief executive 12 october 2017 2 including branches in guernsey and isle of man. group profit from trading operations¹ increased to £158m, up six per cent on the prior year . balance sheet and cash flow as at 31 august 2017, the group had net assets of £187m (2016: £168m). 2017 £m 2016 £m group operating profit 142 133 depreciation,

outflows from working capital were £7m which reflects our new store opening programme and timing. the high street leases are on standard ‘institutional’ lease terms, subject to five year upwards-only rent reviews. the travel stores operate mainly through turnover- related leases, usually with minimum rent guarantees, and generally varying in length from five to ten years. performance indicators relating to operating responsibly can be found in the corporate responsibility and environment section of the strategic report set out on pages 25 to 27 and in our full cr report, available at www.whsmithplc.co.uk/cr . our risk management framework is therefore designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and, as such, can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against these principal uncertainties impacting on business performance. the group’s performance is dependent upon effectively predicting and quickly responding to changing consumer demands. the group has contractual and other arrangements with numerous third parties in support of its business activities. most travel stores are held under concession agreements on average for five to ten years, although there is no guarantee that concessions will be renewed or that travel will be able to bid successfully for new contracts. the group also conducts extensive customer research and analysis to gather feedback on changing consumer requirements which is shared with landlords as part of this ongoing relationship management programme. closure of travel routes both planned and unplanned, such as the disruption caused by natural disasters or weather- related events, may also have a material effect on business. in common with most retail businesses, the group also relies on a number of important it systems, where any system performance problems, cyber risks or other breaches in data security could affect our ability to trade. principal risks and uncertainties continued strategic report corporate governance financial statements other information 23 risk/description mitigation change in risk level international expansion the group continues to expand internationally. the group utilises three business models to manage risk in our overseas locations: directly run, joint venture and franchise. the group also has credit risk in relation to its trade, other receivables and sale or return contracts with suppliers. impr o v ed execution and service 2. high street i. optimise returns on space ii. we use mystery shoppers to monitor customer service and reward employees who perform well. we also operate a gold badge recognition scheme in our high street stores awarded to store staff who have delivered excellent customer service. all of our munch better lines are under 400 kcals and amber or green on the traffic light system. initiatives like this, together with our improved ranges, have contributed to healthier snacking sales growing by over 30 per cent within travel last year . over the last year , we have also completed a detailed review of our ethical trade policies and audit process, benchmarking whsmith against other eti members to ensure that our approach is in line with best practice. we have an in-house ethical audit team based in china who conduct audits of our own-brand suppliers in asia at least every two years assessing compliance with our code of conduct and grading suppliers black, bronze, silver and gold. a factory must be graded bronze or above if we are to work with them. we have set certified (fsc/pefc) or recycled as a minimum standard, which gives additional assurance that pulp is from low risk sources. more than 90 per cent of the pulp used in our own-brand stationery products now comes from certified sustainable forest sources, and we have set a target to get to at least 95 per cent by 2020. a copy of our forest sourcing policy is available at www.whsmithplc.co.uk/corporate_responsibility/ our_policies/. these improved energy efficiency measures have now been implemented in 220 high street stores and 430 travel units. we have used data gathered to fulfil our requirements under the ghg protocol, and recommended defra conversion factors. to mark whsmith’s 225th anniversary , we have partnered with three charities this year , cancer research uk, mind and the national literacy trust, with all of our employees across the group coming together to support our charity fundraising. the whsmith group charitable trust, an independent registered charity , actively supports employees that are involved with charitable organisations in their local communities, as well as working in partnership with the group to support literacy projects. in head office, we introduced a mentoring programme to support employees with their career development. during the year , we have implemented a number of initiatives to promote more women into senior positions. drummond hall has stood for annual re-election since 2011 and will be standing again at the agm in january 2018. further information on the board evaluation process can be found on pages 31 and 32 of this report. this review included receiving reports from management, discussion, challenge, and assessment of the principal risks. work is being undertaken to ensure succession arrangements are in place for board members and key management. when requested to do so, the chairman and non-executive directors attend meetings with major shareholders. this report was approved by

consultancy services. no director or manager is involved in any decisions as to their own remuneration. both executive directors were provided with a car allowance, private medical insurance and life assurance, in addition to other benefits, during the financial year ended 31 august 2017. pension no changes were made to these elements of remuneration within the financial year ended 31 august 2017. both executive directors were members of the company’s defined contribution scheme and received a total benefit equivalent to 25 per cent of base salary. robert moorhead received all of his pension

operating profits, or otherwise than supported by its normal levels of cover, and therefore should be excluded. • while base salaries are reviewed each year , the company’s policy is not automatically to award an inflationary increase. following the march 2017 salary review, stephen clarke and robert moorhead did not receive any annual increase in april 2017. benefits to provide other benefits valued by the recipient which assist them in carrying out their duties effectively. • benefits received by executive directors comprise a car allowance, staff discount, private medical insurance and life assurance. • all executive directors are eligible to participate in the company’s defined contribution pension plan and/or receive a salary supplement in lieu (which is not taken into account as salary for calculation of bonus, ltip/cip or other benefits). • once the shareholding guidelines have been met, individuals are expected to maintain these levels as a minimum. • executive directors are able to participate in all-employee share plans on the same terms as other group employees. • sharesave – individuals may save up to such limit as permitted by the relevant legislation (currently £500 each month) for a fixed period of three years. • in line with market practice, no performance conditions are attached to options granted under the sharesave scheme. these shares are listed on the london stock exchange and can be held in certificated or uncertificated form. the company used this authority to facilitate its ongoing strategy of returning surplus cash to shareholders by way of dividends and share buybacks thereby increasing total shareholder returns and the net asset value per share. it should be noted that these holdings may have changed since notified to the company. on 11 october 2017 blackrock, inc. notified the company that its holding had fallen below five per cent. the amount of supplier income recognised in the year resulted from mainly high volume, low value transactions for agreements such as volume based retrospective discounts and payments for guaranteed in store space dedicated to product. where responses were not received, we performed alternative procedures including agreement to contracts and cash receipts. furthermore, we analysed supplier income by type recognised each month and compared it to the previous year to identify any unusual trends in the amounts or timing of supplier income recognised in each year. a large proportion of stock is supplied through sale or return arrangements, including the majority of books, newspapers and magazines and therefore these are considered to be lower risk than inventory acquired through outright purchases such as stationery. furthermore, we considered write-offs in the year as an indicator of a requirement for further or less provision. our audit work included obtaining management’s impairment assessment and discussing the basis for their decision whether or not to impair store assets. we agreed individual store trading performance to underlying records including trading data and confirmed that those that were loss making were appropriately impaired where an improvement in results could not be expected, this testing did not highlight any significant issues; and we performed a review of the results for all stores to ensure that management’s identification of loss making stores was complete. we also performed a sense check against loss-making stores within our work over store impairment. the central ledger mainly includes head office costs, including pensions and group property provisions. john ellis (senior statutory auditor) for and on behalf of pricewaterhousecoopers llp chartered accountants and statutory auditors london, 12 october 2017 64 wh smith plc annual

the directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future years will have no material impact on the group’s financial statements. it applies to all contracts with customers, except those in the scope of other standards. ifrs 16, ‘leases’ is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2019 (subject to endorsement by the eu). these alternative performance measures, ‘apms’, are not defined or specified under the requirements of ifrs. the key apms that the group uses include: high street and travel trading profit, group profit from trading operations, like-for-like revenue, gross margin, fixed charges cover, net funds, return on capital employed and free cash flow. the principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently throughout both years, are set out below. this income is subsequently recognised in cost of sales when the product has been sold. the carrying values of tangible fixed assets previously revalued have been retained at their book amount. at each balance sheet date, property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. the consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling (gbp), which is wh smith plc’s functional and presentation currency. in order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the group enters into forward contracts (see below for details of the group’s accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments). exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the group’s translation reserve. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. bank borrowings interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value (being proceeds received, net of direct issue costs), and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. actual results could differ from these estimates and any subsequent changes are accounted for with an effect on income at the time such updated information becomes available. further information in respect of the group’s retirement benefit obligation is included in note 4. goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairment reviews the group is required to review goodwill annually to determine if any impairment has occurred. value-in-use calculations require the use of estimates in relation to future cash flows and suitable discount rates. when a review for impairment is conducted the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is determined based on value-in-use calculations prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates. d) other segmental items 2017 £m travel high street group capital additions 22 28 50 depreciation and amortisation of non-current assets (17)
