and our book clubs where we continue to drive good results. the travel stores operate mainly through turnover- related leases, usually with minimum rent guarantees, and generally varying in length from five to ten years. the group also conducts extensive customer research and analysis to gather feedback on changing consumer requirements which is shared with landlords as part of this ongoing
