many applications such as white goods or other very demanding environments. all business segments reported strong sales growth and our pipeline of commercial opportunities developed positively throughout the year. investments the first phase of investment, hp1, at our site in kentucky, usa has now been successfully commissioned, increasing group high-pressure autoclave capacity by over 20%. earnings per share before exceptional item 16.04p +17% 2016 13.69p total dividend 5.93p +3.1% 2016 5.75p this is an exciting time for zotefoams. we are pleased to announce that doug robertson will be replacing richard as the senior independent director upon his departure. the markets in which we operate are driven by global trends – demographic, environmental and regulatory – which we believe offer potential for high rates of market growth as well as opportunity for our disruptive technology solutions. 4. group return on capital, which excludes large asset investments not yet commissioned, increased to 15.5% from 14.0%. within this structure, business units and brand leaders have significant autonomy to operate in a dynamic environment. key investments zotefoams’ core autoclave technology is asset intensive with high barriers to entry on cost, lead-time and know-how. this positions kentucky as a significant, stand- alone contributor to group capacity, initially focused on azote ® polyolefin foams, with the site large enough for further investment if needed. in total, we have committed to increasing our capacity by approximately 45% over 2017 production run rates. while this is disappointing, we have learnt significant lessons from this, including improved clarity on certain costs, management of the risks associated with long-lead-time, specialist, equipment and the potential opportunity loss from lack of capacity. we therefore emerge as a better-informed organisation, more capable of managing similar investments in the future, whilst recognising that risks to execution remain on large and complex capital projects. during 2017 we operated the croydon facility at its effective capacity, increasing sales volumes globally by around 7%. the operational leverage impact of higher sales, while operating at capacity, meant that profits increased significantly in an environment of modest labour cost increases and stable prices for ldpe, our main raw material, despite a more difficult inflationary environment in some other materials and energy. initially, mel will sell equipment to augment an existing extrusion line and, when the licensee is in production and saving money, mel will collect a share of those savings as a licence fee and/or royalty payment. as there is often a time- lag for end-user adoption, a key metric is the number of machines actually in production, which increased by 46% to 83 machines (2016: 57), many of which are not yet operating at full potential. our licensing business mucell extrusion llc (‘mel ’) licenses a patented process that creates ‘micro-bubbles’ in the core of plastic parts or products by injecting gas into them as they are manufactured. products using mucell ® technology can be designed to perform like solid plastic, but will typically use 15-20% less material, realising both cost and environmental benefits by using inert carbon dioxide or nitrogen gas and reducing the plastic content at source. mel shares in the customers’ benefits by receiving a licence fee for ip and/or royalty on parts made. we are often working in conjunction with a channel partner and/or on applications where other solutions may be successful. mel faces some similar challenges in working mainly with packaging converters who need to convince their end- user customers of the benefits provided. zotefoams also sells t-fit ® technical insulation, manufactured from zotek ® foams, for pharmaceutical, semiconductor and biotech facilities. local and global market positions typically the benefits of azote ® polyolefin foams allow zotefoams to command a stronger market position closer to our factories, as distribution costs are relatively high for these types of foams. revenue by market packaging 34% transportation 21% building & construction 13% sport & leisure 12% industrial 10% medical 6% other 4% 11 strategic report governance financial statements how we invest, create and deliver fundamental to our business model is our ability to invest for the long term in people, products and processes. accelerated growth continuing to deliver value on core products, augmented by success in new and innovative areas. zotefoams plc annual report 2017 zotefoams plc annual report 2017 12 our external context alignment to three global megatrends we have built a clear long-term strategy for growth based around three long-term global megatrends that are driving demand for our products. given the diversity of applications for foam it is not possible to track every use for our materials, and a new idea or application may come from a foam converter, an end-user or from within zotefoams. better healthcare has created a population boom, especially in the older age groups, while globally, discretionary spending power is rising rapidly. we sell azote ® grades for automotive, medical, and packaging designed to minimise emissions and/or meet specific purity requirements. it also aids recycling and makes commonly used plastics float in water, thus aiding collection of any waste. much of our azote ® foam is used in permanent packaging or packaging that is designed to be reused, while foams used in transportation, which accounts for 21% of sales, are normally specified to the lightest weight for the required physical performance. zotefoams’ products typically use less plastic than competitive solutions due to the cell structure of foam made in our autoclave process, giving us both a cost and environmental advantage. demographics regulation environment zotefoams plc annual report 2017 13 strategic report governance financial statements product and sales development journey specific zotefoams’ actions linked to our strategy and megatrends however, when applications are developed it is often possible to accelerate adoption across multiple customers or platforms. a challenge of selling unique, technical materials is that awareness and understanding can be low. after central costs, which includes corporate, finance and it as well as foreign exchange losses of £0.32m (2016 loss: £0.03m), which mainly relate to the corporate governance of an increasingly complex organisation, group operating margin remained stable at 13.4% (2016: 13.3%). in order for return on capital to provide meaningful measurement, management has, therefore, altered the definition to recognise the changing financial structure of our business, where a) revolving credit facilities are treated as long-term debt, and b) major capacity and infrastructure investments, such as in walton, ky , which are expected to require considerable capital over a number of years before being commissioned as production assets, are excluded from these calculations until the point of commissioning. we deliver stakeholder value by using unique technology to create a portfolio of differentiated products. over the past three years we have developed our existing site in walton, ky, usa with buildings, infrastructure, a large, high-pressure autoclave and extrusion capability. this foaming capacity will be fed from assets currently used to manufacture materials for the north american market. in total, we have committed to increasing our capacity by approximately 45% over 2017 production run rates. zotefoams plc annual report 2017 16 producing best-in-class solutions azote ® foams have been selected by an italian defence contractor for use in a series of ultra-hi-tech unmanned crafts. the chosen materials deliver industry-leading fire resistance, lightweight and consistent quality, all made possible using zotefoams’ nitrogen-based autoclave technology. this physical expansion process differentiates zotefoams from competitors manufacturing similar foams with low-density polyethylene (‘ldpe’), which is our main raw material. automobile manufacturers have ambitious plans to produce more than a hundred new electric and battery powered models in the next couple of years. zotek ® n nylon foams can withstand the higher operating temperatures generated from conventional engine and battery packs, which are typically used on hybrid vehicles. azote ® materials have been used by automotive oems for their thermal insulation and vibration-dampening capabilities. zotefoams plc annual report 2017 18 our brand performance continued complying to unprecedented levels of aseptic, microscopic, pollutant-free, assembly global regulation and the ever-increasing requirement for the minimisation of risk is driving manufacturers to produce safer and purer products. t-fit ® clean was developed as a unique thermal insulation system designed for these demanding, highly controlled production environments. zotefoams plc annual report 2017 19 strategic report governance financial statements driving benefits throughout production and distribution mel ’s value proposition is to bring significant material savings and cost benefits into plastic production lines through its patented mucell® microcellular foaming technology. mel staff integrates with the customers in product design, to make the best use of our technological capability, and with this depth of knowledge comes improved customer satisfaction and also more opportunity for further ip . with the group’s high cash generation, gearing remained well within banking covenants at 1.5 times. polyolefin price increases, sales mix, some foreign currency benefits and operations efficiencies pushed margins up. energy cost increases, together with, for the most part, non-recurring inventory adjustments in hpp and mel, held back some of this margin gain. distribution and administrative costs the group continues to pursue its expansion strategy, founded on proprietary cellular-materials technology with an increasing portfolio of differentiated products. the group expects this investment to continue, not least with the commissioning of its us investment in february 2018. these costs also include a net loss from foreign exchange hedging contracts and foreign exchange translation of £0.32m (2016 net loss: £0.03m). this policy is kept under frequent review and formally approved by the board on an annual basis. this was offset by a translation loss, primarily on the company’s us dollar receivables, of £0.51m (2016 gain: £1.98m). it is estimated that, for every one percent move in the usd/£ rate, profit moves by £0.06m hedged and £0.17m unhedged. zotefoams plc annual report 2017 22 the board performs post investment appraisals within an appropriate timeframe following start up. a principal risk is one that has the potential to affect significantly our strategic objectives, financial position or future performance. ensuring it has effective systems, communication methods, recruiting and training will be important mitigating factors. this could have sizeable financial and commercial consequences including, in certain defined circumstances, customer claims. the group has invested in its kentucky, usa site, which provides multi-site capability, subject to capacity, on many polyolefin products. with experience, it will also become possible to manufacture some of the more challenging higher performance foams. in the meantime, such action has already included providing mainland eu employees with residency advice and support. the group, therefore, generates surpluses in us dollars and euros, which are converted into sterling. the group is operationally geared and its experience is that, in challenging circumstances, operational labour costs can be reduced, polymer prices generally fall with reduced economic demand, giving a cost benefit, and cash can be generated from both reducing working capital as well as slowing capital expenditure projects to help offset the effects of a downturn. risk group revenues and profits could be impacted by the loss, insolvency or divergence of interest with a major customer. the group has good knowledge of the end customers of its major customers and, with some additional short- term work, would expect to bring or identify additional converter capacity, supply routes or channel partners to service these markets. these relationships, with balanced commercial contracts, are by their nature longer term, providing a unique technical solution and competitive advantage to the zotek ® foams customers. while everyone is very busy at zotefoams these days we nevertheless recognise the importance of this and intend to take the time to make this an integral part of our growth journey during 2018 and beyond. neither route particularly compromises people on an upward trajectory within their specialities and we believe we have structured a talent solution that focuses on resolving business needs without blocking career paths across the broader business. through 2017 we addressed many areas that this review highlighted, including workflow gaps, training and hiring. our second area of focus for talent acquisition is the ability to serve an increasingly global organisation. in our uk-based staff we already have a demonstrably diverse workforce, as illustrated by fig 2, cultural diversity, and we have augmented our international capabilities through a combination of key hires and an opportunistic approach to junior talent. fig 3. role by gender as at 31 dec 17 female male non-executive

zotefoams considers that the management of safety, health, environmental, social and ethical matters forms a key element of effective corporate governance. zotefoams is making advances in both the types of foams that we offer and their uses for existing materials. unlike foam manufactured by the group’s competitors, no other chemical additives or fillers are used in our process. tightly-defined procedures and operational controls are in place to manage the safety of these pressure systems. the nature of these incidents varied, but they all related to incorrect manual handling or slips and falls. in october 2009, the company entered into a climate change levy (‘ccl ’) agreement, which involves meeting specific targets to reduce energy consumption. our actual carbon emissions (kg) per material gassed (kg) have reduced from 2.3 to 2.1. it should also be noted that another driver for the lower carbon emissions in 2017 and 2016, compared to the earlier years, is that lower conversion factors have been used for electricity and gas consumed in the uk to calculate their carbon emissions. he spent 11 years with rmc group plc before joining koch industries inc, where he spent several years in various positions, including global finance director of invista apparel and emea vice president of finance, planning and analysis at georgia pacific. prior to joining sig, doug had been group
