together i believe chris and philip are a great combination to lead the business into its next phase of growth. this is explained fully in the directors’ remuneration report and i hope you will be supportive of these changes at our upcoming agm. addressable market managing investments in one place with a trusted company that makes things easy is an ambition for many investors and this consolidation process is a journey that many of them go through with us given the range of client offering we have. a significant amount of this investment pool will have been initially advised upon, maybe many years ago, but now receives no ongoing advice. within this population there are key segments for us such as peak savers, pre-retirement and retiring which alone hold c£900 billion. our corporate vantage service is directed at segments of this market and existing schemes we administer will also benefit from auto-enrolment contributions. by attracting net new business and providing incredible service we are well positioned to grow revenues across the market cycle. 1.3 (2016: 1.3) strategic change, regulatory website visits provides a view of the engagement and reach that

introduce my first chief executive’s review. however, we also saw a significant uplift in client share trading and associated revenues which carried on throughout the year. having been uncertain as to demand for this, we surveyed our clients, determined there was real interest and went live just after midnight on 6 april 2017 . as a result, we now see more digital contact from mobile devices and app visits than through our traditional desktop site. looking forward i am pleased that we have delivered strong 2017 results in an environment where the uk has many challenges. global politics are unsettled, our position with europe in a state of flux and markets continue to be uncertain. at the same time, society is going through long-term changes in demographics meaning that people are older for longer. people are not making sufficient provision for this so the country has a long-term savings gap of an estimated £314 billion 3 . funds remain our largest client asset class at 57% of average aua (2016: 57%), and the net revenue margin earned on these this year was 41bps (2016: 44bps). following our decision in june 2017 not to proceed with launching a p2p lending platform, we also wrote off £1.2 million of previously capitalised costs. we believe this attractive operating margin allows us considerable flexibility to balance our client service and shareholder obligations across the market cycle. the group also funds a share purchase programme to ensure we avoid any dilution from operating our share-based compensation schemes. it considers the group’s profitability, cash flows, dividend payments, capital requirements and other key variables such as exposure to principal risks. we also offer an employee assistance programme (eap) which is intended to help employees deal with personal problems that might adversely impact their work performance, health and well-being. we have used the ghg protocol corporate accounting and reporting standard (revised) and emission factors from uk government’s ghg conversion factors for company reporting 2016. in order to provide an intensity ratio for our emissions disclosure, we have calculated our greenhouse emissions per employee. to enhance our internal communications a new team have been tasked with ensuring that key leadership messages are communicated and cascaded across the business. jayne brings a wealth of

performance can be measured and agendas framed, with a follow up session planned for december 2017 . we have delivered this balance through retaining an annual performance bonus with a strong focus on rewarding short-term performance and through greater deferral of annual bonuses into hargreaves lansdown shares, a proposed new approach to long-term incentives and by increasing the minimum shareholdings which our executive directors will need to build. provision of tax efficient benefits such as pension contributions, additional holiday, childcare vouchers and workplace parking is available through a salary sacrifice mechanism. deferral is now wholly into nil cost options whereas previously it could optionally be deferred entirely into cash; • sustained performance plan – under this new plan, annual awards of nil cost options of up to half times base salary will be granted, with a five year vesting period. the committee will also consult with professional advisers to ensure we consider current market and industry practices, where appropriate. name of director year gross basic salary 4 £’000 cash bonus £’000 deferred element of bonus – shares £’000 gain on historic

it was announced in september 2016 that ian gorham had decided to step down as chief executive officer. he subsequently stepped down as ceo on 9 february 2017 , and will remain with the group until 30 september 2017 to ensure a smooth transition. topics which have been discussed by the committee include a variety of systemic, regulatory, political, technological and internal change risks. we tested the inputs of our recalculations by agreeing standing data, such as fee structures, commission rates and security prices to supporting evidence on a sample basis. the group does not operate in more than one location and, as a result, no geographical segments are reported. salary ranges are established by reference to those prevailing in the employment market generally for employees of comparable status, responsibility and skills. awards granted under the executive option scheme range between vesting at grant date and a maximum of ten years. amortisation is provided, where material, on all intangible assets excluding goodwill at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly using a straight-line method over its estimated useful life as follows: customer list – eight years the customer list relates to an acquired book of business and does not include internally generated client lists. the group reassesses whether it controls a subsidiary when facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more elements of control. the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. for more information, please see www.hl.co.uk/finds/hl-funds exp e rts a range of funds offering instant
