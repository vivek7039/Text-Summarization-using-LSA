These assets are invested across the wide range of funds and shares we offer on our platform. Together I believe Chris and Philip are a great combination to lead the business into its next phase of growth. In May 2017 , I announced my intention to stand down as Chairman once a suitable replacement had been appointed. This will ensure that we have an appropriate range of skills and experience on the Board going forward. This is explained fully in the Directors’ remuneration report and I hope you will be supportive of these changes at our upcoming AGM. Conclusion It has been a real privilege to have served as your Chairman for the past eight years. Mike Evans Chairman 14 August 2017 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017 06 Strategic report Hargreaves Lansdown at a glance Our vision is to be a household name We want to be the best place for savers and investors in the UK. Addressable market Managing investments in one place with a trusted company that makes things easy is an ambition for many investors and this consolidation process is a journey that many of them go through with us given the range of client offering we have. A significant amount of this investment pool will have been initially advised upon, maybe many years ago, but now receives no ongoing advice. Within this population there are key segments for us such as Peak savers, Pre-retirement and Retiring which alone hold c£900 billion. Transfers come from across the market spectrum, showing our appeal to clients who currently hold assets elsewhere. The auto-enrolment programme has delivered demonstrable successes and we expect future government policy to build on this. Our Corporate Vantage service is directed at segments of this market and existing schemes we administer will also benefit from auto-enrolment contributions. 1 provider 81,000+ accounts Lifetime ISA First to launch on 6 April 2017 14,550+ clients Corporate Vantage 387 schemes 82,000 members £2.5 billion AUA Portfolio+ Ready-made investing managed by experts, £682 million AUA Portfolio Management Service Our discretionary managed solution, £3.5 billion AUA HL Active Savings Cash management service – in development Other services Annuities, foreign currency service, VCTs, certificated share dealing £79.2 billion Assets Under Administration 954,000 active clients Growing AUA and clients delivers increased revenue opportunities through our diversified offering Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 13 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017 High client satisfaction and high retention rates grow AUA Scalable platform 68% operating profit margin Scalability delivers high operating profit margins and can also be used to benefit clients Scalable growth Key revenue streams are recurring in nature providing high quality earnings.

I am proud to be leading a business that has clients at the heart of how it operates. However, we also saw a significant uplift in client share trading and associated revenues which carried on throughout the year. Having been uncertain as to demand for this, we surveyed our clients, determined there was real interest and went live just after midnight on 6 April 2017 . As a result, we now see more digital contact from mobile devices and app visits than through our traditional desktop site. Looking forward I am pleased that we have delivered strong 2017 results in an environment where the UK has many challenges. Global politics are unsettled, our position with Europe in a state of flux and markets continue to be uncertain. At the same time, society is going through long-term changes in demographics meaning that people are older for longer. People are not making sufficient provision for this so the country has a long-term savings gap of an estimated £314 billion 3 . Funds remain our largest client asset class at 57% of average AUA (2016: 57%), and the net revenue margin earned on these this year was 41bps (2016: 44bps). Depreciation, amortisation and financial costs increased by £2.9 million as a result of higher capital spend in recent years, primarily on our core in-house IT systems. Following our decision in June 2017 not to proceed with launching a P2P lending platform, we also wrote off £1.2 million of previously capitalised costs. We believe this attractive operating margin allows us considerable flexibility to balance our client service and shareholder obligations across the market cycle. The Group also funds a share purchase programme to ensure we avoid any dilution from operating our share-based compensation schemes. It considers the Group’s profitability, cash flows, dividend payments, capital requirements and other key variables such as exposure to principal risks. We also offer an Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) which is intended to help employees deal with personal problems that might adversely impact their work performance, health and well-being. To enhance our internal communications a new team have been tasked with ensuring that key leadership messages are communicated and cascaded across the business. Chris Hill was appointed as CEO in his place, having previously held the position of CFO and Deputy Chief Executive from September 2016. Jayne brings a wealth of relevant financial services knowledge, including current executive strategic, governance and operational experience as Chief Investment Officer at MS Amlin, where she is responsible for running their £6 billion plus global multi-asset, multi- manager portfolios.

Induction Our Chairman, with support from the Company Secretary, is responsible for preparing and implementing a personalised induction programme for all new Directors, to include guidance as to their duties, responsibilities and liabilities as a Director of the Company. This plan is the backbone around which performance can be measured and agendas framed, with a follow up session planned for December 2017 . The Committee has chosen to review its effectiveness by means of a self assessment questionnaire this year. We have delivered this balance through retaining an annual performance bonus with a strong focus on rewarding short-term performance and through greater deferral of annual bonuses into Hargreaves Lansdown shares, a proposed new approach to long-term incentives and by increasing the minimum shareholdings which our Executive Directors will need to build. We have further developed our approach, culminating in the revised Remuneration Policy now being presented for approval. This year has also seen a number of changes to our executive leadership, with the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and so the Committee has sought to determine appropriate packages for these individuals. Further details as to how bonuses have been determined are set out in the annual report on remuneration. Provision of tax efficient benefits such as pension contributions, additional holiday, childcare vouchers and workplace parking is available through a salary sacrifice mechanism. Some Company services are provided at a reduced cost on the same basis as for all other employees. Deferral is now wholly into nil cost options whereas previously it could optionally be deferred entirely into cash; • Sustained Performance Plan – under this new plan, annual awards of nil cost options of up to half times base salary will be granted, with a five year vesting period. The Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension, or to participate in any Group employee share plan. Some Group services are provided at a reduced cost, on the same basis as for all other employees. The Committee will also consult with professional advisers to ensure we consider current market and industry practices, where appropriate.

Note that SAYE options were granted at a discount, on the same basis as for all employees. Under the current policy Chris Hill has until 30 June 2019 to obtain a one times base salary shareholding. Payments for loss of office (audited) It was announced in September 2016 that Ian Gorham had decided to step down as Chief Executive Officer. He subsequently stepped down as CEO on 9 February 2017 , and will remain with the Group until 30 September 2017 to ensure a smooth transition. Topics which have been discussed by the Committee include a variety of systemic, regulatory, political, technological and internal change risks. It meets monthly with attendance from members of the Executive Committee supported by senior management and subject matter experts. During the year, Ian Gorham resigned as Chief Executive Officer, on 9 February 2017 with Chris Hill taking his place. We tested the inputs of our recalculations by agreeing standing data, such as fee structures, commission rates and security prices to supporting evidence on a sample basis. An entity was considered to be financially significant if it contributed more than 5% of consolidated profit before tax. The Group does not operate in more than one location and, as a result, no geographical segments are reported. Salary ranges are established by reference to those prevailing in the employment market generally for employees of comparable status, responsibility and skills. Awards granted under the Executive Option Scheme range between vesting at grant date and a maximum of ten years. Amortisation is provided, where material, on all intangible assets excluding goodwill at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly using a straight-line method over its estimated useful life as follows: Customer list – eight years The customer list relates to an acquired book of business and does not include internally generated client lists. The Group reassesses whether it controls a subsidiary when facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more elements of control. Instruments included in Level 1 comprise primarily equity investments and fund units entered into on a counter-party basis. The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques.
