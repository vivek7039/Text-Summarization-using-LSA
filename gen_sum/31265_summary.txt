This is why the Group has spent considerable time and resource in developing a transactional tool which we call Marketplace. Roger Conant Faxon Non-executive Chairman 9 May 2018 Delivering a new advertising solution at GLOBAL SCALE is our purpose I am delighted to present the first Annual Report and Accounts for Mirriad Advertising plc following the Company’s successful admission to AIM on 19 December 2017. We have maintained our tight focus on the world’s largest and fastest growing advertising markets with high levels of video consumption. The value chain for in‑video advertising involves three parties: content producers, distributors (digital or broadcast) and advertisers/media agencies. As our technology has developed we have increasingly focused resources on the last steps in this process. Development work continued around the Marketplace platform, which will enable key stakeholders such as content owners, distributors and advertisers to transact. Mirriad partnered with Youku/ Alibaba to create an in‑video ad campaign for a leading Chinese car leasing company, T angeche. The campaign embedded T angeche’s brand messages as ad units across more than 20 different shows over five months. We are delighted that the campaign results, independently researched by Miaozhen Systems, exceeded even our high expectations. When demand is generated Mirriad has the technology and processes in place to fulfil transactions using Marketplace. It is also worth emphasising that Mirriad has planned capabilities to support programmatic buying and can provide personalisation depending on our distribution partners’ infrastructure. The Company has been actively protecting its IP and currently holds 11 granted patents, with more in process over 2017. In 2017 Marc Pritchard said that: “We bombard consumers with thousands of ads a day, subject them to endless ad load times, interrupt their screens with pop‑ups and overpopulate their screens and feeds… We’re awfully busy, but all of this activity is not breaking through the clutter. It’s just creating more noise.” While Keith Weed said at the IAB Annual Leadership Meeting in 2018 that: “[Consumers] don’t care about good value for advertisers. But they do care when they see their brands being placed next to ads funding terror, or exploiting children.” Mirriad Ad Units are designed to address these issues and more: bringing a new ad unit format to market requires a new metric that is transparent, verifiable and validated by some of the most respected industry measurement companies. The work in these two pivotal markets should drive more transactional liquidity between media owners and advertisers. The Group now has a base of customers which provides a platform for future growth, though the Directors caution that sales cycles are long and signature of customer contracts, while an important KPI, does not immediately lead to future revenue. It is believed that the expectations reflected in these statements are reasonable but they may be affected by a wide range of variables which could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated. All the Group’s revenue is derived from contracts which have no contractual obligation to maintain or renew any level of purchasing activity and there is no minimum purchasing commitment under the Group’s agreements. Mirriad Advertising plc Annual report and accounts 2017 10 STRATEGIC REPORT Description Mitigation Change Failure to renew contracts Typically the Group’s contracts have 24‑month durations and as they have been signed at different times the Group is generally in a state of contract renewal with one or more customers. Both the Chairman and John Pearson, a Non-executive Director, are considered to be independent. In addition, the Company Chairman has a standing right to attend any Remuneration Committee meetings. Both of the Executive Directors have service agreements that can be terminated by either party giving at least six months’ written notice. Both Executive Directors were awarded discretionary bonuses related to the successful IPO, paid in March 2018. Pensions The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme open to all UK Executive Directors and employees. There are no long-term employment benefit or incentive schemes in place other than share options. Supplier payment policy and practice The Group does not operate a standard code in respect of payments to suppliers. Our audit approach Context Mirriad Advertising plc listed on the Alternative Investment Market as of 19 December 2017. • During our scoping procedures China was considered to have a significant revenue balance and brought into scope. For each reporting unit we determined whether we required an audit of its complete financial information (“full scope”) or whether specified procedures addressing specific risk characteristics or particular financial statement line items would be sufficient. It was assessed that Mirriad Advertising plc and Mirriad Inc. were the only reporting units that were required to be full scope, with the other four reporting units contributing less than 11% to loss before tax and 3% of Group total assets.

IAS 20 “Accounting for grants” has been applied to government grant income received in 2016 and 2015. Accounting policies 2.1 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures (a) New standards, amendments and interpretations The following standards, amendments or interpretations, effective for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2017, have had no material impact on the Group or parent company: • Amendments to IFRS 12: Annual improvements to IFRS 2014–2016 cycle – none of the Group interests are classified as held for sale, held for distribution to owners or as discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5. Although there are differences in the basis of debtors provisioning this is not expected to have a material impact. All Group revenue comes from the primary business activity of providing native in-video advertising (“NIVA”) services to broadcasters, advertisers, brand owners and their agencies. Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences at the reporting date except for certain exceptions. Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which does not exceed three years. If collection is expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. It does not disclose transactions with members of the same Group that are wholly owned. (a) Currency risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to US Dollars, Indian Rupees, Singapore Dollars, Chinese Yuan and Brazilian Real. Standard credit terms offered are 30 days but this can vary depending on the commercial agreement reached. 2017 2016 Revenue £ £ Turnover by geography China and Singapore 450,864 64,909 India 248,356 74,727 UK 101,494 520,655 USA 43,733 50,575 Brazil 29,744 — Total 874,191 710,866 2017 2016 £ £ Turnover by category Rendering of services 874,191 710,866 Total 874,191 710,866 2017 2016 Revenues from external customers by country, based on the destination of the customer £ £ China 455,962 357,496 India 251,023 74,727 USA 57,831 58,101 Brazil 29,744 — Italy 33,036 33,312 Germany 23,444 33,670 Other 23,151 33,262 Australia — 64,622 Korea — 55,676 Total 874,191 710,866 Revenues of £455,962 (2016: £327,056) are derived from a single external customer.
