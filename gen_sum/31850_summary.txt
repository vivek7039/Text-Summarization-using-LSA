our varietal development programme in this division continues apace, and we have a strong pipeline of new potato varieties coming through to market. working capital has risen mainly as a result of the high priced raw material, however, extended customer terms have also contributed to this increase. property, plant and equipment is up £5.8m to £39.9m, primarily as a result of the peacock farm purchase on jersey. net debt increased to £28.0m (2016: £18.1m) as a result of the option exercised on peacock farm (£6.1m) and movements in working capital. rowe had an average year, extending further our customer base, and the expanded production area has helped support this. – new supply chain models with our core retail customers helps reduce the financial volatility of crop prices and allows for long-term planning. non-financial kpi’s are principally efficiency related and include: – volume of potatoes sold: overall total volumes have dropped slightly (2%). michael thornton (senior

is a leading operator in the fresh potato and daffodil sectors. the group assesses its revenue arrangements against specific criteria in order to determine if it is acting as principal or agent. from 31 october 2007 the defined benefit plan ceased to accrue benefits going forward and accordingly there are no current service costs. costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and conditions are accounted for as follows: – raw materials – purchase cost on a first-in, first-out basis. once harvested, these goods are subsequently accounted for under ias2 in the same manner as other inventories purchased from third parties. processing includes the staff and assets that supply pre-prepared potato products which are ultimately sold as ingredients for food manufacturers. investment return risk: if the assets under perform returns assumed in setting funding targets, then additional contributions may be required. targets for the year, however, were not met and all options granted in respect of this scheme therefore lapsed. future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases as at 1 july 2017 are as follows: 2017 £’000 2016 £’000 within one
