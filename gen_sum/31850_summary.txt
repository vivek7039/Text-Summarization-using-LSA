Having served two full three-year terms, Senior independent NED Sir David Naish will also be retiring by rotation. We are achieving improved efficiencies in our two fresh potato processing sites, and anticipate further significant efficiency benefits from the implementation of our Directors’ Report Financial Statements Overview Strategic Report 05 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 REASONS TO INVEST IN PRODUCE INVESTMENTS Produce Investments is a diverse business with a solid core at its foundation and continues to seek acquisition opportunities offering good returns and exciting growth prospects. Products diversification Our strategy is to seek opportunities that provide growth outside the fresh potato sector. Management continue to seek quality businesses that offer synergies along with product and customer diversification. 1986 Business acquired by Dalgety plc 2000 Acquisition of ES Black (Scottish packer with the same private equity shareholders as Greenvale) 2006 Greenvale AP acquired by Produce Investments Ltd 1998 Acquisition of Anglian Produce – Business renamed Greenvale AP 2003 Incorporation of Restrain Co Ltd GROWING AND DIVERSIFYING BUSINESS Providing a strong platform for development 07 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 Directors’ Report Financial Statements Overview Strategic Report Jersey Royal The Company 02 Organic growth Management continue to look to grow the core business with both existing and new customers. FRESH Our core potato business, accounting for circa 78% of Group revenues during the year (2016: circa 78%), traded successfully through a less stable year, characterised by lower crop yields, resulting in higher raw material costs and retail price deflation. Following completion of our packing site rationalisation programme in 2015, we now operate two efficient facilities in Scotland and Cambridgeshire, both of which are very well placed for both the major UK potato growing areas and distribution channels. We have also continued our investment in IT, following the successful transition in 2015 from in-house servers to a cloud-based external provider, thereby reducing the risk of business disruption and improving our contingency planning and disaster recovery capability. Our varietal development programme in this division continues apace, and we have a strong pipeline of new potato varieties coming through to market. OTHER Our storage and ripening technology business enjoyed a better year, with recovery in two core markets. An increase in net debt to £28.0m (2016: £18.1m) at the year end principally reflects our purchase during the year of a packing facility (land and buildings) in Jersey for £6.1m (cash), as well as higher stock valuations and increased trade receivables. Working capital has risen mainly as a result of the high priced raw material, however, extended customer terms have also contributed to this increase. Property, plant and equipment is up £5.8m to £39.9m, primarily as a result of the Peacock Farm purchase on Jersey. However, this will require both businesses to show some improvement in financial performance compared with the current year. Net debt increased to £28.0m (2016: £18.1m) as a result of the option exercised on Peacock Farm (£6.1m) and movements in working capital. The core business traded successfully in a difficult season; it secured increased volumes and has delivered further efficiencies. Rowe had an average year, extending further our customer base, and the expanded production area has helped support this. We have a long-standing policy of recruiting directly, offering good terms and favourable working conditions. – The Group also has a number of incentive schemes in place linked to performance criteria for both business unit and the Group which are designed to be competitive and help retention of key individuals. COMPETITION – The Group operates in a highly competitive market, particularly around product availability, quality and price. – New supply chain models with our core retail customers helps reduce the financial volatility of crop prices and allows for long-term planning. Non-financial KPI’s are principally efficiency related and include: – Volume of potatoes sold: overall total volumes have dropped slightly (2%). Greenvale AP Ltd Over our 40 years of trading we have always been environmentally proactive and innovative. The key data was published in June and July 2017 respectively, which is outlined on their individual websites. Neil subsequently became Chief Executive of Arla Foods following its merger with Express Dairies before retiring in 2005. Barrie is a former Director and Chairman of the Company, having held that position from the Company’s inception in 2006 until its AGM in November 2016, when he stood down after serving two five-year terms as Chairman. The Group is therefore committed to provide its employees with information on a regular basis and, to consult them so that their views may be taken into account in making decisions which may affect their interests and to encourage their participation in schemes through which they will benefit from the Group’s progress and performance improvement. The Committee ensures that account is taken of environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks when setting remuneration and is comfortable that remuneration packages do not raise any ESG risks by motivating irresponsible behaviour. Fixed vs performance-related remuneration In order to incentivise management whilst aligning their interests with those of shareholders, a substantial proportion of the Executive Directors’ pay is performance-related, through an annual bonus plan (based on profit growth) and share-based long-term incentives (based on EPS). Fees are still to be agreed with Rob Johnston and Barrie Clapham who joined the Board on 9 June 2017. All Directors are required to stand for re-election by shareholders at least once every three years. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This included planting records, harvest records (where biological assets have been harvested after the balance sheet date), land registers showing specific areas currently farmed by the Group and historic yields achieved in previous periods where relevant. We discussed these forecasts with management and challenged key assumptions, requesting supporting evidence where available. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all unadjusted differences in excess of £10,000, as well as differences below those thresholds that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.

Financial Statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE 53 WEEKS ENDED 1 JULY 2017 1 GENERAL INFORMATION Produce Investments plc (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries (together ‘the Group’) is a leading operator in the fresh potato and daffodil sectors. Losses are attributed to the non-controlling interest even if that results in a deficit balance. – Reclassifies the parent’s share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss. Intangible assets at the reporting date had a net book value of £15.6m (2016: £16.1m) (see Note 13 for further disclosure). The Group assesses its revenue arrangements against specific criteria in order to determine if it is acting as principal or agent. The Group has concluded that it is acting as a principal in all of its revenue arrangements. Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease terms. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. From 31 October 2007 the defined benefit plan ceased to accrue benefits going forward and accordingly there are no current service costs. These instruments have been designated as ‘financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss’. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. All intangible assets of the Group, other than goodwill, are assessed as having finite lives. Such assets are amortised straight line over five years, being the period of expected future benefit. Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and conditions are accounted for as follows: – Raw materials – purchase cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Once harvested, these goods are subsequently accounted for under IAS2 in the same manner as other inventories purchased from third parties. Organic Potato Growers (Scotland) Limited reports its financial performance with a year end of 31 May. Processing includes the staff and assets that supply pre-prepared potato products which are ultimately sold as ingredients for food manufacturers. 51 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 Strategic Report Directors’ Report Overview Financial Statements Deferred tax The deferred tax included in the statement of financial position is as follows: 2017 £’000 2016 £’000 Non-current deferred tax liabilities Accelerated capital allowances 1,328 1,478 Other 1,183 1,357 Fair value adjustments (biological assets) 936 943 Fair value adjustments (customer lists) 437 566 Fair value of interest rate swaps – 12 3,884 4,356 Non-current deferred tax assets Pensions and post-employment obligations (1,522) (1,319) Share-based payments (385) (199) Net deferred tax 1,977 2,838 Reconciliation of total deferred tax movements 2017 £’000 2016 £’000 Opening net deferred tax 2,838 4,009 Income statement (324) (1,277) Statement of comprehensive income (537) 106 Closing net deferred tax 1,977 2,838 The deferred tax included in the income statement is as follows: 2017 £’000 2016 £’000 Accelerated capital allowances (150) (255) Pensions and post-employment obligations (24) 32 Other (174) (696) Acquisition fair value adjustments – customer lists (129) (168) Share-based payments 172 (123) Movement in fair value of interest rate swap (12) (1) Temporary differences arising from valuation of biological assets (7) (66) Deferred income tax (credit) (324) (1,277) 10 EARNINGS PER SHARE 2017 2016 Profit attributable to equity shareholders (£’000) 6,046 3,211 Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 26,946,218 26,815,963 Weighted average number of options with dilutive effect 1,281,042 858,278 Total number of shares – fully diluted 28,227,260 27,674,241 Basic earnings per share – pence 22.43 11.97 Diluted earnings per share – pence 21.42 11.60 Adjusted earnings per share Operating profit (£’000) 7,366 4,579 Exceptional Items 1,007 4,635 Finance costs and income (£’000) (850) (1,094) Income from associate 62 11 Adjusted profit before tax (£’000) 7,585 8,131 Tax on adjusted profit at effective rate (£’000) (557) (421) Adjusted profit after tax (£’000) 7,028 7,710 Adjusted profit attributable to ordinary shareholders (£’000) 6,979 7,606 Adjusted basic earnings per share – pence 25.90 28.36 Adjusted diluted earnings per share – pence 24.72 27.48 52 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 11 DIVIDENDS 2017 £000 2016 £000 Interim dividend of 2.44 pence per share in respect of 2017 (2016: 2.44 pence per share) 659 655 Final dividend of 4.88 pence per share in respect of 2016 (2015: 4.775 pence per share) 1,312 1,280 Total dividends paid in the year 1,971 1,935 The Directors propose a final dividend of 5.026 pence per share payable on 5 December 2017 to shareholders who are on the register at 3 November 2017.
