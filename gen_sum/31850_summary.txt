reasons to invest in produce investments produce investments is a diverse business with a solid core at its foundation and continues to seek acquisition opportunities offering good returns and exciting growth prospects. 4. products diversification our strategy is to seek opportunities that provide growth outside the fresh potato sector. 1986 business acquired by dalgety plc 2000 acquisition

financial statements overview strategic report jersey royal the company 02 organic growth management continue to look to grow the core business with both existing and new customers. following completion of our packing site rationalisation programme in 2015, we now operate two efficient facilities in scotland and cambridgeshire, both of which are very well placed for both the major uk potato growing areas and distribution channels. our varietal development programme in this division continues apace, and we have a strong pipeline of new potato varieties coming through to market. other our storage and ripening technology business enjoyed a better year, with recovery in two core markets. an increase in net debt to £28.0m (2016: £18.1m) at the year end principally reflects our purchase during the year of a packing facility (land and buildings) in jersey for £6.1m (cash), as well as higher stock valuations and increased trade receivables. working capital has risen mainly as a result of the high priced raw material, however, extended customer terms have also contributed to this increase. property, plant and equipment is up £5.8m to £39.9m, primarily as a result of the peacock farm purchase on jersey. however, this will require both businesses to show some improvement in financial performance compared with the current year. net debt increased to £28.0m (2016: £18.1m) as a result of the option exercised on peacock farm (£6.1m) and movements in working capital. the core business traded successfully in a difficult season; it secured increased volumes and has delivered further efficiencies. rowe had an average year, extending further our customer base, and the expanded production area has helped support this. competition – the group operates in a highly competitive market, particularly around product availability, quality and price. – new supply chain models with our core retail customers helps reduce the financial volatility of crop prices and allows for long-term planning. non-financial kpi’s are principally efficiency related and include: – volume of potatoes sold: overall total volumes have dropped slightly (2%). greenvale ap ltd over

company’) and its subsidiaries (together ‘the group’) is a leading operator in the fresh potato and daffodil sectors. – reclassifies the parent’s share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss. intangible assets at the reporting date had a net book value of £15.6m (2016: £16.1m) (see note 13 for further disclosure). the group assesses its revenue arrangements against specific criteria in order to determine if it is acting as principal or agent. the group has concluded that it is acting as a principal in all of its revenue arrangements. rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease terms. from 31 october 2007 the defined benefit plan ceased to accrue benefits going forward and accordingly there are no current service costs. these instruments have been designated as ‘financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss’. following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. such assets are amortised straight line over five years, being the period of expected future benefit. costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and conditions are accounted for as follows: – raw materials – purchase cost on a first-in, first-out basis. once harvested, these goods are subsequently accounted for under ias2 in the same manner as other inventories purchased from third parties. processing includes the staff and assets that supply pre-prepared potato products which are ultimately sold as ingredients for food manufacturers. 51 produce investments annual report & accounts 2017 strategic report directors’ report overview financial statements deferred tax the
