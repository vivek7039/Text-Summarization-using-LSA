We made a further important acquisition in August, of Halarose, an electoral back office software and services business that has significantly enhanced our elections’ capabilities. £m 27.2 Accrued income adjustments relating to accounting irregularities identified by finance team (2.8) Treatment of certain 6PM licences (see below) (1.0) Contracts missed 2017 cut off (4.8) Increased audit fees (0.1) 18.5 The miss of the originally expected EBITDA target of £27.2m by £8.7m can be summarised as follows: Management had an expectation that 6pm licences would be able to be recognised at a point in time and had budgeted for revenue in this way. Idox has an exceptionally strong market position in the public sector, a sound balance sheet, and multiple opportunities for growth. “The best thing about Idox is that we have a network of specialists who all bring different skills, personalities and experiences to projects. Non-Financial Indicators Idox Group practises an integrated management system centred around gaining and retaining ISO accreditations. They represent our long-term investment in smart City solutions, which we believe represents an attractive opportunity for the Group. Digital The Digital business had an unexciting year in revenue terms but was very proud to have completed and delivered new designs and approaches for a diverse customer base including the Church of England, as well as several well- known premier league football clubs. The investment strategy will result in an increased focus on our web cloud and smart city solutions. The new technology needed to facilitate improved citizen engagement and drive efficiencies by delivering a fully integrated, end-to-end service. Case Study: Craven District Council Delivering end-to-end digital services Strategic Report Company Information Financial Statements Governance Overview Strategic Report > Financial Review 15 Financial Review continued Adjusted profit before tax and adjusted earnings per share are alternative performance measures, considered by the Board to be a better reflection of true business performance than looking at the Group’s results on a statutory basis only. Another factor which increased ETR was the non-recognition of losses incurred in Malta, owing to uncertainty over their future utilisation. These losses will be recognised where their likelihood of utilisation increases, with any future recognition resulting in a decrease to ETR. Deferred income, representing invoiced maintenance and SaaS contracts yet to be recognised in revenue stood at £19.8m (2016: £15.9m). Risk management processes and internal control procedures are established within business practices across all levels of the organisation. A diversified geographical footprint and sector focus reduces the risk of exposure due to adverse country or sector-specific conditions. Regular business continuity plans are updated and delivered to the Board on at least an annual basis. The Group has increased diversification of its customer base through acquisitions to mitigate against political risks. The Group is also affected by economic environments in other territories, which include currency volatility, inflation and recession.

The Group has minimal exposure to foreign exchange risk as a result of natural hedges arising between sales and cost transactions. Significant variances from budget or strategy are discussed at Board meetings and actions set in place to address them. Additionally, under the Group’s Articles of Association, at least one third of the Directors who are subject to retirement by rotation are required to retire and may be proposed for re-election at each Annual General Meeting. Two Directors will retire from office at the Group’s forthcoming Annual General Meeting and stand for re-appointment. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the group financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Key observations We gained sufficient audit evidence to support the majority of revenue through our enhanced procedures. We are aware that external valuation specialists have been used to perform the valuations of each acquisition. There are specified criteria that must be met under IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’ to record an asset. Key observations We gained sufficient audit evidence from our procedures relating to the existence of accrued income at year end. We gained 100% full scope coverage over the carrying value of goodwill and business combinations - acquisitions key audit matters. Please refer to note 26 for the Group’s current operating lease commitments, which will be disclosed as a balance sheet liability under IFRS 16 when this becomes effective. Management have estimated that a range of 1 to 5 years is more appropriate depending on the future revenue projected for each individual asset. This review has led to accelerated amortisation on a small number of assets during the year. All new capitalised development is reviewed on an individual project basis and management will select the most appropriate rate of amortisation for each asset. Management may exercise judgements over various elements of a contract, for example: • whether there are ongoing obligations relating to software licences which would require the revenue to be recognised over time rather than at a point in time • whether performance obligations are separable or bundled • whether it is appropriate to recognise revenue on certain contracts such as service agreements, prior to an invoice being raised, where work has been completed and there is a high degree of certainty of the contract being completed and the invoice raised and cash received. Other intangible assets Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortised to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight- line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are reviewed on an annual basis. Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed in profit or loss as incurred. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options that have vested are not exercised. • “Treasury reserve” represents shares repurchased by the Company to be held for redistribution as share options. Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. The Idox Group is considered large for research and development tax credit purposes owing to a headcount of over 500. Exchange adjustments arising are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve and reported in other comprehensive income. As at 31 October 2017, the Group is therefore organised into five operating segments, which are detailed below. 6 Finance Income and Costs 2017 £000 2016 £000 Interest receivable 6 4 Insurance income – 8 Dividends receivable 24 19 Foreign exchange differences 222 – Other income 111 24 Finance income 363 55 Bank loans interest payable (757) (790) Bond interest payable (836) – Bank charges and loan facility fees (335) (298) Loss on discounting of amounts recoverable from customers (103) (191) Foreign exchange differences – (78) Finance costs (2,031) (1,357) 7 Dividends 2017 £000 2016 £000 Final dividend paid in respect of the year ended 31 October 2016 and 31 October 2015 2,627 1,885 Pence per ordinary share 0.650p 0.525p Interim dividend paid in respect of the year ended 31 October 2017 and 31 October 2016 1,590 1,263 Pence per ordinary share 0.385p 0.350p The Directors have proposed the payment of a final dividend of.0.655p per share, which would amount to £2,705,000 (2016: 0.650p). These downward pressures on ETR were mitigated by impairment, acquisition costs and the non-recognition of overseas losses. These losses will be recognised where their likelihood of utilisation increases, with any future recognition resulting in a decrease to ETR. The decision was made to derecognise these assets until there is more certainty over their future utilisation. 63 Company Information Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview Financial Statements > Notes to the Accounts Notes to the Accounts continued For the year ended 31 October 2017 9 Earnings Per Share The earnings per ordinary share is calculated by reference to the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during each period, as follows: 2017 £000 2016 £000 Profit for the year 2,628 11,806 Basic earnings per share Weighted average number of shares in issue 397,125,960 357,989,177 Basic earnings per share 0.66p 3.30p Weighted average number of shares in issue 397,125,960 357,989,177 Add back: Treasury shares 2,366,219 3,023,469 ESOP shares 985,589 875,044 Weighted average allotted, called up and fully paid share capital 400,477,768 361,887,690 Diluted earnings per share Weighted average number of shares in issue used in basic earnings per share calculation 397,125,960 357,989,177 Dilutive share options 10,678,522 13,579,022 Weighted average number of shares in issue used in dilutive earnings per share calculation 407,804,482 371,568,199 Diluted earnings per share 0.64p 3.18p 2017 £000 2016 £000 Adjusted earnings per share Profit for the year 2,628 11,806 Add back: Amortisation on acquired intangibles 5,248 3,817 Impairment 2,681 – Acquisition costs 8 (404) Restructuring costs 704 330 Tax effect (1,727) (829) Adjusted profit for year 9,542 14,720 Weighted average number of shares in issue – basic 397,125,960 357,989,177 Weighted average number of shares in issue – diluted 407,804,482 371,568,199 Adjusted earnings per share 2.40p 4.11p Adjusted diluted earnings per share 2.34p 3.96p 64 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 10 Property, Plant and Equipment Computer hardware £000 Fixtures, fittings and equipment £000 Library books and journals £000 Investment Property £000 Total £000 Cost At 1 November 2015 1,009 514 184 – 1,707 Additions 554 64 61 – 679 Additions on acquisition 65 10 – – 75 Internal reallocation to intangible assets (12) – – – (12) Disposals (359) (105) – – (464) At 31 October 2016 1,257 483 245 – 1,985 FX on opening balances – 9 – – 9 Additions 1,542 38 3 – 1,583 Additions on acquisition 99 212 – 384 695 Disposals (806) (102) (233) (384) (1,525) Internal reallocation of asset category 113 (137) – – (24) At 31 October 2017 2,205 503 15 – 2,723 Depreciation At 1 November 2015 393 104 133 – 630 Provided in the year 355 139 90 – 584 Eliminated on disposal (359) (75) – – (434) Fair value adjustment 63 27 – – 90 At 31 October 2016 452 195 223 – 870 Provided in the year 889 264 19 – 1,172 Eliminated on disposal (731) (138) (233) – (1,102) Internal reallocation of asset category 74 (98) – – (24) At 31 October 2017 684 223 9 – 916 Net book amount at 31 October 2017 1,521 280 6 – 1,807 Net book amount at 31 October 2016 805 288 22 – 1,115 The Group has pledged the above assets to secure banking facilities granted to the Group.

If Halarose had been included from 1 November 2016, it would have contributed £3,474,000 to Group revenue and a profit after tax of £1,310,000. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the parent company financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. During the year end audit process, it was identified that £1.5 million of historic adjustments were made to offset share option reserve impact of share option exercises against fixed asset investment cost rather than a transfer to the retained earnings reserve. We have obtained sufficient audit evidence to conclude that the carrying value of investments is materially correct.
