we made a further important acquisition in august, of halarose, an electoral back office software and services business that has significantly enhanced our elections’ capabilities. idox has an exceptionally strong market position in the public sector, a sound balance sheet, and multiple opportunities for growth. “the best thing about idox is that we have a network of specialists who all bring different skills, personalities and experiences to projects. the total number of customer solutions has now exceeded over 100. building on this, consultation has begun on the next generation of web based solutions for local government which is scheduled for delivery in incremental stages starting in 2019 through to 2020. overall, we have continued to see further market share gains with 108 new local authority customers, 7 new system sales and 11 managed service customers. they represent our long-term investment in smart city solutions, which we believe represents an attractive opportunity for the group. the new technology needed to facilitate improved citizen engagement and drive efficiencies by delivering a fully integrated, end-to-end service. another factor which increased etr was the non-recognition of losses incurred in malta, owing to uncertainty over their future utilisation. these losses will be recognised where their likelihood of utilisation increases, with any future recognition resulting in a decrease to etr. a diversified geographical footprint and sector focus reduces the risk of exposure due to adverse country or sector-specific conditions.
