we made a further important acquisition in august, of halarose, an electoral back office software and services business that has significantly enhanced our elections’ capabilities. £m 27.2 accrued

(0.1) 18.5 the miss of the originally expected ebitda target of £27.2m by £8.7m can be summarised as follows: management had an expectation that 6pm licences would be able to be recognised at a point in time and had budgeted for revenue in this way. 6pm represented a significant expansion into one of the most important and largest public services – healthcare. idox has an exceptionally strong market position in the public sector, a sound balance sheet, and multiple opportunities for growth. “the best thing about idox is that we have a network of specialists who all bring different skills, personalities and experiences to projects. non-financial indicators idox group practises an integrated management system centred around gaining and retaining iso accreditations. this will be completed during h1 2018 and implemented by the end of 2018. it is expected to have an initially negative impact on revenues as a result of increased saas pricing although this is expected to have a medium-term benefit. the total number of customer solutions has now exceeded over 100. building on this, consultation has begun on the next generation of web based solutions for local government which is scheduled for delivery in incremental stages starting in 2019 through to 2020. overall, we have continued to see further market share gains with 108 new local authority customers, 7 new system sales and 11 managed service customers. they represent our long-term investment in smart city solutions, which we believe represents an attractive opportunity for the group. digital the digital business had an unexciting year in revenue terms but was very proud to have completed and delivered new designs and approaches for a diverse customer base including the church of england, as well as several well- known premier league football clubs. content has continued to take market share with strong sales for our research connect platform. the investment strategy will result in an increased focus on our web cloud and smart city solutions. the new technology needed to facilitate improved citizen engagement and drive efficiencies by delivering a fully integrated, end-to-end service. case study: craven

adjusted profit before tax and adjusted earnings per share are alternative performance measures, considered by the board to be a better reflection of true business performance than looking at the group’s results on a statutory basis only. another factor which increased etr was the non-recognition of losses incurred in malta, owing to uncertainty over their future utilisation. these losses will be recognised where their likelihood of utilisation increases, with any future recognition resulting in a decrease to etr. deferred income, representing invoiced maintenance and saas contracts yet to be recognised in revenue stood at £19.8m (2016: £15.9m). risk management processes and internal control procedures are established within business practices across all levels of the organisation. a diversified geographical footprint and sector focus reduces the risk of exposure due to adverse country or sector-specific conditions. idox has budgeted for foreign exchange fluctuations; however, this may not mitigate the risk entirely. for more complex acquisitions, the team work in conjunction with external advisors to reduce exposure. to successfully manage this risk, idox has developed effective business continuity and incident management plans. regular business continuity plans are updated and delivered to the board on at least an annual basis. the group has increased diversification of its customer base through acquisitions to mitigate against political risks. the group is also affected by economic environments in other territories, which include currency volatility, inflation and recession. signed on behalf of the board by: richard kellett-clarke chief executive officer 28 february 2018 21 company information financial statements governance strategic

group uses various financial instruments which include cash, equity investments, bank loans and items such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations. the group has minimal exposure to foreign exchange risk as a result of natural hedges arising between sales and cost transactions. significant variances from budget or strategy are discussed at board meetings and actions set in place to address them. additionally, under the group’s articles of association, at least one third of the directors who are subject to retirement by rotation are required to retire and may be proposed for re-election at each annual general meeting. two directors will retire from office at the group’s forthcoming annual general meeting and stand for re-appointment. the group supports an internal audit function that performs annual audits on its management systems. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the group financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. the group’s accounting policy on revenue recognition is shown in note 1 and related disclosures are included in note 2. key observations we gained sufficient audit evidence to support the majority of revenue through our enhanced procedures. the group’s accounting policy on carrying value of goodwill is shown in note 1 and related disclosures are included in note 11. key observations our audit work indicates that the carrying value of goodwill is fairly stated. we are aware that external valuation specialists have been used to perform the valuations of each acquisition. there are specified criteria that must be met under ias 38 ‘intangible assets’ to record an asset. the group’s accounting policy on capitalised development expenditure is shown in note 1 and related disclosures are included in note 11. key observations we gained sufficient audit evidence relating to the valuation of capitalised development expenditure. the group’s accounting policy on trade receivables is shown in note 1 and related disclosures are included in note 15. key observations we gained sufficient audit evidence to conclude relating to the existence of trade receivables. we gained 100% full scope coverage over the carrying value of goodwill and business combinations - acquisitions key audit matters. management have estimated that a range of 1 to 5 years is more appropriate depending on the future revenue projected for each individual asset. this review has led to accelerated amortisation on a small number of assets during the year. all new capitalised development is reviewed on an individual project basis and management will select the most appropriate rate of amortisation for each asset. management may exercise judgements over various elements of a contract, for example: • whether there are ongoing obligations relating to software licences which would require the revenue to be recognised over time rather than at a point in time • whether performance obligations are separable or bundled • whether it is appropriate to recognise revenue on certain contracts such as service agreements, prior to an invoice being raised, where work has been completed and there is a high degree of certainty of the contract being completed and the invoice raised and cash received. other intangible assets intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortised to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight- line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are reviewed on an annual basis. development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed in profit or loss as incurred. with the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. no adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options that have vested are not exercised. • “treasury reserve” represents shares repurchased by the company to be held for redistribution as share options. deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. exchange adjustments arising are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve and reported in other comprehensive income. such instruments are subsequently carried at their amortised cost and finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption, are recognised in profit or loss over the term of the instrument using an effective rate of interest. bond bonds in issue are recorded initially at fair value, net of direct transaction costs. as at 31 october 2017, the group is therefore organised into five operating segments, which are detailed below. 6 finance income and costs 2017 £000 2016 £000 interest receivable 6 4 insurance

(2016: 0.650p). significant tax repayments were processed in 2017, not previously provided for, in respect of historic r&d claims covering the reading room group and idox health ltd. these downward pressures on etr were mitigated by impairment, acquisition costs and the non-recognition of overseas losses. these losses will be recognised where their likelihood of utilisation increases, with any future recognition resulting in a decrease to etr. the decision was made to derecognise these assets until there is more certainty over their future utilisation. 63 company information financial
