market market overview no signs of slowing the global games market is constantly growing and developing with consumers spending more time than ever on games, as regular updates to consoles smooth and lengthen their cycles, whilst a trend towards the portability of consoles helps extend “screen time”. the millennial generation in particular are perpetuating this trend as games now cater to a much wider variety of interests. data suggests this won’t be stopping any time soon, with revenues set to reach almost $130 billion by 2020 representing a compound annual growth rate (“cagr”) of around 6%. games companies are no longer simply producing games and increasingly are turning game ip into entertainment franchises which has forced them to rethink their position in the broader entertainment industry, which in turn increases demand to engage outsourced service providers such as keywords. according to goldman sachs, an m&a cycle should benefit the scale players such as keywords. • our newer art creation, customer support services and engineering service lines accounted for a total 25% of group revenues. • new engineering service line created through the acquisitions of gamesim, d3t, and sperasoft which also brought a strength in co-development. acquisition track record we have a strong track record in identifying acquisitions with a strong fit with keywords in terms of culture as well as expertise or geography and integrating them effectively to support their growth. keywords’ presence in each stage of the games development cycle creates multiple opportunities for
