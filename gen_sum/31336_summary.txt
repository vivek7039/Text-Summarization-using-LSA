Investment Summary Access to high growth market Keywords operates in an exciting high growth market, without the risk of direct exposure to the successes or failures of individual game titles and our focus on content means that we are platform agnostic. We are a trusted partner to leading companies around the world, with a strong market position, providing services to 23 of the top 25 most prominent games companies, including: 05 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Opportunity to grow further Having made strong progress in extending the Group’s client base, market penetration, geographic footprint and service lines, we now see significant potential for increased cross-pollination of our service lines and geographic locations, including taking advantage of our dual shore capabilities, as we increasingly become strategic partners to our clients. A strong business model Keywords’ flexible resourcing and charging model, with charges levied for time or output rather than a fixed price, combined with relatively low working capital and capital expenditure requirements support its ability to grow the business whilst also achieving strong cash conversion. We made eleven acquisitions during the year, including two of our largest to date, VMC and Sperasoft. That this has been accomplished across all of our service lines, now embracing over 40 studios in 20 countries, during 2017 is a notable achievement. People and Board The Group’s progress is a great credit to every single Keywords person who has helped make it happen.

The millennial generation in particular are perpetuating this trend as games now cater to a much wider variety of interests. Data suggests this won’t be stopping any time soon, with revenues set to reach almost $130 billion by 2020 representing a Compound Annual Growth Rate (“CAGR”) of around 6%. Games companies are no longer simply producing games and increasingly are turning game IP into entertainment franchises which has forced them to rethink their position in the broader entertainment industry, which in turn increases demand to engage outsourced service providers such as Keywords. According to Goldman Sachs, an M&A cycle should benefit the scale players such as Keywords. • Our newer Art Creation, Customer Support services and Engineering service lines accounted for a total 25% of Group revenues. • New Engineering service line created through the acquisitions of Gamesim, d3t, and Sperasoft which also brought a strength in co-development. Keywords’ presence in each stage of the games development cycle creates multiple opportunities for cross selling and revenue growth: Our Business Model #1 #2 #3 #4 #5 #6 Pre-production Early stage game development Later stage game development Launch Ongoing live operations support New content for games • Concept art • Level design • Co-development • Programming • Art production • Cinematics/visual effects • Audio production • Original language voice production • Engineering • Development quality assurance • Story writing • Motion capture • Game demo trailers • Music scoring • Sound design • Functional testing • Text localisation • Audio localisation • Localisation testing • Player research • Game porting • Certification testing • Official game trailers • Marketing and PR services • Customer support • Community management • Data analytics • Payments processing • Promotions management • Game extensions • Level expansions • Art • Audio • Testing • Localisation • Issue patches • Marketing Services offered by Keywords Services not currently offered by Keywords 13 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Creating value for our stakeholders Investors Consistent track record of delivering earnings and dividend growth. Our customers can access a world class talent base without incurring any of the usual variable costs. Audio had a particularly tough comparator with Synthesis having produced an exceptional performance in 2016 while all other service lines posted strong like-for-like growth. Through Liquid Development and Volta we manage further pools of freelance artists numbering about 200 in total. Audio (14% of Group revenue for the year) Our Audio service line increased revenues by 20% to €20.7m (2016: €17.3m) including contributions from La Marque Rose, Around the Word, Dune Sound and asrec, all of which were acquired in August and LOLA which was acquired in December. Type two – Studios with strong overlap: This is used when a business is acquired near an existing Keywords hub, or where no new services are added: • We focus both on gross margins and on SG&A and operational expenditure costs, with immediate impacts; • For example, in the Montreal hub, Babel went from making losses to achieving 20%+ EBITDA in the second year. On a like-for-like basis, the business grew by 16% thanks to new client wins and successful cross selling efforts. 24 KEYWORDS STUDIOS PLC Strategic Report Chief Executive’s Review continued Augmented reality has received a lot of attention but, as with virtual reality in 2016, we feel this technology is still early stage and the mass adoption of both content formats is probably a few years off. The benefit of this option is that it allows clients to focus internal talent on core strengths. 28 KEYWORDS STUDIOS PLC Strategic Report Taxation The Group’s effective tax rate has decreased again in 2017. These are set in agreement with the Board and used to evaluate progress against our strategy.

Our financial assets are short-term in their nature, and no receivables have significant credit terms or interest charged accordingly. 2 Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Consolidation Where the Company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. For business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010, direct costs of acquisition are recognised immediately as an expense. Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The assets are amortised over their useful economic lives, which is deemed to be five years. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in profit or loss. This revenue recognition policy is unchanged at the full adoption of IFRS 15 from 1 January 2018, as the performance obligations on services provided are considered as performance obligations satisfied over time, in accordance with S 35 of IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. MMTC Grants The multimedia tax credits received in Montreal on testing services are a credit against staff costs. Property, plant and equipment acquired through business combinations are valued at fair value on the date of acquisition. They include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments. There is no allocation of operating expenses, profit measures, assets and liabilities to individual product groupings. • The probabilities of employees leaving due to resignations and dismissals in accordance with Company management have been placed at 4.25% per annum. 2017 2016 Economic and financial assumptions Salary increase 2.76% 2.50% Inflation 1.70% 1.73% Discount rate 1.54% 1.29% Key statistics Staff number 98 97 Average age 39.28 38.2 Average service 4.50 3.6 Average defined benefit per staff 8,595 6,745 Average salary for defined benefit 34,438 31,723 72 KEYWORDS STUDIOS PLC Financial Statements Notes Forming Part of the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements continued 19 Employee Defined Benefit Plan continued 2017 €’000 2016 €’000 Actuarial losses Change due to experience 17 30 Change due to demographical assumption 30 5 Change due to financial assumption (22) 28 Actuarial losses 25 63 Interest rate sensitivities -0.50% 1,136 882 0.50% 983 776 Mortality rate sensitivities -0.025% 1,056 827 0.025% 1,055 782 Staff turn over rate sensitivities -0.50% 1,067 835 0.50% 1,045 818 Staff salary increases rate sensitivities -0.50% 1,029 808 0.50% 1,084 845 20 Loans and Borrowings Group 2017 €’000 2016 €’000 Expiry within one year 18,943 8,025 Expiry between one and two years 31 55 Expiry over two years 306 290 19,280 8,370 The Company entered into a loan agreement with Barclays Bank.
