Going forward, our focus on delivering a culture that has customers at its heart will continue to grow. Nick Jopling, Grainger’s Property Director, stepped down in September having been with the Company for seven years. Our GRIP REIT joint venture with APG was recognised as a Sector Leader by the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark. Last year, we completed a full strategic review of the business, covering every portfolio and its potential for growth. While political uncertainty and Brexit are having an impact on real estate generally, the UK PRS is proving resilient. Looking ahead Through implementation of Grainger’s strategy and a focus on creating great homes for rent, the business has been transformed. The work we have done to dramatically improve our cost base and invest in a pipeline of quality assets positions us for strong growth. Working from home is ideal – there’s limited noise here, as well as a great little ramen place down the road to enjoy lunch.” Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 17 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Strategy in action continued Strategy in action By restructuring our teams, we are spending more time out on the road, meeting our customers and ensuring they are happily enjoying their homes. Simplify and focus Proactively managing our portfolio Customer services Customers have a named, dedicated Grainger property manager on hand for all enquiries. Net rental income growth of 8% to £40.4m (FY16: £37 .4m) has been supported by acquisitions, active asset management and increased operational efficiencies. This performance has been driven by strategic land sales which account for one-third of the profit from development activity. We achieved these savings by restructuring our business, improving processes, creating a robust control environment and investing in technology. Next year will be an active period for investment and construction as our secured PRS assets are developed. A new Sustainability and CSR Committee, chaired by an Executive Director, has senior representation from each aspect of the business, with explicit divisional ownership within operational teams. Environment • A growing focus on setting science-based carbon reduction targets backed by investment in renewable energy following the Paris climate change agreement. We have also strengthened our complaints process so customers know their concerns will be dealt with fairly and promptly. We consider a range of risk categories, including strategic, market, financial, legal or regulatory, operational, IT, project and people. The structure also complements our further evolution to a ‘three lines of defence’ model, with clear divisions between each line. We also have an externally supported whistleblowing hotline that staff can use anonymously if other methods are not suitable. • We have a high proportion of liquid and diverse assets to enable sales where necessary, as was shown clearly in the last economic downturn. • Our position as the UK’s leading PRS provider brings a cultural ethos of seeking to adopt best practice. However, we are of the view that Grainger’s exposure to this risk is no higher than similar UK- focused businesses. • We employ an experienced IT team with qualifications in cyber security matters and engaged external advisers to undertake a technology effectiveness review. An unprecedented and continued long-term lack of liquidity in UK residential property markets would cause a threat to the Group.

We then agreed to search for an additional independent Non-Executive Director with public company, financial and real estate experience. Being aware of the developing practice for assessing and reporting alternative performance measures, we plan to carry out a further review in 2018. We found this independent review constructive, and it will help in our annual evaluation of external auditor effectiveness.

Board changes It was announced on 30 August 2017 that Nick Jopling would be leaving Grainger by reason of redundancy. Incentives will be reduced, pro-rata, where his employment ceases part way through the relevant performance or vesting period as appropriate. 3 In light of Nick Jopling’s role being made redundant, the Remuneration Committee determined he would be a good leaver for incentive plan purposes. The targets were met in five out of seven segments including regulated sales, freehold, commercial, CHARM and strategic land.

The Group has operated within its covenants during 2017 and as at 30 September 2017 (see Note 1 ‘Accounting policies – Going concern’). Investment and development opportunities are evaluated using a risk adjusted WACC in order to ensure long-term shareholder value is created. There are no current or past service costs as the scheme is closed to new members and future accrual. Awards not subject to a market-based performance condition are valued at fair value using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Leases relating to office space used by the Group have initial terms of varying lengths, between one and ten years.
