has been in high demand, with initial lettings exceeding expectations, and positive customer feedback. our grip reit joint venture with apg was recognised as a sector leader by the global real estate sustainability benchmark. last year, we completed a full strategic review of the business, covering every portfolio and its potential for growth. while political uncertainty and brexit are having an impact on real estate generally, the uk prs is proving resilient. looking ahead through implementation of grainger’s strategy and a focus on creating great homes for rent, the business has been transformed. the work we have done to dramatically improve our cost base and invest in a pipeline of quality assets positions us for strong growth. this performance has been driven by strategic land sales which account for one-third of the profit from development activity. 1m, down from £25.6m for 2016. we achieved these savings by restructuring our business, improving processes, creating a robust control environment and investing in technology. a new sustainability and csr committee, chaired by an executive director, has senior representation from each aspect of the business, with explicit divisional ownership within operational teams. environment • a growing focus on setting science-based carbon reduction targets backed by investment in renewable energy following the paris climate change agreement. we have also strengthened our complaints process so customers know their concerns will be dealt with fairly and promptly. we consider a range of risk categories, including strategic, market, financial, legal or regulatory, operational, it, project and people. the structure also complements our further evolution to a ‘three lines of defence’ model, with clear divisions between each line. we also have an externally supported whistleblowing hotline that staff can use anonymously if other methods are not suitable. • we have a high proportion of liquid and diverse assets to enable sales where necessary, as was shown clearly in the last economic downturn. • our position as the uk’s leading prs provider brings a cultural ethos of seeking to adopt best practice. however, we are of the view that grainger’s exposure to this risk is no higher than similar uk- focused businesses. • we employ an experienced it team with qualifications in cyber security matters and engaged external advisers to undertake a technology effectiveness review. an unprecedented and continued long-term lack of liquidity in uk residential property markets would cause a threat to the
