this has been further enhanced by the reductions we have made to our overheads and finance costs. net rental income growth of 8% to £40.4m (fy16: £37 .4m) has been supported by acquisitions, active asset management and increased operational efficiencies. we view this as a sustainable level for the future and our medium-term target is 25–26%. our residential sales performance continues to be resilient, with regulated tenancies providing regular cash flows on vacancy. this performance has been driven by strategic land sales which account for one-third of the profit from development activity. 1m, down from £25.6m for 2016. we achieved these savings by restructuring our business, improving processes, creating a robust control environment and investing in technology. we generated £228m of cash from sales, gross rental income and management fees in the year. our income returns will continue to be enhanced by the low cost of debt we can source. around 66% relates to our regulated tenancy portfolio, which will crystallise over time as we dispose of assets. next year will be an active period for investment and construction as our secured prs assets are developed. we anticipate robust sales to continue from natural vacancies associated with our regulated tenancy portfolio. a new sustainability and csr committee, chaired by an executive director, has senior

subsequent investment constraints on further investment into the prs; covenant compliance risk; less attractive business to investors. • we are actively transitioning the business to reduce reliance on trading income and house price inflation. • we have a high proportion of liquid and diverse assets to enable sales where necessary, as was shown clearly in the last economic downturn. • we have strict asset management controls and compliance processes which can also adapt to change. • our position as the uk’s leading prs provider brings a cultural ethos of seeking to adopt best practice. however, we are of the view that grainger’s exposure to this risk is no higher than similar uk- focused businesses. • our business is based on taking considered risks for appropriate returns in
