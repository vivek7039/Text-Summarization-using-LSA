** Adjusted EBITDA is a non-statutory measure that represents earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation adjusted for pre-opening costs related to the development of hotels, organisational restructuring costs, share based payments and other non-recurring items. • On 17 October 2016, easyHotel completed the placing of 38,000,000 new ordinary shares to raise £38.0m (before expenses).

In addition, a number of initiatives have been progressed during the year to optimise the value of existing assets including investments to improve our revenue management systems and processes and our customers’ online booking experience. Further refinements to our hotel development processes and design standards will deliver a lower risk, higher performing model for new projects. This significant increase in our owned estate, together with new franchised hotels opened in Brussels, Amsterdam Arena and Amsterdam Zaandam (and with others on the way), is providing an ever more solid foundation for our strengthening brand. A programme to refresh two of three legacy owned assets (Croydon and Glasgow) will be completed within the coming months and we expect to see a similar positive impact on the revenues of those hotels. In particular, the Company has benefited from continuity within our skilled executive team. Outlook Whilst the wider macroeconomic uncertainty continues to impact consumer confidence, we believe easyHotel is well positioned. Jonathan Lane OBE Non-Executive Chairman 5 December 2017 Summary • Trading slightly ahead of Board expectations and particularly strong across newly opened hotels • Growth strategy underpinned by high quality pipeline and strong asset-backed balance sheet • Disciplined and well-financed approach taken to deployment of capital with strict investment criteria 3 easyHotel plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Chairman’s statement Continued focus Summary • Strong trading across existing hotels • Continued outperformance against our competitive set • Excellent progress achieved across all areas of the business • Five new hotels opened and trading strongly • Positive customer reaction to stylish new easyHotel format • Significantly accelerated pipeline in place to deliver long-term shareholder value Strategy I am delighted to be leading this ambitious business at such an exciting time in its history. 2016/17 was a significant year for easyHotel with excellent progress achieved across all areas of the business. With the experienced team we now have in place, continued high levels of staff engagement and improving customer satisfaction, we are in an excellent position to expand the easyHotel brand and deliver improving returns for our shareholders. The new booking engine and revenue management system rollout, together with selling an allocation of rooms via selected online travel agencies (OTAs), resulted in our owned hotels significantly outperforming their competitive set (as measured by STR) throughout the year. We have started a £1.5m refurbishment of our other two legacy owned assets in Croydon and Glasgow, to improve the quality of the hotels and to bring them into line with our new brand look. We expect their refurbishment to be revenue enhancing during the current financial year. 4 easyHotel plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Transforming our business Strategic report Chief Executive Officer’s review Together with leased hotel projects, considered on a limited and specific basis where the acquisition of a suitable freehold site is not currently available or does not meet our investment return targets, and our new franchised hotels, which are delivering more fees than initially anticipated, we expect to deliver a 15% unlevered blended ROCE at Group level. Consequently, the Board is considering its financing options, which may include new equity and debt, to fund these opportunities. Having appointed a new senior team last year, to ensure that we have the right breadth of talent in place to deliver our growth plans going forward, our focus this year has been on ensuring that all our team members feel valued and recognised and have the opportunity and support to reach their full potential. With such an exciting future, it is perhaps not surprising that our staff engagement score was 82% during the year. I’m confident that, together, we can continue to deliver on our strategic objectives in the months and years ahead. • Customer needs are relatively simple: a great bed, well-trained, friendly staff and well-designed rooms. A weak Pound would be expected to increase staycations and inbound tourism, benefiting our predominantly UK based business. Disaster incidents that could seriously impact the business such as fire, flood or terrorist attack A comprehensive disaster recovery plan with back-up processes and facilities to ensure the business can continue to operate with minimal disruption is in place. No change in risk Improved disaster recovery measures implemented and terrorist insurance cover reviewed. Staff training, data back-up, penetration testing and other security measures are also in place. Marc joined the Company following 16 years at Accor SA, where he worked until 2013, with his most recent role being Executive Vice President of Asset Management. Marc has previously served as a Non-Executive Director of the French shopping centre real estate owner Immochan SA. He went on to spend ten years in senior financial and change management roles with Diageo plc. Since then, Scott has held a number of roles in private equity-backed technology and healthcare businesses. As the business continues to develop, those practices will evolve and, for this reason, governance arrangements are kept under review. Committees The Board has established an Audit Committee comprising the Company’s two Non-Executive Directors, which is chaired by Chartered Accountant Scott Christie, who has recent and relevant financial experience, both as a result of his formal qualifications and his roles elsewhere. The Audit Committee, supported by the Company Secretary, plans appropriately on an annual basis in order to enable it to discharge its duties as set out in its terms of reference. A more detailed report from the Audit Committee can be found on page 16. This Committee also comprises the Company’s two Non-Executive Directors and is chaired by Scott Christie.

Post-year-end developments easyHotel Liverpool opened in November 201 7 adding a further 78 rooms to the network. These risks included revenue recognition, management override and capitalisation of hotel development costs. However, the Board is committed to transparency of its remuneration arrangements and, accordingly, an expanded disclosure has been provided on a voluntary basis in order to provide shareholders with an overview of our remuneration practices. The Remuneration Committee has worked to establish performance related incentives that support the delivery of easyHotel’s strategic goals, ensuring that individual rewards are linked to clear and stretching corporate and individual targets. For on-target performance, Executive Directors will be rewarded with a cash bonus equivalent to 50% of base salary, with a 100% bonus being the maximum payable in the event that stretch targets are achieved.

The Group has not classified any of its financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. The Group’s accounting policy for other financial liabilities is as follows: Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. All standards listed have to be applied, at the latest, from financial years starting on or after 2 October 2015 unless otherwise stated. As a result, the Group recognises tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on its assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with minimum rating “A” are accepted. The Company has no fair value and cash flow interest rate risk to disclose. 5 Operating profit and adjusted EBITDA 2017 2016 £ £ The following have been included in arriving at operating profit before tax: Auditors’ remuneration includes: Company audit fees (15,000) (15,000) Subsidiary audit fees (34,500) (29,500) Fees for audit related assurance services (20,000) (20,000) Total auditors’ remuneration (69,500) (64,500) 2017 2016 £ £ Non-recurring items from reportable segments include: Net accelerated initial fee release — 29,630 Other non-recurring items include: Net franchise termination proceeds 133,060 — Recruitment fees (51,000) — Legal and other costs (167,414) (44,041) Abortive fees (63,627) (6,109) Systems restructuring (9,868) (75,050) (Loss)/profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment* (239,615) 282,675 (398,464) 157,475 Total non-recurring (costs)/income (398,464) 187,105 * (Loss)/profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment relates to the part-closure of operations at the Old Street hotel following an adverse planning result (2016: sale of the ground floor unit in the Liverpool property). 2017 2016 £ £ Aggregate emoluments 950,145 770,830 In addition there were total employer’s National Insurance expenses of £126,957 (2016: £71,290). 41 easyHotel plc Annual report and accounts 2017 7 Segment information continued Owned properties Franchising Total £ £ £ At 30 September 2017 Revenue Total revenue from external customers 6,604,098 1,812,159 8,416,257 Adjusted EBITDA 3,239,960 1,042,417 4,282,377 Profit before taxation excluding pre-opening costs 2,632,860 1,042,417 3,675,277 Segment assets 85,213,653 2,608,410 87,822,063 Segment liabilities (15,048,156) (2,335,555) (17,383,711) Other Additions to non-current assets 22,582,910 — 22,582,910 Disposals of non-current assets (239,615) — (239,615) Finance income 206,999 — 206,999 Finance cost (91,193) — (91,193) Depreciation and amortisation (831,414) — (831,414) At 30 September 2016 Revenue Total revenue from external customers 4,728,151 1,296,104 6,024,255 Adjusted EBITDA 2,570,677 636,385 3,207,062 Profit before taxation 2,014,925 666,015 2,680,940 Segment assets 43,013,707 2,174,506 45,188,213 Segment liabilities (9,303,902) (2,174,506) (11,478,408) Other Additions to non-current assets 10,237,533 — 10,237,533 Disposals of non-current assets (307,334) — (307,334) Finance income 59,341 — 59,341 Finance cost (200,078) — (200,078) Depreciation and amortisation (415,015) — (415,015) 42 easyHotel plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Financial statements Notes forming part of the financial statements continued for the year ended 30 September 2017 7 Segment information continued Reconciliation of reportable adjusted EBITDA, profit or loss, assets and liabilities to the Group’s corresponding amounts is shown below: 2017 2016 £ £ Adjusted EBITDA of reportable segments 4,282,377 3,207,062 Adjusted EBITDA of corporate office (1,982,094) (1,655,970) Total adjusted EBITDA 2,300,283 1,551,092 Profit before income tax Total profit of reportable segments 3,675,277 2,680,940 Corporate office expenses and net interest (2,026,609) (1,497,880) Other non-recurring net costs (see note 5) (158,849) (125,200) Hotel pre-opening and development costs (217,934) (89,157) Share based payments (171,951) (161,177) Disposals of non-current assets (239,615) 282,675 Profit before tax per statement of comprehensive income 860,319 1,090,201 Assets Total assets for reportable segments 87,822,063 45,188,213 Cash in Employee Benefit Trust 1,643 1,693 Corporate office assets 948,047 324,862 Total assets per statement of financial position 88,771,753 45,514,768 Liabilities Total liabilities for reportable segments (17,383,711) (11,478,408) Corporation tax (31,003) (119,314) Corporate office liabilities (824,113) (513,486) Deferred tax liabilities (351,488) (193,792) Total liabilities per statement of financial position (18,590,315) (12,305,000) Geographical information 2017 2016 £ £ Revenue by location United Kingdom 7,209,316 5,144,034 Europe 1,073,830 774,413 Rest of the world 133,111 105,808 8,416,257 6,024,255 Total non-current assets by location United Kingdom 44,828,465 29,112,878 Spain 7,964,214 1,499,629 52,792,679 30,612,507 43 easyHotel plc Annual report and accounts 2017 8 Finance income 2017 2016 £ £ Finance income Interest income on financial assets measured at amortised cost 206,999 59,341 Foreign exchange gain 63,993 189,593 Total finance income recognised in profit or loss 270,992 248,934 9 Finance expense 2017 2016 £ £ Finance expense Interest expense on financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 356,165 200,078 Amount capitalised* (264,972) — Total finance expense recognised in profit or loss 91,193 200,078 * Interest expense attributable to construction works has been capitalised to property, plant and equipment.
