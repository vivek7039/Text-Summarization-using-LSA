in short, it has been a good year for dixons carphone and it gives me great pleasure once again to thank my 43,000 colleagues for the work that they have done to deliver so well and so energetically for our customers.” sebastian james group chief executive 27 june 2017 cautionary statement certain statements made in this annual report and accounts are forward looking. results for 2015/16 have been restated as set out in note 32 to the group financial statements. • id mobile is one of the uk’s fastest growing mvnos offering innovative and flexible propositions. • cws organises its services into two product towers: — value chain services — honeybee platform connectedworldservices.com honeybeesolutions.com 4 dixons carphone plc annual report and accounts 2016/17 chairman’s statement strategic report i am delighted to be reporting to you as the newly appointed chairman of dixons carphone plc. we also have become an important centre to help customers choose the best providers of other services. the hard work of all our people and the management team led by seb – and a huge thank you to all of them - have helped deliver a 10% growth in headline profit before tax on 9% higher revenue with total profit before tax increasing £123 million. i am also pleased to welcome fiona mcbain to the board; fiona’s business leadership, in particular in the financial services sector, will be a great asset as we evolve our consumer services propositions. lord livingston of parkhead chairman 27 june 2017 6 dixons carphone plc annual report and accounts 2016/17 group chief executive’s statement strategic report i am very pleased to be reporting another set of strong numbers for the group. in addition we have launched a new carphone warehouse web platform which is trading well. these propositions are proving to be very successful and i am very pleased that the active customer base is now more than 600,000, making id one of the fastest growing postpay mvnos (mobile virtual network operator) in uk mobile history. both our dixons travel business and harrods technology have had a very strong year, benefiting from an influx of visitors post the eu referendum. our nordics business, against, again, a relatively tough market backdrop, had a very respectable year with like- for-like revenues up 1% over the year and 2% in the fourth quarter, and headline ebit increased 13% to £89 million. our southern european business had a very good year in the face of ongoing political and economic turbulence and i am pleased it has reported group leading 6% rise in like- for-like revenues over the year with headline ebit growing from £17 million to £22 million. the market can also be broken down into two distinct distribution channels: ‘assisted’ and ‘unassisted’. the market is served by a relatively small number of global manufacturers supplying goods to local, regional, national and international electrical retailers. these shifts have helped us to gain market share and it underpins our view that a strong service-led multi-channel operation satisfies both customer and supplier needs while delivering a sustainable business as customer shopping habits continue to evolve. similarly, our pay&collect service, where customers can access a wider range of products than is typically available in their local store for either home delivery or later collection from the store, is also increasingly popular. the rapid innovation cycle may lead to price deflation, but also drives volumes as products become more affordable and replacement cycles accelerate. in addition, innovation drives new service requirements, including tv installation, data backup, computer set up and instructional showhow teach-ins. we have europe’s largest tech and white goods repair facility in newark with more technical support agents than any other business providing a nationwide solution. once fully executed we expect our services business to provide long-term sustainable revenues in attractive, growing markets. it is a unique omni-channel, multi-industry software that simplifies the delivery and management of complex digital customer journeys. during the year our uk & ireland and nordics businesses continued to sustain high levels of customer satisfaction. our objective is to provide our customers with a seamless and personalised experience where convenience, ease of navigation and simplicity are key in attracting customers to shop with us whether it is online, in store or a combination of both. these journeys are supported by product specialists providing expert advice on the products’ features and benefits. the jönköping site is also expanding to incorporate an up- to-date automated ‘small box’ operation. the group also has a significant services infrastructure focused on maintenance, support, repairs, delivery and installation. looking at each of these in turn: 1. continue to enhance and drive successful and sustainable retail business models in a multi-channel world our customers tell us that when buying consumer electricals they want advice to ensure they are making the right choices, particularly as these are often major purchases that customers will own for several years. as a result we are able to offer customers very competitive prices against our competitor set and still be more profitable. there are four distinct activities that we believe are the key strengths of our multi-channel, service-based model and which will support our competitive advantage going forward: 1. work closely with suppliers to harness benefits available to our business model: suppliers want to ensure that 14 dixons carphone plc annual report and accounts 2016/17 business model and strategy strategic report customers not only choose their brands, but also experience the benefits of the latest products. today all our stores are equipped with beacon devices and we are increasingly able to gain a better understanding of consumer activity to improve their shopping experience as well as tailoring more focused customer orientated marketing activity. behind our end-to-end service operation we have a comprehensive infrastructure, including technical phone support, delivery, installation, repair and recycling. 3. develop the connected world services division building on the success of pinpoint, which has been transformational in our carphone warehouse stores, we are now seeking to expand our honeybee platform into new categories and across all brands. 16 dixons carphone plc annual report and accounts 2016/17 principal risks to achieving the group’s objectives strategic report the group recognises that taking risks is an inherent part of doing business and that competitive advantage can be gained through effectively managing risk. uk & ireland revenue in the uk & ireland increased by 2% to £6,550 million (2015/16: £6,402 million) , with like-for-like revenue for the year up 4%, benefiting by approximately 3% as a net result of sales transferred from closed stores and sales disruption. the electricals business delivered a solid result with market share gains across consumer electronics, white goods, computing and multiplay. changes in contractual terms for the sale of third party insurance contracts have benefited headline ebit by £22 million (c) . based on the current share performance it is considered probable that this liability will crystallise and therefore a provision of £11 million has been made during 2016/17. humphrey singer group finance director 27 june 2017 28 dixons carphone plc annual report and accounts 2016/17 corporate responsibility strategic report dixons carphone is committed to the highest standards of corporate and social responsibility (csr) across the group. in 2016 we

accounting policies a) basis of preparation the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with ifrs as adopted by the eu, ifrs issued by the international accounting standards board, those parts of the companies act 2006 applicable to those companies reporting under ifrs and article 4 of the ias regulation. a reconciliation of headline profit and losses to total profits and losses is shown in note 2. items excluded from headline results can evolve from one financial year to the next depending on the nature of exceptional items or one-off type activities described above. sales commission received from third parties is recognised when the insurance policies to which it relates are sold, to the extent that it can be reliably measured and there are no ongoing service obligations. supplier funding amounts that have been recognised and not invoiced are shown within accrued income on the balance sheet. commission revenue is only recognised to the extent it can be reliably measured for each cohort of consumers. further details of estimates used to initially value revenue recognised and subsequently value commission receivable at the balance sheet date, effects on the current year income statement of changes in estimates and sensitivity analysis of the carrying value can be found in note 26. in addition to remeasurement due to changes in consumer behaviour, changes to revenue may also be made, where for example, more recent information becomes available enabling the recognition of previously unrecognised commission. once classified as held for sale, intangible assets and property, plant & equipment are no longer amortised or depreciated. where share-based payments have external performance criteria (such as tsr targets) a monte carlo model is used to measure fair value. no provision is made for tax which would have been payable on the distribution of retained profits of overseas subsidiaries or associated undertakings where it has been determined that these profits will not be distributed in the foreseeable future. these intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and, where appropriate, provision for impairment in value or estimated loss on disposal. amortisation is provided to write off the cost of assets on a straight-line basis on the following bases: brands 7% – 20% per annum customer relationships 13% – 50% per annum this amortisation is recognised in non-headline administrative expenses. internally generated software is recognised as an intangible asset only if it can be separately identified, it is probable that the asset will generate future economic benefits which exceed one year, and the development cost can be measured reliably. software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and, where appropriate, provision for impairment in value or estimated loss on disposal. rates applied to different classes of property, plant & equipment are as follows: land and buildings 1 2 ⁄3% – 4% per annum fixtures, fittings and equipment 10% – 33 1 ⁄3% per annum assets capitalised as finance leases are depreciated over the term of the lease. available-for-sale investments the group has investments in unlisted shares that are not traded in an active market but are classified as available- for-sale financial assets and stated at fair value (because the directors consider that their fair value can be reliably measured) . financial liabilities comprise all items shown in notes 16 to 19 with the exception of deferred income. 2. derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting: these are classified at fair value through profit or loss. the future costs assumed are inevitably only estimates, which may differ from those ultimately incurred. we will initiate a detailed project during 2017/18 in order to confirm any potential impact on reported revenue. there are no changes to cash flows or commercial impact from the change in standard. this information is predominantly based on geographical areas which are either managed separately or have similar trading characteristics such that they can be aggregated together into one segment. 4 non-headline items note year ended 29 april 2017 £million year ended 30 april 2016 (restated) * £million included in revenue businesses to be exited (i) 5 2 5 2

the criteria under ifrs 5 for separate disclosure as discontinued operations. based on the current share performance it is considered probable that this liability will crystallise, and therefore provision of £11 million has been made during 2016/17. financial statements notes to the group financial statements 114 dixons carphone plc annual report and accounts 2016/17 5 employee costs and share-based payments continued a) employee costs continued compensation earned by key management, comprising the board of directors and senior executives, is as follows: year ended 29 april 2017

members of key management in relation to the share plan. in forming the five-year projections, management draws on past experience as a measure to forecast future performance. within cash and cash equivalents, £62 million (2016: £67 million) is restricted and predominantly comprises funds held under trust to fund potential customer support agreement liabilities as well as by the group’s insurance businesses to cover regulatory reserve requirements. all leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments. in the nordics division, the group operates small funded secured defined benefit pension schemes, which are also closed to new entrants, with assets held by a life insurance company as well as an unsecured pension arrangement. the next triennial valuation will be as at 31 march 2019. the principal actuarial assumptions as at 31 march 2016 were: rate per annum discount rate for accrued benefits † – growth portfolio 4.6% – matching portfolio 2.2% rate of increase to pensions 0% – 3.6% inflation 3.0% † the discount rate is based on a linear de-risking methodology which assumes the scheme’s investment strategy switches investments from growth assets (such as equities) to matching assets (such as bonds) and multi-asset credit over a period of 10 years from 2026 to 2036 so that in 20 years’ time the asset portfolio is projected to be 90% invested in matching assets and multi-asset credit. financial statements 131 dixons carphone plc annual report and accounts 2016/17 21 retirement and other

operating activities (1) 2 investing activities 22 30 21 32 26 financial risk management and derivative financial instruments financial instruments that are measured at fair value in the financial statements require disclosure of fair value measurements by level based on the following fair value measurement hierarchy: • level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; • level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) ; and • level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) . fair values have been arrived at by discounting future cash flows (where the impact of discounting is material) , assuming no early redemption, or by revaluing forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to period end market rates as appropriate to the instrument. throughout the period under review, in accordance with group policy, no speculative use of derivatives, foreign exchange or other instruments was permitted. these exposures primarily arise from inventory purchases, with most of the group’s exposure being to euro, norwegian krone and us dollar fluctuations. future cash flows arising from these financial instruments depend on interest rates and periods agreed at the time of rollover. within one year £million in more than one year but not more than five years £million in more than five years £million total £million 29 april

the risk of financial loss to the group if a counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the group’s receivables from consumers. reliance on historical data assumes that current and future experience will follow past trends, there is therefore a risk that changes in consumer behaviour reduce or increase the total cash flows ultimately realised over the forecast period. cash flows in association with the network receivable are received over a period of 1–5 years. the impact of the restatement has been set out below: headline results non-headline

measures (‘apms’) in the reporting of financial information, the group uses certain measures that are not required under ifrs. capital employed is based on net assets including capitalised leases, but excluding goodwill, cash, tax and the defined benefit pension obligations. where businesses have grown organically rather than through acquisition, there is no amortisation of acquired intangibles and therefore the non-cash amortisation charge is removed from our headline earnings measures in order to increase comparability between segments. it is a unique omni-channel, multi-industry software that simplifies the delivery and management of complex digital customer journeys. in short, it has been a good year for dixons carphone and it gives me great pleasure once again to thank my 43,000 colleagues for the work that they have done to deliver so well and so energetically for our customers.” sebastian james group chief executive 27 june 2017 cautionary statement certain statements made
