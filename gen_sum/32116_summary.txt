The hard work of all our people and the management team led by Seb – and a huge thank you to all of them - have helped deliver a 10% growth in headline profit before tax on 9% higher revenue with total profit before tax increasing £123 million. Both our Dixons Travel business and Harrods Technology have had a very strong year, benefiting from an influx of visitors post the EU referendum. The market is served by a relatively small number of global manufacturers supplying goods to local, regional, national and international electrical retailers. The rapid innovation cycle may lead to price deflation, but also drives volumes as products become more affordable and replacement cycles accelerate. In addition, innovation drives new service requirements, including TV installation, data backup, computer set up and instructional Showhow teach-ins. We have Europe’s largest tech and white goods repair facility in Newark with more technical support agents than any other business providing a nationwide solution. Continue to enhance and drive successful and sustainable retail business models in a multi-channel world Our customers tell us that when buying consumer electricals they want advice to ensure they are making the right choices, particularly as these are often major purchases that customers will own for several years. As a result we are able to offer customers very competitive prices against our competitor set and still be more profitable. Behind our end-to-end service operation we have a comprehensive infrastructure, including technical phone support, delivery, installation, repair and recycling. The electricals business delivered a solid result with market share gains across consumer electronics, white goods, computing and multiplay. Changes in contractual terms for the sale of third party insurance contracts have benefited headline EBIT by £22 million (c) . Based on the current share performance it is considered probable that this liability will crystallise and therefore a provision of £11 million has been made during 2016/17. In 2016 we launched our Graduate Scheme which saw 15 university leavers given the opportunity to establish their careers with bespoke training, on-the-job experience and management coaching. An Employee Assistance Programme operates 24/7 offering support for a range of issues such as stress, smoking cessation and debt management. Our environmental policy, endorsed by the Board, covers material issues including energy consumption, carbon emissions, supply chain and operational waste. 940,000 kWh of electricity for our Newark National Distribution Centre, reducing the site’s CO2 emissions by over 500 tonnes per annum. This part of our operation is well established and has been actively engaging in ethical auditing / risk assessment for many years. We actively encourage our employees to recycle through communication campaigns and the provision of recycling facilities at all sites. Online customers buying white goods or a TV larger than 39” are prompted with the option to have an old appliance collected for recycling. We also work with 11 UK charities who select unwanted WEEE from our Customer Service Centres which they repair and reuse to sell. In total, over 14,000 tonnes of packaging recycled (3% less than 2015/16, driven by lighter and less packaging used around products) which is an estimated 16,000 tonnes of CO2 saved (figures from our waste management agency responsible for all cardboard, plastic, polystyrene and wood recycled across our estate). 35 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Strategic Report Re-use Innovation with HM Prisons A three-way partnership between Dixons Carphone, DHL EnviroSolutions and WasteCare in collaboration with National Offenders Management Service (‘NOMS’) sees unwanted large appliances repaired in a HM Prison within purpose-built rooms. Fiona brings a wealth of experience from her career in financial services and will undoubtedly be an asset to the Board. Fiona McBain participated in a tailored induction programme upon joining the Board, including meetings with key Company executives. As a newly appointed Non-Executive Director, Fiona McBain was given an individual induction programme tailored to her specific responsibilities and past experience. The controls by their nature are designed to manage rather than eliminate risk and can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. • Establishes a Group policy framework which contains the core compliance policies that all employees are required to observe.

The new Long Term Incentive Plan operates on a basis that is more closely aligned with market practice, by making an annual award of nil-priced options. We would like to thank Tim How for his service on the Committee and as a Non- Executive Director. A defined benefit pension plan continues in operation for Dixons’ longer-serving employees, which is now closed to new participants and future accrual. • Operation Bonus payments are determined after the year end and subject to a minimum profit threshold being achieved before payment is due. Currently share options are granted under the Dixons Carphone HMRC-approved SAYE scheme, subject to three- or five-year vesting periods. For material, unexpected increases in time commitments, the Board may pay extra fees on a pro-rated basis to reflect additional workload. For example, consultation took place with major shareholders last year in relation to the Committee’s proposed new Long Term Incentive Plan.
