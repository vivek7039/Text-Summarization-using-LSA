selected, value enhancing acquisitions, funded by the group’s free cash flow. after adjusting for the contribution from acquisitions completed both this year and last year, net of a small disposal and for these currency effects on translation, group revenues increased by 7% on an underlying basis. however, expenditure on acquisitions slowed this year to £20.1m (2016: £32.7m) as some vendors postponed their exit plans in the face of a more favourable macroeconomic environment. all of the group’s sectors contributed to this growth with a particularly strong performance from controls. the strategy consistently delivers a return in excess of 20% pre-tax on total capital invested and steadily increasing shareholder value. building larger , broader-based businesses the group’s strategy , consistently applied, delivers strong growth in earnings and shareholder value. the environmental businesses delivered steady growth in instrumentation sales and increasing service contract revenues. abacus adds critical mass to our existing healthcare businesses in the region and opens up new growth opportunities. these acquisitions form a critical part of our sector growth strategies and are designed to generate a pre-tax return on investment of at least 20% and hence support our group objectives for return on total investment. there are also best practices which can be shared within the clusters in areas such as it and digital capabilities. for more information see page 15 essential values we encourage an entrepreneurial culture across our businesses, through a decentralised

businesses, tpd focuses on specialised laboratory diagnostics and specialty medical device segments, again leveraging a number of common suppliers. market drivers the dhg businesses in canada supply into areas of healthcare which are predominantly public sector funded. the relative stability and consistency in funding by each of the provinces, guaranteed through the act, ensures that the market

148.2 145.1 canadian healthcare expenditure 1 (c$bn) % growth public private source: canadian institute for health information. over many years, healthcare expenditure has grown steadily with annual variations mostly dependent on the periodic additional tranches of funding provided by individual provinces. as with canada, australia has a large geography to be covered, low population density and purchasing processes that vary by state. in such periods, healthcare funding is tightly constrained through targeted controls imposed on the number of laboratory tests and operating procedures as well as more rigorous tendering and group procurement processes for expenditure on capital equipment. against this background, the bgs and ds businesses have increased revenues by 4% in local currency terms. however, revenues reduced in the water testing and interventional cardiology segments as certain suppliers moved from specialised distribution to a direct supply model. the businesses also supply products to end users operating process plants within the mining, oil & gas, pharmaceutical, chemical, food and energy sectors, where products are required to support maintenance, repair and overhaul (“mro”) operations. the weakened uk sterling is providing short term benefits to exporters, but this is offset by uncertainty over the terms of any future eu trade deal, which has led to investment decisions being postponed or deferred. revenues increased by 11% with growth particularly strong in sales to canadian customers, driven by recovery in the oil & gas sector, increased pipeline construction and strong sales of excavators ahead of new emissions regulations. all three businesses delivered double-digit revenue increases in the second half of the year with strong demand from key accounts across a range of specialised industrial applications in industries including water, medical, oil & gas, appliances and food equipment. the new erp system will be designed to increase operational efficiency, improve business intelligence and deliver broader marketing capabilities. edco is being managed as part of the m seals group with good opportunities for cross-selling and improved purchasing power. fluid controls the hawco group businesses supply a range of fluid control products used broadly in the food & beverage sectors, in applications including food retailing and transportation, catering equipment, vending machines, coffee brewing, pure water and water cooling systems. the civil aerospace market continues to grow steadily with growth in world passenger traffic averaging over 6% p.a. these trends are driving demand for smaller, more energy efficient components as supplied by hawco. on an underlying basis, after adjusting for these acquisitions and currency effects, revenues increased by 14%, with growth moderating in the second half (though still double-digit) against stronger prior year comparatives. 30 diploma plc annual report & accounts

continued for 2017, the board has recommended a final dividend of 16.0p per share (2016: 13.8p) making the proposed full year dividend 23.0p (2016: 20.0p). this compares with an aggregate of £32.7m invested last year in acquisitions, minority shareholdings and deferred consideration. at a group level, this is a pre-tax measure which is applied against the fixed and working capital of the group, together with all gross intangible assets and goodwill, including goodwill previously written off against retained earnings. during the year a formal triennial funding valuation of this scheme as at 30 september 2016 was completed. in switzerland, local law requires kubo to provide a contribution based pension for all employees, which are funded by employer and employee contributions. it has overall responsibility for the group’s system of risk management and internal control. these may be impacted by internal and external factors, some of which we cannot control. in addition, following the risk evaluation process carried out this year as described above, a new principal risk has been added that relates to ‘cybersecurity/information technology/business interruption.’ the risks are each classified as either strategic, operational, financial or accounting. these metrics are also subject to sensitivity analysis which includes flexing a number of the main assumptions, namely, future revenue growth, gross margins, operating costs and working capital management. the results of flexing these assumptions, both individually and in aggregate, are used to determine whether additional bank facilities will be required during this period. there is also the risk of a supplier taking away exclusivity and either setting up direct operations or appointing another distributor. the businesses also meet with key customers on a regular basis to gain insight into their product requirements and market developments. the group seeks to ensure continuous availability, security and operation of those information systems. unintended actions of employees caused by a cyber-attack may also lead to disruption, including fraud. during september 2017, hfpg successfully deployed their business continuity plans to mitigate the impact of hurricane irma. however, more successful initiatives focus on ensuring a challenging work environment with appropriate reward systems. • giving the freedom, encouragement, financial resources and strategic support for managers to pursue ambitious growth plans. technically qualified personnel and control systems are in place to ensure products meet quality requirements. where necessary, a provision is made to cover both excess inventory and potential obsolescence. this communication programme enables employees to gain a better understanding of the group’s business objectives and their roles in achieving them. health & safety the group is fully committed to ensuring clean, safe and healthy working conditions. the group requires that each operating business conducts health & safety reviews against its specific operational risk profile and local regulatory requirements. the group is committed to identifying and assessing environmental risks, such as packaging waste, arising from its operations. in addition, a number of the businesses now use fully recycled and biodegradable filler materials for packaging. these emissions are calculated following the ghg protocol and uk government environmental reporting guidelines. in general, the interactions with these parties are managed at a local level by senior management and the group expects a high standard of expertise and business principles to be maintained in such dealings. group companies agree payment terms with their suppliers when they enter into binding purchasing contracts for the supply of goods or services. 38 diploma plc annual report & accounts 2017 governance board of directors executive management group john nicholas 1,3 chairman appointed: joined the board on 1 june 2013 and appointed chairman on 21 january 2015. skills and experience: a chartered certified accountant with a masters degree in business administration from kingston university, london. where appropriate, matters are delegated to a committee which will consider them in accordance with its terms of reference. similarly, there are authority levels covering capital expenditure which can be exercised by the chief executive officer. effectiveness independent non-executive directors the non-executive directors are determined by the board to be independent in character and judgement and there are no relationships or circumstances which could affect, or appear to affect, a director’s judgement. people are appointed on merit, in an equal opportunities environment and without any form of positive or negative discrimination. the internal board evaluation was carried out in august 2017 and results of this review were again satisfactory. no formal requests were made during the year, but post-year end, advice was sought in relation to board succession. 44 diploma plc annual report & accounts 2017 governance corporate governance continued procedures adopted to deal with conflicts of interest continue to operate effectively and the board’s authorisation powers are being exercised properly in accordance with the company’s articles. the chief executive officer and group finance director generally deal with questions from individual shareholders. the system of internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. audit committee report continued 49 diploma plc annual report & accounts 2017 all financial data is taken directly from the trial balances of each business held in their local erp systems and reanalysed and formatted in a separate group management reporting system, operated by the group finance department. the e-learning training programme is being extended to encompass other regulatory and compliance based topics, including a code of conduct. employees are encouraged to raise concerns via the confidential hotline which is managed by an independent external company. this was confirmed in a detailed consultation exercise carried out by aon hewitt, who were re-appointed by the committee this year (see page 52) to advise on the latest developments in best practice for executive remuneration. there were however, some areas identified where changes could be made to adopt present best practice and improve the policy. the principal proposed changes are as follows: • annual performance bonus deferral – to ensure shareholder alignment, a requirement has been introduced to defer 50% of any bonus awarded (net of tax) into shares until minimum shareholding guideline levels have been achieved. • shareholder guidelines – an increase has been made to the current guidelines so that all executive directors will be required to hold 200% of base salary in shares (currently 200% for the ceo and 100% for other executive directors). • clarification of the treatment of long term incentive awards in a good leaver situation – the policy around vesting “our new remuneration policy aligns with best practice and provides a strong basis for linking diploma’s strategy and performance to executive remuneration. provides an opportunity for additional reward based on annual performance against targets set and assessed by the committee. discretion to reduce awards if satisfactory threshold levels are not achieved for adjusted operating margin, free cash flow or roatce. different performance measures, including personal objectives, may be used for future cycles to take into account changes in the business strategy. directors’ remuneration policy 54 diploma plc annual report & accounts 2017 governance component purpose and link to strategy operation maximum

foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying exposure. a) credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations; this arises principally from the group’s trade and other receivables from customers and from cash balances (including deposits) held with financial institutions. centrally managed funds are invested entirely with counterparties whose credit rating is “aa” or better. the net fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts used as hedges at 30 september 2017 was £0.7m liability (2016: £0.2m asset). all cash deposits, held in the uk and overseas, are held on a short term basis at floating rates or overnight rates, based on the relevant uk base rate, or equivalent rate. an increase of 1% in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the group’s adjusted profit before tax. 25. retirement benefit obligations the group maintains two pension arrangements which are accounted for under ias19 (revised) “employee benefits”. kubo was acquired by the group on 13 march 2015. the kubo pension scheme is a defined contribution based scheme, which for technical reasons, is required under ifrs to be accounted for in accordance with ias19 (revised). assets the scheme’s assets are held in passive unit funds managed by legal & general investment management and at 30 september 2017, the major categories of assets were as follows: 2017 % 2016 % north america equities 20 20 uk equities 20 19 european equities (non-uk) 20 19 asia-pacific and

transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. ii) non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 90 diploma plc annual report & accounts 2017 financial statements 1.9 property, plant and equipment continued freehold land
