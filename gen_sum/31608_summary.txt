However, expenditure on acquisitions slowed this year to £20.1m (2016: £32.7m) as some vendors postponed their exit plans in the face of a more favourable macroeconomic environment.

Similar to the other DHG businesses, TPD focuses on specialised laboratory diagnostics and specialty medical device segments, again leveraging a number of common suppliers. Market drivers The DHG businesses in Canada supply into areas of Healthcare which are predominantly public sector funded. Over many years, Healthcare expenditure has grown steadily with annual variations mostly dependent on the periodic additional tranches of funding provided by individual Provinces. As with Canada, Australia has a large geography to be covered, low population density and purchasing processes that vary by State. However, revenues reduced in the water testing and interventional cardiology segments as certain suppliers moved from specialised distribution to a direct supply model. The new ERP system will be designed to increase operational efficiency, improve business intelligence and deliver broader marketing capabilities. Edco is being managed as part of the M Seals group with good opportunities for cross-selling and improved purchasing power. On an underlying basis, after adjusting for these acquisitions and currency effects, revenues increased by 14%, with growth moderating in the second half (though still double-digit) against stronger prior year comparatives. In Switzerland, local law requires Kubo to provide a contribution based pension for all employees, which are funded by employer and employee contributions. These metrics are also subject to sensitivity analysis which includes flexing a number of the main assumptions, namely, future revenue growth, gross margins, operating costs and working capital management. The results of flexing these assumptions, both individually and in aggregate, are used to determine whether additional bank facilities will be required during this period. There is also the risk of a supplier taking away exclusivity and either setting up direct operations or appointing another distributor. The businesses also meet with key customers on a regular basis to gain insight into their product requirements and market developments. This communication programme enables employees to gain a better understanding of the Group’s business objectives and their roles in achieving them. The Group requires that each operating business conducts Health & Safety reviews against its specific operational risk profile and local regulatory requirements. The Group is committed to identifying and assessing environmental risks, such as packaging waste, arising from its operations. In addition, a number of the businesses now use fully recycled and biodegradable filler materials for packaging. Group companies agree payment terms with their suppliers when they enter into binding purchasing contracts for the supply of goods or services.

Where appropriate, matters are delegated to a Committee which will consider them in accordance with its terms of reference. Similarly, there are authority levels covering capital expenditure which can be exercised by the Chief Executive Officer. People are appointed on merit, in an equal opportunities environment and without any form of positive or negative discrimination.

Employees are encouraged to raise concerns via the confidential Hotline which is managed by an independent external company. There were however, some areas identified where changes could be made to adopt present best practice and improve the Policy. • Clarification of the treatment of long term incentive awards in a good leaver situation – the policy around vesting “Our new Remuneration Policy aligns with best practice and provides a strong basis for linking Diploma’s strategy and performance to Executive remuneration. Provides an opportunity for additional reward based on annual performance against targets set and assessed by the Committee. Discretion to reduce awards if satisfactory threshold levels are not achieved for adjusted operating margin, free cash flow or ROATCE. Different performance measures, including personal objectives, may be used for future cycles to take into account changes in the business strategy. These measures align with our long-term goal of value creation for shareholders through underlying financial growth and above-market shareholder returns. • Fees for a new Chairman or non-Executive Director will be set in line with the approved Policy.

For management reporting purposes, the Group is organised into three main reportable business Sectors: Life Sciences, Seals and Controls. Adjusted earnings per share Adjusted EPS, which is defined in note 2, is calculated as follows: 2017 pence per share 2016 pence per share 2017 £m 2016 £m Profit before tax 66.8 54.0 Tax expense (18.6) (14.9) Minority interests (0.7) (0.8) Earnings for the year attributable to shareholders of the Company 42.0 33.9 47.5 38.3 Acquisition related charges 8.6 9.1 9.7 10.3 Fair value remeasurement of put options 0.9 1.1 1.0 1.3 Gain on disposal of assets – (0.6) – (0.7) Tax effects on acquisition related charges and fair value remeasurements (1.7) (1.6) (1.9) (1.8) Adjusted earnings 49.8 41.9 56.3 47.4 10. The impairment test requires a “value in use” valuation to be prepared for each Sector using discounted cash flow forecasts. Acquisition intangible assets relate to items acquired through business combinations which are amortised over their useful economic life.

The aggregate amount for which deferred tax has not been recognised in respect of unremitted earnings was £5.5m (2016: £4.5m). The treasury team does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying exposure. The net fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts used as hedges at 30 September 2017 was £0.7m liability (2016: £0.2m asset). An increase of 1% in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the Group’s adjusted profit before tax.

Retirement benefit obligations The Group maintains two pension arrangements which are accounted for under IAS19 (Revised) “Employee Benefits”. Annuity policies have been taken out in respect of some historic pensioners, but the Scheme has not purchased annuities for retirements since 2005. Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life of between three and seven years. CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and can form an integral part of the Group’s cash management. The review has identified specific contracts within Life Sciences where goods and services are sold together which in aggregate account for less than 5% of Group consolidated revenues. Acquisitions often comprise an element of deferred consideration and may include a minority interest, which are subject to put options.
