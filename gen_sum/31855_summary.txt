2017 abcam plc strategic report i am pleased to report that abcam has made good progress, both financially and strategically, over the course of the past twelve months. we are a global leader in the sale of research antibodies and have a reputation for providing high quality products, along with comprehensive supporting scientific data, to researchers who strive to understand the molecular basis of biology and disease. our dual growth strategy combines organic in-house development with a track record of successfully completing partnerships and acquisitions. in addition, we operate a robust framework of systems and controls to maintain high standards throughout the company. one area that has become increasingly attractive to us is broadening abcam’s offerings as a development and supply partner in the diagnostics market. consumers our comprehensive consumer insights, personalised support, data and continually growing range of resources are helping to accelerate scientific discovery. it has been a year of progress for abcam as we have once again delivered on our financial goals. our research use-only product catalogue revenues at reported values grew to £202.5m (fy 2016: £159.0m), a 27.4% increase over the previous year. by product type, we continue to grow primary antibody revenue ahead of the global market growth rate. this is a model we are replicating across many commercial agreements around the world to establish future growth for our business. 8 abcam plc annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report chief executive officer’s review continued underlying markets

report and accounts 2017 strategic report our markets government investment into research remains flat for the fiscal year starting april 2017. japan’s declining population, meaning fewer researchers, alongside the lack of increased budget for science and technology has meant that japan’s global share of scientific publications is decreasing. china’s pharmaceutical industry is also growing strongly, having increased 10.4% from 2015 to 2016. china the asia pacific region has seen strong economic growth overall, and many countries in the region have increased investment in scientific funding. the total european research council (erc) budget increased to €1.8bn, an 8% increase from 2016, with approximately €600m available for new life science projects in 2017. currently germany, uk and france receive the most eu funding, winning 17%, 16% and 13% of eu life science grants, respectively. our integrated marketing approach is driving better conversion across multiple channels

leaders welcome all new employees and spend time explaining our unique culture and what we expect of people. we have continued to listen to our people through our annual all-employee survey which this

directors during 2015/16 the company put in place fee arrangements for all neds where a portion of their fees would be delivered as a fixed number of fully paid ordinary shares. louise patten, mara

paid. • we performed specified procedures over certain account balances and transaction classes at other group companies, including another chinese operation. for all other products, the directors calculate a specific provision for obsolescence by comparing inventories on hand at year end with forecast sales volumes on a product-by-product basis, providing fully against inventories regarded as surplus. the relevant calculations are also performed manually, necessitating a substantive approach to testing that appropriate amounts of labour and overhead cost have been capitalised. for inventory manufactured in house and hybridomas, we agreed, on a sample basis, the quality test results to underlying records. we agreed a sample of the internal staff costs capitalised to supporting calculations and time records. these costs have previously been shown as operating expenses but, as the costs are only incurred in relation to selling product, management has concluded that it more appropriate to include the costs in gross margin as a cost of sales to give a more accurate representation of the true cost of product sales. for this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements. for the group’s other revenue streams, an initial review has been performed on a sample of custom service, licence and royalty agreements and no significant change to the timing of revenue recognition has been identified. dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.

benefit costs payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. the accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below. the group operates an employee share benefit trust as part of its incentive plans for uk-based employees. the group tests whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis or more frequently when there are indications of possible impairment. a number of assets were identified and their remaining useful life shortened based on the expected replacement date. if actual unit sales growth rates differ from those estimated by management, both the level of provision against existing inventory and the rates of provision applied to inventory in future periods would need to be revised. the group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. the group has no individual product or customer which contributes more than 10% of its revenues. no country included within ‘other countries’ contributes more than 5% of the group’s total revenue. 6. profit for the year profit for the year has been arrived at after charging/(crediting): note year ended 30 june 2017 £000 year ended 30 june 2016 £000 cost of inventories

financial instruments are provided in note 24. the group’s principal currency exposure is to fluctuations in usd, euro, chinese renminbi and yen. the group uses forward currency contracts to achieve this objective and applies hedge accounting where applicable. 10% represents management’s assessment of the reasonable possible change in foreign exchange rates over a 12-month period. the group manages liquidity risk by maintaining an adequate level of easily accessible cash reserves, in a currency profile representative of the group’s cost base and matching customer and supplier terms where possible. the group’s customer base is predominantly representatives from government-funded institutions, pharmaceutical companies conducting research, and local distributors. further information on the group’s trade receivable aging and impairment can be found in note 17. where these are not yet required for business opportunities, the excess cash is remitted and managed centrally. this exposure is managed by limiting the concentration of funds and contracts held with any individual financial institution. the fair value is remeasured on a monthly basis with reference to available forward market rates and comparative instrument pricing. 91 annual report and accounts 2017 abcam plc financial statements financial statements 25. share-based payments continued summary of all schemes,

jonathan milner is a non-executive director. deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the group has a legally enforceable right to do so. any other changes in the book values of each loan are attributable to foreign exchange movements, and intergroup settlements. 18. related party transactions company transactions with its subsidiaries the company provided goods for resale to, purchased goods from, received dividends from, and was charged fees by its subsidiaries in the current and prior years. for example, biological pathways can trigger the assembly of new molecules, turn genes on and off, or spur a cell to move. monoclonal antibodies recognise only one kind of antigen, i.e. they bind to the same site on a protein. it serves as an alternative to traditional customer satisfaction research and can be correlated with revenue growth. investor relations 330 cambridge science park milton road cambridge cb4 0fl uk email: corporate@abcam.com phone: +44 (0)1223 696000
