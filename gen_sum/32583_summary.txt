Bloomsbury Popular Music Arcadian Library Online During the year we extended our portfolio of digital resources for fashion studies. Nigel Newton Chief Executive 18 May 2017 We have a strong publishing list in place for the coming year. These acquisitions are strategic investment decisions that took place at different times over a number of years, and so the associated amortisation does not reflect current operational performance. The Corporate Responsibility section gives information on how we take account of social and environmental matters when implementing our strategy. Each division has the capability to publish books in all formats but may also produce other products such as online content accessible through subscription. Bloomsbury re-sells on to other publishers any rights it does not need, which generates an income stream. Bloomsbury has produced e-books since 2005 and as an early adopter benefited from the worldwide growth in e-book sales. Develop other revenue streams, including from rights and services, increasing the scope to enter annually renewing agreements. A deal may require upfront staff time and costs but fail to close resulting in lost investment. Continue to supply books in all formats through multiple digital delivery systems aligned with the demands of readers. Ensure the Group is positioned to take advantage of e-book (or any new format) growth in international markets. Develop non-consumer offering where revenues are less volatile and there is a direct relationship with the customers. We have a substantial Children’s division focused on promoting literacy for young readers of all abilities and ages, including specialist ranges for “Hi-Low” pupils (high age, low attainment) which provide parents and teachers with the tools needed to engage their children in reading. ✷ Bloomsbury’s Chief Executive is President of Book Aid International that gifts approximately 500,000 books a year to libraries in Africa. Staff donating Bloomsbury employees worldwide often call on their colleagues for fundraising sponsorship such as with marathons, cake sales and many other employee-inspired activities. ✷ Employee development: Bloomsbury is acquisitive and has benefited from an intake of high calibre entrepreneurs who support the Group’s capacity to innovate. External recruitment is supported by territorial Human Resources functions enabling vacancies across sites worldwide to be filled internally where employees of an appropriately high calibre seek new opportunities. High performing senior managers may also be eligible to participate in the Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan. These people report to the Chief Executive who has overall Board level responsibility for environmental matters and issues. These visits also provide an opportunity to view employment practices at first hand, including employee minimum age and working conditions. Where the manufacture/handling of novelty items is involved, e.g. on our Children’s lists, we also require ICTI accreditation. By setting such a target we are focused on continuously increasing our efficiency at using natural resources. Our direct operations are predominantly office-based and have been independently assessed as having a low impact on the environment. This does not reflect any sustainable sourcing or supplier specific activity, but allows for recognition of efficiency improvements).

This includes responsibility for ensuring appropriate internal controls are in place over financial reporting processes and related IT systems. A formulaic provision is applied to each inventory line where titles have been published for more than one year.

In line with best practice, LTIP awards will be granted subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period.
