over its 30-year history, bloomsbury’s mission has been to publish works of excellence and originality. again 2013 and 2014 have been restated to reflect the change in treatment of internally generated intangible asset amortisation. — sales of sarah j. maas grew by 87% globally, including a court of mist and fury, which was number one on the new york times young adult bestseller list — neil gaiman reached number one in the sunday times fiction bestseller list with norse mythology adult division — revenue increased by 3% year on year to £29.5 million (2016: £28.7 million) — highlights include william boyd’s sweet caress, celia imrie’s nice work if you can get it, hannah rothschild’s improbability of love and natasha pulley’s the watchmaker of filigree street — the cookery list continues to perform well, notably tom kerridge’s dopamine diet which reached number one on the sunday times non-fiction bestseller list, and le manoir aux quat’ saisons by raymond blanc non-consumer division the non-consumer division, consisting of academic & professional, special interest and content services, generated revenues of £57.2 million (2016: £57.3 million) and operating profit before highlighted items of £4.1 million (2016: £7.1 million). 2 bloomsbury publishing plc annual report and accounts 2017 bloomsbury ar2017-proof 6.indd 2 6/12/2017 1:32:05 pm 25133.04 12 june 2017 1:31 pm proof 6 chairman’s statement b loomsbury has delivered a robust performance over the year to 28 february 2017. group revenue is up 15% (9% at constant currencies) and profit before taxation and highlighted items after incurring the development costs for new digital content products is £12.0 million (2016: £13.0 million), above market expectations. this has coincided with richard charkin reducing his time commitment to around two days a week. we have drawn heavily on his publishing experience and thank him for the tremendous support he has given bloomsbury. bloomsbury’s core business has high social value, namely supporting authors to publish their works of scholarship, literature and information. rather it has provided exciting opportunities for bloomsbury to fulfil its publishing mission in new ways. arcadian library online www.bloomsbury.com strategic report 3 stock code: bmy bloomsbury ar2017-proof 6.indd 3 6/12/2017 1:32:06 pm 25133.04 12 june 2017 1:31 pm proof

growth strategy. “this has been a very strong year for bloomsbury with excellent revenue growth in all our territories. her new throne of glass novel – empire of storms – was on the new york times series bestseller list for nine weeks reaching number two and was also number two on the bookseller uk children’s chart. neil gaiman reached number one in the nielsen bookscan original fiction chart with norse mythology. bloomsbury now has over 1,700 active institutional customers worldwide for its digital resources (2016: 1,009), a growth of 68%. in addition, there were a number of modules added

studies. nigel newton chief executive 18 may 2017 we have a strong publishing list in place for the coming year. £0.1 million of interest was received from hmrc in the year following a successful tax tribunal. last year’s rate was lower because of adjustments for the carry back of double taxation relief to prior years and we were able to use previously unrecognised bloomsbury verlag losses in the uk following a successful hmrc tribunal. we expect the effective rate of tax excluding highlighted items to remain reasonably stable going forward. an equal and opposite tax payable has been recognised which will be settled over three years. these acquisitions are strategic investment decisions that took place at different times over a number of years, and so the associated amortisation does not reflect current operational performance. key performance indicators revenue growth % 2017 2016 2015 1 11 15 digital resources revenue growth % 2017 2016 2015 15 34 50 adjusted operating

responsibility section gives information on how we take account of social and environmental matters when implementing our strategy. each division has the capability to publish books in all formats but may also produce other products such as online content accessible through subscription. bloomsbury re-sells on to other publishers any rights it does not need, which generates an income stream. bloomsbury has produced e-books since 2005 and as an early adopter benefited from the worldwide growth in e-book sales. develop other revenue streams, including from rights and services, increasing the scope to enter annually renewing agreements. a deal may require upfront staff time and costs but fail to close resulting in lost investment. continue to supply books in all formats through multiple digital delivery systems aligned with the demands of readers. ensure the group is positioned to take advantage of e-book (or any new format) growth in international markets. develop non-consumer offering where revenues are less volatile and there is a direct relationship with the customers. we have a substantial children’s division focused on promoting literacy for young readers of all abilities and ages, including specialist ranges for “hi-low” pupils (high age, low attainment) which provide parents and teachers with the tools needed to engage their children in reading. ✷ our australia office supports the indigenous literacy foundation with fundraising and time given for administrative support. ✷ bloomsbury’s chief executive is president of book aid international that gifts approximately 500,000 books a year to libraries in africa. we make a small number of targeted minor cash donations predominantly to not-for-profit organisations that support literature, literacy and education, which in recent years has included book aid international, the independent publishers guild, the charleston trust and woodland trust. staff donating bloomsbury employees worldwide often call on their colleagues for fundraising sponsorship such as with marathons, cake sales and many other employee-inspired activities. ✷ employee development: bloomsbury is acquisitive and has benefited from an intake of high calibre entrepreneurs who support the group’s capacity to innovate. external recruitment is supported by territorial human resources functions enabling vacancies across sites worldwide to be filled internally where employees of an appropriately high calibre seek new opportunities. high performing senior managers may also be eligible to participate in the company’s long term incentive plan. the group maintains h&s risk assessments and accident books for all its locations worldwide (including where there is no local legal requirement to do so) and staff are encouraged to report all accidents or near misses. accidents have typically included infrequent bumps and scalds from hot drinks associated with the office environment. these people report to the chief executive who has overall board level responsibility for environmental matters and issues. these visits also provide an opportunity to view employment practices at first hand, including employee minimum age and working conditions. by setting such a target we are focused on continuously increasing our efficiency at using natural resources. our direct operations are predominantly office-based and have been independently assessed as having a low impact on the environment. data scaled up by number of employees to estimate emissions for dublin and edinburgh serviced offices. www.bloomsbury.com strategic

report and the audited financial statements for bloomsbury publishing plc and its subsidiary companies (the “group”) for the year ended 28 february 2017. bloomsbury publishing plc is a company incorporated in england and wales, company number 01984336, with its principal place of business and registered office at 50 bedford square, london wc1b 3dp. employees from all bloomsbury offices can be involved in business development and travel to various countries worldwide. authorised conflicts or potential conflict matters will be reviewed by the board on an ongoing basis. the group depends on its reputation which strongly influences authors and customers in their selection of publisher. no obligation is assumed to update any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. directors also have access to independent professional advice, if required, at the company’s expense. † the executive directors attend by invitation only for relevant parts of remuneration committee meetings to provide updates. there is a sense of openness in board meetings with all directors able to voice their thoughts effectively. the company maintains an active dialogue with its institutional shareholders and city analysts through a planned programme of investor relations. development may include, for example, meetings with senior managers to gain an improved understanding of the business. directors are provided with a detailed knowledge self- assessment questionnaire to help them consider any further training needs they may have. the system of internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material financial misstatement or loss. this includes responsibility for ensuring appropriate internal controls are in place over financial reporting processes and related it systems. a formulaic provision is applied to each inventory line where titles have been published for more than one year. this provision is a judgement that depends on recent royalty earnings and known future new format releases. ✷ there will be no changes to other elements of fixed pay (i.e. benefit and pension provision). this means that for 2017/18 the total weighting on financial objectives (profit and revenue) increases to 80%. where performance under any of these measures is considered unacceptable, the committee may reduce, or cancel, an award. in line with best practice, ltip awards will be granted subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period. 52 bloomsbury publishing plc annual report and accounts 2017 bloomsbury ar2017-proof 6.indd 52 6/12/2017 1:33:43 pm 25133.04 12 june 2017 1:31 pm proof 6 remuneration

increase of 2% in line with the market. directors may elect to receive a cash alternative in lieu of payments by the company into their private pension arrangements. other benefits benefits comprised a car or car allowance (excluding richard charkin), medical cover, permanent health cover, life assurance and company schemes offered to staff generally, such as buying books for private use at the staff discount rate. 2. each executive director contributed to different areas of developing and delivering bloomsbury 2020 across the group. awards have a concurrent performance condition that no vesting occurs for relative eps growth below 0%. the annual bonus and long-term incentives (see below) for richard charkin will be based on his reduced basic salary. pension contributions (as a percentage of base salary) for other executive directors will remain unchanged. where insufficient sales are forecast by the group, a provision is recorded against each advance. for the remaining components, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these. the income tax relating to each component of other comprehensive income is disclosed in note 7. consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 28 february 2017 www.bloomsbury.com 73 stock code: bmy financial

primarily represents centrally held assets including system development; property, plant and equipment; receivables; and cash. adjustments to prior periods primarily arise where an outcome is obtained on certain tax matters which differs from expectations held when the related provision was made. where the outcome is less favourable than our provision, an additional charge to current year tax will occur. c) factors affecting tax charge for future years reductions in the uk corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% (effective from 1 april 2017) and to 18% (effective 1 april 2020) were substantively enacted on 26 october 2015, and an additional reduction to 17% (effective from 1 april 2020) was substantively enacted on 6 september 2016. this will reduce the company’s future current tax charge accordingly. an equal and opposite tax payable has been recognised which will be settled over three years. notes to the financial statements 98 bloomsbury publishing plc annual report and accounts
