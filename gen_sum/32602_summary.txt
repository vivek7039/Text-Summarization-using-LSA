efficient model we look to develop and enhance strong relationships with our customers over the course of many years. this allows us to provide products that offer exceptional levels of service, across multiple categories, at a fair price. there is potential for customer behavioural changes depending on the stage of each cycle but, given the strengths of our demographic, we tend to see this to a lesser extent compared with other market participants. this gives us a competitive advantage against peers who offer their products to all age ranges. we are well positioned to serve a growing

becoming increasingly customer-centric • put the right team in place to make more of our database and deliver our multi-channel marketing activities. utilising the customer work we will create a platform through which to reward and incentivise our customers to both stay with saga and deepen their relationship with us, we will launch a saga membership programme in the second half of this year. we will continue the work to ensure that saga holidays and saga cruises remain relevant by working with our customers • everyday: to make the little things in life more enjoyable, easier and better value. it’s really important to us that our people speak up, get heard and we take action when necessary. that’s why we’ve created channels that support two-way communication to understand what’s working in saga, and how we can continue to improve our business for both our customers and people. saga also has an important social commentary and campaigning aspect to the brand and we have spoken up on a number of issues that affect the nation’s over 50s – gp waiting times, stamp duty exemptions for downsizing, employment of older people, pension changes, age discrimination and the social care crisis to name but a few. scope 3 business travel emissions from rail and air have been identified, but not included in our disclosure due to a lack of accurate data. there is a continued scope 2 electricity emissions by reporting type use of electric vehicles in our maintenance fleet, and, where practical, active initiatives to switch off unused equipment. we have created a further two year plan to ensure that these values are completely embedded group wide. saga has a diversified business model to lessen the potential impact of changes affecting one product or service. saga controls its third party supply quality through contractual terms and agreed service level agreements. during 2016 we refreshed our selection, monitoring and due diligence processes in place for all key partners/suppliers. we continue to run a motor panel arrangement, thereby increasing competitiveness and reducing risk. we continuously review aicl risk appetite to consider non-standard risks where they are understood. we also purchase reinsurance to reduce claims volatility, including the new funds-withheld quota share arrangement. we have focused a greater marketing effort during the year on these core customers. despite these difficult conditions, we chose to maintain policy volumes with a small reduction in profits. retail broking profit £138.0m +9.1% persistency rate – motor 69.2% persistency rate – home 74.6% policy count 3.0m +3.2% profit per core policy £46.0 +5.7% annual report and accounts 2017 saga plc 24 reinsurance arrangements, enables us to access a competitive cost of risk with no downside underwriting risk. this includes a recent add-on that significantly reduces the cost of car insurance, and access to our travel hub. this is currently running in excess of claims inflation, and sets us on a strong footing to improve motor broking profits during the year. having treatment at home, for example chemotherapy being administered by specialist nurses in the home rather than in a hospital, can be less traumatic and more convenient for some customers at what is clearly a difficult time. underwriting profit £73.1m -13.1% pure cor 94.7% -4.7% solvency ii coverage ratio 143% -27% reserve releases £59.9m -7.4% insurance underwriting aicl, our underwriter, retains its competitive advantage and high panel share of older, lower risk drivers; as a result, it remains a vital part of the group. its rigorous focus on these drivers, along with ongoing efficient management of claims, has led to an excellent underwriting result. aicl ’s high quality book has a track record of generating consistent earnings for the group. within the existing reserve surplus, aicl had already assumed a significant reduction in this rate. by broadening our offering within these categories, we are also succeeding in attracting younger, first time buyers to the brand. the profile of these customers tends to be higher value, making them a natural fit for cross-selling and our membership scheme. in both tour operating and cruising, we have already secured the substantial majority of our fy 2018 sales targets. reservations for departures in fy 2018 as at 18 march 2017 are 8% ahead of the comparable reservation position one year ago. this relationship has been mutually successful, and we are now considering expansion deeper into the category. i am pleased to report that the group has delivered another strong financial performance, with profit before tax from continuing operations 9.7% higher at £193.3m. excluding derivatives and the one-off impact of ogden rate change, profit before tax increased by 5.6%. across each of our products, we have balanced volume and profit to deliver this strong result. annual report and accounts 2017 saga plc 34 insurance

customer-centric, allowing our customers to live the life they want to lead. this committee also considered how we manage our talent and succession planning – for more details see pages 52-53. during the year, we announced that philip green will resign from the board and his position as senior independent director on 31 march 2017, to chair another business. he will be replaced as senior independent director by orna nichionna, one of our current non-executive directors. i am delighted that orna has agreed to take over from philip as senior independent director. a summary of how we have complied with the code is set out overleaf. this started with the group executive and was then cascaded to their direct reports, approximately 72 people. for more details, see page 16. all directors, members of the group executive committee and persons discharging managerial responsibilities receive training on an ongoing basis, to ensure they remain aware of regulatory and statutory responsibilities. a review of our strategic objectives and financial performance takes place at each board meeting. 6 ray king 5 bridget mcintyre 6 orna nichionna 5 gareth williams 6 note: 1 james

off financial crime policies. • externally facilitated board and committee evaluation exercise, which included a review of the previous year’s action plans. other roles: andrew is also chairman of age

lance also has a wealth of senior operational experience in listed companies which he brings to his role at saga. other roles: lance is a trustee of the national gallery and white ensign association. philip is also the uk prime minister’s adviser on corporate responsibility and chairman of sentebale, a charity set up by hrh prince harry. she was a former partner at mckinsey & company, where her client portfolio included many consumer facing clients. she brings these skills to the board along with her considerable experience in other non- executive director roles. he will be replaced as

on successful execution of group strategy. annual re-election the directors are standing for re-election at the agm, with the exception of philip green, who is resigning on 31 march 2017. our view is that each of the directors standing for re-election should be appointed, as we believe that they have the skills required for the board to discharge its responsibilities, as outlined in each of their biographies set out on pages 48-49. reports produced by independent audit limited review/discussion with chairman and committee chairs discussed at board action plans face to face meetings held to

report and accounts 2017 saga plc 51 governance nomination committee report role of the committee our role is to review board composition, consider succession planning and evaluate skills required in board candidates. we concluded that it was important to have the right governance, leadership and independence for such roles. russell reynolds associates were approved as our search consultants and will map candidates against skills sets identified. our policy is to appoint the best possible candidate, considered on merit and against objective criteria (and in accordance with the equality act 2010), rather than to set quotas for a particular aspect that may deflect from achieving this fundamental target every time. consideration of business risks is a standing agenda item at each executive meeting within the group. the financial crime, data and information security committee provides an additional forum to consider specialist risks arising in these areas. most use a common risk assessment matrix, although several have a customised impact scale to reflect their size or the highly specialist nature of their risks each business then creates appropriate controls to manage such risks. explicit consideration is also given as to whether risks lie within or outside of risk appetite. risk registers have been created for each business to capture their key risks, associated controls and incidents. the highest rated residual risks in terms of impact and probability for each business are aggregated at group level to produce a list of principal risks and uncertainties, assessed at residual level against group risk appetite. the group maintains computer systems to record and consolidate all of its financial transactions. • ensuring that at least once every 10 years the audit services contract is put out to tender. this included those risks that would threaten our business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. we recognise the need to review risk appetites and tolerances on a continuous basis. we considered investments made by asset/fund managers on our behalf and were reassured that these followed ethical guidelines. shipping • looked at the assurance structure and minimum standards required by each relevant flag state. • reviewed the relationship with v ships and our requirement for them to operate at ‘beyond compliance’ levels. • discussed whether any additional cover was required, specifically in relation to the threat of financial crime or cybercrime. we set ourselves the target of providing information to our shareholders that is timely, clear and concise. we communicate in the following ways: shareholder communication in addition to the agm, we: • have regular meetings with key shareholders; • arrange face-to-face presentations of full year and half year results by the group chief executive officer and group chief financial officer; • hold telephone briefings in conjunction with key financial announcements; • publish live and post-event webcasts of key presentations; • add presentations to our website to allow shareholders to gain an insight into how our trading performance links to strategy; • hold investor ‘road shows’, investor days, briefings and ad hoc meetings on request, where calendar and regulatory requirements allow; • conduct tours of saga’s operations; • notify our shareholders of key financial calendar information; • publish details of live webcasting services for key presentations; and • make past key presentations available via our corporate website. this includes reference to the views of key shareholders, including their concerns, along with any new analyst research. • attraction, retention and motivation of a talented leadership cadre to deliver the business strategy.

we: • performed detailed testing of a sample of transactions to confirm that the tour operator revenues and cruise holiday revenues were being recognised in line with the contract terms and applicable accounting policy; • performed cut-off testing to confirm revenue had been recorded in the correct period; • challenged and corroborated reasons for variances from prior periods based on analytical procedures performed; and • tested a sample of manual journals for any indication of inappropriate revenue recognition. we determined the appropriate level of our involvement to enable us to be satisfied that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the group as a whole. governance financial statements strategic report annual report and accounts 2017 saga plc

the notes on pages 107-165 form an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. in determining and applying accounting policies, directors and management are required to make judgements in respect of items where the choice of specific policy, accounting estimate or assumption to be followed could materially affect the group’s reported financial position, results or cash flows; it may later be determined that a different choice may have been more appropriate. a discussion on the group’s significant accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty is detailed in note 2.5. actual results could differ from those estimates. the principal accounting policies adopted, which have been applied consistently, unless otherwise stated, are set out in note 2.3 below. if the group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of equity while any resultant gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. for primary care operations, revenue was recognised on delivery of the contracted services, or on a time-elapsed basis for capacity-related contracts as the principal contractual obligation was to provide an agreed level of capacity over a fixed term. unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in the income statement. if not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. in determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. these calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. where an item of property, plant and equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, they are accounted for separately. all other repairs and maintenance costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred. these assets are transferred to other asset categories when they become available for their intended use. after initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (‘eir’) method, less impairment losses. impairment losses on available for sale equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement, but those on available for sale debt instruments are reversed if there is an increase in fair value that is objectively related to a subsequent event. retrospective hedge testing is also performed at each reporting date using the same technique. provision for premium deficiency at each reporting date, the group reviews its unexpired risks and a liability adequacy test is performed to determine whether there is any overall excess of expected claims and deferred acquisition costs over unearned premiums. the amount of any anticipated reinsurance recoveries is treated as a reduction in claims costs. strategic report

operated a number of defined benefit pension plans which require contributions to be made to separately administered funds. in most cases, no explicit assumptions are made regarding future rates of

financial resources to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure them only at excessive cost. this could be for a number of reasons, including weather- related events, large individual claims, changes in claimant behaviour patterns such as increased levels of fraudulent activities, the use of ppos, prospective or retrospective legislative changes, unresponsive and inaccurate pricing or reserving methodologies and the deterioration in the group’s ability to effectively and efficiently handle claims while delivering excellent customer service. cash flow projections are undertaken for ppo claims to estimate the gross and net of reinsurance provisions required. reinsurers are therefore required to have strong credit ratings and their financial health is regularly monitored. specific areas of operational risk by segment include: i) insurance the insurance segment is required to comply with various operational regulatory requirements primarily in the uk but also within gibraltar for its underwriting business. they are thus required to maintain specified liquidity and diversification characteristics of their underlying portfolios which comprise investment grade investments in financial institutions. these amounts held are not readily available to be used for other purposes within the group and total £206.4m (2016: £156.6m). strategic report
