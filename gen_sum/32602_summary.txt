i am very pleased that we have again delivered consistent profit growth in line with our stated targets. historically, we have managed a highly effective product marketing approach, evidenced by industry leading customer acquisition costs in insurance. this gives us further confidence to deliver consistent, sustainable earnings growth through increased efficiency and customer value across the
