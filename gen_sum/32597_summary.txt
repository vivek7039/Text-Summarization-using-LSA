Notwithstanding the investment necessary for our next phase of expansion, the Board remains focused on delivering profitable growth, and as such is pleased to announce an operating profit of £2.6m which is a £1.7m (+192%) improvement on FY16’s underlying operating profit (adjusted to remove one-off IPO costs).

Other competitors in the European market include Musicstore.de (Germany), 4Sound (Sweden), Bax Shop (Netherlands) and Woodbrass (France).

As such we are very pleased to announce the £5.3m freehold acquisition of a 50,000 square foot property at Holgate Park in York, which will become our long-term UK headquarters. Our Swedish distribution centre became operational in November 2016, and I am pleased to report is performing well. Examples of new features deployed during FY17 include the integration of multiple hubs across many countries to automatically select the most appropriate dispatch location, international ‘click & collect’, shopping basket and checkout enhancements, mobile website improvements, and website cloudification. 17 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Case study E-COMMERCE PLATFORM It’s been great for our team to formally become part of the Gear4music family, and with the project pipeline we have mapped out, I see many exciting opportunities ahead. Across all our ranges we currently list more than 37,000 products, up 37% since IPO, but we still see opportunities to grow this significantly, and will achieve this by further expanding our team of specialist buyers. Intelligent marketing With in excess of 12 million website visitors, conversion rates improving by 47 bps, active customer numbers increasing to more than 339,000, and 39% more repeat customers than a year earlier, our marketing strategy has been highly effective. Andrew Wass Chief Executive Officer 4 July 2017 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT CONTINUED The response to the Group’s placing in May 2017 was extremely pleasing and I believe raising £4.2m reflects well on our progress to date and prospects. Andrew Wass Chief Executive Officer 19 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Case study This property acquisition addresses a barrier to growth and makes good commercial sense. As such the Board also monitors two-year revenue growth and going forward will report on this metric. Sourcing own-brand products takes time and the opportunity was highlighted as a medium-term aspiration upon IPO, so it is reassuring to see revenue growth catch up and match the growth in other-branded product revenue. As referred to in the Chief Executive’s 21 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements statement, there will be an initial ‘overhead investment’ phase involving upfront additional costs being incurred that take time to generate added value. The full-year cost effect of these investments and associated benefits will be evident in FY18. The Board will routinely direct management to seek professional input into any such major developments. This dependency has been partly mitigated in FY17 by the Group opening two further distribution centres and warehouses, all holding stock for delivery directly to customers. Any disruption to distribution centres’ efficient operation may therefore have an effect on the Group’s business. Rigorous monitoring of customer feedback helps ensure issues are identified and rectified on a timely basis. Operations continued 29 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Risk Description Mitigation SUPPLY AND SALE OF THIRD-PARTY BRANDED PRODUCTS The Group purchases products from a number of large global musical instrument and music equipment brand owners, and the Group’s business depends on its ability to source a range of products from well-recognised brands on commercially reasonable terms. RELIANCE ON SUB-CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS The Group sub-contracts manufacture of its own-brand musical instruments and equipment to independent third-party businesses in South-East Asia. Any disruption to supply or issues such as poor product quality could have an adverse impact on the Group’s reputation. 31 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Each Director is appraised through the normal appraisal process.
