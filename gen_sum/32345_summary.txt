long‑term successful relationships with our customers help create strong cash flows that can be used to generate growth and shareholder value. 19 babcock international group plc annual report and accounts 2017 chief executive’s review aligned for growth unaffected by the changing environment. but the depth and breadth of our offering brings its own problems when we are trying to win new business. we’ve made a lot of progress internationally in the last two years, but i believe that our structure was holding us back. to carry out these two tasks effectively, we are embedding business development people from each sector in the new global growth organisation. my society is not used to the idea of women working in this field, but i haven’t let that stop me. it is also introducing alternative options for those employees who may wish to leave the schemes whilst remaining employed. three further t23s have now entered their lifex programmes • secured an order for 22 assemblies for

services business has successfully executed the first offshore renewables substation for e.on’s rampion wind farm. our hmnb clyde apprenticeship programme won the prestigious princess royal training award, which honours uk employers who have created a lasting impact. importantly for babcock, there is a change in financial arrangements where savings made by the front line commands can be used to fund new investments. our transformation of royal navy engineering training is progressing, providing innovative learning with stimulating interactive online content and media supported by simplified instruction. this has been achieved by extending the scope of our high potential identification, pushing deeper into talent pools, stretching and challenging people earlier in their careers. targeting critical technical skills, we currently have 118 apprentices on programme and 2016 saw the first cohort complete our two‑year advanced air engineering apprentice scheme. we employ around 1,700 highly trained and uniquely skilled people to deliver those specialist services from more than 30 sites across the uk. however, while we expect large organisations to look to maximise the value of their levy account, our customer base also includes small employers who key highlights • nuclear decommissioning milestones achieved on programmes across all decommissioning sites • additional work at dounreay

executive, said: “we always encourage our contractors to adopt the highest standards of safety, security and environmental responsibility. in addition, cavendish nuclear’s dounreay joint venture had higher than expected activity levels following some acceleration to the programme of works. around 68 tonnes of highly radioactive liquid metal coolant was removed from the dounreay fast reactor (dfr) and safely destroyed over a 10‑year period. handling the material is a particularly complex technical challenge as it reacts vigorously when exposed to air or water, eventually catching fire. in australia, we are running operations for the victorian government’s ambulance victoria service and have renewed our emergency medical services contract at horn island. we have once again increased our market position in australia with the award of two new long‑term contracts by chevron and conoco phillips. the contract to support gse at babcock upgrades technical fleet capability in south australia babcock, in supporting the government of south australia, has upgraded its fleet of three aircraft with increased technical capability utilising electro‑optical infra‑red system (eoirs) technology to enhance outcomes for tactical surveillance and search and rescue missions. sustainability mcs understands that mission critical success depends on people – both our own team members and the communities we serve. finally, at this year’s imarest european international submarine races, babcock sponsored a team of students from montreal’s école de technologie supérieure (é.t .s) allowing them to race and showcase their human‑powered submarines, as well as partnering with é.t .s to launch the ‘babcock excellence award’, with the aim of promoting and recognising innovative engineering students. as a result of this initiative, procurement is engaging earlier in order to help provide our customers with the best possible solution while improving profitability. we take this responsibility very seriously and work in collaboration with other industry leaders to create a process that optimises risk management while encouraging the use of smes. for these companies, we need to be certain that information is well managed and protected throughout the supply chain. focus on recruitment, retention and development of talent we recognise that an employee’s relationship with babcock starts before they even apply to us. in parallel, we have established a partnership that will see babcock employees join vine trust volunteers on 14‑day expeditions to the tanzanian municipality of moshi. inevitably, companies with this background will tend to be starting from a level of relatively low female participation, especially in management positions. we have now also become a founder member of upstanding, which champions equal opportunities for black, asian and minority ethnic group (bame) employees. during the year, a babcock supplier’s code of business conduct was published to further promote these values throughout our supply chain. our customer profile we rely heavily on winning and retaining large contracts with a relatively limited number of major customers, whether in the uk or overseas. mitigation senior management at group and sector level are keenly aware of reputational risks, which can come from many sources. a change in requirements could entail substantial expenditure which may not be recoverable (either fully or at all) under customer contracts. she was also a non-executive director of morgan advanced materials plc (uk), norsk hydro asa (norway) and outokumpu oyj (finland). we, therefore, recommend to shareholders that they reappoint each of our non-executive directors at the forthcoming annual general meeting in july. our updated policy therefore remains largely unchanged, but will incorporate some new features that ensure alignment with best practice and shareholders’ interests. other than in exceptional cases (such as to replace existing arrangements for new recruits) the committee does not anticipate employer contributions into a defined contribution pension scheme or cash in lieu of benefit as being at a cost to the company that would exceed 25% of base salary. 150% of salary performance share plan new appointees may be granted awards under the psp on similar terms to other executives. in order to facilitate like-for-like compensatory awards on recruitment, the committee may avail itself of listing rule 9.4.2(2) if required. financial targets are set taking into account a range of reference points including the group’s strategic and operating plan. no material reduction in long-term incentive targets for future awards would be made without prior consultation with our major shareholders. in line with our policy, overall vesting at threshold is no more than 15% when all measures are taken into account. the important thing for me is getting young people excited about stem subjects, and showing that there are fascinating careers accessible to everyone. the group’s investment in joint ventures and associates includes goodwill (net of any accumulated impairment loss) identified on
