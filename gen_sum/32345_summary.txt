our customers see us as a trusted partner that helps them to manage their complex assets. clearly, this meets a need – in the last 10 years our revenue has grown from £500 million to £5 billion today. there will be new career opportunities opening up in the uk and internationally as we grow. i want babcock to be seen as the benchmark for technical innovation within engineering services. but the depth and breadth of our offering brings its own problems when we are trying to win new business. we’ve made a lot of progress internationally in the last two years, but i believe that our structure was holding us back. therefore i decided to realign our organisation around four sectors: marine, land, aviation and cavendish nuclear. infrastructure, including our dockyards at devonport and rosyth, will continue to be a main driver for all four sectors. to carry out these two tasks effectively, we are embedding business development people from each sector in the new global growth organisation.

pension deficit reduced to £104.5 million (2016: £203.1 million), essentially because the liabilities were 75% hedged for discount rates and inflation by matching assets, and growth assets performed well along with continuing annual deficit contributions. policy the board aims to maintain a balance between equity and debt capital which optimises the group’s cost of carry whilst allowing access to both equity and debt capital markets at optimum pricing when appropriate. this level may be tempered in periods of market volatility and economic and/ or political uncertainty. all the occupational defined benefit schemes have been closed to new members for some years. it is also introducing alternative options for those employees who may wish to leave the schemes whilst remaining employed. the

defined projects, with revenues expected in 2018/19. our transformation of royal navy engineering training is progressing, providing innovative learning with stimulating interactive online content and media supported by simplified instruction. this has been achieved by extending the scope of our high potential identification, pushing deeper into talent pools, stretching and challenging people earlier in their careers. targeting critical technical skills, we currently have 118 apprentices on programme and 2016 saw the first cohort complete our two‑year advanced air engineering apprentice

safety, security and environmental responsibility. however, this decrease was partially offset by growth in our rail electrification joint venture with alstom and costain. in addition, cavendish nuclear’s dounreay joint venture had higher than expected activity levels following some acceleration to the programme of works. work to date has focused on constructability studies and schedule integration with other installation contractors. cavendish nuclear is also pursuing additional opportunities in the uk new build programme, including small modular reactors. around 68 tonnes of highly radioactive liquid metal coolant was removed from the dounreay fast reactor (dfr) and safely destroyed over a 10‑year period. handling the material is a particularly complex technical challenge as it reacts vigorously when exposed to air or water, eventually catching fire. following a challenging period of trading driven by reducing customer demand and escalating supply chain costs, with returns falling below expectations, we are reviewing our heavy mobile equipment fleet management contracts in the aggregates and cement market in north america. working as part of the edinburgh glasgow

leonardo helicopters’ technologies. in australia, we are running operations for the victorian government’s ambulance victoria service and have renewed our emergency medical services contract at horn island. we have once again increased our market position in australia with the award of two new long‑term contracts by chevron and conoco phillips. the contract to support gse at babcock upgrades technical fleet capability in south australia babcock, in supporting the government of south australia, has upgraded its fleet of three aircraft with increased technical capability utilising electro‑optical infra‑red system (eoirs) technology to enhance outcomes for tactical surveillance and search and rescue missions. sustainability mcs understands that mission critical success depends on people – both our own team members and the communities we serve. we believe that giving people the opportunity to see our aircraft up close and to speak with the pilots, engineers, rescuers, doctors and nurses who carry out our missions is a key part of who we are. we also work with groups to help reforest areas that have been affected by fires. in addition, our diversity activities include 15 disabled employees working full time for babcock at year end. it is our belief that strong success can only be delivered through a sustainable business, which is why at babcock we uphold the strictest standards of business ethics, deliver a competitive talent development programme and put safety at the forefront of everything we do. our group‑wide code of business conduct, supplemented by appropriate guidance and training, is not only the right approach to doing business in itself but is also intended to support long‑term success by minimising financial risk and sustaining our reputation. finally, at this year’s imarest european international submarine races, babcock sponsored a team of students from montreal’s école de technologie supérieure (é.t .s) allowing them to race and showcase their human‑powered submarines, as well as partnering with é.t .s to launch the ‘babcock excellence award’, with the aim of promoting and recognising innovative engineering students. graduate diversity in australia: babcock australia also ran several exciting stem initiatives this year, with university outreach including a sponsorship of adelaide university’s ingenuity exhibition – which showcased final year engineering projects, a work placement and mentoring scheme for undergraduates in the casg department of defence industry programme, and the sponsorship of a phd project researching underwater shock modelling through the research training centre for naval design & manufacture. we deliver highly successful after‑school clubs and workshops at uk primary schools, providing young children with a fun, hands‑on introduction to engineering, and this year we were delighted to support three schools in the national finals of the prestigious big

enable us to return value to our customers, our colleagues and our investors. as a result of this initiative, procurement is engaging earlier in order to help provide our customers with the best possible solution while improving profitability. performance building long‑term relationships we are always looking for better, innovative ways of serving our customers. as a result, we work closely with these suppliers to ensure optimal performance, ongoing improvement and innovation support. these tools also provide a common approach, which enables us to share best practice across the organisation. we take this responsibility very seriously and work in collaboration with other industry leaders to create a process that optimises risk management while encouraging the use of smes. potential suppliers must demonstrate their financial, commercial and technical capability to meet our contractual requirements. certain suppliers will be selected for audit and close monitoring based on risk assessment or supplier performance. babcock is a key member of the joint mod/industry initiative to deliver an effective defence cyber protection partnership. in addition to the self‑assessment initiative, we now require additional evidence which gives us objective, verifiable supplier ratings. for these companies, we need to be certain that information is well managed and protected throughout the supply chain. babcock is actively involved with our suppliers in the aerospace, defence and security supply chain development programme. success story in the making engineering ace tom bennett, who works with babcock’s defence systems technology team in bristol, joined an elite group late last year when he received a prestigious institute of mechanical engineers (imeche) whitworth award. our business arrangements require us to deliver services across an array of projects and assets. we have plans in place that identify immediate and/or future potential successors to key senior management posts. focus on recruitment, retention and development of talent we recognise that an employee’s relationship with babcock starts before they even apply to us. in parallel, we have established a partnership that will see babcock employees join vine trust volunteers on 14‑day expeditions to the tanzanian municipality of moshi. we believe diversity is also about embracing the advantages different experiences, skills and outlooks can bring. inevitably, companies with this background will tend to be starting from a level of relatively low female participation, especially in management positions. we have continued to work on the challenges of being a woman within our organisation. a series of actions and development programmes are being implemented across the organisation following this. we focus our graduate recruitment programme, particularly for engineering graduates, on those universities that have a richer gender mix. we have now also become a founder member of upstanding, which champions equal opportunities for black, asian and minority ethnic group (bame) employees. we continued to focus on gender diversity whilst also looking more widely at issues of ethnicity, disability and sexual orientation, challenging our unconscious bias and how we can make the changes to improve diversity among our workforce. during the year, a babcock supplier’s code of business conduct was published to further promote these values throughout our supply chain. the group’s risk management and internal control systems can, however, only seek to manage, not eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, as any system can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. risk assessments made at business unit level are subject to regular review and challenge by group senior management. our customer profile we rely heavily on winning and retaining large contracts with a relatively limited number of major customers, whether in the uk or overseas. bidding for these contracts typically involves a protracted and detailed tendering process, often under public procurement rules. risk description bidding requires a substantial investment in terms of manpower resource and is very expensive. contract award decisions made under public procurement rules can be subject to legal challenge by losing bidders. mitigation senior management at group and sector level are keenly aware of reputational risks, which can come from many sources. a change in requirements could entail substantial expenditure which may not be recoverable (either fully or at all) under customer contracts. these provide for a specified level of pension benefits to scheme members, the cost of which is met from both member and employer contributions paid into pension scheme funds and the investment returns made in those funds over time. mitigation full financial and other due diligence is conducted as far as may reasonably be achievable in the context of each acquisition and a detailed business case, with forward looking projections, is submitted to the board in respect of each acquisition. bill
