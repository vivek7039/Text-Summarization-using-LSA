mnogovershinnoye (mnv) – new jorc-compliant reserve estimate at mnv doubled ore reserves and supported the extension of life-of-mine by four years to at least 2022, with initial results from the ongoing near-mine exploration programme indicating resources for additional years of operation. mining at belaya gora continued to focus on processing low-grade ore stockpiles pending the completion of an ongoing project review. ** 2016 net cash inflow from operations was amended for us$3.1 million reclassified to the investing activities. highland gold mining limited | annual report and accounts

operating mine development project pre-development project highland gold mining limited | annual report and accounts 2017 6 strategic report chairman’s statement eugene shvidler “unlocking the value of a world class resource base…” dear shareholder, it gives me much pleasure to report that highland gold mining’s 15th year as a public company – anniversary: 23rd may 2017 – marked a period of steady progress on all our strategic fronts. before i chronicle such progress, i would like to draw your attention to the fact that, after 15 years as a publicly quoted enterprise, some 63% of your company’s shares are in ‘free float’ and our shareholder base includes a wide range of uk, european and us institutional investors. i utilise this phrase again because there can be few better descriptions of management’s primary objective which was furthered, throughout the year under review, by effective business strategies and carefully monitored disciplines. consistent with our business strategy, your company will continue to maximise the upside potential of our operating assets, namely: mnv (‘life-of-mine’ extended), novo (capacity being expanded to 1.3 mtpa) and belaya gora (processing plant upgrades and combination with the blagodatnoye deposit). an updated jorc reserve statement in respect of mnv, our longstanding mine which is also located in the khabarovsk region, was completed and published in may 2017. this confirmed a doubling of ore reserves to 500,000 oz au (as of 31 december 2016) which, in turn, underwrote a life-of-mine extension to at least 2022. we are intent on extending mnv’s productive life beyond this date and, to this end, we have budgeted for an annual us$3 million – us$5 million exploration spend. completion and publication of an updated jorc reserve statement in may revealed a doubling of mnv’s ore reserves to 500,000 oz au, a development that saw the life-of-mine (lom) extended by four years to at least 2022. management is intent on continuing operations beyond this date and a near-mine exploration programme – actively progressed in 2016 and 2017 – is ongoing. appraisal of the waste stockpiles – a potentially significant source of additional resource – will also continue in 2018. against this background, an updated jorc-compliant reserve estimate is scheduled for completion in q3 2018. belaya gora operations at belaya gora focused on processing low-grade ore stockpiles during 2017 in advance of the pre-feasibility study involving a joint mining schedule with the nearby blagodatnoye deposit. work continued on the expansion of novo’s ore mining and processing capacity from 700,000 tpa to 1.3 mtpa. in line with this a comprehensive survey of the hoist, headframe, crusher and main fan unit buildings was conducted. a tender was held to select a contractor to carry out an additional exploration programme at klen and work began in q1 2018. strategic report ceo’s report (continued) 1. all figures quoted

good governance highland gold mining limited | annual report and accounts 2017 27 governance the company was subsequently notified on 4 january 2018 that, due to the liquidation of primerod, which had retained an 8% interest in the company, primerod’s shareholding was transferred to its sole remaining shareholder, mr. roman abramovich. bonuses, currently paid in cash although they could include a share element, are solely dependent on an overall assessment of the individual’s performance, with both financial and non-financial key performance indicators being taken into account. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. we engaged ey valuation specialists where appropriate to ensure certain specific assumptions applied in the impairment model are reasonable. we consider management’s estimates to be reasonable for the current year with assumptions within an acceptable range. we have tested the quality of management forecasting by comparing cash flow forecasts for prior periods to actual outcomes. audit procedures were performed on the three full scope components by our component teams in russia. 2. basis of preparation the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss and assets and liabilities acquired in business combination that have been measured at fair value. property, plant and equipment acquired through business combinations are stated at their acquisition date fair values on initial recognition. similarly, overhaul costs associated with major maintenance are capitalised and depreciated over their useful lives where it is probable that future economic benefits will be available and any remaining carrying amounts of the cost of previous overhauls are derecognised. • buildings, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives. where parts of an asset have different useful lives, depreciation is calculated on each separate part. these assets are depreciated upon their transfer to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment. fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in note 29. fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. an impairment loss recognised for an asset other than goodwill in prior years is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s value-in-use or fair value less costs of disposal and if there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. when financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. the provision is reviewed on a semi-annual basis for changes in cost estimates or lives of operations. adjustments for volumes (metal grades in concentrates) are based on the available actual test results. ifrs 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018, with early application permitted. instead, the receivables will be accounted for as one instrument and measured at fair value through profit or loss with subsequent changes in fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income each period until final settlement and presented as part of ‘revenue’. the group has neither longer-term receivables, contract assets nor debt securities which can be significantly impacted by ecl requirements. as a result of this analysis, the key issues were identified and are set out below. these are based on the group’s current interpretation of ifrs 15 and may be subject to change as interpretations evolve further. adjustments for volumes (metal grades in concentrates) are based on the available actual test results. the cash flows are based on estimates of expected future production, metal selling prices, operating costs, capital expenditure and post-tax discount rates. please refer to note 17 for further details on the significant judgements and estimations made when preparing impairment tests of non-current assets, including post-tax discount rates. highland gold mining limited | annual report and accounts 2017

applicable to similar sites that have closed recently, and assumptions regarding the life-of- mine (which is assumed to close in 2023, 2033, 2032 for plant and infrastructure (2024 for open pit), 2036 and 2030 respectively), with site restoration activities expected to be carried out in respective periods (removal of waste, restoration of mine sites). there are no restrictions imposed by
