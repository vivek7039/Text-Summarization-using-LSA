mnogovershinnoye (mnv) – new jorc-compliant reserve estimate at mnv doubled ore reserves and supported the extension of life-of-mine by four years to at least 2022, with initial results from the ongoing near-mine exploration programme indicating resources for additional years of operation. mining at belaya gora continued to focus on processing low-grade ore stockpiles pending the completion of an ongoing project review. oz) 272,274 2016: 261,159 oz total group cash costs (us/oz) 507 2016: 454 us/oz group all-in sustaining costs (us/oz) 664 2016: 652 us/oz revenue (us m) 316.7 2016: 305.9

eugene shvidler “unlocking the value of a world class resource base…” dear shareholder, it gives me much pleasure to report that highland gold mining’s 15th year as a public company – anniversary: 23rd may 2017 – marked a period of steady progress on all our strategic fronts. before i chronicle such progress, i would like to draw your attention to the fact that, after 15 years as a publicly quoted enterprise, some 63% of your company’s shares are in ‘free float’ and our shareholder base includes a wide range of uk, european and us institutional investors. i utilise this phrase again because there can be few better descriptions of management’s primary objective which was furthered, throughout the year under review, by effective business strategies and carefully monitored disciplines. consistent with our business strategy, your company will continue to maximise the upside potential of our operating assets, namely: mnv (‘life-of-mine’ extended), novo (capacity being expanded to 1.3 mtpa) and belaya gora (processing plant upgrades and combination with the blagodatnoye deposit). appraisal of the waste stockpiles – a potentially significant source of additional resource – will also continue in 2018. against this background, an updated jorc-compliant reserve estimate is scheduled for completion in q3 2018. belaya gora operations at belaya gora focused on processing low-grade ore stockpiles during 2017 in advance of the pre-feasibility study involving a joint mining schedule with the nearby blagodatnoye deposit. work continued on the expansion of novo’s ore mining and processing capacity from 700,000 tpa to 1.3 mtpa. in line with this a comprehensive survey of the hoist, headframe, crusher and main fan unit buildings was conducted. a tender was held to select a contractor to carry out an additional exploration programme at klen and work began in q1 2018. strategic report ceo’s report (continued) 1. all figures quoted as per oz of gold equivalent production without any by-product credits and refining charges. payments for dividends in us dollars will be fixed at an exchange rate of 1.4329 gbp/us, or us0.0777 per share. the risk register defines a responsible body or individuals who are charged with monitoring, managing and mitigating these risks. the majority of costs are linked to us dollars although a significant proportion is incurred in russian roubles. the group conducts detailed exploration and assesses results in accordance with widely recognised methods of resources/reserves evaluation. the group initiates new projects, mine extensions, etc., based on detailed investment plans and a review of management resources. there can be no guarantee that current or prospective exploration will lead to sustainable production in the future. since leaving swiss bank in 1998 he has undertaken consultancy projects for international banks and investment management companies. colin joined highland gold’s board of directors in september 2013. john mann studied political science at harvard university with a focus on soviet history and politics. she joined the highland gold board of directors in january 2008. t erry robinson is a qualified chartered accountant and has 40 years’ international business experience. • the company anticipates total dividend payout for each financial year will be 20% of net cash flow from operating activities. we engaged ey valuation specialists where appropriate to ensure certain specific assumptions applied in the impairment model are reasonable. we consider management’s estimates to be reasonable for the current year with assumptions within an acceptable range. we have tested the quality of management forecasting by comparing cash flow forecasts for prior periods to actual outcomes. audit procedures were performed on the three full scope components by our component teams in russia. 2. basis of preparation the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss and assets and liabilities acquired in business combination that have been measured at fair value. property, plant and equipment acquired through business combinations are stated at their acquisition date fair values on initial recognition. similarly, overhaul costs associated with major maintenance are capitalised and depreciated over their useful lives where it is probable that future economic benefits will be available and any remaining carrying amounts of the cost of previous overhauls are derecognised. where parts of an asset have different useful lives, depreciation is calculated on each separate part. these assets are depreciated upon their transfer to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment. fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in note 29. fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. when financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. the provision is reviewed on a semi-annual basis for changes in cost estimates or lives of operations. instead, the receivables will be accounted for as one instrument and measured at fair value through profit or loss with subsequent changes in fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income each period until final settlement and presented as part of ‘revenue’. the group has neither longer-term receivables, contract assets nor debt securities which can be significantly impacted by ecl requirements. as a result of this analysis, the key issues were identified and are set out below. these are based on the group’s current interpretation of ifrs 15 and may be subject to change as interpretations evolve further. the cash flows are based on estimates of expected future production, metal selling prices, operating costs, capital expenditure and post-tax discount rates. please refer to note 17 for further details on the significant judgements and estimations made when preparing impairment tests of non-current assets, including post-tax discount rates. assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available. transfer prices between operating segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) highland gold
