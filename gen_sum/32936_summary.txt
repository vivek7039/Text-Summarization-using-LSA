Mnogovershinnoye (MNV) – New JORC-compliant reserve estimate at MNV doubled ore reserves and supported the extension of life-of-mine by four years to at least 2022, with initial results from the ongoing near-mine exploration programme indicating resources for additional years of operation. Mining at Belaya Gora continued to focus on processing low-grade ore stockpiles pending the completion of an ongoing project review. MNV – To continue extensive near-mine exploration programme and publish an updated JORC-compliant reserve estimate in Q3 2018. ** 2016 net cash inflow from operations was amended for US$3.1 million reclassified to the investing activities.

Operating Mine Development Project Pre-development Project Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 6 Strategic Report Chairman’s Statement Eugene Shvidler “Unlocking the Value of a World Class Resource Base…” Dear Shareholder, It gives me much pleasure to report that Highland Gold Mining’s 15th year as a public company – Anniversary: 23rd May 2017 – marked a period of steady progress on all our strategic fronts. Before I chronicle such progress, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, after 15 years as a publicly quoted enterprise, some 63% of your Company’s shares are in ‘free float’ and our shareholder base includes a wide range of UK, European and US institutional investors. I utilise this phrase again because there can be few better descriptions of management’s primary objective which was furthered, throughout the year under review, by effective business strategies and carefully monitored disciplines. Consistent with our business strategy, your Company will continue to maximise the upside potential of our operating assets, namely: MNV (‘Life-of-mine’ extended), Novo (capacity being expanded to 1.3 Mtpa) and Belaya Gora (processing plant upgrades and combination with the Blagodatnoye deposit). As evidenced above and in the ensuing sections, 2017 has witnessed sound progress on numerous fronts. This JORC-compliant reserve estimation as at 31 December 2017 was accompanied by notification of a similarly compliant 6.6% increase in the Company’s mineral resources (measured, indicated and inferred) from 16.1 Moz of gold and gold equivalent to 17.2 Moz on a year-on-year basis. Work continued on the expansion of Novo’s ore mining and processing capacity from 700,000 tpa to 1.3 mtpa. In line with this a comprehensive survey of the hoist, headframe, crusher and main fan unit buildings was conducted. CHUKOTKA AUTONOMOUS DISTRICT, RUSSIA Kekura Work on the final sections of the Kekura Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS), including mine design, technical solutions, a financial model and estimates for capital and operating expenditures, was concluded during Q4 2017 prior to publication in early 2018. This, in turn, was accompanied by a JORC-compliant resource update which included data drawn from the 2016-17 drilling programme. All figures quoted as per oz of gold equivalent production without any by-product credits and refining charges. Depreciation amounted to US$49.5 million, down 17.8% y-o-y, largely reflecting the life-of-mine extensions at all operational assets. Total cash costs 2 (TCC) increased by 11.7% to US$507 per oz, comfortably below the industry average. oz, reflecting the negative currency effect and an increased share of mining from lower horizons. 2016 net cash inflow from operations was amended for US$3.1 million reclassified to the investing activities. The risk register defines a responsible body or individuals who are charged with monitoring, managing and mitigating these risks. The majority of costs are linked to US Dollars although a significant proportion is incurred in Russian roubles. The Group conducts detailed exploration and assesses results in accordance with widely recognised methods of resources/reserves evaluation. The Group initiates new projects, mine extensions, etc., based on detailed investment plans and a review of management resources. There can be no guarantee that current or prospective exploration will lead to sustainable production in the future. The Group’s operations in these jurisdictions are regulated by numerous laws, standards and guides.

Olga Pokrovskaya, Terry Robinson and Colin Belshaw, who retire by rotation, will offer themselves for re-election at the AGM to be held on 24 May 2018. We engaged EY valuation specialists where appropriate to ensure certain specific assumptions applied in the impairment model are reasonable. We consider management’s estimates to be reasonable for the current year with assumptions within an acceptable range. We have tested the quality of management forecasting by comparing cash flow forecasts for prior periods to actual outcomes. Audit procedures were performed on the three full scope components by our component teams in Russia. Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss and assets and liabilities acquired in business combination that have been measured at fair value. Property, plant and equipment acquired through business combinations are stated at their acquisition date fair values on initial recognition. Similarly, overhaul costs associated with major maintenance are capitalised and depreciated over their useful lives where it is probable that future economic benefits will be available and any remaining carrying amounts of the cost of previous overhauls are derecognised. • Buildings, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives. Where parts of an asset have different useful lives, depreciation is calculated on each separate part. These assets are depreciated upon their transfer to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment. When financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. The provision is reviewed on a semi-annual basis for changes in cost estimates or lives of operations. Adjustments for volumes (metal grades in concentrates) are based on the available actual test results. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted. Accordingly, the embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is recognised at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income each period until final settlement, and presented as part of ‘Revenue’. Instead, the receivables will be accounted for as one instrument and measured at fair value through profit or loss with subsequent changes in fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income each period until final settlement and presented as part of ‘Revenue’. The Group has neither longer-term receivables, contract assets nor debt securities which can be significantly impacted by ECL requirements. As a result of this analysis, the key issues were identified and are set out below. These are based on the Group’s current interpretation of IFRS 15 and may be subject to change as interpretations evolve further. The cash flows are based on estimates of expected future production, metal selling prices, operating costs, capital expenditure and post-tax discount rates. Please refer to Note 17 for further details on the significant judgements and estimations made when preparing impairment tests of non-current assets, including post-tax discount rates. Assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available. Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
