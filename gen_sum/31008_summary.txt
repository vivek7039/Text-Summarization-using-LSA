outcomes our remuneration framework is closely aligned with the financial performance of the group, which has been strong in 2017 as continued growth and robust investment markets helped funds under management reach £39.1 billion at 31 december 2017. this performance is reflected in the 17.6% growth in 2017 profit before tax to £58.9 million and an underlyi ng operating margin of 30.6%. consequently, these financial outc omes are directly reflected in the respective elements of the executive incentive plan (eip), which delivered above target performance in respect of three-year return on capital employed (roce) , annual profit before tax and underlying operating margin. a summary of the proposed changes to our policy is set out below, with further details presented on pages 86 and 87. the uk regulator has since confirmed that it does not expect smaller banks, including rathbones, to comply with this capping requirement. this is importan t, recognising that we are coming towards the end of our current five-year strategy planning period and require an incentive structure which can support any refinements of our strategy in 2019. we would consult with shareholders before making any changes to the weightings as they have been implemented for 2018. deferred awards are increased by notional adjustments for dividends paid until vesting, calculated using shares held

relation to recognition of client relationship intangibles the group has capitalised sign ificant amounts as client relationship intangibles, including both those purchased individually (initially recognised at cost) and those acquired as part of a business combinat ion (initially recognised at fair value). 108 rathbone brothers plc report and accounts 2017 rathbone brothers plc report and accounts 2017 109 the key judgement areas our audit concentrated on were: — the group makes contractual payments to its investment managers for introducing new client relationships. our results – we found the recognition and carrying value of client relationship intangibles to be acceptable. — methodology choice: we considered the group’s judgement in selecting its assumptions and whether there were any indicators of management bias. — comparing valuations: we obtained a breakdown of assets held in both defined benefit pension schemes. — methodology choice: we considered the group’s

solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the other information. under this classification, fair value gains and losses will be recognised in profit or loss. therefore, under ifrs 9, the group expects to classify all financial liabilities as amortised cost, with no material impact on measurement. 120 rathbone brothers plc report and accounts 2017 rathbones.com 121 the most significant impact is in respect of its london head office premises. commission charges for executing transactions on behalf of clients are recognised when the transaction is dealt. loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method (note 1.7), less any impairment. held to maturity investments are measur ed at amortised cost using the effective interest method (note 1.7), less any impairment. if an active market for a financial asset does not exist, the group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques. these include the use of recent arm’s length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants. impairment losses on available for sale equity instruments are not re versed through profit or loss, but those on available for sale debt instruments are reversed, if there is an increase in fair value that is objectively related to a subsequent event. comp uter software development costs recognised as assets are amortised using the straight line method over their useful lives (not exceeding four years). the group determines a suitable period during which awards accruing to new investment managers are capitalised. after the defined period has elapsed, any payments made are charged to profit or loss. 31 december 2017
