These costs were  partially offset by a plan amendment gain arising from the closure  of our defined benefit pension schemes. Outlook  The UK wealth management industry continues to evolve, driven  by client needs, regulation, demographics, technological  innovation and a changing competitive landscape. Notwithstanding some caution, which naturally emerges at a time  of high investment markets and political uncertainty, we enter  2018 well positioned to provide long-term value for shareholders. Outflows from intergenerational wealth transfer, property  purchases and other uses of funds to support lifestyle continue  unabated in this low interest rate environment. In addition, our specialist intermediary  team continues to focus on a number of important strategic  partnerships, and is now well established. We also recognise that the risk profile  associated with outsourced activities can change over time and   this will be an area of continued focus in 2018. Although the business is almost wholly UK-situated, it does not  suffer from any material client, geographical or counterparty  concentrations. Premises related capital expenditure fell by £7.8 million, primarily  due to the fit out of our new London Head Office, which was  largely completed in 2016. As announced on 31 August 2017, we incurred professional  services costs of £4.9 million in relation to the me rger discussions  with Smith & Williamson. Deferred  tax balances have therefore been calculated based on these  reduced rates where timing differ ences are forecast to unwind   in future years. The IA pointed  specifically to substantial growth of inflows into ethical funds,   with sustainable investment becomi ng an “increasing priority for  today’s investors”. Concentration risk  Greater loss volatility arising from a higher level of loan default  correlation than is assumed by the Pillar 1 assessment. We keep these issues under constant review to ensure that any  necessary capital raising activities are carried out in a planned and  controlled manner. Treasury assets  As a licensed deposit taker, Rathbone Investment Management  holds our surplus liquidity on its balance sheet together with  clients’ cash. With effect  from 30 June 2017, we closed both schemes, ceasing all future  benefit accrual and breaking the link to salary. Implementing effective stewardship is integral to our  investment process as a means of protecting and enhancing value  for clients. Case study – Smith & Nephe w  Our major issues with variable pay come when the experience  of management and shareholders becomes misaligned. However, most companies equip their  remuneration committees with discretion to make awards  even where performance conditions have not been met. A leadership framework has  been developed that we inte nd to incorporate into our  management training and promotion processes in 2018. Historically, women have been less well represented in the  investment management industry and addressing this imbalance  is a key priority. Performance and reward  We offer a comprehensive remuneration package which is  regularly reviewed to ensure that our employees are fairly  rewarded. We provide a wide range of core benefits such as private medical  cover, income protection insurance and life assurance. Furthermore,   our emissions intensity has also reduced by over 20% following  continued growth in both headco unt and funds under management. Our travel emissions rose largely due to a 17% increase in  headcount and increased use of employee-owned cars for  business purposes.

Fu rthermore, it enables Rathbones to reduce enviro nmental impacts through the provision of 160 cyc le spaces,  photovoltaics, and a green roof grey water recycling system.

The risk – accounting application in relation to recognition of client  relationship intangibles  The group has capitalised sign ificant amounts as client  relationship intangibles, including both those purchased  individually (initially recognised at cost) and those acquired as part  of a business combinat ion (initially recognised at fair value). — Methodology choice: we considered the group’s judgement in  selecting its assumptions and whether there were any  indicators of management bias. — Methodology choice: we considered the group’s judgement in  selecting its assumptions and whether there were any  indicators of management bias. Therefore,  under IFRS 9, the group expects to classify all financial liabilities as  amortised cost, with no material impact on measurement. 120 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017   rathbones.com 121  The most significant impact is in respect of its London head office  premises. Held to  maturity investments are measur ed at amortised cost using  the effective interest method (note 1.7), less any impairment. If an active market for a financial  asset does not exist, the group establishes fair value by using  valuation techniques. These include the use of recent arm’s   length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing  models and other valuation techniques commonly used by  market participants. Comp uter software development costs  recognised as assets are amortised using the straight line method  over their useful lives (not exceeding four years). Any subsequent diff erences  between these estimates and the actual amounts paid are recorded as adjustments in respect of prior years. Fair value has been calculated as th e discounted  amount of estimated future cash flows expected to be received us ing current market rates. Fair value has been cal culated as the  discounted amount of estimated future cash flows expected to be received using curren t market rates. Fair value has been calculated as the discounted  amount of estimated future cash flows expect ed to be paid using current market rates. 140 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017   rathbones.com 141  23 Due to customers     2017  £’000  2016 £’000  Repayable:      — on demand 2,081,788  1,768,215  — 3 months or less excluding on demand 83,425  119,438  — 1 year or less but over 3 months 5,285  1,242    2,170,498  1,888,895  Amounts include balances with:      — variable interest rates 2,060,565  1,751,483  — fixed interest rates 83,908  115,148  — non-interest-bearing 26,025  22,264    2,170,498  1,888,895  The fair value of amounts due to customers was not materially different from their carrying value.

The group also has exposu re to credit risk through its client loan book and guarantees given on  clients’ behalf. Impairment provisions for credit risk, which relate solely to trust and financial planning debtors, are set out in note 16.

A prudent level of highly liquid  assets is retained to cover reasonably foreseeable short term ch anges in client deposits.

Money market funds are demand securities and changes to estim ates of  interest rates will not affect their fair value.
