Inflation rose sharply during the first half of 2017 and wage growth has been sluggish, squeezing household spending power. • Local Authority land release – unlocking large housing sites • Government’s Housing White Paper – plans for ‘presumption that brownfield land is suitable for development’, higher densities in urban locations with good transport links, better local plans, help for public sector landowners with remediation and infrastructure costs, larger Local Authority planning teams, removing unnecessary planning conditions, address skills shortage, reduce time taken for s106 and CIL agreements, encourage modern construction methods, Help to Buy to continue until at least 2021, £7bn affordable homes programme to build 225,000 affordable homes in this parliament.

Through identifying opportunities, selecting acquisitions, securing planning permission and purchasing strategic sites with future potential, Inland is able to expand its land portfolio. We sell some of our sites to Housing Associations and institutional landlords, with a construction contract for Inland Homes. • Working with Local Authorities and communities to maximise the potential value of each site by securing a valuable planning permission. Homeowners: • Part or all of the site can be developed by Inland Homes; we are proud of the developments we plan and design, and are always looking to create an environment that is attractive for future residents. In contrast to a traditional self delivered site, these partnerships provide Inland Homes with earlier revenue, profit and cash flow that also reduces the Group’s borrowing requirements. A planning application has recently been submitted for the wider redevelopment and prior to lodging this Inland Homes undertook a lengthy and extremely detailed consultation exercise to ensure that the requirements of numerous local stakeholders were met. Inland Homes has received significant support from the Local Authority to develop on this brownfield site. The client pays monthly valuations for work completed which enables early recognition of revenue and profit.

With these in mind, it gives me great pleasure to report on another set of robust results for Inland Homes, demonstrating strong profitability during the year ended 30 June 2017 and a further improvement in both stated and EPRA net asset value at the year end. The current status of the land portfolio is as follows: Plots without planning consent Plots with planning consent or resolution to grant planning consent Total plots Owned under construction – 294 294 Owned or contracted 493 1,700 2,193 Managed or held within joint ventures under construction – 43 43 Managed or held within joint ventures 1,266 100 1,366 Joint ventures terms agreed 570 – 570 Terms agreed 200 – 200 Strategic land terms agreed 2,270 – 2,270 TOTAL PLOTS 4,799 2,137 6,936 This last financial year was an exceptional period that demonstrated the full capabilities of the business to deliver planning approvals on a considerable number of sites and across a wide range of diverse projects types with varying levels of complexity associated with them. In addition, the site generates approximately £0.5 million per annum from letting other space for storage and film production. Beaumont Works, St Albans When Inland Homes acquired this Grade II Listed Building it was severely run down and in need of refurbishment. Planning permission for 58 apartments and 8,000 sq ft of commercial space was received with some accolade from the local Council. This process has resulted in recruitment at both head office and site level and, as expected, this investment has brought about a planned increase in overheads, with staff numbers having increased from 39 on 1 July 2016 to 74 at the year end. This figure excludes two land sales which have been shown as a gain on sale of subsidiary or joint venture, rather than flowing through revenue and gross margin. Our associate company, Troy Homes Limited, is in its second operating year and, as expected, further losses were incurred during the start-up phase.

Our development activities are financed using a £20.0 million committed revolving credit facility expiring in the Autumn of 2019 and land purchases have the benefit of a £25.0 million committed revolving credit facility expiring in over three years. We have also procured a £43.3 million term facility secured against the existing residential units and land at our site in Wilton Park, Beaconsfield. At Inland, we support a number of charities and community organisations, including: BIBIC Inland are supporters of The British Institute of Brain Injured Children (BIBIC) who are a national charity offering practical help to families caring for children with conditions like autism, Asperger’s, cerebral palsy, Down’s syndrome, developmental delay, brain injury, and specific learning difficulties like ADHD, dyslexia and dyspraxia. This charity tries to make wishes of children and young people fighting life-threatening, sometimes terminal illnesses, come true. The relationships between Inland Homes and our subcontractors are based on partnerships as opposed to a one sided arrangement. We are trying to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions through a number of initiatives, such as having eco-friendly site accommodation and ensuring that we are always using electricity from the main grid supply, rather than using a generator. We are facing this challenge through investing in elements such as a staff intranet to ensure that no-one feels isolated whilst working at Inland Homes. Along with hiring new talent, we are dedicated to developing the skills of our existing employees. The experience I have gained since working at Inland Homes has been amazing, having received responsibility and ownership of projects early on in my career. The Group’s auditor provides some non-audit services, but these are not considered to threaten their independence. The Remuneration Committee has access to information provided by the three Executive Directors of Inland Homes, namely Stephen Wicks, Chief Executive, Nishith Malde, Group Finance Director and Paul Brett, Land Director and independent advice from external consultants, where it considers this to be appropriate. The Remuneration Committee meets formally three times a year and on such other occasions as may be required. * Further information can be found in note 29 to the accounts INLAND HOMES ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 56 Stock code: INL 25624.01 – 11 October 2017 4:25 PM – Proof 2 Directors’ remuneration table (audited) The remuneration of each of the Directors during the year ended 30 June 2017 is set out in detail below: 2017 2016 Salary/ fees £000 Bonus £000 Benefits £000 Pension £000 T otal remuneration £000 Social security costs £000 T otal remuneration & social security £000 Total £000 Executive Directors S D Wicks* 348 131 29 – 508 83 591 560 N Malde* 348 131 26 – 505 84 589 556 P Brett 197 91 12 20 320 51 371 344 Non-executive Directors T Roydon 55 – – – 55 – 55 55 S Bennett 45 – – – 45 – 45 45 * S Wicks and N Malde have taken their pension entitlement as part of their salaries.

Each year the Group reassesses its judgements in relation to accounting policies which it has adopted. Given the Group’s pipeline such contracts may form a greater proportion of total revenue in future years. Temporary differences include those associated with shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures unless reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. All equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the Group Income Statement with a corresponding credit to retained earnings. Loans and receivables are measured subsequent to initial recognition at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. The Group uses its judgement to select a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing. Therefore this entity has been classified as a joint venture and is accounted for using the equity method.
