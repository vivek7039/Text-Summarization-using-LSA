selecting acquisitions, securing planning permission and purchasing strategic sites with future potential, inland is able to expand its land portfolio. we sell some of our sites to housing associations and institutional landlords, with a construction contract for inland homes. • working with local authorities and communities to maximise the potential value of each site by securing a valuable planning permission. in contrast to a traditional self delivered site, these partnerships provide inland homes with earlier revenue, profit and cash flow that also reduces the group’s borrowing requirements. all of these purchases are funded by our careful financial strategy, which balances loan finance, joint venture funding and equity released from operations. • investment in staff to increase the level of construction expertise within the group • we have 427 residential units under construction across 12 sites (including 43 within a joint venture) our speculative and partnership housing developments are expected to increase in number • total residential units sold 4 maintain borrowings at a manageable level through a strong focus on cash management and vendor
