Sumo Group plc Annual Report 2017 07 DRIVING INNOVATION CREA TING GAMING EXPERIENCES STAYING AHEAD From a visual standpoint, this vibrant platforming romp is basically what would happen if Pixar were given free aesthetic reign over a digital wildlife simulator . Y ou will see from the rest of this Annual Report how those objectives have been achieved or are being advanced. Sumo Group plc’s flotation also enabled private equity investor, Perwyn, to realise some of its investment, while keeping a significant shareholding in the newly quoted business going forward. Carl Cavers Chief Executive Officer Introduction This is my first statement as CEO of Sumo Group plc and it gives me great pleasure to update our shareholders on what has been a momentous year for the Group. The business has grown consistently throughout its history and it is now one of Europe’s largest independent video games developers. Sumo Group is a people business offering premium video game development services to its clients. The year concluded with Sumo Group plc employing 489 people operating at five locations in three countries. We had an overwhelmingly positive response to the Placing and, on behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all our investors for their support and our advisers for helping us make this happen. Slither through long grass, coil around bamboo and climb out of trouble in the latest game from award winning independent studio Sumo Digital. Buoyed by its success, full production began when the team returned home to Sumo HQ. Acquisitions We are very pleased with Atomhawk, which performed strongly in the six months following its acquisition. This was a longstanding objective and an important milestone in the development of Sumo Group. Own intellectual property • Following the successful launch of Snake Pass, which has generated a return on investment in excess of 83% since launch, the Directors intend to continue to operate Group-wide Game Jams and selectively develop ‘Indie Games’. Gamers would also be less inclined to purchase new games at the end of one console’s life cycle. It was pleasing for Darren Mills, a co-founder of Sumo Digital, and me to feature in Games Industry.biz’s Top 100 Most Influential in 2017 and I was particularly gratified to receive an honorary doctorate from Sheffield Hallam University. Sheffield is a burgeoning tech hub in the UK and we take our local heritage very seriously. Sumo Digital directly benefited from this platform, being rewarded with a No.1 for Snake Pass on Nintendo Europe’s eShop. Another exciting platform for Sumo Digital is Esports, where we were part of the team that developed Forza Motorsport in 2017. These figures reflect continuing strong organic growth at Sumo Digital and the acquisition of Atomhawk on 29 June 2017. On 15 December 2017, the Group entered into a £13m revolving credit facilities agreement with Clydesdale Bank plc. There is, however, a risk to the Group that trends may reverse or continue at slower rates than expected. If current or future games were not able to benefit from VGTR, this could materially impact the Group’s financial performance. Complete protection cannot be guaranteed and an IT security breach could cause significant disruption to the Group’s operations. If the Group cannot successfully enforce its intellectual property rights or if a client’s intellectual property is damaged, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and prospects. Carl received TIGA ’s coveted Most Outstanding Individual Award in 2015 and he holds an honorary doctorate from Sheffield Hallam University. From 1999 to 2008, Michael was Group Finance Director of Games Workshop PLC, a FTSE listed consumer goods company. Michael is a qualified chartered accountant having trained with Price Waterhouse, where he held positions in the UK, Paris and Sydney. He was also Non-Executive Director of Plusnet plc, an AIM listed internet business, from 2004 to 2007. Karen McLoughlin (46) Group Director of HR Paul has over 25 years’ experience in developing video games. At Atomhawk, Ron is responsible for top line creative leadership, strategy and new business development. This is expected to include the use of prescribed questionnaires that are completed by all Directors. Our intention is to add these in future years once they become meaningful for shareholders. Payment is dependent on achieving profitable growth and strategic objectives that are essential to deliver the strategy. It is the Committee’s intention that any future service contracts will be subject to similar notice periods. Outstanding awards made under the L TIP would normally lapse on an Executive leaving employment. Further details on related party transactions with Directors are provided in note 25 of the Group financial statements. Legislation governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from one jurisdiction to another . These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. However, a key judgement is whether VGTCs constitute investment tax credits, which are not defined within IFRS yet are specifically excluded from the scope of IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ and IAS 20 ‘ Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance’. The Group was formed in December 2017, and therefore a comparison to prior year materiality is not relevant. The Company was incorporated in November 2017, and therefore a comparison to prior year materiality is not relevant. Paul Houghton Senior Statutory Auditor for and on behalf of Grant Thornton UK LLP Statutory Auditor, Chartered Accountants Sheffield 23 April 2018 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED to the members of Sumo Group plc Sumo Group plc Annual Report 2017 37 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT for the year ended 31 December 2017 4 month period ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2016 2017 Restated 2 Note £’000 £’000 Revenue 4 30,612 8,629 Direct costs (net) 6 (17,360) (5,011) Gross profit 13,252 3,618 Operating expenses (33,191) (3,350) Operating expenses – exceptional 7 (2,656) (599) Operating expenses – total (35,847) (3,949) Group operating loss (22,595) (331) Analysed as: Adjusted EBITDA 1 8,356 2,199 Amortisation 13 (27,626) (1,721) Depreciation 14 (669) (210) Exceptional items 7 (2,656) (599) Group operating loss (22,595) (331) Net finance costs 8 & 9 (5,378) (1,487) Loss before taxation (27,973) (1,818) Taxation 11 4,538 433 Loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders (23,435) (1,385) Loss per share (pence) Basic 12 (389.40) (13,205.57) Diluted 12 (389.40) (13,205.57) 1 Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as profit before finance costs, tax, depreciation, amortisation, and exceptional items, is a non-GAAP metric used by management and is not an IFRS disclosure. 2 As explained in note 28, the presentation of Video Game Tax Credit has been restated and is now presented within Direct costs (net) rather than operating expenses. All the shareholdings in Project Republica Topco Limited were exchanged via a share-for-share transfer on 13 December 2017. Where a contract is executed or where reasonable certainty exists that a contract will be executed for the provision of professional services, then revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion, if this can be reliably estimated. Depreciation is provided on the following basis: Leasehold improvements Over period of lease Fixtures and fittings 25% straight line Computer hardware 50% straight line It has been assumed that all assets will be used until the end of their economic life. Computer software purchased separately, that does not form an integral part of related hardware, is capitalised at cost. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. A provision for impairment is made where there is objective evidence (including clients with financial difficulties or in default on payments) that amounts will not be recovered in accordance with the original terms of the agreement. In accordance with treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Any gain or loss arising from derivative financial instruments is based on changes in fair value, which is determined by direct reference to active market transactions or using a valuation technique where no active market exists. At certain times the Group has foreign currency forward contracts that fall into this category. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis. All share-based remuneration is ultimately recognised as an expense in profit or loss with a corresponding credit to retained earnings. Any adjustment to cumulative share-based compensation resulting from a revision is recognised in the current period. These were based on a three-year forecast with growth rates of 9.7% to 36.1% applied for the following years. All amortisation charges have been treated as an expense and charged to operating expenses in the income statement. Amounts charged to the allowance account are generally written-off, when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash. Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history.
