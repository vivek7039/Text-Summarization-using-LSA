annual report 2017 20 financial review growing, profitable and cash-generative the group has had an excellent year, with revenue growth of 21.6% leading to higher growth in profit and cash. therefore, there was a more pronounced effect this year of the stronger us dollar and euro. all of these legal disputes have now been resolved, with no further cost to the group. therefore, the us dollar strengthening from $1.45 to $1.27 increased revenue but had little effect on gross profit. there have been no significant changes in payment terms relating to either customers or suppliers. this is the proportion of people who buy a focusrite product, register their purchase and have no need to call our technical helpline. the group will continue to monitor other possible effects of brexit and act accordingly as they become known. typically, members of the operations department within focusrite meet each supplier every quarter to review performance and costs. key resellers and distributors in certain countries, the group operates via a single distributor or has large individual reseller customers. the group is dependent for its continued success on being able to hire and retain such individuals. the group has carried out a detailed review of it systems to identify elements requiring upgrade. focusrite plc annual report 2017 26 corporate social responsibility ‘acting in a responsible and considerate way’ we have a duty to maintain the trust of the end-users of our products as well as our customers, suppliers, staff and other stakeholders by ensuring that we act with integrity at all times. focusrite visits its contract manufacturers once every three months to check on compliance issues, manufacturing control and general relationship management. relations with suppliers, partners and contractors whilst price will always play an important part in the commercial decision-making of focusrite in terms of suppliers, partners and contractors, it is by no means the only significant consideration. examples of this include a strategic partnership with kuehne + nagel, which provides inbound and outbound third- party logistics to focusrite. it achieves this by reviewing each shipment to determine the most efficient methods of transporting products, both inbound and outbound. focusrite forward plans the production and shipment of its products so that air freight is rarely required. relations with employees whilst focusrite has clear leadership and reporting structures in place, it enjoys a flat hierarchy amongst its staff. however, it has been decided that all directors should be subject to annual election by shareholders. in each case, the audit committee concluded that there was an appropriate management of risk and financial judgement made. the audit committee meets formally not less than three times every year and otherwise as required. it is furthermore responsible for determining the total individual remuneration packages of each director including, where appropriate, bonuses, incentive payments and share options. in addition, a formal policy for audit and non-audit services has been agreed by the audit committee, ensuring that there is appropriate high level authorisation before the auditor is engaged in providing a material non-audit service. no shareholder holds securities carrying any special rights or control over the company’s share capital. directors’ remuneration report focusrite plc annual report 2017 38 base salary base salaries for the executive directors are reviewed annually and determined taking account of

for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. on derecognition, however, where a specific transaction is entered into with a counterparty that is judged to carry a high credit or liquidity risk, then management may determine that derecognition of the financial asset shall be based on settlement date rather than trade date, with any realised gain or loss taken to profit and loss on date of settlement. income is recognised on an
