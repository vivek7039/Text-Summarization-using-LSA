Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 08 Chief Executive’s Statement A refined growth strategy This is my first full year report, having joined the Company in January 2017, and I am delighted to update shareholders on another year of operational and financial success. We sold approximately 800,000 physical products to end-users last year, and our music creation apps were downloaded 2.7 million times with around 700,000 in-app customer transactions. These results were materially ahead of forecasts and represent a very pleasing outcome for the Group. Sales of our second generation Scarlett USB audio interface range, upgraded and launched in June last year, were particularly strong. We believe that our portfolio of professional AOIP solutions are well poised to become industry standards in post-production, broadcast, installed and live sound. Wider market acceptance of grid-based controllers in the electronic music space, coupled with larger penetration from online distribution channels such as Amazon, has driven demand for Launchpad. This product range experienced significant worldwide uplift in demand with year-on- year sales volume growth of 39.0%.

Their suite of freemium apps allows new music makers to create songs in minutes, even with no prior experience. They are an irreplaceable part of my powerhouse.” Keith Harris Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 20 Financial Review Growing, profitable and cash-generative The Group has had an excellent year, with revenue growth of 21.6% leading to higher growth in profit and cash. Therefore, there was a more pronounced effect this year of the stronger US Dollar and Euro. All of these legal disputes have now been resolved, with no further cost to the Group. Therefore, the US Dollar strengthening from $1.45 to $1.27 increased revenue but had little effect on gross profit. This is the proportion of people who buy a Focusrite product, register their purchase and have no need to call our technical helpline. The Group will continue to monitor other possible effects of Brexit and act accordingly as they become known. Typically, members of the operations department within Focusrite meet each supplier every quarter to review performance and costs. Key resellers and distributors In certain countries, the Group operates via a single distributor or has large individual reseller customers. The Group is dependent for its continued success on being able to hire and retain such individuals. The Group has carried out a detailed review of IT systems to identify elements requiring upgrade. Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 26 Corporate Social Responsibility ‘Acting in a responsible and considerate way’ We have a duty to maintain the trust of the end-users of our products as well as our customers, suppliers, staff and other stakeholders by ensuring that we act with integrity at all times. Focusrite visits its contract manufacturers once every three months to check on compliance issues, manufacturing control and general relationship management. Relations with suppliers, partners and contractors Whilst price will always play an important part in the commercial decision-making of Focusrite in terms of suppliers, partners and contractors, it is by no means the only significant consideration. Examples of this include a strategic partnership with Kuehne + Nagel, which provides inbound and outbound third- party logistics to Focusrite. It achieves this by reviewing each shipment to determine the most efficient methods of transporting products, both inbound and outbound. Focusrite forward plans the production and shipment of its products so that air freight is rarely required. Relations with employees Whilst Focusrite has clear leadership and reporting structures in place, it enjoys a flat hierarchy amongst its staff. He brings with him more than 25 years’ experience as an investment banker, advising UK public companies across a range of sectors. He is also a Non-executive Director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee at Harvey Nash Group plc. However, it has been decided that all Directors should be subject to annual election by shareholders. In each case, the Audit Committee concluded that there was an appropriate management of risk and financial judgement made. The Audit Committee meets formally not less than three times every year and otherwise as required. It is furthermore responsible for determining the total individual remuneration packages of each Director including, where appropriate, bonuses, incentive payments and share options. No shareholder holds securities carrying any special rights or control over the Company’s share capital. Directors’ Remuneration Report Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 38 Base salary Base salaries for the Executive Directors are reviewed annually and determined taking account of individual performance, scope of responsibility, relative pay levels within the Group and reference to external market data as referred to above. 2 Dave Froker ceased to be an employee on 31 December 2016, at which point all options that had not vested lapsed. These financial statements were authorised for issue by the Company’s Board of Directors on 21 November 2017. CGUs to which goodwill has been attributed under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. On derecognition, however, where a specific transaction is entered into with a counterparty that is judged to carry a high credit or liquidity risk, then management may determine that derecognition of the financial asset shall be based on settlement date rather than trade date, with any realised gain or loss taken to profit and loss on date of settlement. Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments other than those financial assets classified as at FVTPL. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. These projects continue to progress in a satisfactory manner, and customer reaction has reconfirmed management’s previous estimates of anticipated revenues from the project. There has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. 29 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS Equity-settled share option schemes 1,947,659 options over Focusrite Plc’s shares were exercised during the year ended 31 August 2017 (2016: 1,181,498). For cash flow hedges the following table sets out the periods when the cash flows are expected to occur and when they are expected to affect profit or loss: 2017 Carrying amount £’000 Expected cash flow £’000 Within 1 year £’000 Between 1 and 5 years £’000 Over 5 years £’000 Forward exchange contracts Liabilities (484) (484) (484) – – Total (484) (484) (484) – – 2016 Carrying amount £’000 Expected cash flow £’000 Within 1 year £’000 Between 1 and 5 years £’000 Over 5 years £’000 Forward exchange contracts Liabilities (1,143) (1,143) (1,143) – – Total (1,143) (1,143) (1,143) – – Interest rate risk management The Group is not currently exposed to interest rate risk because it does not have any external borrowings. To counter this risk, the Group operates with a high level of cash and no bank debt. • The fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments. Under IAS 39, all derivative financial instruments not in a hedge relationship are classified as derivatives at fair value through the income statement. All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share‑ based payment are measured at their fair values. 2 BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 82 The Directors’ remuneration for the year: Salary/fees £’000 Other taxable benefits £’000 Annual bonus £’000 Pension contribution £’000 Total £’000 Executive Directors Tim Carroll (appointed 1 January 2017) FY16 – – – – – FY17 143 46 157 14 360 Dave Froker (resigned 31 December 2016) FY16 168 3 47 2 220 FY17 57 2 – 1 60 Jeremy Wilson FY16 168 2 38 1 209 FY17 172 2 215 22 411 Phil Dudderidge FY16 168 3 – – 171 FY17 171 4 – – 175 Non-executive Directors David Bezem FY16 36 – – – 36 FY17 36 – – – 36 Paul Dean FY16 36 – – – 36 FY17 36 – – – 36 4 STAFF COSTS Staff costs, including Directors’ remuneration, were as follows: 2017 £’000 2016 £’000 Wages and salaries 1,068 714 Social security costs 144 84 Other pension costs 38 99 1,250 897 The average monthly number of employees, including the Directors, during the year was as follows: 2017 Number 2016 Number Management and administration 7 7 5 DIVIDENDS The following equity dividends have been declared: 2017 2016 Dividend per qualifying ordinary share 2.70p 1.95p 6 INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES 2017 £’000 2016 £’000 At 1 September 14,647 14,647 At 31 August 14,647 14,647 The investments in subsidiaries comprise: Name Country of registration or incorporation Principal activity Class of shares 2017 % 2016 % Focusrite Audio Engineering Limited England and Wales Manufacture and distribution Ordinary 100 100 Focusrite Novation Inc 1 USA Marketing services Ordinary 100 100 Focusrite Novation Asia Limited 1 Hong Kong Marketing services Ordinary 100 100 1 Owned indirectly through FAEL.
