A particular focus is improving performance efficiency at Kirkby, where we successfully consolidated all our butters and spreads production onto one site in 2015. Our industry leading margins are the result of us driving long- term value through innovation, brand building, investment in a world class supply chain and strong cost control. Developing our sales of demineralised whey and GOS into the high-margin global infant formula market will be a key priority this year. This is management’s key Group profit measure because it excludes exceptional items and therefore gives a better indication of underlying performance. r isk management process: Each key function in the Group is required to prepare a risk register for its area of accountability. Restricted milk supply could be caused by economic factors, weather, fuel availability or an epidemic which affects dairy cows. Our milk comes directly from farms on contracts that include a notice period of between three months and one year. mitigating controls Our procurement team regularly monitors suppliers’ ability to supply and puts in place alternative arrangements, including dual purchasing, if appropriate. Our contractual relationship with Fonterra, who sell the infant formula ingredients we produce, allows us to utilise its experience in this field. Our world-class supply chain starts with milk collected from around 360 farmers in the dairy heartlands of Cornwall and Devon. The cheese then matures for around a year at our purpose-built Nuneaton facility before being cut, packed and distributed. During the year it was successfully re-launched with a new packaging design, which emphasises Frylight’s ‘no artificial ingredients’ credentials. This follows on from the launch of a coconut variant last year, which has already become our third biggest selling line.

All our butter and spreads manufacturing has been consolidated on one site at Kirkby for the last two years. A wide range of projects included investment in low energy lighting, heat recovery from air compressors and efficient refrigeration systems. Our investment in detailed metering of demand patterns will help us further to optimise energy use for these new processes.

With regard to efficiency projects, considerable progress has been made in defining a revised IT strategy which will deliver cost savings and improved ways of working. With regard to energy usage, this improved and better than target performance was achieved as did carbon emissions which were 13% below last year’s level.
