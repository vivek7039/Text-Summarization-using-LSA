driving long- term value through innovation, brand building, investment in a world class supply chain and strong cost control. developing our sales of demineralised whey and gos into the high-margin global infant formula market will be a key priority this year. this is management’s key group profit measure because it excludes exceptional items and therefore gives a better indication of underlying performance. r isk management process: each key function in the group is required to prepare a risk register for its area of accountability. our milk comes directly from farms on contracts that include a notice period of between three months and one year. mitigating controls our procurement team regularly monitors suppliers’ ability to supply and puts in place alternative arrangements, including dual purchasing, if appropriate. our contractual relationship with fonterra, who sell the infant formula ingredients we produce, allows us to utilise its experience in this field. during the year it was successfully re-launched with a new packaging design, which emphasises frylight’s ‘no artificial ingredients’ credentials. the simplified supply chain, combined with improvements in brand performance, will enable continued investment into this high-margin category and underpin on-going cash generation. all our butter and spreads manufacturing has been consolidated on one site at kirkby for the last two years. a wide range of projects included investment in low energy lighting, heat recovery from air compressors and efficient refrigeration systems. our investment in detailed metering of demand patterns will help us further to optimise energy use for these new processes. we support this in three ways: • all employees have the opportunity to be part of a bonus or incentive scheme which is linked to either personal, site and/or company performance; • dairy crest runs share save schemes whereby employees can invest in dairy crest and take a real ownership role. colleagues through our refreshed corporate responsibility pledges, dairy crest employees have a volunteering day each year to help support local causes. we also know that people are at their most productive when they can achieve an appropriate balance between work and home life. we produce demineralised whey, which forms the base of infant formula, and gos, a lactose based prebiotic that has been shown to help aid digestive health in infants. supporting rural communities dairy crest recognises that the countryside continues to face significant challenges across a wide range of complex social and economic issues. accordingly, although the group’s systems are designed to manage risks they cannot provide absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 8. litigation liability there are a number of contractual disputes in relation to the demineralised whey and gos capital project at davidstow. furthermore, before it may be engaged for the provision of such non-audit services, alternative providers must have been considered and discounted. in addition to me as chairman, the committee comprises richard macdonald, mark allen, tom atherton, robin miller, robert willock, adam braithwaite and simon hewitt (group technical director). our innovation is beginning to generate new business opportunities by selling demineralised whey and gos into growing infant formula markets globally. as set out in last year’s report, our annual bonus has been assessed against three metrics; profit before tax, free cashflow and personal objectives. to deliver an appropriate balance between long-term and short-term reward, any bonus earned over 50% of annual salary is deferred into shares (see below). metrics used to determine performance under the bonus will be based on a mix of financial, operational and personal measures. all employees have the opportunity to participate in a pension arrangement at levels of employer contribution which vary by grade. in addition, salary benchmark information for companies of comparable size and complexity within the ftse250 (excluding financial services) is taken into consideration. any bonus over 50% of salary is deferred into shares for three years as set out in the remuneration policy table. n o allowance is made for share price growth and/or dividends and/or dividend equivalents paid, in accordance with the requirements of rules governing disclosure. this is key in establishing sales to infant formula manufacturers who require exacting high standards t alent development mark has overseen formal development planning for both tom atherton and adam braithwaite and led a full development/succession plan for business critical roles shareholder/customer engagement mark has maintained excellent links with all major customers, meeting senior contacts throughout the year. the remuneration committee felt that corporate responsibility performance had generally been better than target and a payout of 4% was agreed. mark’s leadership of this work and the principles he established on which it was built, were integral to its success. with regard to efficiency projects, considerable progress has been made in defining a revised it strategy which will deliver cost savings and improved ways of working. with regard to energy usage, this improved and better than target performance was achieved as did carbon emissions which were 13% below last year’s level. this is based on an agreed fee for business as usual support with additional work charged at hourly rates. the chief executive attends all meetings by invitation, but is not present at any discussions relating specifically to his own remuneration. anup sodhi ( se nior sta t u t or y audit or ) f or a nd on be half o f er nst & y oung llp , sta t u t
