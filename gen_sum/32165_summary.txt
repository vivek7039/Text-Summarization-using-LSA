results which demonstrate the underlying robustness of our business. both of these products are being marketed and sold into global infant formula manufacturers by our partner, fonterra. we also continue to research other potential applications for gos in both human nutrition and animal feed. if successful, this work would help to broaden the potential market for gos beyond infant formula. from this foundation we will grow through a shared passion to create exceptional food, loved by every generation. we are a much leaner, more focused organisation that makes predominantly branded and high value-added products. this will help us to maintain our strong track record of rewarding shareholders with higher dividends. earlier in the year we successfully rolled out a refreshed master brand identity for cathedral city. it was supported by significant investment including a successful new tv advertisement, ‘the rules of cheese’. a particular focus is improving performance efficiency at kirkby, where we successfully consolidated all our butters and spreads production onto one site in 2015. we are confident that all our sites will contribute towards further improved productivity over the year to 31 march 2018. future prospects in the first full year since the transformational sale of our dairies business, we have delivered a robust performance in a tough market. our industry leading margins are the result of us driving long- term value through innovation, brand building, investment in a world class supply chain and strong cost control. developing our sales of demineralised whey and gos into the high-margin global infant formula market will be a key priority this year. at the same time we are continuing our research into other potential animal and human applications for gos. the principal elements of spend were duplicate running costs, stock write-offs, commissioning expenses and project management. this is management’s key group profit measure because it excludes exceptional items and therefore gives a better indication of underlying performance. r isk management process: each key function in the group is required to prepare a risk register for its area of accountability. mitigating controls consumers are at the heart of our business and we regularly monitor consumer trends. restricted milk supply could be caused by economic factors, weather, fuel availability or an epidemic which affects dairy cows. our milk comes directly from farms on contracts that include a notice period of between three months and one year. mitigating controls our procurement team regularly monitors suppliers’ ability to supply and puts in place alternative arrangements, including dual purchasing, if appropriate. disruption to production r isk area and potential impact an accident, a fire, product contamination, the failure of equipment or systems, a deliberate malicious act, or industrial action could disrupt production, affect food safety, cause injury, and/or cause reputational damage with adverse consequences. mitigating controls we have well-established supply chains and a close working relationship with our milk suppliers. our contractual relationship with fonterra, who sell the infant formula ingredients we produce, allows us to utilise its experience in this field. we have a short milk supply chain with good traceability and strict controls to ensure quality. there is a risk of fines or lawsuits and reputational damage if we fail to comply. our world-class supply chain starts with milk collected from around 360 farmers in the dairy heartlands of cornwall and devon. this top quality milk is made into cheddar cheese at our highly-automated creamery in davidstow, cornwall. the cheese then matures for around a year at our purpose-built nuneaton facility before being cut, packed and distributed. we have a second packing site in frome, somerset, for more complex and innovative packaging. in order to maintain the brand’s premium positioning within £ million 2016/17 2015/16 revenue 254.8 263.7 product group profit 42.8 36.4 margin (%) 16.8 13.8 others 46% 54% dairy crest share of retail branded everyday cheese source: iri 52 weeks ended 25 march 2017 performance the category we decided not to discount too aggressively. however volumes improved in the second half and we expect this performance to continue during 2017/18. it was supported by significant investment including a successful new tv advertisement, ‘the rules of cheese’. these added value products give dairy crest access to new sales channels in fast growing global markets. cheese & functional ingredients dairy crest annual report 2017 19 strategic report cathedral city is the uk’s 18th largest grocery brand, bigger than all other competitor cheddar brands combined and accounts for 54% of all branded everyday cheese sold by uk retailers. partly as a result butter volumes fell by 5% in the final quarter and spreads volume decline slowed to 5%. dairy crest gaining share clover is well placed to meet consumer needs within the changing market. during the year it was successfully re-launched with a new packaging design, which emphasises frylight’s ‘no artificial ingredients’ credentials. the simplified supply chain, combined with improvements in brand performance, will enable continued investment into this high-margin category and underpin on-going cash generation. all our butter and spreads manufacturing has been consolidated on one site at kirkby for the last two years. road fuel used in company cars operated by dairy crest for business travel is also included. this measure is consistent with our internal target setting process and how we communicate relative performance. our extensive research programmes continue, including the exciting area of animal health benefits from functional ingredients such as gos. these standards are designed to reflect best practice on farm and ensure the highest quality of milk supply. a wide range of projects included investment in low energy lighting, heat recovery from air compressors and efficient refrigeration systems. our investment in detailed metering of demand patterns will help us further to optimise energy use for these new processes. from this, we will grow through a shared passion to create exceptional food, loved by every generation. to build on this programme in 2016 we introduced the star safe system of work (‘ssow’) conversations, where front line managers initiate a conversation with a work colleague, based on the recognised safe system of working. an employee roadshow, presented by members of the executive committee, visited all dairy crest sites and offices. the roadshows were very well received by employees with structured feedback reporting high levels of engagement. we support this in three ways: • all employees have the opportunity to be part of a bonus or incentive scheme which is linked to either personal, site and/or company performance; • dairy crest runs share save schemes whereby employees can invest in dairy crest and take a real ownership role. bronze and silver awards, that attract a monetary benefit, recognise excellent behaviour in line with our values. colleagues through our refreshed corporate responsibility pledges, dairy crest employees have a volunteering day each year to help support local causes. this new platform allows dairy crest to drive blended and dynamic learning initiatives across the business. although some turnover of staff is positive in refreshing our skill base, the current level is higher than desired and dairy crest will be looking to the employee survey, undertaken in april 2017, to help identify any areas where we can improve on this key metric. we also know that people are at their most productive when they can achieve an appropriate balance between work and home life. our lower fat spreads – clover light, utterly butterly lightly and country life lighter spreadable – have a collective retail sales value of £20.0 million, and sales of our ‘no artificial ingredients’ clover have been strong, out-performing the spreads market. we produce demineralised whey, which forms the base of infant formula, and gos, a lactose based prebiotic that has been shown to help aid digestive health in infants. sustainable, ethical sourcing dairy crest works with its suppliers to exceed best practice around areas including quality and traceability. supporting rural communities dairy crest recognises that the countryside continues to face significant challenges across a wide range of complex social and economic issues. dairy crest donated £50,000 to the fund in 2016/17 through brand partnerships with davidstow cheddar and country life butter. dairy crest staff voluntarily deliver healthy, fresh food to vulnerable people in our local communities through meals on wheels. we also support release time for staff to volunteer with the fire service and other services. we host visits to our sites for local schools, the women’s institute and young farmer groups. richard had a 30 year career with the national farmers union, serving as director general for 13 years. i believe that the board is well balanced with a broad range of skills, diversity and experience. this year the board and its committees carried out an effectiveness review without external assistance. evaluation questions for the board were grouped into four key areas; strategy, structure & process, people & composition, and stakeholders. as at april 2017 the directors all confirmed that they had no present or anticipated conflicts of interest. shareholder engagement: the company recognises its responsibility for ensuring that a satisfactory dialogue takes place with shareholders. accordingly, although the group’s systems are designed to manage risks they cannot provide absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. bring together all section owners to agree that whole annual report and accounts (‘ara’) is fbu. 8. litigation liability there are a number of contractual disputes in relation to the demineralised whey and gos capital project at davidstow. 9. o perating segments management has judged that the group operates as one segment under international financial reporting standards. furthermore, before it may be engaged for the provision of such non-audit services, alternative providers must have been considered and discounted. they have been asked to prepare a long list of candidates with international experience in either fmcg and/or ingredients businesses. having previously adopted the language of business in the community’s corporate responsibility structure, we felt that our corporate responsibility programme was sufficiently established to allow us to move away from slavishly aping that structure. in addition to me as chairman, the committee comprises richard macdonald, mark allen, tom atherton, robin miller, robert willock, adam braithwaite and simon hewitt (group technical director). we have delivered another good branded performance this year through investment in product innovation, promotional activity and advertising. our innovation is beginning to generate new business opportunities by selling demineralised whey and gos into growing infant formula markets globally. in light of this volatility, setting robust long-term financial earnings or cash targets which are appropriately stretching is extremely challenging, as price volatility can generate a boom or bust vesting outcome which is not within management’s control. as set out in last year’s report, our annual bonus has been assessed against three metrics; profit before tax, free cashflow and personal objectives. further details of the tia objectives and performance against these to date are set out in this report. all executive directors receive a company car/car allowance and private medical insurance, commensurate with market levels. to deliver an appropriate balance between long-term and short-term reward, any bonus earned over 50% of annual salary is deferred into shares (see below). metrics used to determine performance under the bonus will be based on a mix of financial, operational and personal measures. any bonus over 50% of annual salary is deferred for three years, conditional on continued employment until vesting date. metrics used to determine performance under the ltip will be based on a mix of financial and strategic measures. rationale for any changes further to extensive shareholder consultation where the future acceptability of the ltap was questioned and after subsequent consideration of a restricted stock plan, it has been decided to implement a traditional ltip. if performance falls below a minimum level against the scorecard no award will be made. achievements over the prior year against a pre-grant performance scorecard comprising measures aligned to dairy crest’s strategic priorities. all employees have the opportunity to participate in a pension arrangement at levels of employer contribution which vary by grade. in addition, salary benchmark information for companies of comparable size and complexity within the ftse250 (excluding financial services) is taken into consideration. any bonus over 50% of salary is deferred into shares for three years as set out in the remuneration policy table. any external appointment must not conflict with a director’s duties and commitments to dairy crest. t reatment of unvested deferred bonus awards under plan rules if termination is by way of death, injury, illness, disability, redundancy, retirement, or any other circumstances the committee determines, deferred bonus share awards may be released in full on termination. director value of package (£000s) m allen t a therton a braithwaite n otes to the scenarios: fixed: this element comprises salary as of 1 july 2017 (see page 59),

it was built, were integral to its success. 56 dairy crest annual report 2017 directors’ remuneration report continued shareholder dilution in accordance with the guidelines set by the investment association (‘ia’), the remuneration committee can satisfy awards under all its share plans with new issue shares or shares issued from treasury up to a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling 10 year period to employees under all its share plans. with regard to efficiency projects, considerable progress has been made in defining a revised it strategy which will deliver cost savings and improved ways of working. with regard to energy usage, this improved and better than target performance was achieved as did carbon emissions which were 13% below last year’s level. statement of

not present at any discussions relating specifically to his own remuneration. as highlighted in note 31, the company and group meet day-to-day working capital requirements through syndicated revolving credit facilities and cash to ensure that forecast net borrowings plus reasonable operating headroom are covered by committed facilities which mature at least 12 months after the year end. disclosure

information. no compensation for loss of office: the company does not have agreements with any director or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a
