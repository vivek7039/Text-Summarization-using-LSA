we are committed to building trusted, mutually beneficial relationships with our customers by concentrating on their financial needs and offering them well-suited banking solutions. tbc bank has strong coverage across the country through its well-developed multichannel network serving around 75% of georgia’s adult population. we achieved this by fostering a customer-focused culture, where every employee strives to create maximum comfort and value for our customers. at the same time, we will remain focused on operating efficiency and automation to become more agile in our fast-changing environment. we also launched the first georgian- speaking chatbot,ti bot, which allows customers to conduct simple banking transactions via facebook messenger . visa liberalisation would also have a positive impact on tourism, leading to increased awareness about georgia and greater tourist inflow from the eu. the programme aims to support start-ups not only financially, but also by providing non-financial services, including training sessions, master classes and special discounts with tbc bank’s partners. starting from 2018, a free-trade agreement with china has entered into force, which should give additional impetus to georgia’s growing exports. while its immediate neighbours still account for most incoming visitors, tourism inflows from the eu and middle east have been on an upward trend. at the same time, we continue to expand our network of self-service terminals, which offer both cash and cashless payment functionality. they strive to build lasting relationships with customers, becoming trusted partners who can always be relied on and are easily accessible. as our customers’ long-term well-being is of utmost importance to us, we carefully analyse their personal circumstances and goals before coming up with solutions. the main benefits are that customers can be verified quickly, enabling us to deal with a greater number of calls and reduce fraud through identity theft. we supported our robust growth by becoming the core bank for leading industry players such as coca-cola, mcdonald’s, nikora 2 , silknet 3 and nova 4 . with our financial assistance, it has significantly expanded its business and is now one of the leading players on georgia’s beverage market. • mcg’s clinic offers its customers a comprehensive range of services, including general practitioner, paediatrics, therapy, cardiology, rehabilitation, surgery, and world-class emergency aid. we are the sole bank in georgia offering a business support programme to our clients, including training, workshops and individual consultations. as such, borrowers are expected to withstand certain adverse economic developments through prudent financials, debt-servicing capabilities and conservative collateral coverage. the group has large individual exposures to single-name borrowers whose potential default would entail increased credit losses and high impairment charges. risk description the group’s loan portfolio is diversified, with maximum exposure to a single industry (ie energy and utility) standing at 8.4%. collateral on loans extended by the group may include, but is not limited to, real estate, cash deposits, vehicles, equipment, inventory, precious metals, securities and third-party guarantees. increasing the number of successful businesses in our country makes it stronger, increases its economic potential and fosters an attractive investment environment. early-stage businesses need financial assistance as well, but it is common for established banks to refrain from financing them because of the risks associated with start-ups. georgian ski resorts are becoming increasingly popular but need support to transform them into high-class destinations with proper infrastructure, thereby improving their reputations among tourists. since 2011, the bank has run tbc academy, an in-house educational centre available to all employees that offers numerous courses in banking and related fields. furthermore, in may 2017, we started a session of masterclasses for personal development, which were delivered by leading professionals who shared their knowledge and experience with our employees. these accessories were distributed to front-office employees as gifts and are also available for sale at our corporate online brand shop. the channel offers its viewers various culturally themed lectures, recommendations, entertainment programmes and live concerts, which are quite popular among all generations. no such material breaches of the bank’s environmental and social risk management policy were identified during 2017. we are also committed to promoting eco-friendly projects. in previous positions held before joining the group, mr chkonia consulted companies regarding risks, especially those associated with credit and capital market transactions. tbcg ftse 250 ftse all-share 10.0 10.9 11.8 12.7 13.6 14.5 15.4 16.3 17.2 18.1

taxable benefits as described in the single total figure table and notes at section 2.1 above. performance conditions are chosen to align our executive directors' interests with strategic objectives of the group over multi-year periods and encourage a long-term view. the remuneration committee will exercise its absolute discretion to determine whether such terms should be included in any new service contract. in addition, there were regular interim meetings via teleconference facilities, where members discussed a narrower agenda, mostly around planned releases of financial data. members are also in regular e-mail correspondence with each other on various matters relating to the audit committee’s work. whist this law will not come into effect for the banking sector until january 2019, it has a more immediate impact on deferred tax calculations. in our view, pwc continue to offer an independent, professional and cost-effective service that is capable of detecting any audit irregularities. we have, for example, started an initiative to ensure that all best practice policies are rolled out universally and ‘policed’ by internal audit accordingly. individual impairment assessment is performed where individually significant loans have unique characteristics that require judgement at a loan level to determine the present value of expected future cash flows and any resulting shortfall. separate statement of cash flows for the year ended 31 december 2017 166 tbc bank annual report and accounts 2017 consolidated statement of financial position in thousands of gel

initially recognised at their fair value, which is normally evidenced by the amount of fees received. the same principle is applied for wealth management, financial planning and custody services that are continuously provided over an extended period of time. when scheduling future cash flows the management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with similar credit risk characteristics. when the consideration varies for any reason, minimum amounts must be recognised if they are not at significant risk of reversal. as a consequence, it was difficult for investors to compare and contrast the financial performance of otherwise similar insurance companies. at the central level a specific unit manages collateral to ensure that they serve as an adequate mitigation for credit risk management purposes. during 2015 the group reclassified investment securities available for sale to bonds carried at amortised cost with carrying amount of gel 372,063 thousand. provisions for liabilities, charges, performance guarantees and credit related commitments are primarily expected to be utilised within twelve months after the year-end. as of 31 december 2017 the analysis by
