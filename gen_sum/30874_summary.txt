have developed and introduced the first georgian-speaking chatbot, ti bot, using facebook messenger. we achieved this by fostering a customer-focused culture, where every employee strives to create maximum comfort and value for our customers. we aspire to foster the best working environment for our employees and build long-term relationships with our partners, as well as make a positive contribution to society by supporting business, culture, sports and the young generation. in addition to our strong team spirit, we attribute our continued success to having one of the most recognised brands in georgia, a superior customer experience, the best multichannel network and a full range of innovative services and products. the banking industry is entering a digital era and we need to stay abreast of upcoming changes. at the same time, we will remain focused on operating efficiency and automation to become more agile in our fast-changing environment. we also launched the first georgian- speaking chatbot,ti bot, which allows customers to conduct simple banking transactions via facebook messenger . visa liberalisation would also have a positive impact on tourism, leading to increased awareness about georgia and greater tourist inflow from the eu. these projects will strengthen georgia’s position as a regional tourism and transportation hub, as it offers the shortest route to connect the economies of china and countries in central asia to those of european countries. during the past 25 years, tbc bank has actively supported culture, sports, young talent and other important social projects. ti bot serves as an efficient new sales channel and can also be used to conduct simple banking transactions. ertguli is a credit vakhtang butskhrikidze ceo 1 region in this

this programme has proven extremely successful, helping to increase the use of our credit cards by 79.4% year-on-year . on the msme side, we launched a new financing programme called startuperi for early-stage companies. the programme aims to support start-ups not only financially, but also by providing non-financial services, including training sessions, master classes and special discounts with tbc bank’s partners. georgia continues to benefit from its open trade policies with all major economic players in the region. starting from 2018, a free-trade agreement with china has entered into force, which should give additional impetus to georgia’s growing exports. after the subdued growth seen in 2015 and 2016, this suggests a revival of investment activity by local companies. i would like to thank all my colleagues for their dedicated hard work and commitment. notable export growth to china continued (up 23.4% yoy), making it the fifth-largest destination for georgian goods. while its immediate neighbours still account for most incoming visitors, tourism inflows from the eu and middle east have been on an upward trend. in 2h 2017, higher oil prices and a weaker nominal effective exchange rate added to the inflationary pressure. in the open budget index ranking, georgia outscored all eu countries except for sweden and norway. we have been growing together with our business customers from the very beginning of georgia’s independence. over the past 25 years, we have gained strong market expertise and a solid understanding of our customers’ financial needs. to further support our business customers, we offer added-value, free-of-charge non-financial services, including various training courses, individual consultations and conferences. as the usage of our digital channels is growing rapidly, especially mobile banking, we continue to invest in smart, remote solutions offering our customers such innovative services as chatbot, mobile wallet and a voice biometric recognition system. at the same time, we continue to expand our network of self-service terminals, which offer both cash and cashless payment functionality. as these factors will remain in the future, we have added a new strategic priority: to proactively manage our nim. we will be working on various initiatives, both internally and with one of the world’s leading consulting firms.

decided to apply for startuperi.” one of x-park’s founders 51 tbc bank annual report and accounts 2017 governance additional information financial statements strategic report overview strategic report strategy & performance msme: case study x-park in recent years, georgia has entered the lists of top must- see destinations from condé nast traveler, vogue and lonely planet. she decided to increase the number of beehives, as natural honey was in high demand and quite profitable. it was acquired by the group in october 2016 and has been growing rapidly since then. in line with the group’s digitalisation strategy, tbc insurance actively uses digital channels to market and sell its products. the two largest players hold respective market shares 2 of 37.4% and 17.2%, followed by tbc insurance in third place with 13.3%. as a result, we disbursed record high leases in the amount of gel125 million to msme clients. in 2017, tbc leasing also enhanced its internal operations and processes by:  launching the first bespoke leasing core software system, which was developed by a local it company;  establishing an independent call centre separate from that of the bank; and  enhancing operational risk management procedures. we also started using our terminals as a channel to originate fast, preapproved loans for the bank’s customers.  real estate management fund and mali manage property that tbc bank has repossessed for future sale. unhedged borrowers could suffer from increased debt burden when their liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are amplified. negative macroeconomic developments could compromise the group’s performance through various parameters, such as rising unemployment rates, increasing retail sector default rates, falling property values, worsening loan collateralisation, or falling debt service capabilities of companies suffering from decreasing sales. the group has in place a macroeconomic monitoring process that relies on close, recurrent observations of the economic developments in georgia, as well as its neighbouring countries, to identify early warning signals indicating imminent economic risks. resilience towards a changing macroeconomic environment is incorporated into the group’s credit underwriting standards. as such, borrowers are expected to withstand certain adverse economic developments through prudent financials, debt-servicing capabilities and conservative collateral coverage. therefore, the group’s profitability and performance may be compromised by an increased regulatory burden, including higher capital requirements. banks operating in developing markets are typically exposed to both single-name and sector concentration risks. the group has large individual exposures to single-name borrowers whose potential default would entail increased credit losses and high impairment charges. the group’s portfolio is well diversified across sectors, resulting in only a moderate vulnerability to sector concentration risks. risk description the group’s loan portfolio is diversified, with maximum exposure to a single industry (ie energy and utility) standing at 8.4%. as part of its risk appetite framework, the group limits both single-name and sector concentrations. all are comfortably above the national bank of georgia’s minimum requirements or guidance for such ratios. 8. principal risk the threat posed by cyber-attacks has increased in recent years and continues to grow. the risk of potential cyber-attacks, which have become more sophisticated, may lead to significant security breaches. nonetheless, the group’s rising dependency on it systems increases its exposure to potential cyber-attacks. intrusion prevention and distributed denial of service (ddos) protection systems are in place to protect the group from external cyber-threats. internal fraud arises from actions committed by the bank’s employees and such events happen less frequently. the risk and control self-assessment exercise focuses on identifying residual risks in key processes, subject to respective corrective actions. all new products and projects pass through risk teams to ensure that risks are comprehensively analysed.  stress-testing exercises are one of the crucial tools for effective risk identification, measurement and mitigation. business underwriting risk managers specialise in a particular sector to be aware of current industry trends and developments. the performance of scorecard models is closely monitored to ensure that decisions are in line with predefined risk limits. collateral on loans extended by the group may include, but is not limited to, real estate, cash deposits, vehicles, equipment, inventory, precious metals, securities and third-party guarantees. in specific instances, such as lending to related parties and material transactions, external appraisers validate these appraisals. early warning signals serve as an important advance alert system for the detection of credit deteriorations, leading to mitigating actions. collection functions for retail and micro loans support customers who are experiencing difficulties in fulfilling their obligations. a centralised team monitors retail borrowers in delinquency which, coupled with branches’ efforts, aims to maximise collection. according to the group’s policy, asset and contingent liability loss reserves must be maintained at an adequate level to absorb all estimated incurred losses in the group’s credit portfolio at any given point in time. both funding and market liquidity risks can emerge from a number of factors that are beyond the group’s control. in 2017, the national bank of georgia introduced its own lcr for liquidity risk management purposes. increasing the number of successful businesses in our country makes it stronger, increases its economic potential and fosters an attractive investment environment. early-stage businesses need financial assistance as well, but it is common for established banks to refrain from financing them because of the risks associated with start-ups. start-ups received individual consultations with leading professionals about topics such as marketing, human resources, management, finance and taxes. another remarkable idea put into action in 2017 was making basic information about various industries easily accessible for businesses. georgian ski resorts are becoming increasingly popular but need support to transform them into high-class destinations with proper infrastructure, thereby improving their reputations among tourists. after setting goals, employees have a clear understanding of their roles, responsibilities and contribution to the group’s overall strategy. since 2012, we have run a special internship programme for college students in their third or fourth year of study. we partner with top georgian universities and give the best students an opportunity to become part of our team. since 2011, the bank has run tbc academy, an in-house educational centre available to all employees that offers numerous courses in banking and related fields. we also use a distance learning system for many training programmes, allowing employees more flexibility in completing the courses. furthermore, in may 2017, we started a session of masterclasses for personal development, which were delivered by leading professionals who shared their knowledge and experience with our employees. in addition, our team members can receive special discounts and offers at various sport centres. based on the survey results, we created 10 different designs of scarves and ties in partnership with leading georgian designers. these accessories were distributed to front-office employees as gifts and are also available for sale at our corporate online brand shop. we continuously add new collections to our brand shop that are designed exclusively for tbc bank. the policy encourages all employees to report on any suspected violations in an open manner without fear of retaliation. periodic audits are also conducted by the internal audit department to identify any violations or inappropriate behaviour. our 2018 initiatives include:  introducing a job classification system, which means assessing and grading head office staff positions. we also supported last years’ winners to participate in the intel international science and engineering fair. more than 100 people with a start-up mindset took part in the hackathon, creating business prototypes for gamification and entertainment. another initiative that we have curated since 2013 is artarea, the first online tv channel dedicated to art and culture. the channel offers its viewers various culturally themed lectures, recommendations, entertainment programmes and live concerts, which are quite popular among all generations. no such material breaches of the bank’s environmental and social risk management policy were identified during 2017. we are also committed to promoting eco-friendly projects. in june 2017, we transformed several client authorisation procedures paperless and saved around 1.7 million sheets of paper . it also includes combustion of, among others, petrol, diesel fuel and natural gas in owned transportation devices. tbc bank group plc financial results are prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards (as endorsed by the european union) ("ifrs") and are adjusted for certain one-off items to enable better analysis of the group’s performance. in particular, we aim to pay

management team that is drawn from a diverse range of backgrounds. vakhtang butskhrikidze and giorgi shagidze have service contracts with the company, which came into effect on 10 august 2016 and will continue until terminated by either party to such contracts, giving the other not less than seven months written notice. the directors consider that, in preparing the financial statements they have used appropriate accounting policies, supported by reasonable judgements and estimates, and that all accounting standards which they consider to be applicable have been followed. at present, mr enukidze serves as executive chairman of jsc caucasus minerals, a georgian mineral resources exploration company. in 2016, mr butskhrikidze joined the visa central & eastern europe, middle east and africa (cemea) business council. prior to joining tbc, george worked for barclays investment bank, where he held the position of vice president in the financial institutions group (fig), emea since june 2011. from september 2009 he was an associate director in barclays debt finance and restructuring teams. prior to that, he served as senior vice president at pimco responsible for the risk advisory practice. in previous positions held before joining the group, mr chkonia consulted companies regarding risks, especially those associated with credit and capital market transactions. financial risks the recc closely reviewed the group’s financial risk positions and produced a report that included an assessment of tbc bank’s risks associated with liquidity, foreign exchange, banking book interest rates and counterparties. in addition, the executives achieved a number of corporate non-financial and personal kpis, as explained below. new remuneration policy for 2019 taking into consideration that our existing executive remuneration policy is expiring at the end of 2018, we have engaged with shareholders and external, independent consultants to enhance our remuneration structure in order to ensure that it is more closely aligned with all stakeholders’ expectations and at the same time allows us to attract and retain the best talent. 1.2 statement of voting at annual

and commitments that were agreed prior to this policy taking effect. the remuneration committee may decide to make no awards where kpis have not been met. performance conditions are chosen to align our executive directors' interests with strategic objectives of the group over multi-year periods and encourage a long-term view. once shares are delivered, they remain subject to 2 year holding period and continued employment requirements. shareholders should note that the cost of providing comparable benefits in different jurisdictions may vary widely. 10.3 performance measures and targets (a) salary – deferred shares paying part of the executive director's salary in shares is an important element of remuneration as it helps to align each individual's efforts with the group’s performance. the remuneration committee’s goal for each kpi is to establish a level of performance that is not certain to be attained, so that achieving or exceeding the targets requires diligent efforts by our executive directors. the remuneration committee’s goal for each performance condition is to establish a level of performance that is not certain to be attained, so that achieving or exceeding the targets requires diligent efforts by our executive directors. (d) shareholder guidelines executive directors should naturally build up a significant holding of shares in the company. shareholders should note that the cost of providing comparable expenses in different jurisdictions may vary widely. for an internal appointment of an executive or non-executive director , any pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may either continue on its original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment, as appropriate. the remuneration committee will exercise its absolute discretion to determine whether such terms should be included in any new service contract. 16.2 service contracts the service contracts of executive directors may contain tailored terms which allow for termination payments to be paid if the executive director’s employment is terminated under certain circumstances, such as following a corporate change, a change in control, involuntary termination, termination without cause, for "good leaver" reasons (including) death or disability, each as defined in the applicable executive director’s service contract. tbc plc will also reimburse the cfo for all reasonable business expenses properly incurred and paid by him. the current service agreement provides for mr butskhrikidze to act as ceo of tbc jsc. in september 2016, vakhtang butskhrikidze and giorgi shagidze were appointed to the supervisory board of tbc jsc. nevertheless, we continue to ensure that particular resolutions are passed by the appropriate audit committee with as little duplication as possible, while making sure that there is seamless co-operation between the two committees to avoid any gaps in overall scrutiny. in addition, there were regular interim meetings via teleconference facilities, where members discussed a narrower agenda, mostly around planned releases of financial data. members are also in regular e-mail correspondence with each other on various matters relating to the audit committee’s work. we are also in regular communication with the external auditor via both teleconference facilities and correspondence before approving any releases. we recognise that the impact of ifrs9 will take time to calibrate across all across financial institutions and that there will be an element of “informed guesswork” (as it has been widely described) in financial reporting until the new standard is definitively established. readiness for other accounting standards the audit committee has also looked at other accounting standards recently adopted or in the pipeline, most notably ifrs15 (which has applied since january 2018) on revenue recognition and ifrs16 (which is expected to come into force from january 2019) on leases. in response to this risk pwc conducted review of organisation-wide governance systems and overall control environment. whist this law will not come into effect for the banking sector until january 2019, it has a more immediate impact on deferred tax calculations. equally, pwc have shared with us supportive insights into the management as part of their audit findings. we also used pwc for tax audit work in our azeri subsidiary after a full tender process. pwc have confirmed in writing their independence and that no “prohibited” non-audit services were provided. in our view, pwc continue to offer an independent, professional and cost-effective service that is capable of detecting any audit irregularities. whilst primary responsibility to manage risk always resides with the management, internal audit’s role, acting in its capacity as the “third line of defence”, is to identify potential problems and recommend ways of improving risk management and internal control. while we are still some way from automated internal auditing, internal audit has invested in specialist software, which will enable it to speed up some of its more routine tasks, allowing it to concentrate on its most added-value functions. we have, for example, started an initiative to ensure that all best practice policies are rolled out universally and ‘policed’ by internal audit accordingly. individual impairment assessment is performed where individually significant loans have unique characteristics that require judgement at a loan level to determine the present value of expected future cash flows and any resulting shortfall. we re-performed management’s impairment calculations, testing key inputs such as expected future cash flows and discount rates. 10029943 the notes set out on pages 170 to 254 form an integral part of these financial

to the consolidated financial statements 31 december 2017 1 introduction principal activity. the bank is a joint stock company limited by shares and was set up in accordance with georgian regulations. ** in 2015 all gdr holders’ interests were held through bank of new york (nominees), limited (the custodian). the carrying amount of associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition less accumulated impairment losses, if any. this may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are recycled to profit or loss. fair value measurements are analysed by level in the fair value hierarchy as follows: (i) level one are measurements at quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, (ii) level two measurements are valuations techniques with all material inputs observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices), and (iii) level three measurements are valuations not solely based on observable market data (that is, the measurement requires significant unobservable inputs). this classification includes investment securities which the group intends to hold for an indefinite period of time and which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices. available for sale securities or bonds carried at amortised cost reclassified to repurchase receivables continue to be carried at fair value or amortised cost respectively in accordance with the accounting policies for these categories of assets. amounts due from other banks are recorded when the group advances money to counterparty banks with original maturity of more than three months and with no intention of trading the resulting unquoted non-derivative receivable due on fixed or determinable dates. loans and advances to customers are recorded when the group advances money to purchase or originate an unquoted non-derivative receivable from a customer due on fixed or determinable dates and has no intention of trading the receivable. if the group determines that there is no objective evidence that an individually assessed financial asset incurred in impairment whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment. financial guarantees and commitments to provide a loan are initially recognised at their fair value, which is normally evidenced by the amount of fees received. performance guarantees are contracts that provide compensation if another party fails to perform a contractual obligation. gains and losses on disposals determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount are recognised in profit or loss. it is amortised on a straight line basis over an expected useful life of 30 to 50 years. intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over expected useful lives of 2 to 15 years. subordinated debt includes long-term non-derivative liabilities to international financial institutions and is carried at amortised cost. debt securities in issue include promissory notes, bonds, certificates of deposit and debentures issued by the group. the group does not designate loan commitments as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. the same principle is applied for wealth management, financial planning and custody services that are continuously provided over an extended period of time. when scheduling future cash flows the management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with similar credit risk characteristics. in practice, the new rules mean that entities will have to record an immediate loss equal to the 12-month ecl on initial recognition of financial assets that are not credit impaired (or lifetime ecl for trade receivables). as for the retail and macro segments facility level default definition is utilised with additional pulling effect criteria being applied. when the consideration varies for any reason, minimum amounts must be recognised if they are not at significant risk of reversal. as a consequence, it was difficult for investors to compare and contrast the financial performance of otherwise similar insurance companies. the issue ratings on georgia’s senior unsecured foreign- and local-currency bonds are also affirmed at “bb-”. at year-end 2016 the bank updated its methodology for loan loss provisioning purposes to include impairment assessment of acquired portfolios. borrowers with total liabilities of gel 2 million or more are regarded as significant and assessed individually for impairment. at the central level a specific unit manages collateral to ensure that they serve as an adequate mitigation for credit risk management purposes. refer to note 18. none of the debt securities available for sale are overdue or impaired. during 2015 the group reclassified investment securities available for sale to bonds carried at amortised cost with carrying amount of gel 372,063 thousand. finance lease payments receivable (gross investment in the leases) and their present values are as follows: in thousands of gel due in 1 year due between 1 and 5 years total finance lease payments receivable as of 31 december 2017 86,186 105,595 191,781 unearned finance income
