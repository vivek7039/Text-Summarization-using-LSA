We are  committed to building trusted, mutually beneficial relationships  with our customers by concentrating on their financial needs and  offering them well-suited banking solutions. TBC Bank has strong coverage across the country through its  well-developed multichannel network serving around 75% of  Georgia’s adult population. We achieved this by fostering a customer-focused culture,  where every employee strives to create maximum comfort and  value for our customers. At the same time, we  will remain focused on operating efficiency and automation to  become more agile in our fast-changing environment. We also launched the first Georgian- speaking chatbot,Ti Bot, which allows customers to conduct simple  banking transactions via Facebook Messenger . Visa  liberalisation would also have a positive impact on tourism, leading  to increased awareness about Georgia and greater tourist inflow  from the EU. The programme aims to  support start-ups not only financially, but also by providing  non-financial services, including training sessions, master classes  and special discounts with TBC Bank’s partners. Starting from 2018, a free-trade  agreement with China has entered into force, which should give  additional impetus to Georgia’s growing exports. While its immediate neighbours still account for  most incoming visitors, tourism inflows from the EU and Middle  East have been on an upward trend. To further support our business customers, we offer added-value,  free-of-charge non-financial services, including various training  courses, individual consultations and conferences. At the same time, we continue to expand our network of self-service  terminals, which offer both cash and cashless payment functionality. As these  factors will remain in the future, we have added a new strategic  priority: to proactively manage our NIM. They strive to build lasting  relationships with customers, becoming trusted partners who  can always be relied on and are easily accessible. As our  customers’ long-term well-being is of utmost importance to us,  we carefully analyse their personal circumstances and goals  before coming up with solutions. Our representative office in Israel, TBC Invest, allows us to  attract non-resident clients more effectively from all over the  world. Ti Bot has proven very popular  among our clients and we have received around 6.5 million  messages from 124,000 customers since launch. All customers who  own TBC Bank plastic cards automatically participate in the  programme and can accumulate points on each purchase. The main benefits  are that customers can be verified quickly, enabling us to deal with a  greater number of calls and reduce fraud through identity theft. We supported our robust growth by becoming the core bank for  leading industry players such as Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Nikora 2 ,  Silknet 3  and Nova 4 . With our financial assistance, it has  significantly expanded its business and is now one of the leading  players on Georgia’s beverage market. • MCG’s clinic offers its customers a comprehensive range of services, including  general practitioner, paediatrics, therapy, cardiology, rehabilitation, surgery, and  world-class emergency aid. We also actively cooperate with the government programme, “Produce in  Georgia”, which aims to support agriculture, manufacturing and hospitality  industries. We are the sole bank in Georgia offering a business support programme   to our clients, including training, workshops and individual consultations. In line with the Group’s digitalisation strategy, TBC Insurance  actively uses digital channels to market and sell its products. As  such, borrowers are expected to withstand certain adverse economic  developments through prudent financials, debt-servicing  capabilities and conservative collateral coverage. Risk description The National Bank of Georgia has introduced a new capital adequacy  framework that came into force in December 2017. The Group has large individual exposures to single-name borrowers  whose potential default would entail increased credit losses and  high impairment charges. Risk description The Group’s loan portfolio is diversified, with maximum exposure to  a single industry (ie energy and utility) standing at 8.4%. Intrusion prevention and Distributed Denial of Service  (DDoS) protection systems are in place to protect the Group from  external cyber-threats. Collateral on loans extended by  the Group may include, but is not limited to, real estate, cash  deposits, vehicles, equipment, inventory, precious metals, securities  and third-party guarantees. Early warning signals  serve as an important advance alert system for the detection of  credit deteriorations, leading to mitigating actions. Both funding and market liquidity risks can emerge from a number  of factors that are beyond the Group’s control. During 2017 particular attention was given to operational risk  concerns arising from an incidence of identity fraud in the fourth  quarter 2017. Increasing the number of successful  businesses in our country makes it stronger, increases its economic  potential and fosters an attractive investment environment. Early-stage businesses need financial  assistance as well, but it is common for established banks to refrain  from financing them because of the risks associated with start-ups. To better support women employees, we offer   them six months of maternity leave at full pay and other   childcare benefits. Georgian ski resorts are becoming increasingly popular but  need support to transform them into high-class destinations with  proper infrastructure, thereby improving their reputations among  tourists. After setting goals, employees have a clear  understanding of their roles, responsibilities and contribution to the  Group’s overall strategy. Since 2011, the Bank has run TBC Academy, an in-house educational  centre available to all employees that offers numerous courses in  banking and related fields. Furthermore, in May  2017, we started a session of masterclasses for personal  development, which were delivered by leading professionals who  shared their knowledge and experience with our employees. These accessories  were distributed to front-office employees as gifts and are also  available for sale at our corporate online brand shop. The channel  offers its viewers various culturally themed lectures,  recommendations, entertainment programmes and live concerts,  which are quite popular among all generations. They also have service contracts with the Bank, which both  came into effect on 1 July 2015 and will continue until 31 December  2018. Mr Haag has 32 years of experience working in the  financial services industry, with a significant emphasis on equity capital markets and  technology. In previous positions held before joining the  Group, Mr Chkonia consulted companies regarding risks, especially  those associated with credit and capital market transactions. RECC activities during 2017 In 2017, one of the Group’s primary focus areas was to ensure a  smooth post-merger integration with Bank Republic. The Group has developed a new remuneration policy, which is presented in this document and if approved by shareholders on 2018 AGM, will  become applicable starting from 1 January 2019. Performance conditions are  chosen to align our executive  directors' interests with  strategic objectives of the  Group over multi-year periods  and encourage a long-term  view. The Remuneration Committee will exercise its absolute discretion to  determine whether such terms should be included in any new  service contract. In addition, there were  regular interim meetings via teleconference facilities, where  members discussed a narrower agenda, mostly around planned  releases of financial data. Members are also in regular e-mail  correspondence with each other on various matters relating to the  Audit Committee’s work. We are also in regular communication with the External  Auditor via both teleconference facilities and correspondence before  approving any releases. Whist this law will not come into effect for the banking  sector until January 2019, it has a more immediate impact on  deferred tax calculations. In our view, PwC continue to offer an independent,  professional and cost-effective service that is capable of detecting any  audit irregularities. Internal Audit seeks to complete audits of all the Bank’s key  operating risks on a regular basis and this activity has continued in  2017. We have, for  example, started an initiative to ensure that all best practice policies  are rolled out universally and ‘policed’ by Internal Audit accordingly. Individual impairment assessment is performed where individually  significant loans have unique characteristics that require judgement   at a loan level to determine the present value of expected future cash  flows and any resulting shortfall.

The same  principle is applied for wealth management, financial planning and custody services that are continuously provided over an extended period of time. When scheduling future cash flows the  management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with similar credit risk characteristics. As for the retail and macro  segments facility level default definition is utilised with additional pulling effect criteria being applied. When the consideration varies for any reason, minimum amounts must be recognised if they are not at  significant risk of reversal. As a  consequence, it was difficult for investors to compare and contrast the financial performance of otherwise similar insurance companies. At the central level a specific unit manages collateral to ensure that they serve as an adequate mitigation for credit risk management purposes. During 2015 the Group reclassified investment securities available for sale to bonds carried at amortised cost with carrying amount of GEL  372,063 thousand. The main types of collateral  obtained are: • Leased assets (inventory and equipment); • Down payment; • Real estate properties; • Third party guarantees. Provisions for liabilities, charges, performance guarantees and credit related commitments are primarily expected to be utilised within twelve  months after the year-end. As of 31 December 2017 the analysis by expected maturities may be as follows: In thousands of GEL Less than  3 months From 3 to  12 months From 1 to 5  Years Over 5 years Total Assets Cash and cash equivalents 1,431,477 – – – 1,431,477 Due from other banks 32,845 3,071 3,727 – 39,643 Mandatory cash balances with National Bank of Georgia 1,033,818 – – – 1,033,818 Loans and advances to customers 1,031,608 1,767,797 3,438,180 2,087,768 8,325,353 Investment securities available for sale 657,938 – – – 657,938 Bonds carried at amortised cost 81,859 105,956 216,177 45,546 449,538 Finance lease receivables 22,896 38,526 82,414 – 143,836 Other financial assets 110,604 22,207 13,333 – 146,144 Total financial assets 4,403,045 1,937,557 3,753,831 2,133,314 12,227,747 Liabilities Due to Credit institutions 1,137,076 351,381 990,480 141,777 2,620,714 Customer accounts 844,123 136,821 – 6,835,873 7,816,817 Debt securities in issue 47 7,778 12,870 – 20,695 Other financial liabilities 82,685 8,808 260 – 91,753 Subordinated debt 3,471 49,694 97,372 276,251 426,788 Total financial liabilities 2,067,402 554,482 1,100,982 7,253,901 10,976,767 Credit related commitments and performance guarantees Performance guarantees 2,067  – – – 2,067  Financial guarantees 8,239  – – – 8,239  Other credit related commitments 105,268 – – – 105,268 Credit related commitments and performance guarantees 115,574 – – – 115,574 Net liquidity gap as of 31 December 2017 2,220,069 1,383,075 2,652,849 (5,120,587) 1,135,406 Cumulative gap as of 31 December 2017 2,220,069 3,603,144 6,255,993 1,135,406 The management believes that the Group has sufficient liquidity to meet its current on- and off-balance sheet obligations.
