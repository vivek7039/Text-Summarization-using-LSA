Since then, it has consistently maintained its status as the go-to source of  inspiration for both locals and visitors alike. Everything Time Out does helps people discover, book and share what the world’s cities have to offer. 25887  11 April 2018 10:34 AM  Proof 4 5 www.timeout.com STRATEGIC REPORT OUR KEY STRENGTHS Established international brand   with an extensive audience reach:  Time Out is one of the leading brands to inspire and  enable people through curated content about how  to enjoy food, drink, culture, art, travel and entertainment in  cities around the world. Key Achievements I am very pleased that Time Out Group  continued to consistently deliver against its  core areas. We expanded our digital advertising  presence through the integration of Time Out  franchises in Australia, Spain and Asia. How does Time Out intend to grow sales so  rapidly in the highly competitive travel and  leisure e-commerce market? To  complement our broad affiliates offering  and further monetise traffic, we have also  launched exclusive products like our very  successful recent restaurant gift box which  sold out quickly – this is a unique product  only Time Out can deliver as it is inspired  by editorial curation of the best of the city. Secondly, in 2017  we have again grown our average global  monthly audience reach by 39% and it now  stands at 217 million. The fact that Time  Out Market Lisbon saw 3.6 million visitors  in 2017 shows how successful and popular  this format is. This combination of assets  is difficult to replicate for these tech giants  but something advertising clients and  consumers increasingly seek. Our unique,  curated content written by professional  journalists remains as relevant now as when  it first started – it is this authentic high- quality content people value in times of  fake news more than ever before and that is  why we are able to inspire millions of people  to have a great time in cities around the  world. This fee and  the fixed charge are reported as  revenue by Time Out (million) 2017 1,230 2016 770 2015 493 2017 €33.1 2016 €23.5 2015 €16.5 *O&O is the Time Out ‘owned and operated’ business operations in 76  cities across 20 countries; this does not include international licensing  arrangements in a further 32 cities across 20 countries. Time Out’s positive, trusted content - curated by professional  journalists - is of great value to advertising partners seeking brand  safe environments and unique campaign approaches. Plans to focus product development on improving the visibility and  distribution of offers have reaped rewards in 2017 with revenue  increasing by 21%. Called ‘Table for Two’, the curated luxury gift box was filled with cards  giving diners 50% off food at twelve of Time Out’s 100 best restaurants  in London throughout 2018. Flypay is  a mobile technology platform providing solutions for ordering and  payment within the hospitality sector.
