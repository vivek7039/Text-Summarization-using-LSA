Our children services cover assessment, residential care, education and fostering options, including specialist provision for very complex young people. Delivering a safe and secure support of very high quality, ensuring that all our service users enjoy extraordinary days, every day. We also have an outstanding track record for diverting people away from acute care and supporting them in their own homes. These services are highly intensive operations with exceptional staff ratios and include on site or dedicated educational facilities. We have national coverage across England, Wales and Scotland in a highly fragmented UK social care market. National presence CareTech is very well known as a care company in public ownership that operates throughout England, Scotland and Wales. A number of organic growth projects and potential bolt-on acquisitions had been identified prior to the placing. It has 57 residential beds in eight freehold sites and supported living services are provided to 30 service users. In the 12 years since joining AIM, the business has transformed from being very focused on supporting adults with a learning disability through residential and day care settings to one where today we cater for young people and children with complex needs across a range of settings, be it residential, supported living or community support. Simplifying the structure has also supported planning and service delivery with a more powerful approach to development. I am always drawn to the achievements of our excellent front line staff, which is inevitable as we are first and foremost a care organisation. We plan to introduce another CareTech Sharesave Scheme in 2018 as this is one part of our staff retention strategy. This is where CareTech has developed its provision and helps to explain why spending cuts have had minimal impact on the Group. This ensures that CareTech is in a very strong position to address the demands of our evolving marketplace. Nationwide locations The CareTech strategy is to offer a strong national presence with local brands and regional service delivery points. This is reinforced by our presence at major industry events where we have been reliable sponsors and commentators. This reflects the improved underlying EBITDA and lower finance charges offset by an increased tax provision. It is a total including residential care beds, independent supported living accommodation, community support service users and children that foster carers can currently look after. However, social care does carry risks that will always be at the forefront of our minds. National public policy continues to be a significant driver of local authority commissioning intentions and behaviour. New systems were procured during the year for the Group’s recruitment and training solutions including e-learning with standard automated reports as well as for maintenance, hosting, data analytics and e-compliance in order to benefit from cutting edge technology. This ensures that CareTech is in a very strong position to address the demands of our evolving marketplace. Our adult services offer a solid and reliable provision across the whole spectrum of service offerings which now includes acquired brain injuries and we see a particular volume demand in the area of supported living, balanced by renewed demand for more specialised residential care solutions. Conversely, resources for those with the highest level of need are being maintained and increased in some local authorities. We have an outstanding track record for helping people away from acute care and supporting them in their own homes. However, this is changing as the NHS drives to lower bed capacity and accelerated early discharge from acute psychiatric hospital care. It is generally held that fostering in an ordinary family home delivers better quality than any residential setting. Our market intelligence suggests that most, if not all, independent sector fostering agencies are still experiencing some degree of “hold back” at present. However, it is also clear that local authorities fail to undertake a full cost analysis of their in-house provision. In our view this is an expensive and unsustainable approach that exposes local authority commissioners to risk. It also strengthened the residential care and education services for young people with complex needs, especially EBD. We can now bridge that gap by supporting young people as they make the transition to adult life. However, both EQL Solutions and Dawn Hodge Associates faced a challenging start to the new Learning sector year. Considering non-financial values such as reputation, employee commitment and service user fulfilment helps us develop longer-term opportunities, ultimately adding to the financial bottom line. This year there has been significant policy development and we see some indicators that local authorities have recognised the need to maintain or grow their social care budgets. However, we are mindful about acquisition and have robust criteria which must be satisfied to ensure that any acquired business fits our long-term strategic objectives.

(ii) EBITDA is operating profit stated before depreciation, amortisation of intangible assets and share-based payments charge. As highlighted in that note, the Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through a mixture of bank facilities which are sufficient, with cash flow from profits, to fund present commitments. The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements. Negative goodwill (bargain purchase credit) arising on an acquisition is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. For goodwill and assets that have an indefinite useful life, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date. After initial recognition, these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. The impairment loss estimate is then based on recent historical counterparty default rates for each identified group. Deferred taxes at the balance sheet date have been measured using this enacted tax rate and reflected in these financial statements. At 30 September 2017 the Group has available bank facilities totalling £195m, sufficient, with cash flow from profits, to fund present commitments. Term facilities are used to fund capital expenditure and short-term flexibility is achieved by the utilisation of cash resources.
