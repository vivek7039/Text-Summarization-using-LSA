segment of the non-standard credit market, with approximately 1.8m people using its services regularly. other forms of non-standard credit, eg instalment loans, do not operate in the same way as hcc and rely on fully-online lending. morses club’s hcc business currently operates on an interim permission from the fca whilst application for full authorisation is considered. our customers are based throughout the uk, and we operate using nine regional networks which contain multiple branches. – repayments collected weekly by agents – experienced agents, familiar with their customers’ communities – agents are self-employed and paid in commission – frequent contact with agents means there is always an open channel of communication with customers – issues identified quickly and sensitively, supporting customers in difficulty – robust complaints process – customer satisfaction consistently above 95% – customers cite agent relationship as a top reason for high satisfaction – additional loans available for suitable customers according to strict criteria – affordability checks are completed for every single loan – proactive customer retention process (eg marketing campaigns, retention

the meaningful progress of our business. revenue growth of 10% was achieved whilst maintaining impairment comfortably within management’s guidance range and improving operating efficiencies. management has focused on reducing vacancy rates and optimising territory sizes during the year, rather than increasing absolute agency numbers. firstly, the cost of increased territory build subsidies to agents joining from competitors accounted for £1.2m compared with £0.7m last year. secondly, agents inherited from acquisitions are generally more expensive, creating an estimated cost increase of £0.5m this year (fy16: £0.1m). no intangible asset is recognised for new customers agents may identify subsequently, which management considers to be a conservative approach. it should be noted that there is no final dividend accounted for in our first period as a listed company. gross receivables from customers (before impairment provisioning, which includes discounting of cash flows) increased by 5% in the year. it is secured by a debenture on our business assets and runs until march 2019, with a further term-out period until september 2019. the facility is subject to both

amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (oci) or fair value through profit or loss, on the basis of the entity’s business model for managing financial assets and its contractual cash flow characteristics. ifrs 9 further introduces a revised impairment model which will require entities to recognise expected credit losses based on unbiased forward-looking information. impairment is calculated using models which use historical payment performance to calculate the estimated amount and timing of future cash flows from each arrears stage. all assumptions are reviewed regularly to take account of differences between previously estimated cash flows on impaired debt and the eventual losses. bank overdrafts are presented in current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances. impairment is calculated using models which use historical payment performance to generate the estimated amount and timing of future cash flows from each arrears stage. the agent is well placed to identify signs of strain on a customer’s income and can moderate lending accordingly. most of the group’s financial assets are repayable within one year which results in a positive liquidity position.
