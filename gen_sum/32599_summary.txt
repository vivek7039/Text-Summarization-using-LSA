Strategic Report Morses Club PLC 4 The agent calls regularly, they are lovely and keep you up to date with everything. Between them, they bring a wealth of experience in compliance, financial services, legal, investment banking, accounting, and general business matters to Board deliberations. Lenders providing non-standard credit typically lend on an unsecured basis and the market is characterised by high- frequency borrowing. HCC is a specialised and well-established segment of the non-standard credit market, with approximately 1.8m people using its services regularly. Other forms of non-standard credit, eg instalment loans, do not operate in the same way as HCC and rely on fully-online lending. Morses Club’s HCC business currently operates on an interim permission from the FCA whilst application for full authorisation is considered. Our customers are based throughout the UK, and we operate using nine regional networks which contain multiple branches. – Repayments collected weekly by agents – Experienced agents, familiar with their customers’ communities – Agents are self-employed and paid in commission – Frequent contact with agents means there is always an open channel of communication with customers – Issues identified quickly and sensitively, supporting customers in difficulty – Robust complaints process – Customer satisfaction consistently above 95% – Customers cite agent relationship as a top reason for high satisfaction – Additional loans available for suitable customers according to strict criteria – Affordability checks are completed for every single loan – Proactive customer retention process (eg marketing campaigns, retention reports, paid-up customer research) Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Annual Report and Accounts 2017 11 Chief Executive Officer’s Review Growth Strategy The HCC business has benefited from a strong pipeline of territory builds. Our core underwriting system for HCC has a fully developed automated credit control engine at its centre. Strategic Report Morses Club PLC 12 new entrants to take volume risks, form a part of the competitive landscape. This in turn eases the business operation, improves work-life balance and enhances loyalty to Morses Club, thus reducing agent churn. Digitising our business has brought many planned and subtle advantages in addition to those already detailed. The platform has also allowed us to automate credit decisions based on policy with minimal levels of intervention or management overrides. It is however no accident that the developments in which we have invested also enable us to be more productive, reduce our operating costs, re-use technology many times over for the same investment case and, of course, to attract and retain customers. A fully interactive customer portal and downloadable mobile app will mean easier, two-way communication with customers. Building a Market-leading UK Non- standard Consumer Finance Company – Long-established UK Home Collected Credit (HCC) market player with strong returns – Proven track record of KPI-enhancing acquisitions and organic growth – Prudent credit control and shorter duration loans improve both impairment and profitability – Consolidation opportunities created by regulatory change – Initiatives to future-proof the core business – Highly invested IT platform – Progressive dividend policy supported by strong cash generation Our KPIs below comprise a set of performance metrics used by management to help gauge the meaningful progress of our business. Revenue growth of 10% was achieved whilst maintaining impairment comfortably within management’s guidance range and improving operating efficiencies. Return on equity of 27 .2% demonstrates the strong returns within HCC and compares favourably with major competitors. 3 Return on assets of 20.1% demonstrates the strong returns within HCC and compares favourably with major competitors. Management has focused on reducing vacancy rates and optimising territory sizes during the year, rather than increasing absolute agency numbers. Firstly, the cost of increased territory build subsidies to agents joining from competitors accounted for £1.2m compared with £0.7m last year. Secondly, agents inherited from acquisitions are generally more expensive, creating an estimated cost increase of £0.5m this year (FY16: £0.1m). No intangible asset is recognised for new customers agents may identify subsequently, which management considers to be a conservative approach. It should be noted that there is no final dividend accounted for in our first period as a listed company. Gross receivables from customers (before impairment provisioning, which includes discounting of cash flows) increased by 5% in the year. The Board is keen to emphasise that any increase in gearing will always be firmly founded on our culture of Treating Customers Fairly. Line managers are directly accountable for identifying and managing the risks arising in their functional or business area. Home Collected Credit (HCC) is a long- established offering, and parts of the Group have been undertaking this business for more than 80 years. The Group has an ongoing programme to conduct regular vulnerability assessments against our core infrastructure services. Penetration testing of our external and internal networks helps to identify new or emerging security concerns.

IFRS 9 requires all financial assets, except equity instruments, to be classified at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI) or fair value through profit or loss, on the basis of the entity’s business model for managing financial assets and its contractual cash flow characteristics. IFRS 9 further introduces a revised impairment model which will require entities to recognise expected credit losses based on unbiased forward-looking information. See Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty on pages 57 to 58 for more information. Impairment is calculated using models which use historical payment performance to calculate the estimated amount and timing of future cash flows from each arrears stage. All assumptions are reviewed regularly to take account of differences between previously estimated cash flows on impaired debt and the eventual losses. Computers and PDAs – 20%-33% on cost Fixtures & fittings – 20% on cost Investment in Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company has power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefits from such entities’ activities. Bank overdrafts are presented in current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances. Impairment is calculated using models which use historical payment performance to generate the estimated amount and timing of future cash flows from each arrears stage. This transaction changed the number of ordinary shares outstanding without a corresponding change in total equity. A default occurs when the customer or bank fails to honour repayments as they fall due. The agent is well placed to identify signs of strain on a customer’s income and can moderate lending accordingly. Most of the Group’s financial assets are repayable within one year which results in a positive liquidity position. For any subsequent annual grants, the Remuneration Committee will set any performance conditions by reference to the Company’s long-term strategy, which may include total shareholder return and/or financial metrics and/or key strategic goals to support long-term value creation.
