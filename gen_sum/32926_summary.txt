Since October 2016, the Company has focused on both acquiring and developing cybersecurity software solutions for consumers, whilst utilising its proprietary digital distribution technology to grow its user base across the Company’s product suite. With CyberGhost now fully integrated into the Group, I am pleased to report it has performed ahead of management’s expectations both on a revenue and profit level. Looking forward Kape’s management has been successful in demonstrating its ability to both drive organic growth initiatives alongside maximising the benefits from strategic acquisitions.

I am therefore delighted to look back at 2017 as a year of significant strategic and operational progress.

We also launched a Mac version of Reimage in September 2017 to complement our highly successful PC solution. Cybersecurity market Management identified the consumer cybersecurity space as presenting a significant opportunity for Kape, as a sizeable growth market with few nimble B2C focused-players that can easily adapt to the ever-changing digital landscape. In 2004, the global cybersecurity market was worth $3.5 billion and in 2017 it was worth over $120 billion, representing growth of over 35 times in 13 years, with key growth drivers including: 3 • a growing number of internet users to c. 3.17 billion globally; • increased network and WiFi connectivity across the world; • commercial entities increasingly collecting personal data; • cybercrime targeting individuals, not just enterprise-level hacks; • heightened regulatory uncertainty around privacy and online security; and • the emergence of the Internet of Things. Current trading and outlook Over the past 12 months we have delivered on our stated growth strategy. Adjusted cash flows from operations after adding back payments that are one-off in nature and deferred payment for past acquisition that was treated as a remuneration expense in previous years, was $7.6 million (2016: $7.9 million). Moran Laufer Chief Financial Officer 12 March 2018 12 KAPE TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS Risks Background Mitigating controls Regulatory, legislative or self-regulatory developments regarding internet privacy matters could adversely affect the Group’s ability to conduct its business. International regulatory bodies are increasingly focused on online privacy issues and user data protection. In particular, GDPR was approved by the European Union (EU) and takes effect from May 2018. It intends to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the EU. • Whilst not externally regulated, the Group adheres to a strict set of controls with its partners. Such companies could also seek to replicate all or parts of the Group’s business. 13 KAPE TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT Risks Background Mitigating controls If the Group fails to innovate and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, the Group’s solution may become less competitive or obsolete. BOARD OF DIRECTORS Don has many years’ experience in marketing services including developing companies organically and by acquisition. Prior to joining Kape, Ido was acting Joint Chief Executive Officer of VisualDNA (which was acquired by The Nielsen Company), a leading psychographic data business, where he led its geographic expansion and oversaw significant EBITDA growth. Prior to VisualDNA, Ido worked as a Senior Associate within KPMG’s private equity deal advisory practice in London and as a Senior Manager within KPMG’s Transaction Services practice focusing on technology deals in Israel and with the Israeli Ministry of Finance. Ido is a Certified Public Accountant, having graduated magna cum laude in Accounting and Economics from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Previously Moran worked for Ernst & Young as a senior auditor of London Stock Exchange and NASDAQ traded companies primarily focused on the technology sector. Executive Directors and the Group’s auditors may be invited to attend all or part of any meetings. The Directors (other than alternate Directors) shall be entitled to receive by way of fees for their services as Directors (in addition to fees paid for employment or executive services) such sum as the Board may from time to time determine, provided that such amount shall not exceed in aggregate £500,000 per annum or such greater sum as the Company in general meeting shall from time to time determine by ordinary resolution. Vesting schedule: 25% one year from date of grant and then in 12 equal quarterly instalments thereafter. The Corporate Governance Statement set out on pages 16 to 17 forms part of this report. Principal activity Kape develops and distributes a variety of digital products in the online security space. Kape therefore places significant emphasis on ensuring that it has a strong recruitment team as well as appropriate remuneration and bonus policies which are set by reference to appropriate objectives and include share-based incentive schemes, details of which are set out in note 18 to the financial statements. The Group has no material exposure to price, liquidity, or cash flow risk that would impact its objectives. The Company has one class of ordinary shares, which carry no right to fixed income. Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 18 to the financial statements. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Prior to the acquisition date, CyberGhost acquired Mobile Concept, a software development company based in Germany. Management have engaged external valuations experts to undertake the purchase price allocation exercise required. Goodwill should be allocated to each of the groups cash generating units (“CGU’s”). Our testing focused on both material and more judgmental fair value adjustments that were recorded. A further four components have been scoped in as significant to ensure sufficient coverage was obtained across the group. This included reporting over material movements in the year, taxation and related party transactions. Summary of audit scope Based on the above scope we were able to conclude that sufficient and appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis to form our opinion on the group financial statements as a whole. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 28 KAPE TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 Note 2017 $’000 2016 $’000 Revenue 4 66,383 56,532 Cost of sales (4,572) (2,360) Gross profit 61,811 54,172 Selling and marketing costs 4a (44,117) (39,915) Research and development costs (1,016) (1,661) Management, general and administrative costs (12,832) (7,761) Depreciation and amortisation 10,11 (6,445) (9,884) Impairment of intangible assets 10 – (4,683) Total operating costs (64,410) (63,904) Operating loss 6 (2,599) (9,732) Adjusted EBITDA 8,261 6,413 Employee share-based payment charge 18 (340) (716) Charge for repurchase of employee options 18 (3,176) – Exceptional and non-recurring costs 6 (899) (862) Depreciation and amortisation 10,11 (6,445) (9,884) Impairment of intangible assets 10 – (4,683) Operating loss (2,599) (9,732) Share of results of equity accounted associates (40) 47 Finance income 277 4 Finance costs 8 (532) (332) Loss before taxation (2,894) (10,013) Tax charge 9 (467) (665) Loss for the year (3,361) (10,678) Other comprehensive income: Foreign exchange differences on translation of foreign operations 858 – Total comprehensive loss for the year (2,503) (10,678) Total profit/(loss) for the year attributable to: Owners of the parent Non-controlling interests (3,561) – Total comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to: 200 – Owners of the parent (2,703) – Non-controlling interests 200 – Basic earnings per share (cents) 19 (2.4) (7.6) Diluted earnings per share (cents) 19 (2.4) (7.6) 29 KAPE TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2017 Note 2017 $’000 2016 $’000 Non-current assets Intangible assets 10 12,350 7,113 Property, plant and equipment 11 815 591 Investments in equity accounted associates 16 – 859 Non-current investments 50 – Deferred contract costs 4c 406 – Deferred tax asset 9 97 166 13,718 8,729 Current assets Software licence inventory 65 – Deferred contract costs 4c 1,386 – Trade and other receivables 12 11,071 7,950 Cash and cash equivalents 13 69,502 72,064 82,024 80,014 Total assets 95,742 88,743 Equity Share capital 15 14 Additional paid in capital 130,728 130,292 Foreign exchange differences on translation of foreign operations 852 (6) Retained earnings (53,200) (49,747) Equity attributable to equity holders of the parent 78,395 80,553 Non-controlling interests 977 – Total equity 79,372 80,553 Non-current liabilities Contract liabilities 4b 892 – Deferred tax liabilities 9 349 691 Deferred consideration 25 993 160 2,234 851 Current liabilities Trade and other payables 14 10,094 7,096 Contract liabilities 4b 3,120 – Deferred consideration 25 922 243 14,136 7,339 Total equity and liabilities 95,742 88,743 The financial statements were approved by the Board and authorised for issue on 13 March 2018. IFRS 16 provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities for all applicable leases. Business combinations and goodwill Acquisitions of businesses not under common control are accounted for using the acquisition method. Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at fair value thorough profit and loss in accordance with IAS 39 as appropriate. Some of these contracts’ term are greater than one year, mostly for 24 and 36 months. Historical experience and information post year-end allows management to estimate the value of products that will be returned which are not material to the Group and a refund liability has therefore not been recognised. (a) Revenue from advertising The Group generates revenues from its customers’ advertising campaigns on fixed bases such as cost per mille impressions (“CPM”), cost-per-acquisition (‘‘CPA’’), cost-per-sale (‘‘CPS’’), cost-per-lead (‘‘CPL’’), cost-per-download (‘‘CPD’’) and cost-per-install (‘‘CPI’’). Amortisation of these intangible assets is calculated using the straight-line method over their useful economic lives. The useful economic life of IP, customer lists and trademarks is three to seven years. Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which is two to three years. (b) Presentation of net revenues The Group makes judgements in assessing whether it has acted as a principal or agent in transactions for selling and acquiring advertising media space, and therefore whether it reports its revenues gross or net respectively. The principal credit risk is considered to result from new relationships with customers with which the Group does not have a long working relationship and for which reliable information as to their credit ratings cannot be obtained. An unmatched position potentially enhances profitability, but can also increase the risk of losses. The Group’s management monitors the exchange rate fluctuations on a continuous basis and acts accordingly and also avoids engaging in a significant level of transactions in currencies which are considered volatile or exposed to risk of significant fluctuations. (a) Disaggregation of revenue The following table presents our revenues disaggregated by the timing of revenue recognition in accordance with our reporting segments: 2017 (USD, in thousands) 2016 (USD, in thousands) App Distribution Media Web Apps and License Total App Distribution Media Web Apps and License Total Revenue recognised over a period 6,454 – 2,376 8,830 – – 4,508 4,508 Revenue recognised at a point in time 41,772 15,781 57,553 38,241 13,783 52,024 Total 48,226 15,781 2,376 66,383 38,241 13,783 4,508 56,532 In accordance with the new revenue standard requirements, the disclosure of the impact of adoption on our consolidated income statement and balance sheet for the period ended December 31, 2017 was as follows: Income statement Fiscal year ended 31 December 2017 as reported under IFRS 15 (USD, in thousands) Fiscal year ended 31 December 2017 under IAS 18 (USD, in thousands) Effect of adjustment of IFRS 15 (USD, in thousands) Costs and expenses Selling and marketing expenses (44,117) (45,508) 1,391 Total operations cost (64,410) (65,801) 1,391 Operation loss (2,599) (3,990) 1,391 Adjusted EBITDA 8,261 6,870 1,391 Total comprehensive loss for the year (2,503) (3,894) 1,391 Basic earnings per share (2.4) (3.4) 1 Diluted earnings per share (2.4) (3.4) 1 Balance sheet Balance at 31 December 2017 as reported under IFRS 15 (USD, in thousands) Balance at 31 December 2017 under IAS 18 (USD, in thousands) Effect of adjustment of IFRS 15 (USD, in thousands) Assets recognised for costs incurred to obtain a contract Non-current assets – deferred expenses 347 – 347 Current assets – deferred expenses 1,044 – 1,044 1,391 – 1,391 The marketing costs to obtain a contract include fees paid to marketing partners on behalf of subscription sales of CyberGhost or Reimage to customers referred by the partners. There is no reasonably possible change in assumption that would give rise to an impairment. The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the credit timeframe and no interest has been charged by any suppliers as a result of late payment of invoices.
