specific measure which is calculated as operating loss before depreciation, amortisation, exceptional and non-recurring costs, employee share-based payment charges and impairment of intangible assets which are considered to be one-off and non-recurring in nature as set out in note 6. the directors believe that this provides a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the business. moran laufer chief financial officer 12 march 2018 12 kape technologies plc annual report and accounts risks background mitigating controls regulatory, legislative or self-regulatory developments regarding internet privacy matters could adversely affect the group’s ability to conduct its business. • whilst not externally regulated, the group adheres to a strict set of controls with its partners. such companies could also seek to replicate all or parts of the group’s business. 13 kape technologies plc annual report and accounts corporate governance financial statements strategic report risks background mitigating controls if the group fails to innovate and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, the group’s solution may become less competitive or obsolete. board of directors don has many years’ experience in marketing services including developing companies organically and by acquisition. prior to joining kape, ido was acting joint chief executive officer of visualdna (which was acquired by the nielsen company), a leading psychographic data business, where he led its geographic expansion and oversaw significant ebitda growth. prior to visualdna, ido worked as a senior associate within kpmg’s private equity deal advisory practice in london and as a senior manager within kpmg’s transaction services practice focusing on technology deals in israel and with the israeli ministry of finance. ido is a certified public accountant, having graduated magna cum laude in accounting and economics from the hebrew university of jerusalem. moran joined kape as group financial controller in 2012. he was a key member of the finance team that successfully supported the group’s admission to aim in september 2014. prior to joining kape, moran was a divisional controller at safecharge international ltd (aim: sch), a global provider of payments services, technologies and risk management solutions for online and mobile businesses. previously moran worked for ernst & young as a senior auditor of london stock exchange and nasdaq traded companies primarily focused on the technology sector. executive directors and the group’s auditors may be invited to attend all or part of any meetings. principal activity kape develops and distributes a variety of digital products in the online security space. kape therefore places significant emphasis on ensuring that it has a strong recruitment team as well as appropriate remuneration and bonus policies which are set by reference to appropriate objectives and include share-based incentive schemes, details of which are set out in note 18 to the financial statements. the group has no material exposure to price, liquidity, or cash flow risk that would impact its objectives. the company has one class of ordinary shares, which carry no right to fixed income. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. our testing focused on both material and more judgmental fair value adjustments that were recorded. a further four components have been scoped in as significant to ensure sufficient coverage was obtained across the group. summary of audit scope based on the above scope we were able to conclude that sufficient and appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis to form our opinion on the group financial statements as a whole. misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. the company has early adopted ifrs 15 for the financial year beginning 1 january 2017, as set out in note 4. standards issued but not yet effective ifrs 16 ‘leases’ is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2019 subject to eu endorsement. ifrs 16 provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities for all applicable leases. business combinations and goodwill acquisitions of businesses not under common control are accounted for using the acquisition method. historical experience and information post year-end allows management to estimate the value of products that will be returned which are not material to the group and a refund liability has therefore not been recognised. amortisation of these intangible assets is calculated using the straight-line method over their useful economic lives. the useful economic life of ip, customer lists and trademarks is three to seven years. internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which is two to three years. (b) presentation of net revenues the group makes judgements in assessing whether it has acted as a principal or agent in transactions for selling and acquiring advertising media space, and therefore whether it reports its revenues gross or net respectively. the principal credit risk is considered to result from new relationships with customers with which the group does not have a long working relationship and for which reliable information as to their credit ratings cannot be obtained. the group’s management monitors the exchange rate fluctuations on a continuous basis and acts accordingly and also avoids engaging in a significant level of transactions in currencies which are considered volatile or exposed to risk of significant fluctuations.

or reimage to customers referred by the partners. 1 adjusted ebitda is a company specific measure which is calculated as operating loss before depreciation, amortisation, exceptional and non-recurring costs, employee share-based payment charges and impairment of intangible assets which are considered to be one-off and non-recurring in nature as set out in note 6. the directors believe that this provides a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the business. following completion clearvelvet is considered to be a subsidiary undertaking and has been included in the company’s consolidated statements on a basis of full consolidation, as set out in note 21. in october 2016, the group exercised an option to acquire the intellectual property of pc maintenance software product, driveragent, from esupport.com inc. for a total consideration of 1,208,000. there is no reasonably possible change in assumption that would give rise to an impairment. if the management assumption was not changed, the amortisation attributed to the media intellectual property and customer lists would have been 2,416,000 instead of 3,629,000. notes to the consolidated
