C4XD at a glance Read more on page 2 Highlights Operational highlights Corporate highlights Strategy • The Board is committed to the delivery of C4X Discovery’ s (“C4XD’ s”) vision to become the world’ s most productive drug discovery engine by exploiting cutting-edge technologies to design and create best-in-class small molecule candidates targeting a range of high value therapeutic areas. • C4XD focusses on generating a high value pre-clinical asset portfolio that will drive revenue through early stage licensing deals with the pharmaceutical industry. We are ambitious and aim to produce four or more pre-clinical candidates every year once the Company reaches “steady state”. T axonomy3 ® fuels our drug discovery portfolio by generating novel targets in these genetically defined patient sub-groups. We only pursue new programmes in areas of high unmet medical need that are commercially attractive and focus on generating long-term partnerships with licensors. Fast, cost-effective novel candidate discovery Well diversified multi-disease portfolio across a variety of biological targets Focussed investment on highest value activities Long-term alliance revenue from partners Suite of cutting-edge proprietary technologies Highly experienced scientific team (>320 years) Industry-leading management team and Board Proactive commercial capability Strategic report 03 C4X DISCOVERY HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 WWW.C4XDISCOVERY.COM Interim Chairman’s statement Sam Williams, Interim Chairman The Board is fully committed to the delivery of our strategy. These, alongside our existing programmes, open new opportunities for future revenue-generating deals with the pharmaceutical industry. Sam Williams Interim Chairman 14 December 2017 We are passionate about finding better ways of discovering drugs. Our lead programme, Orexin-1, aims to treat addiction by targeting the “craving” process itself and, therefore, can be applied across a broad range of substance disorders. This deal enables us to increase the output of our engine whilst reducing risk and cost. Alongside our own proprietary suite of cutting-edge technologies, the alliance with Evotec will expand our ability to generate commercially attractive pre-clinical assets to meet the pharmaceutical industry’s increasing demand for high quality, early stage drug candidates. Over the past 12 months, key drug discovery programmes in addiction and inflammation have advanced and our Taxonomy3 ® DNA-based target discovery technology continues to produce novel target data in a number of commercially valuable disease areas. Critically, robust scientific and commercial intelligence gathering continues to drive selection criteria for inclusion in our portfolio. Strategic report 05 C4X DISCOVERY HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 WWW.C4XDISCOVERY.COM CEO’s statement continued Clive Dix, Chief Executive Officer Drug Discovery Engine and portfolio review Neuroscience – addiction and neurodegeneration Oral Orexin-1 Receptor Antagonist Programme Our most advanced drug discovery programme aims to provide a novel oral medicine for addiction/substance use disorders, a substantial area of unmet medical need forecast to be worth an estimated $13 billion per annum by 2018 1 . Our pre-clinical candidate molecule, an oral selective Orexin-1 receptor antagonist, remains on schedule to be ready for clinical development by the end of 2017. As a result, and in line with our stated goal, late stage commercial discussions are underway. During 2017, we have extended our initial exciting results on understanding the genetic basis of this disorder and confirmed these discrete patient sub-groups. Informatic analysis of proprietary genes discovered with T axonomy3 ® , together with known genetic susceptibility genes, has flagged new pathways relevant to the disease aetiology: identification of such disease-relevant pathways is a pivotal step in drug discovery. Oral NRF-2 Activator Programme C4XD has designed and discovered novel potent activators of the NRF-2 pathway , which is important in mediating lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”), pulmonary arterial hypertension (“P AH”) and other inflammatory diseases. Recently we identified potent compounds suitable for oral delivery and these are now the subject of in vivo studies. Commercially this is critical as current marketed drugs that target IL-17 are based on injectable C4X DISCOVERY HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 06 Strategic report monoclonal antibodies so an oral or topical treatment would increase the number of patients who can access drugs targeting this mechanism. Of these, nine were prioritised based on corroborative biology in the scientific literature and druggability . These potential targets are from protein families whose function suggests that any resulting drug molecules will have a very different biological impact on disease from that of existing rheumatoid arthritis therapies, enabling considerable therapeutic and commercial differentiation. T ype-2 diabetes (“T2D”) affects over 420 million people worldwide, creating an enormous healthcare and socio-economic burden. One challenge with generating this data is that multiple 3D shape information is generated for each molecule (a “4D” ensemble of these individual 3D shapes) and scientific insights for design can be obtained from this data by comparing similar molecules that have different biological activity. The Group may be unable to adequately protect itself from intellectual property infringement or effectively enforce its rights in certain jurisdictions. We will continue to review the situation, in particular the harmonisation of drug approval regulations and patent law, as well as any potential impact on existing staff and planned staff recruitment caused by any changes in immigration legislation. At this stage of its development, quantitative key performance indicators are not generally an effective way of measuring the Group’ s Strategic review Clive Dix, Chief Executive Officer C4X DISCOVERY HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 08 Strategic report Financial review Brad Hoy, Chief Financial Officer Administrative expenses increased by £716,000 during the year to £2,533,000 (2016: £1,817,000) reflecting additional non-scientific staff costs, in particular staff to build a commercial team, and additional premises costs to support growing activities. Brad Hoy Chief Financial Officer 14 December 2017 Results Revenue for the 12 months ended 31 July 2017 amounted to £143,000 (2016: £279,000). Last year the Group ceased its fee-for-service offering choosing only to work on a collaborative risk and revenue sharing basis. Grants secured are accounted for as a reduction in research and development (“R&D”) expenses. Our cash position and fundraising will allow C4XD to continue with its plan of becoming the world’s most productive Drug Discovery Engine.
