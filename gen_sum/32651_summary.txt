Chairman’s Statement Results and strategic progress Crawshaw Group has experienced a challenging year but, once the causes of the declining like-for-like sales were established, management made rapid changes that clearly resonated with customers. As a result, we have finished the year with some really encouraging sales and margin momentum. We are pleased with the recent improved trading performance and are very encouraged by the momentum that has been built up throughout H2, which was reflected in our Christmas T rading Update. Crawshaw has demonstrated its ability to manage a major change agenda in parallel with evaluating the ongoing potential of our store rollout programme. Whilst we remain completely committed to the high street, shopping centre and market location stores, the factory shop concept is proving to deliver significantly better financial returns with its higher sales, lower operating costs (no hot food-to-go offer) and lower fit out costs. Our customers wanted to see some of the old fresh meat pack sizes, price points and offers that were previously on sale in their specific store. T o ensure that all areas of our business were completely focused on delivering the sales recovery programme effectively, it was important to temporarily pause the store rollout programme and provide full support to our store colleagues. Having successfully landed our major change agenda, we now believe we have the right operational balance between the disciplined framework required as a platform for rollout with enough freedom for store managers to react to local customer requirements. As previously communicated, this improvement in both sales and customer number momentum has required a moderate level of margin investment. This growth was supported by contributions from our 11 new stores in the year. Our stores continue to develop local products specific to their community, provide local special offers, as demonstrated with our successful Christmas Hampers and the planned new BBQ packs for the warmer months ahead. Our teams have reintroduced a number of store specific favourite dishes to the ‘Butcher’ s Kitchen’ menu and continuously test new dishes/recipes with input from their customers. This provides customers with a great choice of meal occasion, such as cooked whole chickens, chicken portions, pork loins, gammon joints and ham shanks. Encouragingly, these initiatives have already contributed to an increase in customer numbers and sales. Crawshaw Group Plc Annual Report 52 weeks ended 29 January 201 7 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 05 Crawshaws VIP As part of the Facebook launch, we have also introduced the ‘Crawshaws VIP Club’ into 4 stores (2 factory shops and 2 high street). Customer driven marketing incentives We will also maintain a disciplined approach to our growth strategy, which means it is imperative that the pace and timings of the store openings are managed correctly. Accordingly, we have signed the lease for our next factory shop which is scheduled to open in May, with a sufficient pipeline and capability to open a further 4 factory shops during FY 2018. Outlook for 2018 The UK grocery market will remain competitive and, with industry-wide pressures emerging in commodities and labour costs, the UK consumer outlook will continue to be more challenging than we have seen in recent years. Whilst we would ordinarily expect these to have a modest impact on margin in the short term we believe that, with our cost management measures and margin additive initiatives, together with the expected cost reduction in our business rates, we are well placed to navigate through this challenging environment. Indeed, it has been very encouraging to see that we have already proven we are capable and well placed to meet multiple challenges simultaneously, whether they are internally or externally driven.

Summary It has been a year of considerable change and challenge as we have navigated through some unexpected external impacts in addition to experiencing some growing pains from significantly scaling up a small entrepreneurial business. Alan Richardson Chief Financial Officer 25 April 2017 Crawshaw Group Plc Annual Report 52 weeks ended 29 January 201 7 08 Our management team have extensive experience in sourcing quality meat products from tried and tested local and international suppliers at the lowest possible prices. We have our own distribution centres where we control additional processing and logistics as well as the production of our own award winning sausages, beef burgers, beef mince and grill sticks. Our retail outlets are manned with skilled butchers who are happy to help customers with advice on choosing the right product, in the right quantities as well as how to cook it. • New store locations are regularly reviewed for suitability to grow/replace our existing retail estate. As raw meat is a traded commodity, the business operates in an environment where input prices can fluctuate based on worldwide natural and economic factors such as a growing world population, climate change, exchange rates and changing dietary habits. The Company’ s purchasing and sales strategy is designed to minimise these risks by ensuring (i) we sell a broad range of products and in particular, as we split into 2 complementary retail areas, we cover 2 distinct customer types rather than relying on one product, one customer and (ii) we use a broad range of tried and tested suppliers across the globe rather than relying on any specific supplier or region. Hot and cold cooked food We have a wide range of products sold either (i) loose in a serve over counter for the traditional experience or (ii) as multi buy packs on supermarket style multi deck counters which have all been cut and packaged in store. Our factories have also consistently maintained standards whilst increasing throughput to match the increases in sales.

This standard is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. It applies to all contracts with customers, except those in the scope of other standards. However, it is not yet practicable to fully quantify the effect of IFRS 16 on these consolidated financial statements. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable. The Group’s investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. Dividends thereon are recognised as distributions within equity upon approval by the Group’s shareholders. Preference share capital is classified as a liability if it is redeemable on a specific date or at the option of the shareholders, or if dividend payments are not discretionary. T rade and other receivables are recognised at stated cost less impairment losses. It is the Company’s policy to review trade and other receivable balances for evidence of impairment at each reporting date. In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 February 2006, goodwill is included at 1 February 2006 on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP which was broadly comparable save that only separable intangibles were recognised and goodwill was amortised.
