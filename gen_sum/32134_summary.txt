towards delivering category and revenue growth but in future will be more evenly balanced with a specific focus on reducing our net debt/ebitda ratio to below 3.0x, helping ensure we generate best value for our shareholders over the medium-term. in january we announced a major cost reduction and efficiency programme designed to deliver savings of £20m over the next two years. regrettably this

generation cost & efficiency premier foods plc annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 april 2017 06 strategic report strategy in action in the uk, growing ahead of our categories continues to be a core objective for us and our plans for international are for further strong growth. this helps us identify key consumer trends such as convenience, health & wellness and indulgence which in turn informs our product innovation strategy. recent examples of new branded product ranges which illustrate this approach to innovation include oxo stock pots, cadbury amaze bites and ambrosia deluxe custard. this was primarily driven by a time lag in the recovery of increased input cost inflation and changing retailer promotional strategies which reduced gross profit. it also demonstrates successful partnerships with our customers to grow the overall categories in which we operate. progress we’ve made over the year sg&a costs rose slightly reflecting investment in sales, marketing and product development resource. we will continue to focus on consumer quality benchmarking and reformulate any products testing below par. further information on health and nutrition is set out in the section on our responsibilities on pages 18 and 19. note: grocery has been restated to include the baking category and sweet treats has been restated to include a broader definition of the ambient packaged cake category, both of which provide a closer fit to our product portfolios. strategic report operating and financial review sales group underlying sales (£m) grocery sweet treats group

international business unit continues to demonstrate excellent progress and has now delivered ten successive quarters of sales growth. partly offsetting these impacts were sg&a savings, manufacturing cost efficiencies and slightly lower marketing investment in the year. the group has worked collaboratively with customers to agree these changes and appropriate settlements were concluded. however, these mechanics are more costly than multi-buys and resulted in reduced sales per unit. deferred tax assets at 1 april 2017 were £32.4m compared to £25.9m at 2 april 2016. strategic report operating

comparative period of £13.0m. on a statutory basis, cash generated from operations was £76.8m compared to £137.1m in the comparative period. this was largely due to increased pension deficit contributions, as identified in the table above, and lower operating profit before (non-cash) impairment charges. during the year we removed more than 200 tonnes of sugar, primarily from our cake, desserts and cooking sauce brands. we also ask all of our ingredient and packaging suppliers to become members of sedex (the supplier ethical data exchange) supported by our own sedex member ethical data audits covering areas such as health & safety and labour rights. at year end, more than 94% of our direct spend was covered by sedex registered suppliers (excludes knighton foods). last year’s highlights included a company-wide charity challenge in the brecon beacons, which saw colleagues either trek 24 miles or cycle 100 miles raising an impressive £50,000 in the process and a christmas in-store campaign to raise awareness of cruk’s life-saving work to beat cancer. higher production volumes meant our non-ingredient water usage was higher in the period although overall usage intensity on a per tonne basis reduced by 3.6% through greater investment in leak prevention and improved clean down practices, particularly at our bakeries. the following charts set out our environmental performance for the financial period on both a per tonne basis and an absolute basis: environmental performance 2016/17 vs 2015/16 (per tonne) 2016/17 target 1 2016/17 performance reduce waste to

reporting progress against longer-term goals aligned with the various commitments we’ve made to industry programmes such as the food and drink federation’s (fdf) 2025 ambition and the courtauld 2025 commitment on food waste. these also reflect our formal obligations under the climate change agreement, carbon reduction commitment and european union emissions trading scheme. this is reflected in an

annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 april 2017 20 changes since last year the business has reviewed its strategy during the year to be more evenly balanced between delivering revenue growth, driving cost and efficiency savings and cash generation rather than being weighted to category and revenue growth. during the financial period grocery revenue growth targets were not met largely due to weather impacts and changes in major customers' promotional strategies. a major logistics consolidation programme is underway which will provide significant cost savings but carries some operational risk during the transition. negotiations on the 2016 pension fund revaluations have been positive, resulting in reduced cash outflows until march 2020. we are also starting to see positive outcomes from our collaboration with nissin, including the successful launch of our batchelors super noodles product in a pot format. our website also contains a more detailed discussion of operational risks seven and eight below. capital availability may be impacted by market trends which are outside the group's control e.g. us interest rate volatility and global political uncertainty. this could impact margins and/or our ability to invest in other areas of the business such as marketing or capital expenditure. longer-term climate change patterns could also undermine our business model if the product portfolio does not evolve over this period. as a result we have been able to outperform the market in many of our categories. initiatives to mitigate inflation through price increases, cost efficiencies and supply chain optimisation are well advanced. premier foods plc annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 april 2017 22 strategic risks operational risks mitigating activities mitigating activities 5. commercial arrangements the delivery of our strategic objectives is dependent on strong relationships with key customers, suppliers and distributors. there are also some short-term risks around our ability to maintain staff engagement and retain key talent. the group has recently signed non-binding heads of terms to be a strategic global partner with mondelez for cadbury cake. the logistics consolidation programme is being managed through a strong project governance framework including transition planning and risk management activities. the supplier contract has been agreed following appropriate due diligence checks and effective contractual protections are in place. operational control over sites has been consolidated with one senior manager providing a

group’s rhm pension scheme also holds assets for which quoted prices are not available. further information is set out in note 23 on pages 93 to 98. deferred tax assets a deferred tax asset is an asset on a group’s balance sheet, which may be used to reduce future taxable income. significant contracts – change of control the company has various borrowing arrangements including a revolving credit facility and senior secured notes. such an event could also be mitigated by reducing capex and / or consumer marketing expenditure. the ceo's salary therefore remains unchanged since his appointment in 2013. i look forward to your continuing support. whilst the company does not have a cap on salaries, increases are normally expected to be in line with increases across the management grades, subject to particular circumstances such as a significant change in role, responsibilities or organisation. group performance is taken into consideration when determining an appropriate level of base salary increase for the group as a whole and personal performance is taken into account when determining an appropriate level of base salary increase for the executive. performance period: one year long-term incentive plan (ltip) the premier foods long- term incentive plan ('ltip') provides a clear link to our strategic goal of returning to profitable growth with sustainable share price growth over the long-term. executive directors are expected to retain 50% of shares from vested awards under the dbp and the ltip (other than sales to settle any tax or nics due) until they reach their guideline multiple of salary in shares. increases are normally expected to be in line with the market, taking into account increases across the group as a whole, subject to particular circumstances such as a significant change in role, responsibilities or organisation. premier foods plc annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 april 2017 38 2. remuneration scenarios & weighting

product promotions and discounts. the group also focuses on revenue as a key performance measure which could create an incentive for revenue to be overstated through manipulation of rebates and discounts, resulting from the pressure management may feel to achieve performance targets. the business operates in an environment of significant retailer pressure on price, competitor activity and increasing commodity prices. forecast-based valuation as the group has a history of recent losses, there is judgement in determining whether deferred tax assets should be recognised. we consider group revenue to be the most appropriate benchmark as it is a key performance indicator. for the remaining components, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these. richard pinckard (senior statutory auditor) for and on behalf of kpmg llp, statutory auditor chartered accountants 15 canada
