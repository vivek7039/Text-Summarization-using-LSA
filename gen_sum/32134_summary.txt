1 £1,007m We also have a growing presence in the home-baking category with brands including our new Paul Hollywood range of mixes. We’re also working hard to expand internationally by finding new markets for our brands around the world. Our key customers are the major UK supermarkets but we also serve a wide range of other channels including: discounters; convenience stores; online; wholesale and food service. As a consequence, we’ve streamlined our organisational structures and this has regrettably resulted in some colleagues leaving the business. The search for a successor is underway led by Ian Krieger, Senior Independent Director and further details can be found on page 29. STRATEGIC REPORT INTRODUCTION GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 03 Brands • Unique portfolio of leading British brands • Strong insights into UK consumer • Creating innovative new products to meet consumers’ needs • Excellent operational capability • Ability to manufactur e a diverse range of pr oducts and format s • Experienced and dedicated workforce Operations We create the food the nation loves most for modern life STRATEGIC REPORT Business model As a business we believe we have certain capabilities which set us apart from our competitors. Previously this balance has been weighted more towards delivering category and revenue growth but in future will be more evenly balanced with a specific focus on reducing our net debt/EBITDA ratio to below 3.0x, helping ensure we generate best value for our shareholders over the medium-term. In January we announced a major cost reduction and efficiency programme designed to deliver savings of £20m over the next two years. Regrettably this has meant over 50 valued colleagues have had to leave the business and we wish them well in their future careers. Whilst it’s been a difficult year overall, I believe we’ve continued to make progress in many important areas helping us out-perform the marketplace.

This helps us identify key consumer trends such as convenience, health & wellness and indulgence which in turn informs our product innovation strategy. Recent examples of new branded product ranges which illustrate this approach to innovation include OXO Stock Pots, Cadbury Amaze Bites and Ambrosia Deluxe custard. This was primarily driven by a time lag in the recovery of increased input cost inflation and changing retailer promotional strategies which reduced gross profit. It also demonstrates successful partnerships with our customers to grow the overall categories in which we operate. Progress we’ve made Over the year SG&A costs rose slightly reflecting investment in sales, marketing and product development resource.

The Group’s International business unit continues to demonstrate excellent progress and has now delivered ten successive quarters of sales growth. Partly offsetting these impacts were SG&A savings, manufacturing cost efficiencies and slightly lower marketing investment in the year. STRATEGIC REPORT Operating and financial review continued Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 12 Earnings per share Continuing operations (£m) 2016/17 2015/16 Change Operating profit 61.5 54.5 7.0 Net finance cost (49.5) (44.9) (4.6) Share of loss from associates – (22.6) 22.6 Profit/(loss) before taxation 12.0 (13.0) 25.0 Taxation (charge)/credit (6.5) 47.0 (53.5) Profit after taxation 5.5 34.0 (28.5) Average shares in issue 830.1 826.0 (4.1) Basic earnings per share (pence) 0.7 4.1 (3.4) Profit before tax was £12.0m in the year, compared to a loss before tax in the comparative period of £13.0m. This was largely due to increased pension deficit contributions, as identified in the table above, and lower Operating profit before (non-cash) impairment charges. During the year we removed more than 200 tonnes of sugar, primarily from our cake, desserts and cooking sauce brands. At year end, more than 94% of our direct spend was covered by Sedex registered suppliers (excludes Knighton Foods). Last year’s highlights included a company-wide charity challenge in the Brecon Beacons, which saw colleagues either trek 24 miles or cycle 100 miles raising an impressive £50,000 in the process and a Christmas in-store campaign to raise awareness of CRUK’s life-saving work to beat cancer. The following charts set out our environmental performance for the financial period on both a per tonne basis and an absolute basis: Environmental performance 2016/17 vs 2015/16 (per tonne) 2016/17 Target 1 2016/17 Performance Reduce waste to incineration by 1.5% -6.9% Reduce energy consumption per tonne by 1.5% -6.0% Reduce non-ingredient water usage per tonne by 1.5% -3.6% Reduce carbon equivalent CO 2 emissions per tonne by 1.5% -10.2% Total energy usage (Gigawatts) Total (non-ingredient) water usage (Megalitres) Total CO 2 (e) emissions (Metric tonnes) Looking ahead, we will be moving from reporting against annual targets to reporting progress against longer-term goals aligned with the various commitments we’ve made to industry programmes such as the Food and Drink Federation’s (FDF) 2025 Ambition and the Courtauld 2025 commitment on food waste. These also reflect our formal obligations under the Climate Change Agreement, Carbon Reduction Commitment and European Union Emissions Trading Scheme.

During the financial period Grocery revenue growth targets were not met largely due to weather impacts and changes in major customers' promotional strategies. A major logistics consolidation programme is underway which will provide significant cost savings but carries some operational risk during the transition. This could impact margins and/or our ability to invest in other areas of the business such as marketing or capital expenditure. Longer-term climate change patterns could also undermine our business model if the product portfolio does not evolve over this period. Commercial arrangements The delivery of our strategic objectives is dependent on strong relationships with key customers, suppliers and distributors. There are also some short-term risks around our ability to maintain staff engagement and retain key talent. The Group has recently signed non-binding Heads of Terms to be a Strategic Global Partner with Mondelez for Cadbury cake. The logistics consolidation programme is being managed through a strong project governance framework including transition planning and risk management activities. The supplier contract has been agreed following appropriate due diligence checks and effective contractual protections are in place.

Significant contracts – change of control The Company has various borrowing arrangements including a revolving credit facility and senior secured notes. Group performance is taken into consideration when determining an appropriate level of base salary increase for the Group as a whole and personal performance is taken into account when determining an appropriate level of base salary increase for the executive. Total remuneration is made up of fixed and performance-linked elements, with each element supporting different strategic objectives. However, includes discretion to pay lower base salary with incremental increases as new appointee becomes established in the role. Senior management participate in long-term incentive arrangements reflecting their contribution to Group performance and enhancing shareholder value. Strategic objectives are focused on commercial opportunities to drive sales, generate cost savings and improve free cash flow. The two performance conditions were split 50:50 between Financial and Strategic measures subject to a Trading profit underpin. Deferred Share Bonus Plan CFO Maximum opportunity as a % of salary 30% Performance Measures (subject to a Trading profit underpin of £131.0m) Weighting Outcome Financial 50% – Short to medium-term strategic objectives 50% – 100% – Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) The current LTIP was approved by shareholders in 2011; awards have two elements, performance shares and matching shares. Estimation uncertainty impacting revenue The Group enters into commercial arrangements with its customers on a regular basis to offer product promotions and discounts. The business operates in an environment of significant retailer pressure on price, competitor activity and increasing commodity prices. Forecast-based valuation As the Group has a history of recent losses, there is judgement in determining whether deferred tax assets should be recognised. For the remaining components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these. Deferred income is recognised for rebates that were received from suppliers at the balance sheet date but relate to contracts covering future periods. All inventories are reduced to net realisable value where the estimated selling price is lower than cost. Inter-segment transfers or transactions are entered into under the same terms and conditions that would be available to unrelated third parties. No adjustment is made to the profit or loss in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share. The Directors believe it is appropriate to use a single common discount rate for all impairment testing as each CGU shares similar risk profiles. The Group also enters into contracts with suppliers for its principal raw material requirements, some of which are considered commodities, diesel and energy. (iii) Interest rate risk The Group’s borrowing facilities comprise senior secured notes and a revolving facility, in sterling. (f) Financial compliance risk Risk The Group continues to operate with a high level of net debt of £523.2m (2015/16: £534.2m) and is subject to operating within banking covenants set out in its refinancing agreement agreed with its banking syndicate, which include net debt/EBITDA and EBITDA/interest covenant tests.
