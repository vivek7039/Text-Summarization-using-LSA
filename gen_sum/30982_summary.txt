improvement in the group’s performance, as shown by ﬁve consecutive halves of improving comparative metrics, all achieved through self-funded growth. i would like to thank all my colleagues at parity for their continued support in delivering this positive run of results. we believe this is an attractive area to focus on due to strong market growth rates and the impact of an increase in demand for relatively scarce it and digital specialist skills across the broader market. we have a strong reputation with long- standing relationships in both divisions, established over 45 years of delivering successful projects. this distinctive, integrated approach is a key point of diﬀerentiation that we plan to exploit further. 249360 parity group_pp01-pp13.qxp 26/04/2018 12:10 page 6 ceo statement

also beneﬁt from greater visibility of future revenues. alan rommel chief executive oﬃcer 9 april 2018 i don’t know how to truly express our gratitude and appreciation to the parity team for the extremely high quality, eﬃciency and speed of service; every time it was beyond exceptional. data-driven insight is critical to optimising operations and developing informed business strategies for our clients. we are pleased to report that all key contracts for the business have been extended. professionals improved operational proﬁtability with higher conversion of opportunity to placement, and performed strongly against our peers. the division previously carried forward an unrecognised deferred tax asset in respect of deductible timing diﬀerences that had not been recognised due to historic ﬁnancial performance. other discontinued costs include professional advisor fees incurred in connection with actions taken to divest of inition. we have provided a sample below: o macro-economic uncertainty client project decisions can stall and recruitment activity are aﬀected by conﬁdence. we are following the same principles with a working group in place focused on gdpr. we support staﬀ to achieve expectations in their roles and there is clarity on the development required. john’s current roles include eservglobal, the innovative mobile ﬁnancial services plc, where he has served as both non-executive director and is currently executive chairman. prior to that, david has held senior ﬁnance positions in public companies across a number of sectors including ﬁnancial markets, recruitment, it services, motor retailing and advertising. roger joined the group after qualifying as an accountant in 1997, and previously held managerial roles within a variety of listed entity ﬁnance departments. the group aims to adopt a policy of diversity at all levels including selection, role assignment, teamwork and individual career development. an employee voice forum was introduced during 2017 in order to create more opportunities for upward communication and generation of ideas from all employees. appropriate written health and safety information outlining the group’s policy in each area is issued to all new employees. • fire safety — each oﬃce has an evacuation marshal who will liaise with building management or local emergency authorities, as appropriate. where possible, the group provides ﬂexibility with working hours to accommodate such commitments outside of work. as a normal part of its operations the group seeks to occupy oﬃces which have eﬃcient building management systems and, ideally, low energy lighting. i have dealt with several staﬀ from parity all of which were friendly, approachable, helpful and understanding. annual appraisals are held of each director, providing feedback and reviewing any training or development needs. there is an agreed procedure for directors to obtain independent professional advice, if necessary, at the company’s expense. regular updates are provided by the heads of shared service functions such as marketing, hr and it. the non- executive directors ensure that independent judgement is brought to board discussions and decisions. advice on share options and co-investment plans is provided by pinsent masons, who also provide other legal services to the group. 249360 parity group_pp14-pp34.qxp
