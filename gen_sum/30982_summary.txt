Strategically, Parity believes it has established a clear point of diﬀerentiation from competitors due to the synergy between its consulting and professional services divisions. It helps customers transform the way they deliver their services to improve speed, eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness. Group By aligning both divisions, Parity provides an attractive combination of trusted consultancy advice with access to the best delivery expertise. When necessary, we supplement our industry and technology specialists with access to the broader contractor market through Parity Professionals. The model is now proven, and we look forward to accelerating it during 2018 and 2019. www.parity.net www.parityprofessionals.co.uk www.parityconsultancyservices.co.uk 249360 Parity Group_pp01-pp13.qxp  26/04/2018  12:10  Page 5 CEO Statement 6               Parity Group plc                                         www.parity.net                  Report and Accounts 2017                       stock code: PTY Alan Rommel – Chief Executive Oﬃcer Introduction  I am delighted by the continuing improvement in the Group’s performance, as shown by ﬁve consecutive halves of improving comparative metrics, all achieved through self-funded growth. I would like to thank all my colleagues at Parity for their continued support in delivering this positive run of results. We believe this is an attractive area to focus on due to strong market growth rates and the impact of an increase in demand for relatively scarce IT and digital specialist skills across the broader market. We have a strong reputation with long- standing relationships in both divisions, established over 45 years of delivering successful projects. This distinctive, integrated approach is a key point of diﬀerentiation that we plan to exploit further. 249360 Parity Group_pp01-pp13.qxp  26/04/2018  12:10  Page 6 CEO Statement (continued) 7 Strategic Report Governance Accounts, notes and other information 2017 Performance Our emerging strategy has already driven growth in the more proﬁtable Consultancy Services where we also beneﬁt from greater visibility of future revenues. Alan Rommel Chief Executive Oﬃcer 9 April 2018 I don’t know how to truly express our gratitude and appreciation to the Parity team for the extremely high quality, eﬃciency and speed of service; every time it was beyond exceptional. Data-driven insight is critical to optimising operations and developing informed business strategies for our clients. Professionals improved operational proﬁtability with higher conversion of opportunity to placement, and performed strongly against our peers. The division previously carried forward an unrecognised deferred tax asset in respect of deductible timing diﬀerences that had not been recognised due to historic ﬁnancial performance. We have taken a prudent view on the division’s carried forward tax losses which remain unrecognised, but will keep this under review. Other discontinued costs include professional advisor fees incurred in connection with actions taken to divest of Inition. We have provided a sample below: o     Macro-economic uncertainty Client project decisions can stall and recruitment activity are aﬀected by conﬁdence. We are following the same principles with a working group in place focused on GDPR. We support staﬀ to achieve expectations in their roles and there is clarity on the development required. John’s current roles include eServGlobal, the innovative mobile ﬁnancial services plc, where he has served as both Non-Executive Director and is currently Executive Chairman. Prior to that, David has held senior ﬁnance positions in public companies across a number of sectors including ﬁnancial markets, recruitment, IT services, motor retailing and advertising. Roger joined the Group after qualifying as an accountant in 1997, and previously held managerial roles within a variety of listed entity ﬁnance departments. The Group aims to adopt a policy of diversity at all levels including selection, role assignment, teamwork and individual career development. An Employee Voice forum was introduced during 2017 in order to create more opportunities for upward communication and generation of ideas from all employees. Appropriate written health and safety information outlining the Group’s policy in each area is issued to all new employees. •     Fire safety — Each oﬃce has an evacuation marshal who will liaise with building management or local emergency authorities, as appropriate. Where possible, the Group provides ﬂexibility with working hours to accommodate such commitments outside of work. As a normal part of its operations the Group seeks to occupy oﬃces which have eﬃcient building management systems and, ideally, low energy lighting. I have dealt with several staﬀ from Parity all of which were friendly, approachable, helpful and understanding. Annual appraisals are held of each Director, providing feedback and reviewing any training or development needs. There is an agreed procedure for Directors to obtain independent professional advice, if necessary, at the Company’s expense. Inition is a non-core separate business oﬀering, acquired under the previous strategy, and was held for sale during 2017. Regular updates are provided by the heads of Shared Service functions such as Marketing, HR and IT. The Non- Executive Directors ensure that independent judgement is brought to Board discussions and decisions. Details of Davids’s recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience are set out in his biography on page 14. Advice on share options and Co-investment Plans is provided by Pinsent Masons, who also provide other legal services to the Group. 249360 Parity Group_pp14-pp34.qxp  26/04/2018  12:11  Page 26 Remuneration Report (continued) 27 Strategic Report Governance Accounts, notes and other information Executive share option plans (continued) Executive Share Options granted after 2004 are exercisable in normal circumstances between three and ten years after the date of grant. Options granted under the Sharesave Scheme do not have performance related conditions attached to them. They are entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred by them in carrying out their duties as Directors of the Company. Service contracts and letters of appointment The Group’s policy is that no Director has a service contract with a notice period of greater than one year or has provision for pre-determined compensation on termination which exceeds one year’s salary, bonus and beneﬁts in kind. The Group believes that such appointments provide a valuable opportunity in terms of personal and professional development.

It is not anticipated that there will be a material impact in respect of IFRS 9, as the Group has minimal ﬁnancial assets (except for trade debtors). Non-current assets are stated at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Rebates may be applicable on a sliding scale where the candidate’s employment is terminated within nine weeks. Software is amortised on a straight line basis over its expected useful economic life of three to seven years. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the eﬀective interest method, less any impairment losses. Such assets, or disposal groups, are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

Save As You Earn options lapse if not exercised within six months after the vesting date. Accordingly, the Group’s proﬁts for this accounting period are subject to tax at a rate of 19.25% (2016: 20%). As such, the Directors have recognised a deferred tax asset for all deductible temporary diﬀerences available to Parity Consultancy Services. 18 Trade and other payables Consolidated Company 2017 2016 2017 2016 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 Amounts falling due within one year: Payments in advance 16 594 - - Trade payables 5,318 6,018 14 - Amounts due to subsidiary undertakings - - 10,967 10,724 Other tax and social security payables 1,450 1,126 21 21 Other payables and accruals 1,565 1,366 139 174 8,349 9,104 11,141 10,919 Amounts falling due after one year: Amounts due to subsidiary undertakings - - 121,384 121,255 Total 8,349 9,104 132,525 132,174 Strategic Report Governance Accounts, notes and other information 249360 Parity Group_pp55-pp63.qxp  26/04/2018  12:14  Page 63 Notes to the accounts (continued) 64             Parity Group plc                                         www.parity.net                  Report and Accounts 2017                       stock code: PTY 19  Provisions  Leasehold dilapidations Total  Consolidated £’000 £’000 At 1 January 2017 17 17 Created in year 1 1 At 31 December 2017 18 18 Due after more than one year 18 18 Total 18 18 At the Balance Sheet date the Company had no provisions (2016: No provisions).

It is Group policy to assess the credit risk of new customers before entering contracts. Quantitative disclosures of the credit risk exposure in relation to ﬁnancial assets are set out below. Interest costs on borrowings from the asset-based ﬁnancing facility with PNC was charged at 2.35% above base rate throughout 2017 (2016: 2.5% until 1 September 2016 and 2.35% subsequently). Interest on all loans is charged at 2.0% above the prevailing Bank of England base rate, except for one loan with Parity International B.V. which is charged at 2.0% above the prevailing European Central Bank base rate. The Group’s net assets arising from overseas operations are exposed to currency risk resulting in gains or losses on retranslation into sterling. Owing to the small value and volume of such contracts no hedging transactions were entered in 2017 or 2016. It is a funded deﬁned beneﬁt scheme and has been closed to new members since 1995. During March 2015 the Trustees agreed to a temporary suspension of contributions, and subsequently extended this agreement until July 2016. This was achieved by using liability driven investment, which provides leveraged exposure to bond-like assets. This comprises emoluments received, pension contributions and share based payment charges (2016: included compensation for loss of oﬃce).
