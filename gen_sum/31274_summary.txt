government-backed innovate uk knowledge transfer partnership with manchester metropolitan university to undertake research on a new form of stem cell technology in march 2018. through our three divisions, we are focused on making stem cell treatment affordable and accessible for families around the world. cellplan will be launched to cryoviva customers on a phased basis, commencing in h2 2018, providing staged revenue increases. whilst the group had been offering umbilical cord stem cells processing and storage services through a third-party storage facility under its babycells brand in portugal between 2014 and early 2015, it was only post period end in february 2018 that widecells was awarded a human application licence by the uk’s human tissue authority (“hta”). in support of this, we believe we have a very strong product offering, as alongside offering clients state-of-the-art storage services, new babycells clients will be given a year’s stem cell insurance cover, provided by our cellplan division. our leading stem cell scientists have, for example, been appointed by qigenix, a california-based clinical stage medical device company, to undertake research on its behalf, testing a new laser technology designed to increase the homing and integration of stem cells. as part of these board changes, dr. graham hine, my predecessor as chairman, retired from his board role; i would like to thank him for all his work and support in helping advance the group to a point of international growth and development. peter presland non-executive chairman 4 june 2018 widecells group plc annual report & accounts 2017––––––– 10 stem cell therapy is gaining increasing recognition for its life-saving potential in a wide-range of medical applications. this is accordingly an opportune time to be building a leading position within the stem cell industry and having successfully launched our ﬁrst of its kind end-to-end stem cell service that covers storage, insurance, research and education/training, we are now focused on achieving global roll-out to build revenues, drive development and ultimately ensure that all people, regardless of geography or ﬁnancial position, have access to stem cell treatment. however, looking at the limitations, whilst over 4,000,000 people have stored cord blood with over 500 cord blood bank companies that exist worldwide, paying c.£2,000 to do so, many do not realise that if treatment is needed costs could climb to as high as £300,000, making it unaffordable for many. it is because of these limitations and strong growth dynamics that we have created our end-to-end stem cell service. principal activities and business review widecells group is an international specialised provider of stem cell services. furthermore, the group maintains an active growth strategy and will continue to target new partner cord blood banks as policies are adapted for local insurance requirements. widecells group plc annual

which facilitates low-cost global rollout. the cellplan insurance product is, and will continue to be available for selected potential customers via its e-commerce platform. in addition, there is an option to further expand capacity on the current site if required. key performance indicators 2017 2016 change turnover £50,765 £25,000 103% operating loss (£2,789,463) (£1,236,719) 126% net cash
