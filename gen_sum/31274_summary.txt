Keeping this in mind, WideCells Group PLC has been developing its three divisions: • CellPlan: The world’s ﬁrst stem cell healthcare insurance plan providing ﬁnancial cover for a second medical opinion and recommendation of the best transplant centre worldwide, private cord blood transplantation costs, travel to treatment centre where required, accommodation expenses and concierge service to manage the whole transplant process. Collection of cord blood at birth is simple, safe and painless compared to other sources of haemopoietic stem cells such as bone marrow, which requires a general anaesthetic and a surgical procedure to collect. WideCells Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017––––––– 2 • Launched a portfolio of stem cell services designed to make stem cell treatments accessible and affordable worldwide • Focused on driving global sales and revenues across the Group’s three divisions: • Innovative insurance product CellPlan, the world’s ﬁrst insurance plan and medical concierge service for the cord blood stem cell industry • Secured a number of commercial agreements with stem cell banks to facilitate roll-out and launched a bespoke e-commerce platform • Fully live in the UK with initial sales secured as part of a test launch to customers of Biovault, a leading storage facility • Launch in Spain underway • Agreements in place to launch in Thailand, Singapore India and Brazil in H2 2018 • Stem cell storage and pioneering research work, operated via WideCells Ltd’s state-of-the-art Institute of Stem Cell Technology (ISCT) in Manchester, UK • Awarded Human Tissue Authority (HTA) research licence July 2017 to undertake paid- for-research work on stem cell therapy and regenerative medicine – three projects already secured, which are collectively worth ~£300,000 • Includes government-backed Innovate UK Knowledge Transfer Partnership with Manchester Metropolitan University to undertake research on a new form of stem cell technology in March 2018. • Includes government-backed Innovate UK Knowledge Transfer Partnership with Manchester Metropolitan University to undertake research on a new form of stem cell technology in March 2018. The aim is now to roll CellPlan out internationally I am delighted to be part of this ground-breaking company and deliver my inaugural statement as its Chairman; the prospects of WideCells Group truly excite me. Through our three divisions, we are focused on making stem cell treatment affordable and accessible for families around the world. CellPlan will be launched to Cryoviva customers on a phased basis, commencing in H2 2018, providing staged revenue increases. Whilst the Group had been offering umbilical cord stem cells processing and storage services through a third-party storage facility under its BabyCells brand in Portugal between 2014 and early 2015, it was only post period end in February 2018 that WideCells was awarded a Human Application Licence by the UK’s Human Tissue Authority (“HTA”). In support of this, we believe we have a very strong product offering, as alongside offering clients state-of-the-art storage services, new BabyCells clients will be given a year’s stem cell insurance cover, provided by our CellPlan division. Our leading stem cell scientists have, for example, been appointed by Qigenix, a California-based clinical stage medical device company, to undertake research on its behalf, testing a new laser technology designed to increase the homing and integration of stem cells. As part of these board changes, Dr. Graham Hine, my predecessor as Chairman, retired from his board role; I would like to thank him for all his work and support in helping advance the Group to a point of international growth and development. A new Scientiﬁc Advisory Committee consisting of leading ﬁgures in the industry was also appointed. Finally, post-period end, investors will be aware that trading in our shares was suspended. Having received commitments in respect of approximately £1.47 million via a placing, and with a live market bookbuild underway to bolster this further, we have been able to successfully conclude the auditing of our annual accounts. Peter Presland Non-Executive Chairman 4 June 2018 WideCells Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017––––––– 10 Stem cell therapy is gaining increasing recognition for its life-saving potential in a wide-range of medical applications. This is accordingly an opportune time to be building a leading position within the stem cell industry and having successfully launched our ﬁrst of its kind end-to-end stem cell service that covers storage, insurance, research and education/training, we are now focused on achieving global roll-out to build revenues, drive development and ultimately ensure that all people, regardless of geography or ﬁnancial position, have access to stem cell treatment. However, looking at the limitations, whilst over 4,000,000 people have stored cord blood with over 500 cord blood bank companies that exist worldwide, paying c.£2,000 to do so, many do not realise that if treatment is needed costs could climb to as high as £300,000, making it unaffordable for many. It is because of these limitations and strong growth dynamics that we have created our end-to-end stem cell service. PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES AND BUSINESS REVIEW WideCells Group is an international specialised provider of stem cell services. It will offer a series of online stem cell training programmes for healthcare professionals. Furthermore, the Group maintains an active growth strategy and will continue to target new partner cord blood banks as policies are adapted for local insurance requirements. WideCells Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017––––––– 14 Strategic Report The Group has an active growth strategy to further build CellPlan’s global reach and increase sales, which is in part via the e-commerce platform, which facilitates low-cost global rollout. The CellPlan insurance product is, and will continue to be available for selected potential customers via its e-commerce platform. Through an extended provider network, CellPlan insurance will be offered to families which store their child’s stem cells in cord blood storage facilities which are of high quality in terms of licensing and accreditation. In addition, there is an option to further expand capacity on the current site if required.

Maintenance of such licences may present a damaging or insurmountable barrier to its business development and growth if the necessary licences cannot be obtained or maintained in a ﬁnancially and commercially viable manner. In such circumstances the development programmes may be delayed or cancelled and business operations cut back. The Group seeks to reduce this risk by keeping a tight control on expenditure, avoiding long-term supplier contracts, prioritising development spend on products closest to potential revenue generation, maintaining a focused portfolio of products under development and by keeping shareholders informed of progress.
