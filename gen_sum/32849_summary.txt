Playing to our strengths Over the last 20 years, we have built on our core competencies: using a hub-based system (Dukat, Omolon and Okhotsk); mastering POX technology and trading refractory gold concentrates (Kyzyl, Albazino, Mayskoye); operating successfully in difficult climatic conditions at locations with little or no existing infrastructure (five operations in the Russian Far East).

The gold price grew by 13.5% – its biggest annual gain since 2010 – and outperformed all major asset classes other than stocks. This performance was primarily supported by a weakened US Dollar, as well as heightened investor uncertainty on the back of geopolitical instability and a potential pullback on increased P/E ratios and expensive stock valuations, which fuelled investor flows into gold in order to manage risk exposure. The decline was driven by substantially lower retail investment demand and lagging ETFs, which only added one-third of 2016’s inflows. Moreover, palladium prices were further bolstered due to a substantial supply deficit on the back of mining issues in South Africa.

Adjusted EBITDA increased by 3% to US$120 million, despite the appreciation of Russian Rouble, which negatively affected total cash costs. At Tsokol, underground development continued with 153 Kt of ore mined and a slight decrease in the average gold grade to 10.4 g/t. Processing In 2017, ore processed at the flotation circuit decreased by 15% year-on-year to 644 Kt, as planned, with an average gold grade of 5.4 g/t (2016: 5.3 g/t). At Khakanja CIP plant, processing volumes remained flat at 623 Kt, with feed mainly drawn from high-grade Avlayakan ore. Gold equivalent production during 2017 decreased by 3% as expected, since the historic reserves are being depleted and the plant is mainly focused on stockpile and third-party material processing. In 2018, the Company plans to undertake an additional 15 km of core drilling targeting both resource-to-reserve conversion and further resource growth. In 2018, we plan to continue exploring this highly promising property that may significantly extend the life-of-mine and halt production decline at Voro.

Development Prognoz is the largest undeveloped primary silver deposit in Eurasia with an outstanding exploration upside (only 40% of known vein outcrop has been tested by drilling). Individual units across our production facilities, plants and mines which have been classified as ‘hazardous’ are all fully insured. In recent years, the number of our underground mining operations has increased, with more complex and challenging geomechanical conditions. Despite more employees working in these conditions, and the increased number of production sites, we are encouraged that our Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) has declined from 0.19 to 0.15. Most of these injuries occurred at sites where our CRM system had not been fully implemented and this is now an urgent priority. Overall, this new system has reduced injury risk and we hope will prevent repeat of past accidents in the future. Both employees had more than 15 years’ experience working in hazardous conditions, including chemicals, cold climate, noise, vibration, dust and hard physical work. Our Group-wide Environmental Management System (EMS) helps us manage these risks, driving resource and energy efficiency across the business. In particular accountants, geologists, dispatchers, engineers, inspectors, mechanics, quantity surveyors, editors, economists, energy specialists, legal advisors etc., and assistants to these positions. • Adjusted EBITDA 1 was US$745 million, down 2% compared with 2016, as increased costs incurred due to a stronger Russian Rouble largely offset the production growth. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes the impact of certain accounting adjustments (mainly non-cash items) that can mask underlying changes in core operating performance. Though income statement volatility may arise in financial reporting, Polymetal believes that the underlying matching of revenue cash flows against debt repayments and related interest represents an economically effective hedging strategy.

Exploration spending is expected to stay elevated as Polymetal will continue its aggressive drilling campaign at the Prognoz silver project. Companies in the mining sector are challenged with managing a rapidly changing risk landscape, including market volatility, widespread macroeconomic changes, geopolitical crises and environmental risks. An approved production programme includes increased volume of operational prospecting works, such as in-fill drilling and grade control sampling. CHAIRMAN’S LETTER Respect for our stakeholders, employees and the environment are all integral to making Polymetal a profitable business. 2 Mr Homeniuk served as a Director in 2017 and will not be offering himself for re-election at the AGM 2018. ROMAN SHESTAKOV DEPUTY CEO, PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION Appointed: 2009 Experience: Chief Engineer at Gold of Northern Urals, 2007-2009; pit superintendent 2006-2007. The Board has determined Jonathan Best, Christine Coignard, Leonard Homeniuk, Russell Skirrow, Tracey Kerr and Giacomo Baizini to be independent non-executive Directors. The challenge of succession Recognised pressure for forthcoming Board refreshment, and importantly that Polymetal’s strong Group CEO would be difficult to replace. It is our intention that Deloitte will be invited to participate in this tender process, along with other appropriately qualified international audit firms. Stringent PSP vesting conditions, based on above median relative TSR and underpinned by positive absolute shareholder returns, are therefore fully aligned with shareholder- value creation. Where a recoverability risk has been identified, we have recalculated the projected net realisable values based on expected commodity prices, technological recoveries and costs to complete.

In May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15), which covers principles that an entity shall apply to report information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for that product based on forward metal prices for inventories which are expected to be realised within 12 months, and the flat long-term metal prices non-current inventories, less estimated costs to complete production and selling costs. Revenue is presented net of refining and treatment charges which are subtracted in calculating the amount to be invoiced. In making the assessment for impairment indicators, assets that do not generate independent cash inflows are allocated to an appropriate cash-generating unit. Cash flow projections used in fair value less costs of disposal impairment models are discounted based on this rate. The asset comprises an active open pit mine and a 500 ktpa heap leach facility with grid power available on site. In addition, a deferred consideration contingent upon future production levels and gold price performance, will be paid to Kazzinc LTD. Depreciation expense, which is excluded from the Group’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA (see Note 5), also excludes amounts absorbed into unsold metal inventory balances. The Group’s estimate of future taxable income is based on established proven and probable reserves which can be economically developed. Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely in accordance with enacted changes to Russian Federation legislation described above. As a result, the Group is subject to transaction and translation exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
