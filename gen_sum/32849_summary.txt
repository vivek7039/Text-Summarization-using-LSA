global metrics but, nevertheless, a respectable milestone for a business built from the ground up in an emerging market. during that time, the company has delivered a production compound annual growth rate (cagr) of 24%, developed 16 mines from scratch, added 6.7 moz of gold equivalent and 9.5 moz of palladium equivalent in newly discovered resources, paid out more than us$1 billion in dividends and attained industry leadership in processing refractory gold ore. we have expanded our operations within three mining jurisdictions in the former soviet union (russia, kazakhstan and armenia) and have maintained a premium listing on the london stock exchange since 2011. playing to our strengths over the last 20 years, we have built on our core competencies: using a hub-based system (dukat, omolon and okhotsk); mastering pox technology and trading refractory gold concentrates (kyzyl, albazino, mayskoye); operating successfully in difficult climatic conditions at locations with little or no existing infrastructure (five operations in the russian far east). just one year after launch, svetloye delivered superior results while komar provided strong support to our varvara operations. however, this was partially offset by the best performance in gold prices since 2010, with 13% annual growth. health and safety still a key focus although there has been some improvement in our health and safety performance, there is no room for complacency since, sadly, we have to report the death of two employees in 2017 . last, but by no means least, i wish to thank our employees for all their commitment and professionalism. for the sixth consecutive year, we beat our production guidance through a consistently robust and resilient operating performance. to further streamline logistics and reduce haulage costs, a new railway spur has been commissioned at komar. production 106 ge koz 2016: 23 ge koz average pox recovery 96.4% 2016: 94.5% production 130 ge koz +54% production 50 ge koz

create significant shareholder returns construction activities are now focused on the installation of smaller technological equipment and kyzyl is on track to produce the first concentrate in q3 2018. first ore has already been mined from the open-pit ahead of schedule in january 2018. there is a strong demand for concentrate from multiple offtakers with the first contract signed in q1 2018. expansion of amursk pox plant targets an increase in pox capacity, enabling polymetal to retain approximately 50% of kyzyl concentrate for in-house treatment, as opposed to a third-party offtake. see

potential pullback on increased p/e ratios and expensive stock valuations, which fuelled investor flows into gold in order to manage risk exposure. platinum group metals 2017 was an interesting year for pgms, primarily led by palladium’s stellar performance. moreover, palladium prices were further bolstered due to a substantial supply deficit on the back of mining issues in south africa. to learn

primary silver deposit in eurasia with an outstanding exploration upside (only 40% of known vein outcrop has been tested by drilling). stakeholder engagement and materiality it is important to understand our stakeholders’ perspectives on sustainability issues. in 2018, we will evaluate the results of our assessment and ensure all priorities are being addressed effectively. we also make social investments, helping to improve people’s livelihoods and strengthening our relationships with local communities. we continually promote safety behaviours to ensure all our people and contractors work in a safe environment. individual units across our production facilities, plants and mines which have been classified as ‘hazardous’ are all fully insured. in 2017 , we implemented our new critical risks management (crm) system, identifying critical risks for 2018. while the greatest hazards at our sites are from falling rock, road transportation accidents and falling (slipping), we have seen reduced exposure in the past year from these categories. we have upgraded the risk of fire to ‘critical’; controlling measures for flammable materials is a particular challenge. in recent years, the number of our underground mining operations has increased, with more complex and challenging geomechanical conditions. despite more employees working in these conditions, and the increased number of production sites, we are encouraged that our lost time injury frequency rate (ltifr) has declined from 0.19 to 0.15. while we are also encouraged that the overall number of fatalities in our operations has reduced by 50% in the past year, any fatality at polymetal is one too many. we are helping our employees to better identify risks and effectively prevent any incidents in the future. most of these injuries occurred at sites where our crm system had not been fully implemented and this is now an urgent priority. overall, this new system has reduced injury risk and we hope will prevent repeat of past accidents in the future. we clarify competence requirements for each relevant job description and heads of business units identify training needs. both employees had more than 15 years’ experience working in hazardous conditions, including chemicals, cold climate, noise, vibration, dust and hard physical work. our group-wide environmental management system (ems) helps us manage these risks, driving resource and energy efficiency across the business. we are rigorous in our handling, management and monitoring of cyanide due to its hazardous potential. our new energy management system has been developed in compliance with iso-50001 and will be implemented across the company in 2018. following a feasibility study into alternative energy sources in 2017 , approval has been given for a solar power plant at svetloye and a wind farm at the seaport of unchi, with the aim of launching both during 2018. greenhouse gas emissions heat and electricity from our diesel generators, as well as our mining fleet operations, produce greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions. it sets out our zero-tolerance approach to drug use, conflicts of interest, bribery and bullying. no court cases relating to corruption were brought against the company or any of our employees. all issues raised by employees through our internal communication systems are considered and investigated promptly. over the last seven years, we have been steadily reducing our average employee turnover rate (including fly-in/fly-out operations). in particular accountants, geologists, dispatchers, engineers, inspectors, mechanics, quantity surveyors, editors, economists, energy specialists, legal advisors etc., and assistants to these positions. • adjusted ebitda 1 was us$745 million, down 2% compared with 2016, as increased costs incurred due to a stronger russian rouble largely offset the production growth. % changes can be different from zero even when absolute amounts are unchanged because of rounding. strategic report governance financial statements appendices polymetal international plc annual report & accounts 2017 61 polymetal international plc annual report & accounts 2017 60 financial review the total cost of labour within cash operating costs in 2017 was us$183 million, a 24% increase over 2016, mainly stemming from additional labour costs at the new kapan, komar and svetloye operations and annual salary increases (tracking domestic cpi inflation). during 2017 , the group released us$6 million of accrued penalties and interest due to settlements with tax authorities at kapan and paid us$6 million in relation to royalty provisions identified as of 31 december 2016. there were no other significant changes in tax provisions. gold equivalent sales volume is calculated based on average realised metal prices in the relevant period. in 2017 , total cash costs (tcc) per gold equivalent ounce sold were us$658/ge oz, up 15%

increased year-on-year across all operating mines, except for svetloye and mayskoye where strong operating performances outweighed the effect of other factors resulting in decreased aisc. adjusted ebitda also excludes the impact of certain accounting adjustments (mainly non-cash items) that can mask underlying changes in core operating performance. the company defines adjusted ebitda (a non-ifrs measure) as profit for the period adjusted for depreciation and amortisation, write-downs and reversals of inventory to net realisable value, share-based compensation expenses, rehabilitation expenses, bad debt allowance, foreign exchange gains or losses, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, finance income, finance costs, income tax expense and other tax exposures accrued within other operating expenses. • at albazino/amursk, tcc was us$676/ge oz, up 28% compared with 2016. the cost increase was mostly attributable to a seven-week maintenance and retrofit shutdown in may plus an additional 15-day maintenance shutdown in q4, as well as processing of higher cost third-party concentrate. though income statement volatility may arise in financial reporting, polymetal believes that the underlying matching of revenue cash flows against debt repayments and related interest represents an economically effective hedging strategy. financial review adjusted ebitda by

then determined and implemented to bring the risk within acceptable tolerance levels. companies in the mining sector are challenged with managing a rapidly changing risk landscape, including market volatility, widespread macroeconomic changes, geopolitical crises and environmental risks. further detail on our approach to assessing long-term viability can be found on page 112. risk management and internal control systems are continuously enhanced in accordance with coso erm framework and are adjusted for any changes to the uk corporate governance code. an approved production programme includes increased volume of operational prospecting works, such as in-fill drilling and grade control sampling. there is an increased focus on health and safety – refer to pages 52-53 of this report. we are continuously improving our construction risk management systems and employ leading world-class consultants in applicable areas. the company operates a certified environmental management system which meets international standards and is audited for compliance. these factors may have an adverse effect on the group’s market value and operating environment. during 2017 there was moderate volatility of the russian rouble and kazakh tenge exchange rates against foreign currencies. the group ensures that significant undrawn committed facilities are in place to cover any funding gaps. chairman’s letter respect for our stakeholders, employees and the environment are all integral to making polymetal a profitable business. kyzyl takes centre stage when it launches later this year successfully fulfilling our medium-term growth plans. succession planning is also of vital importance in ensuring that we are able to access a combination of skills and experience across all levels that will, in turn, deliver the effective and strategic leadership needed to take the business forward. 1 mr skirrow served as a director in 2017 and will not be offering himself for re-election at the agm 2018. 2

non-executive directors. mr godsell’s other significant commitment is a non-executive directorship in the south african industrial development corporation. at the company’s 2017 agm, we received votes representing approximately 69% of our issued share capital. the challenge of succession recognised pressure for forthcoming board refreshment, and importantly that polymetal’s strong group ceo would be difficult to replace. we enjoy a frank and open working relationship with polymetal’s chairman, group ceo, chief financial officer, the external lead audit partner and head of internal audit – all key players in upholding good standards of corporate governance across the business. it is our intention that deloitte will be invited to participate in this tender process, along with other appropriately qualified international audit firms. the external audit was carried out by an independent center for cyber security, jet infosystem. the group has a code of conduct in place, which

may be terminated by either party on one month’s notice. a non-executive director is not entitled to receive any compensation on termination of his or her appointment. the group ceo’s remuneration is denominated in russian roubles and converted to us dollars for presentation purposes. it was based on an internally developed questionnaire, taking into account on the one hand external factors including our group regulatory environment, applicable governance as well as internationally acknowledged best practice, and on the other hand internal factors relating to group matters including the remuneration policy and its application together with committee’s terms of reference, yearly agenda, ways of working and output. the board is confident that routine operational risks are being effectively monitored and managed within the three-year lookout period and corporate scenario planning is focusing primarily on plausible changing external factors with a reasonable degree of confidence whilst still providing an appropriate longer-term outlook. the company may, by ordinary resolution, appoint another person in place of a director removed from office. this provision does not affect any indemnity to which a director or officer is otherwise entitled. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. e&e costs, including geophysical, topographical, geological and similar types of costs, are capitalised into exploration assets if management concludes that future economic benefits are likely to be realised based on an assessment of exploration results and identified mineral resources. where a recoverability risk has been identified, we have recalculated the projected net realisable values based on expected commodity prices, technological recoveries and costs to complete. our audit scope focused primarily on nine identified components (voro, okhotsk, dukat, omolon, varvara, amursk-albazino, mayskoye, kyzyl and another single component comprising the support function corporate entities) such that 96% of revenue (2016: 100%) and 98% of assets (2016: 97%) were subject to a full scope audit. james leigh, fca for and on behalf of deloitte llp recognized auditor london 9 march 2018 consolidated financial

assessing its going concern status, the group has taken account of its financial position, anticipated future trading performance, its borrowings and other available credit facilities, and its forecast compliance with covenants on those borrowings and its capital expenditure commitments and plans. the group has determined these amendments do not have significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. in may 2014, the iasb issued ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers (ifrs 15), which covers principles that an entity shall apply to report information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer. this standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018, and permits early adoption. the group doesn’t expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in equity are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest was disposed of. cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for that product based on forward metal prices for inventories which are expected to be realised within 12 months, and the flat long-term metal prices non-current inventories, less estimated costs to complete production and selling costs. loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment. further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 28. strategic report governance financial statements appendices polymetal international plc annual report & accounts 2017 133 polymetal

the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. this final stage of processing is carried out on a toll-treatment basis at four state-owned refineries. sales of copper, zinc, gold and silver concentrate the group sells copper, zinc, gold and silver concentrate under pricing arrangements where final prices are determined by quoted market prices in a period subsequent to the date of sale. concentrate sales are initially recorded based on forward prices for the expected date of final settlement. revenue is presented net of refining and treatment charges which are subtracted in calculating the amount to be invoiced. in making the assessment for impairment indicators, assets that do not generate independent cash inflows are allocated to an appropriate cash-generating unit. cash flow projections used in fair value less costs of disposal impairment models are discounted based on this rate. strategic report governance financial

critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued recoverability of deferred tax assets deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised (note 16). gross tax losses carried forward of

subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable as follows: • level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. as a result, the group is subject to transaction and translation exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. a significant portion of the group’s trade accounts receivable is due from reputable export trading companies. the assumptions used in the calculation and fair value of one award, calculated based on those assumptions, are set in the table below: tranche 2014 tranche 2015 tranche 2016 tranche 2017 risk free rate 1.60% 1.17% 1.11% 1.60% expected volatility 46.14% 43.70% 42.05%
