Experience Kanat Assaubayev is one of Kazakhstan’s leading entrepreneurs in the natural resources sector. He was formerly the Vice Chairman of Renaissance Group, where his position was a senior investment-banking role, and prior to that he worked with international firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP . He has worked with natural resources since joining Antofagasta during its 1990s transformation into a major copper producer with the US$1.3bn Los Pelambres and US$0.3bn El Tesoro mines taken into production. Following that he was CFO of gold explorer Brancote until its US$0.4bn acquisition. He has served as a director of companies on the AIM, ASX, LSE, JSE and TSX. The exploration and evaluation work conducted so far indicate substantial economic exploitable reserves. The Directors anticipate that while they may seek to raise further finance in the future it now has access to sufficient funds for its immediate need, and have therefore prepared these financial statements on a going concern basis. Directors’ emoluments Details of Directors’ emoluments for the Group for the year are as follows: 2017 2016 Fee Fee £’000 £’000 Kanat Assaubayev – – Ashar Qureshi – – Sanzhar Assaubayev – – Aidar Assaubayev – – Ken Crichton – 2 Neil Herbert 24 27 Total 24 29 Service contracts The Non-Executive Directors have contracts with a rolling one-month notice period which may be given by either party. At each Annual General Meeting, one third of the Directors must retire by rotation, whereupon they can offer themselves for re-election if eligible. The internal control system can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Directors do not believe an internal audit function is practicable for a company of this size. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at £50,000, being 2% of total assets (2016: £50,000). Materiality for the parent company financial statements was set at £45,000, being 2% of total assets (2016: £45,000). We also agreed to report differences below this threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. The Group’s operations principally comprise exploration & evaluation of mining assets located in Kazakhstan. These locations, which were subject to full scope audit procedures represent the principal business units. How the matter was addressed in our audit We evaluated Management and Board’s assessment of whether there were any facts or circumstances that would suggest that the assets would not be recoverable.

Accounting policies continued New accounting standards and amendments continued IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ is not expected to have a material impact on the Group at this stage of the Group’s operations. Basis of consolidation Where the Company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in profit or loss. Interest expense includes initial transaction costs and any premium payable on redemption, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is not settled; p liability components of convertible loan notes are measured as described further below; p trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using an effective interest method; p loans from related parties are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Kemin Resources Plc Annual Report 2017 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued year ended 31 December 2017 24 1. Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of such assets other than land over their useful economic lives on a straight line basis. It is therefore reasonably possible that changes could occur which may affect the recoverability of assets. Changes in estimates are dealt with on a prospective basis as they arise. Management has considered whether any indicators of impairment have arisen over certain assets relating to the Group’s exploration licenses. As a result there could be significant adjustments to the provisions established which would affect future results. (iv) Fair value of financial instruments The Group determines the fair value of financial instruments that are not quoted, based on estimates using present values or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows. As a result, tax liabilities are recognised based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due.
