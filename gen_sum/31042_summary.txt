strategy, business model, capabilities, values, long-term track record and key risks. in early 2018, enquest agreed renegotiated terms for the transocean leader drilling rig, reducing both the contract duration and day rates, saving c.$60 million of net cash payments for capital expenditure in 2019. kraken full cycle gross project capital expenditure has been further reduced and is now expected to be c.$2.3 billion, more than 25% lower than originally sanctioned. achieving asset life extension and maximising economic recovery from those assets will enable future growth. in 2016, seven years after enquest started this programme, thistle was still delivering very high levels of production efficiency. in occupational safety, our lost time incident (‘lti’) performance remained strong, with many assets recording an lti-free year. while that quantum of reduction in operating costs cannot be repeated, a focus on improving costs and driving efficiencies is a fundamental requirement in ensuring enquest is able to deliver profitable growth over the long term. this year, it has been updated with guidance on preventing the facilitation of tax avoidance. alongside this, time was invested to understand the culture of our business through an online survey and subsequent focus groups. kraken is progressing well, the magnus integration and drilling programmes are well underway, plans are being developed to enhance performance at our other producing assets, and the period of heavy capital investment is largely behind us. specific developments and updates in all areas are brought to the board’s attention when appropriate. amjad bseisu chief executive enquest’s priorities and performance in 2017 2017 was a transformational year for enquest, positioning the group for profitable growth and transitioning from a period of heavy capital investment to one in which the group can begin to reduce its debt. operational performance enquest was proud to deliver first oil from kraken on schedule while significantly reducing full cycle gross capital expenditure. production at other assets was also reduced by lower water injection, natural declines and an unscheduled shutdown in december of the third-party operated forties pipeline. the second processing train, which was brought online during november, assisted in bringing gross production rates to over 40,000 bopd. magnus is a good quality reservoir with large volumes in place, providing opportunities for infill drilling and the revitalisation of wells. rigorous cost discipline and a proven project execution model: just two of the factors behind its journey to first oil. these included: a good understanding of a productive reservoir • exceptionally well mapped, with 3d seismic used to place wells • two discovery wells and nine appraisal wells were drilled • in total, almost 50,000 feet measured depth of reservoir section has been drilled to date • deep directional resistivity data acquired in all development wells excellent drilling performance • the rig deployed on kraken was able to operate through challenging weather conditions, with recorded downtime levels of less than 5% • a highly experienced and competent rig crew delivered continuous improvements by utilising lessons learned in each phase • drilling at the second and third drill centres (‘dc’s) were completed significantly ahead of schedule • the team delivered the world’s longest open hole interval gravel packed with optipac screens at 4,347 feet on dc3 a project-specific model • a comparatively small core team managed a limited number of larger contractors charged with delivering larger workscopes • fewer interfaces and greater scope for contractors to pursue efficient progress in their specialist areas underpinned our ability to deliver with agility and efficiency • tried-and-tested technologies and systems resulted in important cost efficiencies as a result of the above initiatives and a strong focus on cost control and commercial agreements, the full cycle gross project capex is now expected to be approximately $2.3 billion, down more than 25% from the projected figure of $3.2 billion at project sanction. magnus & svt acquisition strategic report corporate governance financial statements 15 enquest plc annual report 2017 with their integrated skills, operational scale, cost structures and high levels of operating efficiency, we have seen what enquest can do on the thistle, deveron and dons fields that were previously operated by bp . proposals are also being developed to drill ‘twin’ producer and injector wells later this year. amid this growth, we commit to preserving the essential enquest characteristics of agility and dynamism. such success would not have been possible, however, without a strong relationship with our regulator and partner, the national oil company petroliam nasional berhad (‘petronas’), which holds a 50% interest in the fields through its subsidiary petronas carigali sdn bhd. the work is to be performed by a semi-submersible tender assisted drilling rig and is scheduled for completion in the second half of 2018. pm8/seligi: key facts • the group of oil fields is c.300 kilometres off peninsular malaysia in 70 metres water depth • oil in the seligi field is found in reservoirs located between 1,000 metres to 2,000 metres vertically beneath the seabed • two central processing platforms and one flare structure • 11 satellite platforms • 370 kilometres of pipeline • average age of assets: 21 years for more details see pages 08 to

performance has been excellent, with programmes completed early and at a lower cost than originally planned. as such, it has the potential to play an important role in enquest’s future growth. such financial discipline is an essential part of the way in which enquest does business. when combined with northern north sea operations better plant uptime, these programmes enabled thistle production rates to finish the year strongly. the abandonment programme on heather partially abandoned legacy wells which should safeguard sustained high water injection reservoir efficiency. jenny thomson group

and are stated on a best technical case or ‘2c’ basis. the increase in revenue reflected higher market prices for crude oil, partially offset by lower production. during 2016, the group entered into commodity hedging contracts to hedge a portion of its 2017 production against fluctuations in oil prices. enquest continually reviews its currency exposures and when appropriate looks at opportunities to enter into foreign exchange hedging contracts. these forecasts and sensitivity analyses allow management to mitigate any liquidity or covenant compliance risks in a timely manner. should there be any liquidity shortages or covenant breaches due to events not included in the base or downside cases, the directors believe that a number of mitigating actions, including assets sales or other funding options, can be executed successfully in the necessary timeframe to meet debt repayment obligations as they become due and in order to maintain liquidity. prolonged low oil prices, cost increases and production delays or outages could further threaten the group’s liquidity and/or ability to comply with relevant covenants. 36 enquest plc annual report 2017 corporate responsibility review in our drive for operational excellence we remain focused on continual improvement through the early detection and resolution of issues. our heather, thistle, kittiwake and northern producer assets in the north sea all recorded an lti-free year. excellent overall workplace safety performance was achieved across our malaysia assets, also with zero ltis. the platform embraces enquest values and promotes an open reporting culture where everyone’s voice is valued. we also completed comprehensive uk and malaysian hse&a audit programmes, with outcomes fed into our 2018 continual improvement programme. the transition has been complex and the transition team have systematically worked through all matters arising with bp to ensure a smooth transfer, including consultation with transferring staff during 2017. inductions were run for all transferring staff from september to ensure that all those impacted understood the enquest business, how we work and how they can contribute to enquest’s success. combining these staff groups is a great opportunity to bolster the north sea business and add depth, particularly offshore. as a result, we focused our recruitment effort in certain functions, including commercial, subsurface and finance. north sea we have continued to raise funds for archway, an aberdeen-based charity which supports young people and adults with learning disabilities. as part of our community service project for 2017, enquest petroleum production malaysia organised an event at district 21 putrajaya with good samaritan home. please see pages 40 to 47 for further information on how the group manages its key risk areas. this financial discipline drives cost efficiency and cash flow generation to reduce the group’s debt. the group’s desire is to maintain upper quartile hse performance measured against suitable industry metrics. risk appetite production the group’s production is critical to its success and is subject to a variety of risks including: subsurface uncertainties; operating in a mature field environment; potential for significant unexpected shutdowns; and unplanned expenditure (particularly where remediation may be dependent on suitable weather conditions offshore). lower than expected reservoir performance or insufficient addition of new resources may have a material impact on the group’s future growth. mitigation the group’s programme of asset integrity and assurance activities provide leading indicators of significant potential issues which may result in unplanned shutdowns or which may in other respects have the potential to undermine asset availability and uptime. enquest also supports its partners and suppliers through the provision of appropriate secondees if required. prolonged low oil prices, cost increases and production delays or outages could threaten the group’s liquidity and/or ability to comply with relevant covenants. related kpis – b, c, f, g, h the group recognises that significant leverage has been required to fund its growth as low oil prices have impacted revenues. mitigation the group has established an able and competent employee base to execute its principal activities. the group undertakes regular audit activities to provide assurance on compliance with established policies, standards and procedures. further, as described above, the group’s focus on production efficiency supports mitigation of a low oil price environment. mitigation the group operates regular cash call and billing arrangements with its co-venturers to mitigate the group’s credit exposure at any one point in time and keeps in regular dialogue with each of these parties to ensure payment. work on assessing the cyber security environment and implementing improvements as necessary will be

providing assurance that the executive directors are exercising good judgement in delivery of strategy and decision making. scheduled board meetings are preceded by a day of committee meetings and, when required, technical reviews which allow for an in-depth review on a particular topic of interest, such as well performance, project updates and drilling. the chairman met with each director individually and directors were also asked to complete a questionnaire. it was considered that the collaborative board environment encouraged open debate and challenge when appropriate. in addition, the continuing development of board members is supported through regular briefings on key business, industry, governance and regulatory developments which in 2017 included training on corporate governance reform, preventing the facilitation of tax evasion and new ifrs accounting standards. in january 2018, a new anti-facilitation of tax evasion module was added to the training course. meetings are also held at enquest’s offices in london and aberdeen, with site visits undertaken as appropriate. an internal board effectiveness evaluation was conducted during 2017, and further details on this are outlined in the corporate governance report (refer to page 58). owing primarily to changes in assumptions and lower production performance at alma/galia compared to the same time last year, impairment testing has been performed resulting in a pre-tax non-cash net impairment charge of $0.2 billion of tangible oil and gas assets. this allows employees and contractors to raise any concerns about business practices in confidence through an independently appointed third party. this discrepancy between the ‘per share’ terminology and actual target setting has not previously been identified. the committee has also taken into account management’s longstanding and significant alignment with shareholders through exposure to equity. • executive directors may participate in the hmrc approved sharesave scheme and benefit from share price growth. all bonus above 100% of salary is deferred into enquest shares for two years, subject to continued employment. • where the threshold level of performance is met for each element, bonuses will begin to accrue on a sliding scale from 0%. 2 reserves and production growth targets are no longer described as being on a ‘per

due) until they hold at least 200% of salary in shares 1 . note: 1 to include shares which are beneficially owned (directly or indirectly) by family members of an executive director. amjad bseisu’s bonus objectives are normally based solely on the company performance contract of enquest. performance share plan the psp is typically awarded annually and has a vesting period of three years. tax equalisation may also be considered if an executive is adversely affected by taxation due to their employment with enquest. an annual bonus would not typically be paid to executive directors when leaving the company. deferred bonus shares held by good leavers will normally vest at the normal vesting date. the non-executive directors do not have service contracts but their terms are set out in a letter of appointment. their terms of appointment may be terminated by either party giving three months’ notice in writing. details of any payments to former directors will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise. specific groups of key technical employees may have their salaries set above median for the industry. • if applicable, executive directors have an element of the annual bonus automatically converted to shares and deferred. • all other employees may be invited to participate in the dbsp where they can elect to defer a defined proportion of their annual bonus and receive a matching amount of shares that vest over the following three years. single total figure of remuneration – non-executive directors the remuneration of the non-executive directors for the

based on our work on the going concern assessment prepared by management, we agree that a material uncertainty exists in respect of going concern and that this has been appropriately disclosed in the financial statements. we will focus on management’s estimation process including whether bias exists in the determination of reserves and resources. we also reconciled internal estimates to third party reserves reports, and obtained an understanding of differences. there are other judgemental areas such as reserves, production and cost profiles, which could lead to impairment triggers. the impairment calculations are particularly sensitive to both reserve estimates, future oil prices and discount rates. in our view the reserves, price and discount rate assumptions used by management are within reasonable ranges. in our view the reserves, price and discount rate assumptions used by management are within reasonable ranges. • based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identified in the paragraphs above. our procedures involved: journal entry testing, with a focus on manual consolidation journals and journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the business; enquiries of legal counsel, group management, location management in all full scope entities; and focused testing, as referred to in the key audit matters section above. this listing is of standards and interpretations issued, which the group reasonably expects to be applicable at a future date. ifrs 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018, with early application permitted. the scheduled repayment of cash flows have been and continue to be received in line with expectations. 2. summary of significant accounting policies continued enquest plc annual report and accounts 2017 111 strategic report corporate governance financial statements the group has completed an initial assessment of the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements, but has not yet completed its detailed assessment. this means that it will apply ifrs 16 to all contracts entered into before 1 january 2019 and identified as leases in accordance with ias 17. contracts which have not been considered or identified as a lease will continue to be accounted for in line with their historical treatment. subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. all other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as a financial liability are remeasured through profit or loss. the effects of changes in estimates do not give rise to prior year adjustments and are dealt with prospectively. these forecasts and sensitivity analyses allow management to mitigate any liquidity or covenant compliance risks in a timely manner. expenditure directly associated with exploration, evaluation or appraisal activities is initially capitalised as an intangible asset. other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. the group also considers qualitative factors in assessing whether a modified financial liability is ‘substantially different’. provisions decommissioning provision for future decommissioning costs is made in full when the group has an obligation: to dismantle and remove a facility or an item of plant; to restore the site on which it is located; and when a reasonable estimate of that liability can be made. however, deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. the carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. current and deferred prt is provided on the same basis as described above for income taxes. the impairment of alma/galia is primarily driven by performance issues relating to electric submersible pumps and underlying natural declines in fields. the amounts disclosed above are in respect of assets where an impairment (or reversal) has been recorded. assets which did not have any impairment or reversal are excluded from the amounts disclosed. discounted cash flow models comprising asset-by-asset life of field projections using level 3 inputs (based on ifrs 13 fair value hierarchy) have been used to determine the recoverable amounts. oil prices are based on dated brent forward price curve for the first three years and thereafter at $70/bbl from 2021. production volumes are based on life of field production profiles for each asset within the cgu. segment risk is incorporated by applying a beta factor based on publicly available market data. management considers this to be the best estimate of a market participant’s discount rate. at 31 december 2017, $7.0 million was placed on short-term deposit in order to cash collateralise the group’s letter of credit. during november 2017, the group
