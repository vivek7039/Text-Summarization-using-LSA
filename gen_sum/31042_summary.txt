capabilities, values, long-term track record and key risks. in early 2018, enquest agreed renegotiated terms for the transocean leader drilling rig, reducing both the contract duration and day rates, saving c.$60 million of net cash payments for capital expenditure in 2019. kraken full cycle gross project capital expenditure has been further reduced and is now expected to be c.$2.3 billion, more than 25% lower than originally sanctioned. alongside this, time was invested to understand the culture of our business through an online survey and subsequent focus groups. operational performance enquest was proud to deliver first oil from kraken on schedule while significantly reducing full cycle gross capital expenditure. production at other assets was also reduced by lower water injection, natural declines and an unscheduled shutdown in december of the third-party operated forties pipeline. the second processing train, which was brought online during november, assisted in bringing gross production rates to over 40,000 bopd. magnus is a good quality reservoir with large volumes in place, providing opportunities for infill drilling and the revitalisation of wells. rigorous cost discipline and a proven project execution model: just two of the factors behind its journey to first oil. these included: a good understanding of a productive reservoir • exceptionally well mapped, with 3d seismic used to place wells • two discovery wells and nine appraisal wells were drilled • in total, almost 50,000 feet measured depth of reservoir section has been drilled to date • deep directional resistivity data acquired in all development wells excellent drilling performance • the rig deployed on kraken was able to operate through challenging weather conditions, with recorded downtime levels of less than 5% • a highly experienced and competent rig crew delivered continuous improvements by utilising lessons learned in each phase • drilling at the second and third drill centres (‘dc’s) were completed significantly ahead of schedule • the team delivered the world’s longest open hole interval gravel packed with optipac screens at 4,347 feet on dc3 a project-specific model • a comparatively small core team managed a limited number of larger contractors charged with delivering larger workscopes • fewer interfaces and greater scope for contractors to pursue efficient progress in their specialist areas underpinned our ability to deliver with agility and efficiency • tried-and-tested technologies and systems resulted in important cost efficiencies as a result of the above initiatives and a strong focus on cost control and commercial agreements, the full cycle gross project capex is now expected to be approximately $2.3 billion, down more than 25% from the projected figure of $3.2 billion at project sanction. magnus & svt acquisition strategic report corporate governance financial statements 15 enquest plc annual report 2017 with their integrated skills, operational scale, cost structures and high levels of operating efficiency, we have seen what enquest can do on the thistle, deveron and dons fields that were previously operated by bp . when combined with northern north sea operations better plant uptime, these programmes enabled thistle production rates to finish the year strongly. gas from these three fields is ‘sweetened’ at svt before being shipped to magnus, for enhanced oil recovery and onward export. the second processing train, which was brought online during november, assisted in bringing gross production rates to over 40,000 bopd. 4 contingent resources relate to technically recoverable hydrocarbons for which commerciality has not yet been determined and are stated on a best technical case or ‘2c’ basis. during 2016, the group entered into commodity hedging contracts to hedge a portion of its 2017 production against fluctuations in oil prices. enquest continually reviews its currency exposures and when appropriate looks at opportunities to enter into foreign exchange hedging contracts. these forecasts and sensitivity analyses allow management to mitigate any liquidity or covenant compliance risks in a timely manner. prolonged low oil prices, cost increases and production delays or outages could further threaten the group’s liquidity and/or ability to comply with relevant covenants. 36 enquest plc annual report 2017 corporate responsibility review in our drive for operational excellence we remain focused on continual improvement through the early detection and resolution of issues. we also completed comprehensive uk and malaysian hse&a audit programmes, with outcomes fed into our 2018 continual improvement programme. combining these staff groups is a great opportunity to bolster the north sea business and add depth, particularly offshore. north sea we have continued to raise funds for archway, an aberdeen-based charity which supports young people and adults with learning disabilities. as part of our community service project for 2017, enquest petroleum production malaysia organised an event at district 21 putrajaya with good samaritan home. risk appetite production the group’s production is critical to its success and is subject to a variety of risks including: subsurface uncertainties; operating in a mature field environment; potential for significant unexpected shutdowns; and unplanned expenditure (particularly where remediation may be dependent on suitable weather conditions offshore). lower than expected reservoir performance or insufficient addition of new resources may have a material impact on the group’s future growth. prolonged low oil prices, cost increases and production delays or outages could threaten the group’s liquidity and/or ability to comply with relevant covenants. related kpis – b, c, f, g, h the group recognises that significant leverage has been required to fund its growth as low oil prices have impacted revenues. he

or an item of plant; to restore the site on which it is located; and when a reasonable estimate of that liability can be made. the impairment of alma/galia is primarily driven by performance issues relating to electric submersible pumps and underlying natural declines in fields. discounted cash flow models comprising asset-by-asset life of field projections using level 3 inputs (based on ifrs 13 fair value hierarchy) have been used to determine the recoverable amounts. at 31 december 2017, $7.0 million was placed on short-term deposit in order to cash collateralise the group’s letter of
