STRATEGIC REPORT 5 Annual report and accounts 2017 Collagen Solutions plc STRATEGIC REPORT Our business model Our core products include medical-grade collagen, the primary protein in those tissues that provides a supportive environment for the cells, and processed native tissues such as pericardium, a uniquely strong tissue that surrounds the heart, and medical-grade collagen formulations. Example collagen-based medical devices We enable creation of regenerative medicine technologies through our extensive experience in biomaterials. Manufacturing We manufacture semi-finished or finished devices to spec for our customers under their private label. Value creation process Strategies Summary value proposition Collagen Solutions has established multiple opportunities for accelerated growth over the next several years in both our core development, supply and manufacturing business as well as our new proprietary products to take advantage of the high-growth regenerative medicine opportunity with few competitors that can match the quality, expertise and experience we bring along with our extensive offering of products and services. This new trial, which is technically known as an open-label extension trial, will provide us with seven to eight years of longitudinal data which, if positive, will help enormously with our partnering activities. We remain confident about our ability to partner these products, although the increasing burden of regulation has resulted in extended timelines. Our collaborations with various academic and industry partners include our participation in two prestigious European Horizon 2020 consortiums to develop: (i) a disease-modifying therapy for Parkinson’s which could slow down the progression of the disease rather than offering symptomatic benefits; and (ii) cell-based tissue regeneration techniques. We have also seen an increase in demand for tissue biomaterials from our Australian and New Zealand sources. We continue to put in place the clear organisation and detailed initiatives to drive our focused strategy in the current financial year and beyond, which is to build a leading global regenerative biomaterials business based upon a core supply, development and manufacturing platform, enhanced by developing our own novel products, such as ChondroMimetic ® , across a range of clinical indications. • Achieving continued revenue growth across all our key territories and to seek to address a specific risk with a Korean customer on potential reduced quantities at contract renewal, which could possibly impact 18/19 revenues if not addressed this year. • The Company is keen to reflect its ambition by contemplating potential transactions which could help deliver critical mass in its core business and access additional products and technology which will be accretive to future commercial plans for high-value products. Hopefully as a shareholder you will see this better reflected in our share price. Chris’ experience in medical device development, regulatory approvals, intellectual property and biomaterials will be vital to ensuring the success of these programmes. With Australia-New Zealand tissue sourcing becoming a more significant part of our core business, we were pleased to have been granted a patent from the Australian Patent Office for the use of our novel ultra-thin processed pericardium material, which can be used for heart valve replacement medical devices and other applications. Our wound healing project is based upon core technology we developed over several years, with promising results presented at multiple conferences, including the recent Society for Biomaterials Annual Meeting in Minneapolis. Our CE mark submission is pending this study conclusion and completing internal validations, with a target commercialisation outside the US in mid-2018. Finally, we recognise the need for close co-ordination between our global commercial and R&D teams as well as the expertise needed for successful development and regulatory approvals of our proprietary medical devices. Our 2017 initiatives generally focused on three areas: sales channel development, marketing brand launch and operational excellence. While the team was very busy and accomplished several important goals last year, two stand out as critical achievements. Finally, Chris Wattengel brings a critical skill set in finished devices with his 16+ years of directly relevant biomaterials and OEM experience. In addition, each of these leaders has also enhanced their own teams with new talent. Finally, we are focused on advancing our proprietary products and securing partners for successful commercialisation. In Glasgow our employees have raised money for charitable causes and organised donations to the local food banks. With our tissue business growing organically by 30% with growing demand, yet limited somewhat by sufficient supply, our focus for this year is an initiative focused on securing and creating a stronger pericardium business. We see significant value creation potential over time with our three proprietary product programmes in cartilage, wounds and bone. Achievements • Implemented a robust OEM process with improved time-to-close deal flow and contributed to nine new agreements during the year. Our collagen component or formulation may have been developed, embedded and listed as part of a customer’s regulatory admission, but contract manufacturing revenues may be delayed until such approval is obtained in the relevant geographical market from the relevant agencies.

A further £2 million of Bond facility is available for draw down during the coming financial year providing certain revenue targets are met. Business risks Risk management is an important element of the management process throughout the Group, and internal controls have been developed to address the main business risks, which are considered to be: Growth of pericardium tissue business +30% EMEA revenue +190% Asia revenue +36% 18 Strategic The Group operates in a global market and is dependent on enhancing revenues by leveraging existing customers, products and facilities in order to provide a broad range of collagen biomaterials, development services, contract manufacturing for collagen-based medical devices and commercialisation of our own proprietary medical devices. The timelines for launching proprietary products also present risks which are addressed through close monitoring and project management.

and accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS General information Collagen Solutions plc is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The registered office is c/o Shepherd and Wedderburn LLP, Condor House, 10 St. Paul’s Churchyard, London EC4M 8AL. Management prepares detailed working capital forecasts which are reviewed by the Board on a regular basis. It is included within intangible assets and subject to annual impairment reviews noted above. Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. Impairment At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangibles, including goodwill, to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. Amounts are reviewed annually against criteria for payment set out within the relevant sale and purchase agreements. Fair value is measured by use of the Trinomial Barrier Option and Black-Scholes models.
