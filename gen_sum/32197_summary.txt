our fund managers are independent thinkers and have the courage of their convictions in making investment decisions. our fund managers are independent thinkers and have the courage of their convictions in making investment decisions. at liontrust, we have brought together a talented group of fund management teams who believe that rigorous investment processes are key to long- term performance and risk control. they do not get distracted by short- term events and noise but stay true to their own documented investment processes. like investors, asset management businesses are continually confronted by potential challenges and threats along with plenty of opportunities. financial advice and fund management will become increasingly, not less, important in the future to help people achieve this. adjusted profit before tax is disclosed in order to give shareholders an indication of the profitability of the group excluding non-cash (depreciation, intangible asset amortisation and share incentivisation related) expenses and non-recurring (professional fees relating to acquisition, cost reduction, restructuring, share incentivisation and severance compensation

positions and small holdings in the sub-funds of liontrust global funds plc which have been undertaken to aid incorporation and are redeemed when funds grow in size. liontrust manages its operational risk with a framework based upon the basel committee on banking supervision’s paper “sound practices for the management and supervision of operational risk” using seven operational risk event types that may result in substantial losses including: operational risk event type description internal fraud misappropriation of assets, tax evasion, intentional mismarking of positions, bribery external fraud theft of information, hacking damage, third-party theft and forgery employment practices and workplace safety discrimination, workers’ compensation, employee health and safety clients, products, & business practice market manipulation, antitrust, improper trade, product defects, fiduciary breaches, account churning damage to physical assets natural disasters, terrorism, vandalism business disruption & systems failures utility disruptions, software failures, hardware failures execution, delivery, & process management data entry errors, accounting errors, failed mandatory reporting, negligent loss of client assets these risk event types are further broken down into 36 sub-categories. liontrust also commissions an external accountancy firm to report on internal controls in accordance with aaf 01/06. failure to compete effectively in this environment may result in loss of existing clients and a reduced opportunity to capture new business which may have a material adverse impact on the group’s financial wellbeing and growth. all our investment processes are fully documented, which enables clients to understand clearly how we manage assets. ensuring that our clients understand the product is a core element in treating them fairly. social responsibility we are carrying out our community engagement through two major sponsorships, with three key objectives. after
