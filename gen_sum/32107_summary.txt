despite some headwinds from contract phasing. core business demand is typically stable, predictable and often recurring, thereby providing relatively high visibility of future revenues. here are some of the key motivations for investment in consort medical plc: 1 long-term contracts consort medical serves pharmaceutical and life sciences customers with drug/ device development, formulation and manufacturing services, all of which, typically, have long life cycles. pharmaceutical customers invest significant resources in launching, marketing and building the treatment franchises which often have high rates of repeat prescription. this value delivery to the customer yields attractive margins, whilst affording protection from potential new market entrants. in bespak’s devices arena, this diversification strategy has taken the business from respiratory into injectables, nasal, ocular and point of care (poc) diagnostics (horizontal). syrina ® ar 2.25 provides patients with a fully-automatic two-step, compact device for the self-administration of viscous drug formulations smoothly and safely in less than 15 seconds. syrina ® ar 2.25 has been tailored specifically for higher viscosities while still enabling the safe use of glass syringes. aesica has been an early provider of serialisation services to the industry including china and latin america that have adopted this process. consort medical has been transformed under this strategy, with the group strengthening its base of core competencies and leveraging them in strategic growth initiatives. our intention is to continue to achieve organic growth by building on aesica’s foundations of new business development, key account management, project management and continuous improvement as well as broaden our technology offering through both acquisition and innovation. whilst the divisions have several customers in common, currently, a number are exclusive to either aesica or bespak. • aesica has been

fully-automatic two-step, compact device for the self-administration of viscous drug formulations smoothly and safely in less than 15 seconds. aesica has been an early provider of serialisation

associated opportunities for bespak to supply both metered dose inhaler (mdi) and dry powder inhaler (dpi) devices. endorsing this strategy, in fy2017 we signed a significant new commercial supply agreement for bespak’s proprietary respiratory devices with astrazeneca. in 2014, consort medical commercially unveiled lapas ® , a new range of innovative wearable bolus injection devices powered by

continued the group recognises that the strength of its business relies heavily on a stable and ethical supply base. this standard aims to ensure our entire supply base operates with the highest ethical standards. the group maintains a close dialogue with all of its customers and seeks to enter into long term supply agreements where appropriate. the group carries out critical plant risk and remediation assessments at each of its manufacturing sites. these provide good visibility of resource requirements, whether capital, space, equipment or people, and enable timely fulfilment on multiple parallel programmes. warranties and indemnities are also sought from the seller, which act to further reduce risk/exposure in certain areas. legal risk: as an international enterprise, the group must comply with differing laws in different jurisdictions. this can result in a wide range of risks relating to contract, competition, trademark, patent and anti-bribery/corruption laws. the group is not aware of any risks from legal disputes that could have a significant impact on its financial results or net assets. liquidity and leverage risk: whilst the group has comfortable borrowing facilities and strong cash flows, there is a risk of unforeseen short term working capital fluctuations which it may not be able to meet, or which may breach covenants on its borrowing facilities. the group has strong cash flows, and good earnings visibility ensures that its margins are sufficient to exceed normal operating costs. the group’s tax advisors, ernst & young llp have also completed our strategy for repatriation of profits in overseas subsidiaries. these have included serving as chairman of optos plc from 2010 to 2015, until its acquisition by nikon corporation. paul was with smiths

all non-executive directors are appointed for an initial term of three years subject to satisfactory performance. all non-executive directors are expected to devote such time as is necessary for the proper performance of their duties. our 2017 agm will be held on 6 september 2017 at the company’s registered address in hemel hempstead. this process involves reviewing relevant papers prepared by management in support of the policies adopted and judgements made. the committee has reviewed papers prepared by management showing how these costs have been identified and calculated. management prepares a paper for the committee setting out any key judgements applied in respect of revenue recognition and in the accounting for major manufacturing contracts or material amendments to contracts where significant judgements have been applied. this is being supplemented as and where appropriate through the engagement of internal audit services from suitably qualified external providers. fy2017 incentive outcomes the business continued to deliver underlying growth during fy2017 and made progress towards certain key strategic priorities. as paul hayes was appointed at the start of fy2018 he will not receive a bonus for fy2017. this has been delivered alongside strong financial performance, with eps growth of 36% over the last three years. it was pleasing to see that this approach subsequently received strong support from our shareholders at the 2016 agm. this review will include consideration of alternative incentive structures which have been debated by many stakeholders over recent months. the committee will seek to appropriately consult with shareholders regarding any changes which are subsequently proposed. richard cotton’s award lapsed in full following his departure

between 30 april 2017 and 14 june 2017 jonathan glenn acquired 29 partnership shares through payroll deductions under the all-employee share incentive plan. these measures will normally be equally weighted but the committee may determine that an alternative weighting is appropriate. where appropriate, alternative metrics may be used for future awards to ensure they remain aligned with the corporate strategy. since 2013, the long-term share awards have been based on total shareholder return and earnings performance. the majority of employees are eligible to earn a bonus each year based on their site specific performance. additional fees may also be paid for other board responsibilities or roles if this is considered appropriate. remuneration for newly appointed non-executive directors may be paid in the form of cash or shares. such annual incentive scheme awards will be determined by the committee taking into account time in employment and performance. a participant’s personal representatives have until 12 months from the date of death to exercise any vested awards. the group also believes that all employees have a right to work in an environment free from discrimination and bullying. opportunities also exist for employees of the group who become disabled to continue in their employment or to be considered for other open positions in the group and generally their training, career development and promotion. for and on behalf of the board john ilett company secretary 14 june 2017 25378.04 19 july 2017 4:02 pm proof 5 consort medical plc annual

2.0 net book value at 30 april 11.4 8.3 investments relate to a 12.2% investment in oxular limited (formerly “precision ocular limited”), a retinal therapeutics company and atlas genetics limited, a uk-based privately owned healthcare technology company with an ultra-rapid point of care (“poc”) diagnostics platform. pension costs of defined benefit schemes for accounting purposes have been assessed in accordance with independent actuarial advice, using the projected unit method. formal, independent, actuarial valuations of the group’s defined benefit scheme are undertaken, normally every three years. the expected yield on bond investments with fixed interest rates can be derived exactly from their market value. the investment return related to these is variable, and they are generally considered much “riskier” investments. employee benefits represents a provision for national insurance contributions on share options and other share-based payments. consort medical plc does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes and the group’s treasury policies specifically prohibit such activity. all transactions in financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities. grants under share option schemes are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant. 3 italy – 100
