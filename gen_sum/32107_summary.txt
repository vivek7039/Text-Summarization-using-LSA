OUTLOOK Consort has again delivered further growth in revenue and profit ahead of its expectations with both divisions performing well. Group performance is expected to be broadly in line with our near-term expectations for the current financial year, despite some headwinds from contract phasing. Pharmaceutical customers invest significant resources in launching, marketing and building the treatment franchises which often have high rates of repeat prescription. In Bespak’s devices arena, this diversification strategy has taken the business from respiratory into injectables, nasal, ocular and point of care (POC) diagnostics (horizontal). Syrina ® AR 2.25 provides patients with a fully-automatic two-step, compact device for the self-administration of viscous drug formulations smoothly and safely in less than 15 seconds. Syrina ® AR 2.25 has been tailored specifically for higher viscosities while still enabling the safe use of glass syringes. Aesica has been an early provider of serialisation services to the industry including China and Latin America that have adopted this process. Consort Medical has been transformed under this strategy, with the Group strengthening its base of core competencies and leveraging them in strategic growth initiatives. Whilst the divisions have several customers in common, currently, a number are exclusive to either Aesica or Bespak. • Aesica has been working with a leading Japanese pharmaceutical company to provide the active ingredient for an anti-inflammatory formulation containing S+ flurbiprofen. Syrina ® AR 2.25 provides patients with a fully-automatic two-step, compact device for the self-administration of viscous drug formulations smoothly and safely in less than 15 seconds. Aesica has been an early provider of serialisation services to the industry including China and Latin America that have adopted this process. Endorsing this strategy, in FY2017 we signed a significant new commercial supply agreement for Bespak’s proprietary respiratory devices with AstraZeneca. The global injectable drug delivery market is forecast to reach US$625 billion in 2021, growing at an estimated CAGR of 11.5% between 2016 and 2021. In 2014, Consort Medical commercially unveiled Lapas ® , a new range of innovative wearable bolus injection devices powered by Vapoursoft ® . Syrina ® AR 2.25 provides patients with a fully- automatic two-step, compact device for the self-administration of viscous drug formulations smoothly and safely in less than 15 seconds. Strategy Consort Medical’s Syrina ® , Lila ® and Lapas ® range of auto-injectors positions the Group well to participate in this growing market. The global nasal drug delivery technology market is forecast to reach US$64 billion in 2021, growing at an estimated CAGR of 6.5% between 2016 and 2021. The global ophthalmic drugs market is forecast to reach US$21 billion in 2022, growing at an estimated CAGR of 5.2% between 2016 and 2022. Strategy In FY2016, the Group was awarded a new strategic development and manufacturing agreement with retinal therapeutics company, Oxular Limited. The global oral drug delivery market is forecast to reach US$100 billion in 2018, growing at an estimated CAGR of 9.4% between 2013 and 2018. 25378.04 19 July 2017 4:02 PM Proof 5 CONSORT MEDICAL PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 April 2017 19 OUR PERFORMANCE Strategic Report The current status of the 15 major programmes in our development pipeline is listed below: Project Description Customer Status VAL310 Easifill primeless valve US Pharma Awaiting regulatory approval INJ570* Auto-injector UCB Product launched in October VAL020 MDI valve Global Pharma Stability trials complete; customer progressing towards approval and launch POC010 POC Test Cartridge Atlas Genetics CE marking granted for Chlamydia in February 2016; Combined Chlamydia / Gonorrhoea test cartridge development progressing to plan NAS020 Nasal device Global Generic Formulation change; brief under review DEV610 DPI Mylan Awaiting FDA approval NAS030 Nasal device Pharma Co.

This has been achieved by all non-hazardous waste being recovered in the form of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF). We have taken appropriate steps to ensure slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in our business or supply chain. The Group maintains a close dialogue with all of its customers and seeks to enter into long term supply agreements where appropriate. These provide good visibility of resource requirements, whether capital, space, equipment or people, and enable timely fulfilment on multiple parallel programmes. The Group is not aware of any risks from legal disputes that could have a significant impact on its financial results or net assets. Liquidity and leverage risk: Whilst the Group has comfortable borrowing facilities and strong cash flows, there is a risk of unforeseen short term working capital fluctuations which it may not be able to meet, or which may breach covenants on its borrowing facilities. The Group has strong cash flows, and good earnings visibility ensures that its margins are sufficient to exceed normal operating costs. The Group’s tax advisors, Ernst & Young LLP have also completed our strategy for repatriation of profits in overseas subsidiaries. Paul was with Smiths Group plc for over ten years from 1993, including a number of divisional and operating company finance director roles. 25378.04 19 July 2017 4:02 PM Proof 5 44 consortmedical.com Stock Code: CSRT OUR GOVERNANCE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE JONATHAN GLENN CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER DR KEYVAN DJAMARANI MANAGING DIRECTOR, BESPAK PAUL HAYES CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER LISA KING DIRECTOR OF HUMAN RESOURCES JOHN ILETT GROUP GENERAL COUNSEL AND COMPANY SECRETARY Committee Membership Member of the Corporate Responsibility Committee Skills & Experience Lisa was Vice President, Human Resources, UK and Ireland for UCB Pharma (previously Celltech plc) from 2000 to 2008 before being appointed Director of Group Human Resources at Consort Medical in August 2008. All non-executive directors are expected to devote such time as is necessary for the proper performance of their duties. This process involves reviewing relevant papers prepared by management in support of the policies adopted and judgements made. This is being supplemented as and where appropriate through the engagement of internal audit services from suitably qualified external providers. FY2017 incentive outcomes The business continued to deliver underlying growth during FY2017 and made progress towards certain key strategic priorities. It was pleasing to see that this approach subsequently received strong support from our shareholders at the 2016 AGM. This review will include consideration of alternative incentive structures which have been debated by many stakeholders over recent months. 25378.04 19 July 2017 4:02 PM Proof 5 CONSORT MEDICAL PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 April 2017 59 OUR GOVERNANCE Long-term Incentives – Performance Share Plan Awards to executive directors will remain unchanged at 100% of salary. Between 30 April 2017 and 14 June 2017 Jonathan Glenn acquired 29 partnership shares through payroll deductions under the all-employee Share Incentive Plan. These measures will normally be equally weighted but the Committee may determine that an alternative weighting is appropriate. Where appropriate, alternative metrics may be used for future awards to ensure they remain aligned with the corporate strategy. Such Annual Incentive Scheme awards will be determined by the Committee taking into account time in employment and performance. A participant’s personal representatives have until 12 months from the date of death to exercise any vested awards. The Group also believes that all employees have a right to work in an environment free from discrimination and bullying. Information about environmental, ethical, social and community matters is set out in the Corporate Responsibility review on pages 30 to 38.

is incorporated and domiciled under the laws of England and Wales, registered number 406711. The Group pays contributions to publicly and privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.

Consort Medical plc does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes and the Group’s Treasury policies specifically prohibit such activity.
