Performance Underlying proﬁt from operations more  than doubled to £196 million in 2017;  with all of our earnings-based businesses  reporting improved proﬁtability. Additionally, the order book does not yet  include work won in two-stage design and  build contracts, such as work awarded  to Balfour Beatty’s 50:50 joint venture  (Balfour Beatty VINCI) for two major  civils packages, Lots N1 and N2, for  the UK’s new high speed railway (HS2)  valued at £2.5 billion. Balfour Beatty is increasingly building its  business model on a foundation of deep  capability underpinned by risk reduction. £11.4bn Order book ^ £8,234m Underlying revenue ^ £6,916m Statutory revenue £165m Underlying proﬁt before tax ^ £117m Statutory proﬁt before tax £1.24bn 5 Directors’ valuation 28,000 Employees Balfour Beatty’s power transmission  and distribution team has helped  to create the world’s ﬁrst ﬂoating  wind farm, Hywind, off the coast of  Peterhead, Scotland. We also invest directly  in infrastructure assets,  particularly when there are  opportunities to manage the  project on completion. Construction is an inherently dangerous business  and without the highest standards of safety we do not have a  licence to operate. A growing  pipeline of major infrastructure projects,  particularly in the UK and US markets, will  see increasing competition for skilled  workers. These people had worked alongside  Balfour Beatty staff on the Aberdeen  Western Peripheral Route (AWPR), A14  or Manchester Smart Motorway joint  ventures. Rapid action was taken to remove  management layers, upgrade leadership  and strengthen governance within a  simpliﬁed Group structure. Clients, particularly in the  UK public sector, are increasingly taking  into account social value and other  environmental factors when making  procurement decisions. The largest of  these is Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route  (AWPR) which has experienced ongoing  schedule and cost issues. At the start of 2015, 89  historical contracts were identiﬁed that had  a material negative impact on proﬁtability  and cash. In September 2017,  work was completed on the A21 upgrade  project between Tonbridge and Pembury  which now provides drivers with a new  dual carriageway. HS2  Balfour Beatty’s 50:50 joint venture  with VINCI will deliver the two  northern stretches of HS2 Phase 1,  closest to Birmingham. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017 20 Since 2014, over half of the 50 US states  have increased state gasoline tax. Additionally,  many counties in various states have raised  their sales tax from 0.5% to 1%, which  will increase infrastructure funding by over  US$2 billion per year. The Buildings business remains focused  on working with repeat customers, in  known geographies where it can deliver  value. In 2017, the Group closed its  Houston ofﬁce and continued to withdraw  from bidding on most stick frame multi- family housing. In California, Balfour Beatty has started  construction on a new US$38 million  performing arts and recreation centre  for Heart of Los Angeles (HOLA)  and completed its largest concrete  pour, involving 888 trucks, at a new  US$276 million 42-storey residential tower  at 500 Folsom in San Francisco. In Denver, Balfour  Beatty is currently adding 2.3 miles and  three stations to the light rail line as part  of a design-build contract. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017 24 What we have been doing in 2017 Infrastructure Investments Financial review The Investments business delivered  another strong performance, having  continued its strategy of optimising  value through the disposal of operational  assets, whilst also continuing to invest  in new opportunities. The remainder was due to a  number of changes in cash ﬂow forecasts,  discount rates and economic assumptions. In 2017, business leaders  and Balfour Beatty’s My Contribution  champions considered 2,000 ideas, which  have the potential to save £2.8 million. Zero Harm is Balfour Beatty’s vision,  which means no injury, ill health or incident  caused by its work activities. Central to sustainable delivery of Zero  Harm is Balfour Beatty’s Making Safety  Personal (MSP) programme, based  around four simple golden rules. In 2016  the focus was engagement through  workforce observations, which achieved  a dramatic increase and this trend has  continued into 2017. Balfour Beatty also won several national  awards, including a RoSPA Gold award for  outstanding safety performance by the  Sellaﬁeld Box Encapsulation Plant Delivery  Team (BEPDT). Employee survey results across the  Group rated consistently highly on health  and safety questions, a strong indicator  of engagement. An independent review  of the supply chain indicated that 81%  believe Balfour Beatty is leading on health  and safety. In addition to  formal programmes, bespoke development  has been delivered through individual  coaching, mentoring and structured  feedback processes. At 31 December 2017 the Group’s  UK businesses were supporting 293  graduates, 292 apprentices, 163 trainees  and 19 year out industrial placement  students on a range of schemes. There has been positive action to build  strong foundations for Balfour Beatty’s  work in D&I during 2017. Speak up Balfour Beatty encourages its staff and the  wider community to report any concerns  about unethical conduct. The International Labour  Organisation estimates that at any one time  over 40 million men, women and children  are working in conditions of modern  slavery, including trafﬁcked persons. Balfour Beatty has been  taking steps to reduce its carbon emissions  and mitigate against the business risks of  climate change. Even though Balfour Beatty does  procure signiﬁcant amounts of renewable  electricity, the average DEFRA and IEA  location-based conversion factors have  been used for carbon reporting purposes in  order not to detract from reducing energy  intensive operations. Balfour Beatty’s B rating indicates that  its team has provided comprehensive  information in a transparent and  open manner. Building a sustainable business Using Our Blueprint to support communities and enable growth balfourbeatty.com/AR2017 Governance Financial Statements Other Information 37 Strategic Report Across the Group’s operations, employees  volunteered 12,400 hours for charitable  causes. In California, Balfour Beatty hosted its  annual Golf Classic that raised more  than US$135,000 for the Sharefest  2017 Workday. They taught students how to  develop construction milestone schedules  and site logistics plans based on an actual  1.9 million square-foot, mixed-use project  in Dallas, Texas. The Group does not  enter into artiﬁcial arrangements that lack  commercial purpose in order to secure a  tax advantage. These cash ﬂows have been discounted using different discount rates depending on project risk and maturity, reﬂecting  secondary market transaction experience. In deriving these cash  ﬂows, assumptions have been made and different discount rates used which are updated at each valuation date. Financial failure of a customer, including any government or public sector body, could result  in not collecting amounts owed. Emerging talent is supported via a range of graduate, apprenticeship, trainee and industrial  placement/internship schemes including The 5% Club (see page 32). All in-scope complaints are independently investigated by the Business Integrity  function and appropriate action is taken, where necessary. Local legal and regulatory frameworks are considered as part of any decision to conduct  business in a new country. Details of their service agreements,  emoluments and share incentives are shown in the Remuneration  report starting on page 76. All appointments to the Board are based on merit, against objective  criteria, having due regard for diversity, including gender. The search agencies appointed were reminded to approach a  diverse talent pool of candidates, and neither has other connections  with Balfour Beatty. No person has special rights of control over the Company’s share  capital and all issued shares are fully paid. Cost contingencies may also be included in these estimates to  take account of speciﬁc uncertain risks, or disputed claims against  the Group, arising within each contract. For the residual three components in 2016, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level  to re-examine our assessment that there were no signiﬁcant risks of material misstatement within these.

When classiﬁed as a discontinued operation, income statement  performance is reported in summary form outside continuing  operations and comparative ﬁgures are restated. The Group also had temporary differences  relating to retirement beneﬁts on which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised of £62m (2016: £108m). – actuarial risk: the ultimate cost of providing pension beneﬁts is affected by inﬂation rates and members’ life expectancy. This research is taken into account in the Group’s mortality assumptions across its various deﬁned beneﬁt schemes.
