variety of ﬁnancial risks: market risk; credit risk; and liquidity risk. whenever a current or future foreign currency exposure is identiﬁed with sufﬁcient reliability group treasury enters into forward contracts on behalf of operating companies to cover 100% of foreign exchange risk above materiality levels determined by the chief financial ofﬁcer. as at 31 december 2017, the notional principal amounts of foreign exchange contracts in respect of foreign currency transactions where hedge accounting is not applied was £13m (2016: £70m) receivable and £12m (2016: £71m) payable with related cash ﬂows expected to occur within one year (2016: two years). the group has designated forward exchange contracts with a notional principal amount of £8m (2016: £10m) receivable and £9m (2016: £11m) payable as cash ﬂow hedges against highly probable cash ﬂows which are expected to occur in up to four (2016: ﬁve) years. fair value gains on these contracts of £1m (2016: £2m) have been taken to hedging reserves through other comprehensive income. at 31 december 2017, £1m (2016: £1m) did not meet this criterion due to the operational and relationship difﬁculties in transferring certain balances, however no losses are anticipated from these counterparties. for trade and other receivables, credit evaluation is performed on the ﬁnancial condition of accounts receivable using independent ratings where available or by assessment of the customer’s credit quality based on its ﬁnancial position, past experience and other factors. level 1 – the fair value is calculated based on
