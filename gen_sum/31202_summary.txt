Used alone or in combination, our techniques solve a wide range of geotechnical challenges across the entire construction spectrum. Geotechnical techniques includes all our ten product groups (eg bored piling, driven piles, diaphragm walls, deep-soil mixing, vibro compaction, anchors/nails). Infrastructure renewal and expansion, eg road, rail, power Creates new demand for us, typically operationally efficient given scale. More detail on the trend As populations grow and current infrastructure ages there is an imperative to invest in new, greater capacity. Through Getec we have very strong capabilities globally to integrate instrumentation and monitoring solutions into our geotechnical projects. Covering 8.0m m 2 , Keller Middle East’s £25m joint venture with Trevi is our largest ever design and build ground improvement project in the region. When it’s completed in 2019, the Clairwood Logistics Park will house seven platforms for warehousing, ranging from 25,000m 2 to 130,000m 2 . Increasing technical complexity Monitoring success The Regional Connector Project in Los Angeles links a series of light rail stations downtown. One example of how Keller is working smarter, using modern digital tooling to enable informed decision-making, reduce risk and improve productivity for our clients. Constant currency revenue was up 10%, primarily as a result of strong organic growth in the EMEA and APAC regions. If completed, this acquisition will further strengthen our US East Coast presence and add new specialist technical capabilities to the group. 14 Keller Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 We continue to make progress on operational productivity with our 5S rollout in all business units. Chief Executive Officer’s review continued 2020 benefits target We said in our 2016 preliminary results announcement that we expected to realise £50m of annualised total gross benefits from the group’s strategic initiatives by 2020, around half of which was expected to be reflected as improved profitability. As these are now essentially complete, EMEA’s 2018 revenue and profitability will be well down on that achieved in 2017. Our difficult markets in APAC are slowly recovering, with encouraging signs of new Australian mining and infrastructure projects. The year‑end APAC order book was more than 20% above last year which, combined with our ongoing internal improvements, means we remain confident of a return to divisional profitability in 2018. 24 Keller Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Finance Director’s review 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 81.0 87.6 122.4 66.0 243.0 Investment (£m) * * Excludes acquisition of non-current assets held for sale. Constant currency revenue was up 10%, primarily as a result of strong organic growth in the EMEA and APAC regions.

Keller Group plc is a non-trading investment company that derives its profits from dividends paid by subsidiary companies. Virtually all Keller’s earnings and most of its debt are in foreign currencies, primarily the US dollar. Contract agreement Commercial teams trained in relevant local laws set up contracts that are fair to all parties. We also have a set of target geographies to either consolidate market position or open up new markets. While the plans were built ‘bottom-up’ we have been careful to align them ‘top-down’ with group and divisional strategies. Already we are seeing the benefit that our strong customer orientation and schedule adherence has on satisfaction scores. For instance, by combining our equipment buying power around the world we have signed new framework agreements with a number of suppliers, improving financial and service terms. For example, working with a global client to develop common business around the world that previously would have been managed in silos.

The five‑day Academy covered a broad range of topics, such as contracts, planning, risk assessment, change management, decision‑making and finance. Katja Maihold Branch Manager, Hamburg, Germany “As a female engineer with Keller, my experiences in being accepted have predominantly been positive. Staff from companies throughout the group maintain close contact with partner universities in order to share best practice and provide examples of their leading-edge engineering. Most incidents were low impact involving spillages from diesel and hydraulic fluid; however, we had one significant incident in Australia when 20 cubic metres of bentonite was released. As bats can’t latch onto a smooth surface, Austral used pre-cast beams and poured rough concrete over, to create the right environment inside. Movement in risk Increased No change Reduced Risk A rapid downturn in our markets Inability to maintain a sustainable level of financial performance throughout the construction industry market cycle which grows more than many other industries during periods of economic expansion and falls harder than many other industries when the economy contracts.

During this financial year the Committee met three times and attendance at these meetings is shown on page 48. I would like to commend the management team for their compassionate and collaborative response in dealing with this tragic incident. – After discussion in the Committee, a shortlist was put forward to me for which detailed references were sought by Zygos and soundings taken from our advisers. It provides information on the Company’s financial calendar, dividends, annual general meetings and other areas of interest to shareholders. Our current strategy is built around five strategic levers and we see these priorities continuing over the next three years. We have made other small editorial changes notably reflecting that the PSP awards is now based on three metrics. In determining appropriate remuneration, the Remuneration Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both Keller and its shareholders and will seek not to pay more than is necessary for this purpose. When setting the fee levels consideration is given to market practice for companies of similar size and complexity.
