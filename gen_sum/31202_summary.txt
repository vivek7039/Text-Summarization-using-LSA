used alone or in combination, our techniques solve a wide range of geotechnical challenges across the entire construction spectrum. geotechnical techniques includes all our ten product groups (eg bored piling, driven piles, diaphragm walls, deep-soil mixing, vibro compaction, anchors/nails). market demand trends 1. urbanisation and more large- scale development projects this holds for almost all geographies. this breadth of market exposure also allows us to share new techniques for working in urban areas. 3. infrastructure renewal and expansion, eg road, rail, power creates new demand for us, typically operationally efficient given scale. more detail on the trend as populations grow and current infrastructure ages there is an imperative to invest in new, greater capacity. in cramped metropolitan environments new infrastructure typically replaces old in-situ, adding complexity to the solution. through getec we have very strong capabilities globally to integrate instrumentation and monitoring solutions into our geotechnical projects. 6 keller group plc annual report and accounts 2017 market demand trends continued 1. urbanisation and more large- scale development projects a middle eastern mega project zayed city is part of plan abu dhabi 2030, one of the uae’s most ambitious urban development projects. covering 8.0m m 2 , keller middle east’s £25m joint venture with trevi is our largest ever design and build ground improvement project in the region. when it’s completed in 2019, the clairwood logistics park will house seven platforms for warehousing, ranging from 25,000m 2 to 130,000m 2 . clairwood logistics park durban south africa 8 keller group plc annual report and accounts 2017 3. infrastructure renewal and expansion, eg road, rail, power keller tackles complex subway works the c$5.3bn eglinton crosstown line is toronto’s biggest ever light rapid transit expansion. infrastructure projects often require complex solutions and the ability to deliver them in busy urban environments. after beating stiff competition, keller was appointed as principal contractor for the particularly complex foundation works. spirit queensland australia 10 keller group plc annual report and accounts 2017 5. increasing technical complexity monitoring success the regional connector project in los angeles links a series of light rail stations downtown. keller company hayward baker provided compensation grouting to control settlement under the structures during twin-bore tunnelling. horizontal inclinometers were then installed one metre apart and programmed to read every five minutes. one example of how keller is working smarter, using modern digital tooling to enable informed decision-making, reduce risk and improve productivity for our clients. if completed, this acquisition will further strengthen our us east coast presence and add new specialist technical capabilities to the group. 14 keller group plc annual report and accounts 2017 we continue to make progress on operational productivity with our 5s rollout in all business units. we also had significant success in the large project domain with many market-leading projects across all regions. chief executive officer’s review continued 2020 benefits target we said in our 2016 preliminary results announcement that we expected to realise £50m of annualised total gross benefits from the group’s strategic initiatives by 2020, around half of which was expected to be reflected as improved profitability. summary overall keller has had a positive year with good growth in group revenue and profits. our largest north american business, hayward baker, had a very strong year, producing record results. in this 14-month project, hj foundation installed some of the biggest augercast piles we’ve done. as these are now essentially complete, emea’s 2018 revenue and profitability will be well down on that achieved in 2017. the 2018 result however is still expected to be better than that achieved in 2016, which also benefited significantly from the caspian project, as a result of a healthy order book and actual and further expected improvements in the underlying business. the asean business was still loss-making in 2017, but at a lower level than in 2016. the business continued to be challenged by a very difficult pricing environment for heavy foundations projects, some legacy resource piling contracts and additional costs and teething problems associated with introducing new products. 22 keller group plc annual report and accounts 2017 operating

potential acquisitions to help us access target markets, where required. we will continue to focus on and satisfy the needs of our customers at local level. during the year we completed our first full business unit level standard strategy roll out. while the plans were built ‘bottom-up’ we have been careful to align them ‘top-down’ with group and divisional strategies. already we are seeing the benefit that our strong customer orientation and schedule adherence has on satisfaction scores. these actions typically involve adding local sales and project management capability either in new or existing offices. synergies in operating model will be selectively implemented so that we don’t lose local responsiveness. our group level procurement capability has gained real strength and traction in the last year. for instance, by combining our equipment buying power around the world we have signed new framework agreements with a number of suppliers, improving financial and service terms. for example, working with a global client to develop common business around the world that previously would have been managed in silos. our software algorithms help find optimal design solutions with the

committee: continued improvement in management’s ability to conduct and report on root cause analysis. the intention is to conduct an internal audit of all material business units at least once every four years. (l) whistleblowing procedures employees are encouraged to raise genuine concerns about malpractice at the earliest possible stage. any issues raised under our procedures are thoroughly investigated and reported back to the audit committee. detailed risk analyses covering technical, operational and financial issues are performed as part of the bidding process. the performance of contracts is monitored and reported by most business units on a weekly basis. 50 keller group plc annual report and accounts 2017 corporate governance report continued accountability nancy tuor moore chairman of the health, safety, environment & quality committee the group’s overall accident frequency rate continues to improve and is at an all-time low. i would like to commend the management team for their compassionate and collaborative response in dealing with this tragic incident. – after discussion in the committee, a shortlist was put forward to me for which detailed references were sought by zygos and soundings taken from our advisers. there are, therefore, no formal targets set for female or other aspects of diversity at board level. no one other than a member of the committee is entitled to be present at its meetings. pricewaterhousecoopers, in their role as internal auditors, attend at least two meetings of the committee each year. – receive briefings on various technical issues, such as accounting standards and their practical consequences for keller. it provides information on the company’s financial calendar, dividends, annual general meetings and other areas of interest to shareholders. progress against personal objectives, which are aligned to the company’s five strategic levers, was encouraging. our current strategy is built around five strategic levers and we see these priorities continuing over the next three years. return on capital employed is one of our key performance indicators and, as highlighted in our september 2017 capital markets day, keller has an aspiration to generate a roce of 20% (2016 roce stood at 15% and the average over the last five years is 16%). increase psp opportunity to realign with market levels and offer adequate long-term focus there has been no change in incentive levels (bonus or psp) at keller in the last 10 years despite keller’s increased size and complexity as outlined earlier. we will also increase the shareholding guideline from 100% to 200% of base salary for all executive directors. we have made other small editorial changes notably reflecting that the psp awards is now based on three metrics. the award opportunity at threshold performance is 0%, with around 50% of maximum bonus normally payable for target. individual award levels may vary and will be set out in the relevant annual remuneration report. – from 2018, relative tsr performance will be measured by ranking against ftse250 companies (excluding investment trusts and financial services). – roce is one of our key performance indicators well-understood and used internally to drive profitability. in determining appropriate remuneration, the remuneration committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both keller and its shareholders and will seek not to pay more than is necessary for this purpose. when setting the fee levels consideration is given to market practice for companies of similar size and complexity. successfully achieved the development of an m&a pipeline; successful development and execution of a major product strategy which will

financial statements governance strategic report overview consolidated cash flow statement for the year ended 31 december 2017 1 general information keller group plc (‘the parent’ or ‘the company’) is a company incorporated in the united kingdom. a threshold of £2m was used as it is the larger contracts that are more complex and more likely to have multiple performance obligations and contracts awarded in december would not have made sufficient progress by 31 december 2017 to have a material difference in treatment under ifrs 15. of the 150 contracts that met this criteria, it was determined that only 16 had multiple performance obligations. for contracts that are just the supply of materials, revenue will continue to be recognised on delivery. additional disclosures required as a result of adopting ifrs 9 will be presented in the 2018 financial statements. full provision is made for deferred tax on temporary differences in line with ias 12, ‘income taxes’. deferred tax assets are recognised when it is considered likely that they will be utilised against future taxable profits. derivative financial instruments are accounted for in accordance with ias 39 and recognised initially at fair value. 94 keller group plc annual report and accounts 2017 notes to the consolidated financial statements continued trade receivables trade receivables do not carry any interest, are initially recognised at fair value and are carried at amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. an operating segment is a component of the group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the group’s other components. in future the effective rate of us tax on the group’s us profit before tax is expected to fall from high thirties percent to high twenties percent, inclusive of state taxes and recurring permanent adjustments. the calculations all use cash flow projections based on financial budgets and forecasts approved by management covering a three-year period. all hedges are tested for effectiveness every six months using the cumulative dollar offset method. in 2017 and in 2016, the valuation methods of all of the group’s derivative financial instruments carried at fair value are categorised as level 2. level 2 is defined as inputs, other than quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices). all other payables and receivables are discounted using market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. sensitivity analysis at 31 december 2017, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the group’s profit before taxation by approximately £2.0m. the group recognised total expenses (included in operating costs) of £2.8m (2016: £1.0m) related to equity-settled, share-based payment transactions. 115 keller group plc annual report and accounts 2017 financial statements governance strategic
