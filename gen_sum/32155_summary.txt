Over the past five years, Burberry has returned around £700m to shareholders through dividends, and in April 2017 completed £100m of a £150m announced share buyback. And we are reinforcing these structural changes by redesigning our processes as needed, for example getting local input earlier in the cycle. This is a significant evolution for us and although the changes will take time to embed, we are already seeing early benefits across our business. Looking ahead, we will continue to lead all creative aspects of Beauty, while benefiting from Coty’s first-class industry expertise and distribution. 14 Strategic Report – Introduction This emphasis on facilitating experiences across the physical and digital worlds has long been a focus for Burberry, because it reflects how our customers live today. This will prioritise business continuity, security and the rollout of a common, standardised technology platform globally, to facilitate efficiency business-wide.
