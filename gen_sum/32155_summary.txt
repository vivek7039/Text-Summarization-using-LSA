through dividends, and in april 2017 completed £100m of a £150m announced share buyback. we touched on these in our last report, and have since distilled them into comprehensive plans covering five key areas: product focus; productive space; e-commerce leadership; operational excellence and inspired people, the detail of which i will turn to shortly. as such, the scope and scale of the changes we are making to our business are significant, and it will take time to realise their full benefits, particularly in respect of revenue growth. then, within this significantly simplified assortment, we have implemented new tools and ways of working that mean we are more effectively tailoring our assortments to the individual needs of stores in different locations – from climate, to customer profile. and we are reinforcing these structural changes by redesigning our processes as needed, for example getting local input earlier in the cycle. this is a significant evolution for us and although the changes will take time to embed, we are already seeing early benefits across our business. looking ahead, we will continue to lead all creative aspects of beauty, while benefiting from coty’s first-class industry expertise and distribution. these actions helped drive improvements in conversion and retention globally – with room for continued growth. e-commerce leadership through early investment and focus, we have established a leading position in digital in our industry, with more than 48 million followers on social media worldwide and a ‘genius’ ranking from the influential think-tank l2. meanwhile, the redesign of our china site to tailor it more effectively to local preferences and behaviours drove increases of around 70% in direct-to-consumer sales, while giving valuable insights for our overall site development for the future. 14 strategic report – introduction this emphasis on facilitating experiences across the physical and digital worlds has long been a focus for burberry, because it reflects how our customers live today. whether partnering with leaders in social media to bring our physical moments to life for online audiences, or enabling purchases

our shared services we moved towards a simpler, single global way of working during the year, which drove good initial results. this will prioritise business continuity, security and the rollout of a common, standardised technology platform globally, to facilitate efficiency business-wide. an important early step has been detailed work to consider how we might evolve our operating model. digital

breach in cyber systems or information security could adversely impact the group’s business operations and/ or result in a major data loss adversely impacting the group’s reputation. these changes or events could include: (i) a sustained economic slowdown, which adversely impacts the group’s customers, suppliers and operations; (ii) a change in consumer behaviour or other events, which adversely impact consumer demand particularly in relation to key consumer groups who make a significant contribution to group revenues; and (iii) increasing global economic uncertainty including matters such as brexit which could have an impact on economic growth and adversely impact the group or give rise to additional costs relating to movements of inventory within the supply chain. brexit may have an adverse impact on the group’s uk workforce which includes eu nationals, including within senior management. competitive incentive arrangements currently exist, with specific initiatives in place designed to retain key individuals. the group would seek to mitigate any adverse impacts on its uk workforce arising from brexit. ip rights are driven largely by national laws which afford varying degrees of protection and enforcement priorities depending on the country. consequently, any change to chinese consumer tastes or the economic, regulatory, social and/or political environment in china could adversely impact this consumer group’s disposable income, confidence and travel, which could impact the group’s revenue and profits. therefore, changes in exchange rates which are driven by a number of factors, such as global economic trends, brexit or other developments, can impact the group’s revenues, margins, profits and cash flows. change in level of risk no material change strategic
