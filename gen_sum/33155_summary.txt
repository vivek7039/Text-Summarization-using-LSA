positive year for the performance of retail real estate across europe, driven primarily by an improving economic backdrop. household consumer expenditure grew by 2.0% in 2015. the government initiated changes to allow more sunday trading, which should help future sales growth. with a limited number of prime shopping centres changing hands, investment transactions attracted significant competition and lifted capital valuations across this sector. investor appetite was strong, in particular with low european interest rates, and this drove capital value uplifts. france 15 2020 2008 2004 2006 2010
