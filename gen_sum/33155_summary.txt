STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 1 HAMMERSON.COM OUR BUSINESS AT A GLANCE 57 places where more happens We are an owner, manager and developer of retail destinations in Europe. This enables us to once more increase the dividend for our shareholders, which at 22.3p per share is up 9 .3% on last year and with compound annual growth of 7 .7% since 2011. Like-for-like NRI growth of 2.3% is higher than last year as we continue to see a growing demand for prime retail and leisure space. Against a backdrop of falling vacancy, combined with our Product Experience Framework initiatives, we are well-positioned to drive future rental income growth. There is still more to be done however, especially as a result of additional property costs from the strategic development properties we hold. The next 18 months will also see us make advancements on our major London development schemes including moving towards starting on-site at Brent Cross and Croydon. It gives us greater insight into consumer shopping habits which we can then analyse and share with our retail tenants to improve the customer offer. The modern design provides colleagues with a digitally-enabled, agile workspace which enhances collaboration across our various asset, leasing and development projects. We were delighted to achieve BREEAM Excellent at the design stage for Le Jeu de Paume, Beauvais, our new shopping centre north of Paris.

With a limited number of prime shopping centres changing hands, investment transactions attracted significant competition and lifted capital valuations across this sector. Click & collect is a growing trend and over half of customers said they would use the service if it was offered. Overall, our findings suggest that retailers with a successful multichannel strategy are able to drive greater sales efficiency from their physical retail space. + STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 15 HAMMERSON.COM CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 15 HAMMERSON.COM STRATEGIC REPORT OUR MARKET 0 Intu Hammerson Land Securities M&G GIC CPPIB Capital & Regional Standard Life Westﬁeld Hermes 14 10 6 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 0 3 6 9 12 15 Unibail Klépierre Hammerson Carrefour Immochan Axa Altarea Santander Carmila Wereldhave 14 13 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 Our market continued OCCUPIER MARKETS PRIME SHOPPING CENTRES Prime shopping centres are those which cover a sizeable catchment, include large anchor stores and offer consumers catering and entertainment as well as retail.

They are a core component of our performance-management processes and the two day Corporate Induction Programme attended by all new employees. All senior management vacancies filled via internal promotions in 2015 We conducted our employee survey during 2015 using the globally established ‘Great Place to Work’ programme. It is therefore not surprising that 2015 was a year during which we continued to develop our strategy and build on the good practices already in place. We welcome and fully consider all suitable applications for employment, irrespective of gender, race, ethnicity, religion, age, sexual orientation or disability. Disposals reduced net rental income in 2015 by £4.8 million, reflecting the 2015 sales of Drakehouse Retail Park, Sheffield, Bercy 2, Paris and Grand Maine, Angers. The UK retail parks valuations increased by £19 million associated with an uplift from leasing and ERV changes as yields were virtually unchanged. Acquisitions may be financed initially using short-term funds before being refinanced for the longer term when market conditions are appropriate. Short-term funding is raised principally through syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions with which we maintain strong working relationships. As explained at the beginning of this Financial Review, we do not proportionally consolidate our two premium outlet investments for reporting purposes. Link to business model 1 2 3 – We focus on prime shopping centres in the best locations, convenient retail parks and premium outlets, all with experienced management. We estimate that property values (including premium outlets) could fall by 42% from their December 2015 levels before covenants would be endangered. These meetings gave Directors further insight into how Hammerson’s values are embedded in the business and you can read more about this on page 75. During the interview process and in my initial meetings with fellow Directors, I was impressed by everybody’s collegiate, friendly but professional attitude. Gwyn Burr The Board’s diversity helps inform our debates and we have a wide range of experience to draw on. Andrew Formica As Chief Executive, David Atkins provides strong leadership and instils the culture that makes Hammerson such an attractive place to work. Judy Gibbons Yes, we have many opportunities to hold informal meetings with management that help us assess the underlying perceptions of our culture and values. Investor feedback was positive with investors commenting that they found it useful to see two key schemes under development and meet operational colleagues. Considerations included a review of the Company’s plans aiming to ensure that key roles at Board and Group Executive Committee level can be filled by other colleagues on an interim basis. A review of talent in the wider business is undertaken and GEC members engage with high potential individuals to discuss their career aspirations. As part of this review, EY and Deloitte were also asked to provide feedback on the Group’s current internal audit arrangements.
