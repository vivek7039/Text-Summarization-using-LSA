As with prior transactions we expect HPE Software’s revenue trend to continue its historical decline until signiﬁcant change has been implemented. Signiﬁcant market positions In any IT system the customers’ business logic and data remain critical to their competitive advantage. This combination enables customers to execute a hybrid on premise/cloud solution ensuring day-to-day operations are handled effectively on premise but offering broadly unlimited additional capacity as and when needed to support business operational peaks, underpinned by the ﬂexibility and ease of use of a common solution in both cases. Through our suite of identity, access and security solutions we offer industry leading capabilities to help customers ﬁnd this balance. We would like to thank our employees for their continued dedication, commitment and hard work in delivering the full year results. We will also list in the USA, through an ADS, which further expands Micro Focus relevant investor base. We are conﬁdent that this level of debt will not reduce our ability to deliver growth, invest in products and/or make appropriate acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions in the year, exceptional items, share-based payments and exchange gains, administrative expenses decreased by $14.3m to $78.7m (2016: reported $93.0m). We achieve this through the rigorous application of our FOUR-BOX MODEL which has at its core direct engagement with customers to enable highly targeted product development and delivery. The remaining focus area is on IT systems where our stated goal of driving standardization will take longer to deliver than originally anticipated. The teams have been reorganized with compensation and incentives changed to be targeted on delivering successful software implementations rather than more standalone services engagements. These technologies allow customers ﬂexibility in deciding the platform choice for development, testing and deployment of their business applications. Micro Focus will maintain its leadership positions in CDMS through products such as Visual COBOL and Enterprise Developer. Our customers span all sectors with particular strength in regulated industries, including Healthcare, Finance, Government, Retail, Manufacturing, and Energy. Micro Focus will maintain its existing and seek to develop new leadership positions through continued investment in customer centred innovation. By continuing to sharpen our focus in IAS we are well positioned for growth over the longer term. This portfolio continues to show annual revenue growth underpinned by Visual COBOL and Enterprise Developer which highlights the continuing value customers derive from our CDMS products in support of their mission critical applications. There were some excellent wins in IAS that demonstrate what can be delivered when skill and execution levels are maintained. In the year ended 30 April 2018, SUSE will directly manage all of their own consulting services and maintenance renewals activities. Thousands of customers around the world rely on SUSE for their Open Source, software-deﬁned infrastructure needs ranging from enterprise Linux to OpenStack private cloud to software deﬁned, distributed storage and container based application delivery – all combined with comprehensive management capabilities for the complete software deﬁned infrastructure architecture. – Data Center consolidation and virtualization – maximizing hardware investments by running multiple operating system instances on the same physical server. – Reducing Operating Expenses (“OPEX”) – the days of manual systems management processes are past for any enterprise that needs to also innovate and compete. – Meeting regulatory compliance requirements – to stay compliant, enterprises must have comprehensive monitoring, conﬁguration management controls and remediation capabilities in place. Application Containers Organizations can improve business agility by adopting a software-deﬁned infrastructure approach to support containerization of their applications. As the weighted average contract duration reduces, we would generally expect to get a higher ‘in ﬁscal year yield’. Good solid performance across all countries in the region together with closing of some large enterprise deals contributed to this outstanding growth. Indirect represents customers that subscribe via the SUSE Value Added Reseller network and predominantly through a two tier distribution model. Nils Brauckmann Chief Executive Ofﬁcer SUSE 17 July 2017 Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Consolidated ﬁnancial statements and notes Company ﬁnancial statements and notes Additional information 33 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Shareholder returns Description Metrics Performance Compound Annual growth rate: – Since IPO – Over last ﬁve years – Over last three years – Over last year 2017: 29.3% 42.7% 51.7% 73.3% 2016: 26.4% 34.8% 34.1% 24.2% These ratios demonstrate the compound annual growth rate in shareholder returns assuming reinvestment of Return of Values, but not ordinary dividends. In addition, effective GTM models may be more successful if accompanied by compelling Micro Focus and SUSE brand awareness programmes. Tom Virden, formerly, a non-executive director, also participated in the CSR committee to provide additional board level input until he resigned on 25 April 2017. Processes are being established to track other sources of emissions such as commercial ﬂights for business travel, which is not presently covered in this data. We have maintained our capital budget for investment in energy saving initiatives to help us drive further reductions. Most recently, he was the General Manager of Europe, Middle East, & Africa for Dell’s Public Sector and Large Commercial Enterprise business unit. Karen began her career at ICL before spending 20 years at Hewlett-Packard Company, where in 2000 she became Vice President and General Manager Worldwide Sales & Marketing for the Business Customer Organization, responsible for sales of all Hewlett-Packard products, services and software to business customers globally. Since leaving IBM in 2005 he has acted as a non-executive director for several companies including Compel, Message Labs, Global Crossing, Morse and Easynet. The board also met on a further nine occasions to receive interim updates or consider matters arising between formal meetings. There are a number of Group administrative functions such as Finance, Treasury, Human Resources, IT, Corporate Communications and Legal. A number of Group-wide policies, issued and administered centrally, have been set to ensure compliance with key governance standards. Shareholder communications The Company currently reports formally to shareholders twice a year, in July (preliminary announcement of annual results) and December (interim statement). The external auditors reported that they tested in detail all larger deals above a certain threshold and had not identiﬁed any exceptions. They also take into consideration that individuals may have different levels of experience, capability, and market demand for their services. Conditional share awards or nil-cost options are typically made annually with vesting dependent upon the achievement of performance conditions normally over three years. The committee commits to consulting with and seeking approval from shareholders in advance of operating outside these policy limits. However, the Company will only do so after consulting with, and seeking approval from shareholders in advance of operating outside these limits. There are accordingly areas where this contract is not consistent with the policy for new executive directors as set out below. Executive directors Base salary, ARA and fees 1 (£’000) Benefits in kind 2 (£’000) Annual bonus 3 (£’000) LTIP 4 (£’000) Pension 5 (£’000) Total (£’000) Kevin Loosemore 2017 750 32 506 2,788 150 4,226 2016 750 31 1,125 2,175 150 4,231 Mike Phillips 2017 470 19 317 1,493 71 2,370 2016 470 16 470 979 59 1,994 Stephen Murdoch 6 2017 500 18 338 1,365 75 2,296 2016 125 5 125 610 19 884 Nils Brauckmann 6 2017 423 12 285 619 63 1,402 2016 98 17 98 – – 213 Non-executive directors Tom Skelton 2017 –– –––– 2016 25 – – – – 25 Karen Slatford 7 2017 103 – – – – 103 2016 82 – – – – 82 Tom Virden 2017 62 – – – – 62 2016 50 – – – – 50 Richard Atkins 2017 78 – – – – 78 2016 60 – – – – 60 Karen Geary 2017 –– –––– 2016 48 – – – – 48 Steve Schuckenbrock 8 2017 71 – – – – 71 2016 17 – – – – 17 Amanda Brown 9 2017 68 – – – – 68 2016 –– –––– Total 2017 2,525 81 1,446 6,265 359 10,676 2016 1,725 69 1,818 3,764 228 7 ,604 Notes: 1 Base salary, ARA and fee: amount earned for the year. For all executive directors (with the exception of the Executive Chairman) one-third of any bonus earned will be deferred into Company shares, to maximize long-term shareholder alignment, support retention in a highly competitive and global talent pool, and be in line with typical market practice. At present it is anticipated that the performance measures and targets will be on a similar basis as for awards made in 2016. 3 Stephen Murdoch and Nils Brauckmann are required to have a 150% shareholding within three years of joining as directors on 1 February 2016. 4 Performance condition requires that cumulative EPS growth over a three year vesting period is at least equal to RPI plus 3% per annum (at which point 25% of awards will vest) and for full vesting the cumulative EPS growth will be required to be RPI plus 9% per annum. The Group has a range of policies which are aimed at retaining and providing incentives for key staff. We assessed this risk to be greatest in larger transactions, where there is increased likelihood of unusual sales arrangements containing bespoke terms. These costs are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of three to ﬁve years. Property held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell. These amendments clarify how to account for deferred tax assets originated from unrealized loss in debt instruments measured at fair value. Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to each individual cash generating unit (“CGU”). Long-term growth rate The VIU calculations are based on ﬁve years projections and then a terminal value calculation. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic life – see Group accounting policy I(d).
