to be successful in this stage of a market both operational effectiveness and scale are critical. micro focus sets out to deliver consistent long-term shareholder returns of between 15% and 20% per annum. these returns can be further enhanced by the appropriate deployment of capital in value enhancing acquisitions. this has now been superseded by the plan to adopt new systems being implemented in hpe software. as with prior transactions we expect hpe software’s revenue trend to continue its historical decline until signiﬁcant change has been implemented. typically customers would be forced into costly, disruptive and risky change to make this possible but with micro focus, customers can take a different approach that we characterize as bridging the old and the new. we focus on customer centred innovation that enables customers to exploit new technologies without undue disruption. by contrast, if a cobol application had been rewritten in another language, to execute in java or .net the customer would have to undertake additional incremental re-writes and incur signiﬁcant costs every time there was a major technology change. this combination enables customers to execute a hybrid on premise/cloud solution ensuring day-to-day operations are handled effectively on premise but offering broadly unlimited additional capacity as and when needed to support business operational peaks, underpinned by the ﬂexibility and ease of use of a common solution in both cases. for example, visual cobol enables customers to take cobol applications forward with conﬁdence into the next phase of it industry innovation, speciﬁcally cloud and mobile, whilst protecting their investments in business logic and data built up through prior investments. through our suite of identity, access and security solutions we offer industry leading capabilities to help customers ﬁnd this balance. we will continue to focus investment in growth and core products and will not dispose of declining products unless we can achieve greater than the discounted cash ﬂow they would generate in our ownership. most organizations operate infrastructure and applications which have emerged over time, often years apart, such that core legacy platforms sit alongside distributed systems, which more recently have been extended further again with web, cloud and mobile technologies. the company’s market capitalization on that date was £635.0m and by 30 april 2017 this had increased to £5,944.0m. we would like to thank our employees for their continued dedication, commitment and hard work in delivering the full year results. whilst the vast majority of companies will choose to focus on the “new and exciting”; we believe that there will be an increasing opportunity to help clients derive value from their existing and often highly complex it investments. the annual cash bonus applies to all members of staff in micro focus (excluding those on sales incentives). we will also list in the usa, through an ads, which further expands micro focus relevant investor base. following this activity approximately 30% of the company’s shares are now held in north america. we are conﬁdent that this level of debt will not reduce our ability to deliver growth, invest in products and/or make appropriate acquisitions. kevin loosemore executive chairman 17 july 2017 10 micro focus international plc annual report and accounts 2017 executive chairman’s statement continued group results presented for the year ended 30 april 2017 include the post-acquisition period results for serena, gwava, openattic and openstack. excluding acquisitions in the year, exceptional items, share-based payments and exchange gains, administrative expenses decreased by $14.3m to $78.7m (2016: reported $93.0m). net ﬁnance costs have decreased by $1.7m on a pro-forma ccy basis, mostly due to reduced loan interest and commitment fees ($2.1m) offset by an increase in the amortization of prepaid facility arrangement, original issue discounts and facility fees ($0.2m). the facility was less than 35% drawn at 30 april 2017 and therefore no covenant test is applicable. this represented a cash conversion ratio when compared to adjusted ebitda less exceptional items of 102.0% (2016: 87.9%). we achieve this through the rigorous application of our four-box model which has at its core direct engagement with customers to enable highly targeted product development and delivery. – integration of the business into a coherent whole is now broadly complete as evidenced by the progress on removing sub-branding, completely redesigning our websites, transitioning to a geographic go-to-market (“gtm”) model globally and creating an integrated approach to product development and management. the remaining focus area is on it systems where our stated goal of driving standardization will take longer to deliver than originally anticipated. this will enable more effective integration of the existing group with hpe software and the creation of a more ﬂexible platform from which to execute our strategy but it remains a very signiﬁcant undertaking. the teams have been reorganized with compensation and incentives changed to be targeted on delivering successful software implementations rather than more standalone services engagements. in the interim we switched focus to tackling other areas of process or technology inefﬁciencies. all of which is key to effective operation today and faster integration with hpe software in the future. these technologies allow customers ﬂexibility in deciding the platform choice for development, testing and deployment of their business applications. micro focus will maintain its leadership positions in cdms through products such as visual cobol and enterprise developer. there are additional secure shell (“ssh”) based ﬁle transfer solutions that solve a range of tactical and strategic problems for securely transferring ﬁles of any size, enabling businesses to work seamlessly with partners and customers. our customers span all sectors with particular strength in regulated industries, including healthcare, finance, government, retail, manufacturing, and energy. 22 micro focus international plc annual report and accounts 2017 ceo review – micro focus product portfolio continued development & it operations management tools – 20.6% of fy17 group revenues (2016: pro-forma ccy 22.7%) on 2 may 2016 we added important new capabilities and depth to this product portfolio through the acquisition of serena, a leading provider of application lifecycle management products enhancing both our expertise in mainframe computing and distributed software change management. organizations competing in a global marketplace must deliver innovative applications that meet customer expectations anytime, anywhere. using a uniﬁed management console, these tools enable all devices to be patched, compliant, secure and properly equipped. collaboration & networking – 10.5% of fy17 group revenues (2016: pro-forma ccy 11.3%) our collaboration products enable organizations to build and operate work environments that are more secure and easier to manage, regardless of how or where people work. this technology is deployed across thousands of customers supporting more than a billion transactions per day. micro focus will maintain its existing and seek to develop new leadership positions through continued investment in customer centred innovation. by continuing to sharpen our focus in ias we are well positioned for growth over the longer term. overview strategic report corporate governance consolidated ﬁnancial statements and notes company ﬁnancial statements and notes additional information 23 micro focus

revenue consultancy revenues declined by 12.0% (2016: 15.2%) on a pro-forma ccy basis as we completed the implementation of the established micro focus policy of focusing only on consulting business that supports our licence business. cdms revenues were $265.2m; a growth of 2.8% on a pro-forma ccy basis compared with the year to 30 april 2016. this portfolio continues to show annual revenue growth underpinned by visual cobol and enterprise developer which highlights the continuing value customers derive from our cdms products in support of their mission critical applications. identity, access & security (“ias”) revenues declined by 3.4% ($7.3m) in the year on a pro-forma ccy basis. licence revenues declined by 6.0% on pro-forma ccy basis due to a lack of large scale projects in customers which is an area of real strength for our products and increased competition in this market from niche players for the smaller more point solutions. development & it operations management tools revenues which now include serena were $285.2m; a 9.7% ($30.6m) decline on pro-forma ccy basis. collaboration & networking revenues which now include gwava were $144.5m a decline of 8.1% ($12.7m) on pro-forma ccy basis. there were some excellent wins in ias that demonstrate what can be delivered when skill and execution levels are maintained. in the year ended 30 april 2018, suse will directly manage all of their own consulting services and maintenance renewals activities. in fy17, we continued to strengthen our partner eco system, with continued investment in broadening and deepening the partnership with alliances, oem, two tier distributors, value add resellers, cloud service providers and system integrators. suse continues to rely on sustained growing contribution from these strategic partnerships for its overall success. thousands of customers around the world rely on suse for their open source, software-deﬁned infrastructure needs ranging from enterprise linux to openstack private cloud to software deﬁned, distributed storage and container based application delivery – all combined with comprehensive management capabilities for the complete software deﬁned infrastructure architecture. additional detail can be found at: enterprise linux linux is one of the ﬁrst and most successful open source software projects in the industry and has now become a well-established choice in the enterprise operating system market but also in numerous other use cases including mobile devices, internet of things (“iot”), cloud computing, big data analytics and more. – data center consolidation and virtualization – maximizing hardware investments by running multiple operating system instances on the same physical server. this technology provides a highly ﬂexible alternative to proprietary solutions which both commercial companies and end-customer enterprises can directly engage with through the openstack project in addition to utilizing distributions such as suse openstack cloud. some of the key drivers creating demand for openstack private cloud solutions such as suse openstack cloud include: – data center evolution to software deﬁned infrastructure (“sdi”) – the next step beyond data center consolidation and virtualization is to embrace the ﬂexibility and agility of cloud capabilities such as self-service, direct integration with software-deﬁned storage and networking. suse storage, built on ceph technology, is a unique solution with resilient self-managing and self-healing capabilities combined with ﬂexibility to dynamically utilize both existing hardware as well as today’s latest industry standard hardware components. 28 micro focus international plc annual report and accounts 2017 ceo review – suse product portfolio continued systems management for mid-sized or larger computing environments, comprehensive systems management is a critical factor that many enterprises still struggle to address. – reducing operating expenses (“opex”) – the days of manual systems management processes are past for any enterprise that needs to also innovate and compete. – meeting regulatory compliance requirements – to stay compliant, enterprises must have comprehensive monitoring, conﬁguration management controls and remediation capabilities in place. application containers organizations can improve business agility by adopting a software-deﬁned infrastructure approach to support containerization of their applications. suse – key performance metrics suse provides technical support together with rights to updates,

that it had reached agreement with hpe on the acquisition of technology and talent to expand suse’s openstack infrastructure-as-a-service solution and accelerate suse’s entry to the cloud foundry platform-as-a-service market. in addition, effective gtm models may be more successful if accompanied by compelling micro focus and suse brand awareness programmes. succession plans have been developed and are in place for key leadership positions within the company. some of the group’s products utilize open source technology which is dependent upon third party developers. treasury risk the group operates across a number of jurisdictions and so is exposed to currency ﬂuctuations. acquisitions will be considered but they need to meet the group’s stringent return on investment criteria. the group also considered a number of scenarios that would represent serious threats to its liquidity. tom virden, formerly, a non-executive director, also participated in the csr committee to provide additional board level input until he resigned on 25 april 2017. micro focus products can help customers to reduce their it carbon footprint and these beneﬁts feature in conversations with existing customers, prospects, partners and suppliers. micro focus continues to work with the carbon trust and as a result of changes to our operational boundaries and increased acquisition activity micro focus narrowly missed achieving the “carbon trust standard” this time round. this reporting period 98.84% of software products were distributed electronically, with just over 1% delivered to customers via physical distribution; – further improvements across all locations either by moving to more modern and efﬁcient ofﬁce environments or by improving the ofﬁce environments already in use. part of micro focus’ decision making process when sourcing locations is to identify leed ratings wherever possible. all material emission sources over which micro focus deems to have operational control are in scope. processes are being established to track other sources of emissions such as commercial ﬂights for business travel, which is not presently covered in this data. for consistency, in this reporting period our emissions have been calculated solely using defra’s conversion tables published on their website, rather than as in previous periods where the energy company’s individual fuel mix was used. this work is helping with the ability to monitor and report on year-on-year comparisons going forward. during this reporting year we have continued our commitment to both cdp and the carbon trust. we have maintained our capital budget for investment in energy saving initiatives to help us drive further reductions. in prior years, a portion of the group’s charitable giving has been allocated to global causes. 3 stephen murdoch, 50 (chief executive ofﬁcer micro focus) stephen is currently our chief executive ofﬁcer, micro focus and a member of the micro focus board, positions he has held since 1 february 2016. before his appointment as ceo, micro focus stephen served as general manager of products and marketing strategy from november 2012 to april 2014 and then as chief operating ofﬁcer from april 2014 to february 2016. stephen has a 25-year track record of success in the it industry, spanning hardware, software, and services. most recently, he was the general manager of europe, middle east, & africa for dell’s public sector and large commercial enterprise business unit. karen began her career at icl before spending 20 years at hewlett-packard company, where in 2000 she became vice president and general manager worldwide sales & marketing for the business customer organization, responsible for sales of all hewlett-packard products, services and software to business customers globally. since leaving ibm in 2005 he has acted as a non-executive director for several companies including compel, message labs, global crossing, morse and easynet. prior to hiscox, amanda held a number of leadership roles with mars, pepsico, and whitbread plc. she has expertise in human resources, remuneration strategy, and managing organizations through periods of signiﬁcant change. silke is a director of cnh industrial n.v., the netherlands and jungbunzlauer holding ag, basel, switzerland. key corporate governance activities in 2016/2017

risk management review a renewal of the group’s overall risk management framework was undertaken, see pages 36 to 43 for details on 15 may 2017, darren roos and silke scheiber were appointed as new non-executive directors. therefore all directors will retire, and seek election or re-election, as applicable, at the forthcoming agm. the board also met on a further nine occasions to receive interim updates or consider matters arising between formal meetings. there are a number of group administrative functions such as finance, treasury, human resources, it, corporate communications and legal. a number of group-wide policies, issued and administered centrally, have been set to ensure compliance with key governance standards. shareholder communications the company currently reports formally to shareholders twice a year, in july (preliminary announcement of annual results) and december (interim statement). the group also has internal and external checks to guard against unauthorized release of information. the external auditors reported that they tested in detail all larger deals above a certain threshold and had not identiﬁed any exceptions. they had also tested a sample of transactions from the remaining population and no issues were identiﬁed. development expenditure the costs incurred on development projects relating to the development of new computer software programmes and signiﬁcant enhancement of existing computer software programmes are recognized as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will be a success, considering its commercial and technological feasibility, and costs can be measured reliably. the committee received a report from management and having considered this concluded that no impairment was necessary. having ﬁrst formally assessed and conﬁrmed their ability to be independent in the time frame required, appropriate ﬁrms were invited to tender in january 2017. the tender process encompassed a range of activities including a data room, management interviews (including hpe software), written proposals, tender presentations and a review process incorporating the use of scorecards. following a period of due consideration of a report and recommendation from the committee, the board announced on 1 1 april 2017 its intention to appoint kpmg llp to become micro focus’ external auditors and pwc will be stepping down as external auditors. 66 micro focus international plc annual report and accounts 2017 audit committee report continued whistleblowing the group has a whistleblowing policy which forms part of the group’s worldwide code of conduct and business ethics. all board appointments are made on merit with the aim of achieving a correct balance. no executive director or employee participates in discussions relating to the setting of their own remuneration. they also take into consideration that individuals may have different levels of experience, capability, and market demand for their services. additional beneﬁts may also be provided in certain circumstances which may include (but are not limited to) relocation expenses, housing allowance, school fees, incremental overseas tax of the directors and fees for a temporary increase in responsibilities. an individual may elect to receive some or all of their pension contribution as a cash allowance. conditional share awards or nil-cost options are typically made annually with vesting dependent upon the achievement of performance conditions normally over three years. any such adjustments would be disclosed in the relevant year’s annual report on remuneration. the ‘maximum’ scenario reﬂects ﬁxed remuneration, plus full pay-out of all incentives (excluding asg awards). the committee commits to consulting with and seeking approval from shareholders in advance of operating outside these policy limits. however, the company will only do so after consulting with, and seeking approval from shareholders in advance of operating outside these limits. there are accordingly areas where this contract is not consistent with the policy for new executive directors as set out below. 1 subject to the below, set out in the loss of ofﬁce payments section, kevin loosemore’s notice period decreases by one month for each complete month served after 31 october 2017 until it reaches zero on 1 may 2018. executive directors must take all reasonable steps to obtain alternative employment during the notice period and payments made by the company will be reduced to reﬂect any payments received in respect of alternative employment. the committee may vary the level of vesting, if it believes that exceptional circumstances warrant this, taking into account any other factors it believes to be relevant in deciding to what extent an award will vest. with prior approval from the board, each serving executive director can undertake external non-executive directorships. we remain committed to shareholder dialogue and take an active interest in voting outcomes. 2017 $m 2016 $m % change distribution to shareholders – dividends paid 177.5 105.2 +68.7% employee remuneration 554.0 509.7 +8.7% the directors are

remuneration package is structured to help ensure alignment with shareholders. 2 as previously discussed with shareholders, due to this being nils brauckmann’s ﬁrst board appointment his initial salary was set at a relatively low level with the intention to increase this over time as he develops in the role. 3 stephen murdoch and nils brauckmann are required to have a 150% shareholding within three years of joining as directors on 1 february 2016. 4 performance condition requires that cumulative eps growth over a three year vesting period is at least equal to rpi plus 3% per annum (at

and (ii) above. the group also has an online process which enables employees to express views and suggest improvements. the group has a range of policies which are aimed at retaining and providing incentives for key staff. as at 30 april 2017 the total number of voting rights in the company was 229,674,479. rights and obligations attaching to shares voting at a general meeting of the company: – on a show of hands, every member present in person and every proxy duly appointed by a member shall have one vote; and – on a poll, every member who is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which he or she is the holder. the board may, in its absolute discretion and without giving any reasons, decline to register any instrument of transfer of a certiﬁcated share which is not a fully paid share provided that, where any such shares are admitted to the ofﬁcial list maintained by the uk listing authority, such discretion may not be exercised in such a way as to prevent dealings in the shares of that class from taking place on an open and proper basis. 94 micro focus international plc annual report and accounts 2017 directors’ report continued – in relation

secured seven year term loan b issued by ma financeco llc is priced at euribor plus 3.00% (subject to a euribor ﬂoor of 0.00%) with an original issue discount of 0.25%. the facility was less than 35% drawn at 30 april 2017 and therefore no covenant test is applicable. we assessed this risk to be greatest in larger transactions, where there is increased likelihood of unusual sales arrangements containing bespoke terms. having identiﬁed those transactions, we traced a sample to supporting documentary evidence that, without exception, supported their validity. our testing focused on the larger and more judgmental fair value adjustments that were recorded. 11 0 micro focus international plc annual report and accounts 2017 consolidated statement of cash ﬂows for the year ended 30 april 2017 general information micro focus international plc (“company”) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the uk. as at 30 april 2017, the group had a presence in 40 countries (2016: 39) worldwide and employed approximately 4,800 people (2016: 4,200). the areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are signiﬁcant to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements are disclosed below in ii, ‘critical accounting estimates and assumptions’. control is presumed to exist when the group owns more than half of the voting rights (which does not always equal percentage ownership) unless it can be demonstrated that ownership does not constitute control. at 30 april 2017 the group had a 12.5% interest ($10.5m) (2016: 14.3%, $12.7m) investment in open invention network llc (“oin”). amounts collected prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are included in deferred income. this is usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. these costs are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of three to ﬁve years. property held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell. 11 4 micro focus international plc annual report and accounts 2017 summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies for the year ended 30 april 2017 continued m trade receivables trade receivables are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost less provisions for impairment. a provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position. subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are stated at amortized cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the period of borrowing on an effective interest basis. deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. – annual improvements 2014 includes amendments to ifrs 5, ‘non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations’, ifrs 7, ‘financial instruments: disclosures’, ias 19, ‘employee beneﬁts’ and ias 34, ‘interim financial reporting’ applies for periods beginning on or after 1 january 2016. application of the standard is mandatory for annual reporting periods starting from 1 january 2018 onwards. these amendments clarify how to account for deferred tax assets originated from unrealized loss in debt instruments measured at fair value. this interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2019, subject to eu endorsement. where acquisitions are signiﬁcant, appropriate advice is sought from professional advisors before making such allocations otherwise valuations are done by management using consistent methodology used on prior year acquisitions where appropriate professional advice was sought. collateral is not required for those receivables, but on-going credit evaluations of customers’ ﬁnancial conditions are performed. borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash ﬂow interest rate risk. other activities include: development of a new group intranet and website, system integration costs. goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to each individual cash generating unit (“cgu”). long-term growth rate the viu calculations are based on ﬁve years projections and then
