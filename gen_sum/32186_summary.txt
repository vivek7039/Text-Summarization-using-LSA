‘n’ lock” system delivers cost savings with “one‑man” installation the challenge accessories provide the finishing touches to any bathroom but fitting larger items such as mirrored cabinets has traditionally been a time-consuming “two-man job”. both white steel cabinets have mirrored doors, two adjustable shelves and 110 degree sprung hinges to maximise storage space. the result by enabling a single fitter to install each cabinet, significant cost savings in both labour and time have been achieved. norcros plc annual report and accounts 2017 05 overview strategic report corporate

develop. martin towers chairman 14 june 2017 06 norcros plc annual report and accounts 2017 group chief executive’s statement overview building on our record of sustained progress over recent years, group revenue for the year increased by 15.0% to £271.2m (2016: £235.9m) and by 10.6% on a constant currency basis. this performance reflected the business‑ wide progress, particularly in operating efficiencies, procurement and supply chain management, with improvements made by all three businesses. organic growth will continue to be driven by capitalising on our leading market positions in the uk and south africa. in the previous year vado won new business with miller homes, stewart milne and cala homes, amongst others, and these relationships have driven increased demand in the current year as vado products have been specified for additional new home developments. growing our export business is a key focus and it is pleasing to report that there has been an encouraging take‑ up following the launch of a range of croydex products into south africa through the group’s tile africa retail network. abode abode, our leading niche designer and distributor of high quality kitchen taps, bathroom taps and kitchen sinks, recorded revenue of £10.6m for the twelve months since acquisition on 31 march 2016, in line with the board’s expectations. operationally, the business has expanded its sales force and sourced additional warehousing to support future growth. consistent with our other recent acquisitions it is pleasing to report that abode has been integrated seamlessly into the group. johnson tiles continued to make gains in the house developer sector with barratt david wilson, persimmon, redrow and an increasing number of smaller regional builders, although the social housing refurbishment market remained weak, because of continued tight funding control. more recently the business has secured significant contract wins to supply wickes and the nmbs buying group, and has grown its relationship with travis perkins such that several new products will be rolled out across its extensive branch network. this reflected the business‑ wide progress, particularly in supply chain management, with improvements made by all three businesses. tile africa tile africa, our leading retailer of wall and floor tiles, adhesives, showers, sanitaryware and bathroom fittings, delivered its third successive year of double digit constant currency growth with revenue 12.0% higher on a constant currency basis, being 26.1% higher on a sterling reported basis, at £57.0m (2016: £45.2m). the customer experience (cx) format stores, both new and upgraded, are performing ahead of expectations. it looks to uplift both our own employees and the wider communities that we operate in. as part of the tile academy course, students were able to practise their skills by tiling three children’s crèches in local disadvantaged areas. norcros plc annual report and

striped tables, the restaurant delivers authentic nautical chic. this will be payable over the next ten years and thereby provides a greater degree of certainty around future deficit recovery contributions. net cash generated from operating activities was £7.0m higher than the previous year at £25.5m, largely due to the £9.4m improvement in underlying operating cash flows offset by a £2.0m increase in outflows from exceptional items and acquisition related costs. these should not be viewed as a replacement of, or superior to, those defined by generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). rebate schemes and incentive programmes help maintain these key relationships in a competitive market situation. no change competition the group operates within a highly competitive environment in all its markets. future growth plans may be restricted or delayed by difficulties experienced in recruiting and retaining appropriate staff. in addition to competitive salaries there are annual bonus schemes, share options and other benefits offered. a grant of options under the apsp has taken place annually since 2011. the group is able to offer employees appropriate training and opportunities for advancement and has a demonstrable track record of internal promotion. a significant increase in interest rates would affect the group’s profitability and cash flow. no change acquisition risk part of the group’s strategy is to grow through selective acquisitions. the group also has robust board approval procedures in place to ensure independent review of proposals. in south africa, the country’s government debt has recently been lowered to non‑ investment grade status by certain credit rating agencies. if market conditions unexpectedly deteriorated, demand for our products would reduce, impacting profitability and cash generation. increased norcros plc annual report and accounts 2017 27 overview strategic report corporate governance financial statements risk and description potential effects mitigating actions change foreign currency exchange risk the group’s financial performance is subject to the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. the group may, where it is considered appropriate, denominate some of its borrowings in other currencies to hedge translational asset risk. risks from rising costs of providing a final salary pension scheme have therefore been materially reduced. economic uncertainty may impact input costs, consumer confidence and demand for the group’s products. nevertheless, all businesses in the group are strongly encouraged to devise and adopt whatever means of employee consultation best suits their circumstances. across norcros, great emphasis is placed on the recruitment, training and development of our people. norcros is committed to minimising this impact by continually improving its efficiency in terms of energy, water and material consumption. alongside well‑ established links with d2d,

of corporate governance are maintained by norcros plc and is accountable to the company’s shareholders for good corporate governance. the directors and management teams of each group company are responsible for those business entities. this non-executive role provides useful experience and does not adversely impact his duties to the company. the board has suitable procedures in place for ensuring that its powers to authorise conflict situations are operated effectively. however, the board has decided that every director should, where appropriate, offer themselves for re-election at each annual general meeting. the company ensures that all valid proxy appointments received for general meetings are properly recorded and counted. this is undertaken via an annual programme to review the internal control environment at each business unit. an annual budget for each business unit is prepared in detail and approved by the group executive management. in order to value the liabilities, management had engaged an independent firm of qualified actuaries. such systems can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. the status of internal audit recommendations is also reviewed at each divisional board meeting to ensure that they are implemented on a timely basis. lower-level risks are discussed at monthly divisional management meetings and highlighted to the board as appropriate. we are focused on ensuring the group’s remuneration policy is closely aligned with shareholders’ interests and enables us to attract, retain and motivate quality executive leadership, but without paying more than is necessary for this purpose. under a scenario where all performance conditions are met in full, the executive directors’ package consists of 38% fixed pay, 31% annual bonus and 31% long-term incentive. the committee is focused on ensuring the group’s remuneration policy is closely aligned with shareholders’ interests.” corporate governance overview financial statements strategic report norcros plc annual report and accounts 2017 43 remuneration strategy continued to further ensure remuneration is aligned with shareholder interests, half of any bonus paid is deferred for three years, shares vesting from apsp awards made in 2015 onwards need to be held for a further two years (i.e. until the fifth anniversary of grant), and the executive directors are additionally required to build and maintain a shareholding of at least 100% of salary. on behalf of the remuneration committee, i would like to thank shareholders for their continued support. vesting of apsp awards is dependent upon the group’s diluted underlying earnings per share (eps) performance over a three-year period. 46 norcros plc annual report and

which up to 5% may be used to satisfy options under executive share schemes. this indemnity does not provide cover should a director be proven to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly. however, because the group’s activities are organised on a de-centralised basis, with each operating business having a reasonable degree of autonomy over its operations, there is no uniform set of arrangements for employee involvement imposed throughout the group. nevertheless, all group companies are strongly encouraged to devise and adopt whatever means of employee consultation best suits their circumstances. there are no provisions within directors’ employment contracts which allow for specific termination payments upon a change of control. additionally, testing was performed in respect of post-year- end credit notes issued and debit notes received, where applicable, to determine whether specific promotions were appropriately provided for as at the balance sheet date at the appropriate amount. based on our work performed, we consider the assumptions and methodology adopted to be reasonable. hazel macnamara (senior statutory auditor) for and on behalf of pricewaterhousecoopers llp
