CASE STUDY – CROYDEX Aberfeldy Village T ower Hamlets, Croydex “Hang ‘N’ Lock” system delivers cost savings with “one‑man” installation THE CHALLENGE Accessories provide the finishing touches to any bathroom but fitting larger items such as mirrored cabinets has traditionally been a time-consuming “two-man job”. Both white steel cabinets have mirrored doors, two adjustable shelves and 110 degree sprung hinges to maximise storage space. THE RESULT By enabling a single fitter to install each cabinet, significant cost savings in both labour and time have been achieved. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 05 Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements People Our employees continue to be our most valuable asset and in recognition of this the Group aims to create an environment in which they can see their careers develop. This performance reflected the business‑ wide progress, particularly in operating efficiencies, procurement and supply chain management, with improvements made by all three businesses. Organic growth will continue to be driven by capitalising on our leading market positions in the UK and South Africa. In the previous year Vado won new business with Miller Homes, Stewart Milne and CALA Homes, amongst others, and these relationships have driven increased demand in the current year as Vado products have been specified for additional new home developments. Growing our export business is a key focus and it is pleasing to report that there has been an encouraging take‑ up following the launch of a range of Croydex products into South Africa through the Group’s Tile Africa retail network. Consistent with our other recent acquisitions it is pleasing to report that Abode has been integrated seamlessly into the Group. This reflected the business‑ wide progress, particularly in supply chain management, with improvements made by all three businesses. Tile Africa Tile Africa, our leading retailer of wall and floor tiles, adhesives, showers, sanitaryware and bathroom fittings, delivered its third successive year of double digit constant currency growth with revenue 12.0% higher on a constant currency basis, being 26.1% higher on a Sterling reported basis, at £57.0m (2016: £45.2m). As part of the Tile Academy Course, students were able to practise their skills by tiling three children’s crèches in local disadvantaged areas. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 21 Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements CASE STUDY – JOHNSON TILES Prismatics and Refine help Harry Ramsden’s seaside‑ inspired interiors THE CHALLENGE Harry Ramsden’s, Blackpool, has long been an institution of the Lancashire seaside town – located on its busiest seafront thoroughfare. Paired with fun interior elements, such as wooden benches and beach hut-style striped tables, the restaurant delivers authentic nautical chic. This will be payable over the next ten years and thereby provides a greater degree of certainty around future deficit recovery contributions. These should not be viewed as a replacement of, or superior to, those defined by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Future growth plans may be restricted or delayed by difficulties experienced in recruiting and retaining appropriate staff. In South Africa, the country’s government debt has recently been lowered to non‑ investment grade status by certain credit rating agencies. Increased Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 27 Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Risk and description Potential effects Mitigating actions Change Foreign currency exchange risk The Group’s financial performance is subject to the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Group may, where it is considered appropriate, denominate some of its borrowings in other currencies to hedge translational asset risk. Nevertheless, all businesses in the Group are strongly encouraged to devise and adopt whatever means of employee consultation best suits their circumstances. Norcros is committed to minimising this impact by continually improving its efficiency in terms of energy, water and material consumption. Appropriate procedures are in place at each location to mitigate the risk of any employee committing an offence under this Act. 2,087 5 1 15 852 4 48 1,235 63 Company Directors Other senior managers 1 Total employees Male Female 30 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 A strong leadership team committed to driving growth. 32 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Board of Directors The Board is committed to ensuring that high standards of corporate governance are maintained by Norcros plc and is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for good corporate governance. The Board has suitable procedures in place for ensuring that its powers to authorise conflict situations are operated effectively. However, the Board has decided that every Director should, where appropriate, offer themselves for re-election at each Annual General Meeting. Martin Payne attended the one Board meeting which took place prior to his leaving office on 12 May 2016. The Company ensures that all valid proxy appointments received for general meetings are properly recorded and counted. This is undertaken via an annual programme to review the internal control environment at each business unit. An annual budget for each business unit is prepared in detail and approved by the Group Executive Management. The status of internal audit recommendations is also reviewed at each divisional board meeting to ensure that they are implemented on a timely basis. Under a scenario where all performance conditions are met in full, the Executive Directors’ package consists of 38% fixed pay, 31% annual bonus and 31% long-term incentive. The Committee is focused on ensuring the Group’s remuneration policy is closely aligned with shareholders’ interests.” Corporate governance Overview Financial statements Strategic report Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 43 Remuneration strategy continued To further ensure remuneration is aligned with shareholder interests, half of any bonus paid is deferred for three years, shares vesting from APSP awards made in 2015 onwards need to be held for a further two years (i.e. until the fifth anniversary of grant), and the Executive Directors are additionally required to build and maintain a shareholding of at least 100% of salary. Vesting of APSP awards is dependent upon the Group’s diluted underlying earnings per share (EPS) performance over a three-year period. APSP targets reflect industry context, expectations of what will constitute appropriately challenging performance levels and factors specific to the Group. Details of any such award will be disclosed in the first Annual Report on Remuneration following its grant. Any such bonus would normally be paid on a pro-rata basis, taking account of the period actually worked. Voluntary resignation or other reason not stated above Unvested awards lapse unless the Committee, in its absolute discretion, determines that an award should vest.

Vesting of this award was based on Norcros’ aggregate diluted underlying EPS over the three financial years to 31 March 2017. External appointments in the year On 1 May 2016 Shaun Smith was appointed as a non-executive director of Air Partner plc. Of any bonus earned 50% will be deferred into nil-cost options for a further three years under the DBP. This indemnity does not provide cover should a Director be proven to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly. Nevertheless, all Group companies are strongly encouraged to devise and adopt whatever means of employee consultation best suits their circumstances. There are no provisions within Directors’ employment contracts which allow for specific termination payments upon a change of control. Although these estimates are based on management‘s best knowledge of amounts, events or actions, actual results may differ from expectations. The comparative figures at 31 March 2016 have also been restated with an additional £19.6m of bank overdrafts being reported in borrowings. Customer rebates, incentives, discounts and promotional support Accrual is made at each Balance Sheet date to reflect management’s best estimate of amounts to be paid in respect of arrangements in place with customers regarding rebates, incentives, discounts and promotional support. 2017 Number 2016 Number Average monthly numbers employed in continuing operations: – UK 1,056 1,036 – overseas 1,031 955 2,087 1,991 Directors’ emoluments 2017 £m 2016 £m Salaries and short-term employee benefits 1.0 1.0 Share-based payments 0.5 0.4 Post-employment benefits 0.1 0.1 1.6 1.5 Further information about the Directors’ remuneration may be found in the Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 51 to 58. Costs of maintaining an in-house acquisitions department and professional advisory fees incurred in connection with the Group’s business combination activities. Such alternative performance measures should not be viewed as a replacement of, or superior to, those defined by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Management has applied sensitivities to the key assumptions and believes that there are no reasonably possible scenarios which would result in an impairment of goodwill. Taking into account the Group’s credit insurance, management believes that no further material provision is required for impairment of receivables. Amounts charged to this provision are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash. Financial liabilities – borrowings continued The repayment terms of borrowings are as follows: 2017 £m 2016 £m Not later than one year 30.9 22.4 After more than one year: – between one and two years — — – between two and five years 30.0 36.0 – costs of raising finance (0.2) (0.4) 29.8 35.6 Total borrowings 60.7 58.0 Capital risk management In July 2014 the Group agreed an unsecured £70m revolving credit facility with a £30m accordion facility with Lloyds Bank plc, Barclays Bank plc and HSBC Bank plc. The Group’s principal UK-based foreign currency exposures are largely hedged until at least March 2018 based on current forecasts. Taking into account both the translational impact and the level of forward exchange contracts in place relative to forecast foreign currency requirements, either a 5% strengthening or a 5% weakening in both Sterling and South African Rand against all other currencies would have an impact on reported profits of less than £0.1m. It is expected that this expenditure will be incurred within one year of the Balance Sheet date.
