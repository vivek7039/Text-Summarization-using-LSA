is clear that there is scope for significant growth within both our current and adjacent markets. group since joining northgate in january 2017 i have been impressed by the professionalism and hardworking attitude of all our team members. the lcv purchase, contract hire and rental markets together generate annual revenues of c.£16bn across our three territories. all investments made will be self-funded through the delivery of business wide efficiencies and improved agility to drive growth. the fixed term opportunity is particularly exciting and we will build on our good progress this year which saw over 4,100 vehicle contracts signed. management’s assessment of our principal risks is based on impact, likelihood, change from the prior year and appetite. an increase in holding costs, if not recovered through hire rate increases, would adversely affect profitability, shareholder returns and cash generation. alternatively, utilisation can be maintained through purchasing fewer vehicles, increasing disposals or a combination of the two. further investment will be made in marketing to ensure that the value proposition underpinning pricing is well communicated and received (see strategy section on page 10). northgate plc annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 april 2017 review 33 strategic report 32 25361.02 13-6-17 proof four corporate social
