Group Since joining Northgate in January 2017 I have been impressed by the professionalism and hardworking attitude of all our team members. The LCV purchase, contract hire and rental markets together generate annual revenues of c.£16bn across our three territories. At £2bn in market revenue, with volumes growing at 8% per annum and both EBIT margins and return on capital similar to that of flexible rental, we see an outstanding opportunity to grow from a position of low market share today. We see significant tailwinds supporting this conversion as a result of the structural market trends identified. All investments made will be self-funded through the delivery of business wide efficiencies and improved agility to drive growth. The fixed term opportunity is particularly exciting and we will build on our good progress this year which saw over 4,100 vehicle contracts signed. Management’s assessment of our principal risks is based on impact, likelihood, change from the prior year and appetite. An increase in holding costs, if not recovered through hire rate increases, would adversely affect profitability, shareholder returns and cash generation. Alternatively, utilisation can be maintained through purchasing fewer vehicles, increasing disposals or a combination of the two. Further investment will be made in marketing to ensure that the value proposition underpinning pricing is well communicated and received (see Strategy section on page 10). In particular, should there be a significant downturn in demand for the Group’s business, vehicle utilisation can be maintained through purchasing fewer vehicles, increasing disposals, or a combination of the two, which would generate cash and reduce debt.

However, we feel that maintaining a Board with an appropriate mix of skills and experience serves our stakeholders well. Accountability Although no system of internal controls can provide absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss, the Group’s system is designed to provide the Directors with reasonable assurance that, should any problems occur, these are identified on a timely basis and dealt with appropriately. Executive change In January 2017, Bob Contreras left the business and Kevin Bradshaw was appointed as CEO. In line with our remuneration policy and good leaver status, Bob must exercise his deferred bonus shares within six months of leaving the business. The EPS target is set at a level to encourage progressive and sustainable growth of earnings for shareholders. Awards are granted subject to continued employment and satisfaction of challenging performance conditions measured over three years. The Company may also make awards of free shares to all employees including executive Directors, on an equal basis. In accordance with best practice it is proposed that the executive Directors are required to hold any awards under EPSP for two years following vesting. In line with best practice it is proposed that equal notice periods will apply to the executive Directors and the Company and that these will normally be six months, although in exceptional circumstances a notice period may be agreed of up to a maximum of 12 months. Termination payment Base salary plus benefits (including pension), subject to mitigation and paid on a phased basis for notice period. Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise. £000 Salary & Fees Taxable Benefits 6 Annual Bonus Long Term incentive 7 Pension 8 Other 9 Loss of Office Total Executive Directors K Bradshaw 1 2017 125 7 – – 23 – – 155 RL Contreras 2 2017 284 14 – 355 51 3 166 873 2016 408 7 208 438 73 4 – 1,138 PJ Gallagher 3 2017 325 18 – – 59 – – 402 2016 62 5 16 – 10 – – 93 Chairman A Page 2017 163 – – – – – – 163 2016 138 – – – – – – 138 Non-executive Directors AJ Allner 2017 63 – – – – – – 63 2016 71 – – – – – – 71 B Spencer 4 2017 62 – – – – – – 62 J Caseberry 2017 65 – – – – – – 65 2016 65 – – – – – – 65 C Miles 5 2017 55 – – – – – – 55 2016 28 – – – – – – 28 1 Kevin Bradshaw was appointed to the Board on 11 January 2017. 6 Taxable Benefits: K Bradshaw £000 RL Contreras £000 PJ Gallagher £000 Car 6 13 17 Medical insurance 1 1 1 7 This relates to the 2014 EPSP award, details of which are given on page 67 . The total amount paid in this financial year after he ceased to be a Director was therefore £195,746. Similarly, he will be permitted to exercise all vested but unexercised EPSP awards over the same period. At 30 April 2017 the Capita Trust held 31,479 (2016 – 17,186) Ordinary shares which had been forfeited as a result of early withdrawals post January 2017. In line with senior UK staff, no increases were made to the executive Directors’ salaries at 1 May 2017. Full retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be seen in next year’s annual report on remuneration. Results Details on financial performance and dividends can be found in the Strategic Report from pages 8 to 39. No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. This limit excludes any Ordinary shares issued pursuant to a general disapplication of pre-emption rights in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment. Disclosure of information under Listing Rule 9.8.4 Dividend waiver arrangements are in place for the employee trusts as shown on page 71. This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of s418 Companies Act 2006. IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ requires that depreciation rates and estimated useful lives are reviewed regularly to ensure that the net book value of tangible fixed assets when they are sold is broadly equivalent to their market value. We also performed look back testing to consider management’s historical accuracy of provisioning for trade receivables. We ensured that appropriate further audit work was undertaken for Northgate plc as the Parent Company.
