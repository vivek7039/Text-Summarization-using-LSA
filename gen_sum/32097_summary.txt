proof four chief executive officer’s review i have undertaken an initial strategic review of the group and it is clear that there is scope for significant growth within both our current and adjacent markets. group since joining northgate in january 2017 i have been impressed by the professionalism and hardworking attitude of all our team members. the lcv purchase, contract hire and rental markets together generate annual revenues of c.£16bn across our three territories. today, we participate in c.£11bn of this spanning rental, contract hire and second hand lcv trading. at £2bn in market revenue, with volumes growing at 8% per annum and both ebit margins and return on capital similar to that of flexible rental, we see an outstanding opportunity to grow from a position of low market share today. we see significant tailwinds supporting this conversion as a result of the structural market trends identified. all investments made will be self-funded through the delivery of business wide efficiencies and improved agility to drive growth. the fixed term opportunity is particularly exciting and we will build on our good progress this year which saw over 4,100 vehicle contracts signed. kevin bradshaw chief executive officer northgate plc annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 april 2017 review 17 strategic report 16 25361.02 13-6-17 proof four financial review our objective is to build shareholder value by generating returns above our cost of capital. excluding both of these impacts underlying profit before tax was £7.4m lower than the prior year. capital management the group’s objective is to maintain a balance sheet structure that is efficient in terms of providing long term returns to shareholders and safeguards the group’s financial position through economic cycles. management’s assessment of our principal risks is based on impact, likelihood, change from the prior year and appetite. without any adjustment to the cost base, this will result in an erosion of returns. an increase in holding costs, if not recovered through hire rate increases, would adversely affect profitability, shareholder returns and cash generation. should it systems not be invested in adequately or fail, whether the cause is accidental or malicious, this could have an adverse impact on the recording and processing of financial information, efficiency of operations and customer service delivery. risk impact before mitigation continued northgateplc.com stock code: ntg 25361.02 13-6-17 proof four should there be a significant economic downturn the flexible nature of the group’s business model allows any vehicles returned to be placed with different customers. alternatively, utilisation can be maintained through purchasing fewer vehicles, increasing disposals or a combination of the two. further investment will be made in marketing to ensure that the value proposition underpinning pricing is well communicated and received (see strategy section on page 10). pricing is negotiated with manufacturers on an annual basis in advance of purchases being made. before any material system changes are implemented a project plan is approved by the board. in particular, should there be a significant downturn in demand for the group’s business, vehicle utilisation can be maintained through purchasing fewer vehicles, increasing disposals, or a combination of the two, which would generate cash and reduce debt. northgate plc annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 april 2017 review 33 strategic report 32 25361.02 13-6-17 proof four

policy and good leaver status, bob must exercise his deferred bonus shares within six months of leaving the business. his epsp awards will remain subject to performance, vest pro-rata and on the original dates. upon review of the fy2016 bonus paid to bob contreras in july 2016 an error was identified. the eps target is set at a level to encourage progressive and sustainable growth of earnings

challenging performance conditions measured over three years. awards will vest, subject to performance, on the third anniversary of grant and will be subject to an additional two year holding period post vesting, during which time awarded shares may not be sold (other than for tax). the company may also make awards of free shares to all employees including executive directors, on an equal basis. awards under the epsp will be based on performance against one or more financial measures. in accordance with best practice it is proposed that the executive directors are required to hold any awards under epsp for two years following vesting. in addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue, if relevant. in line with best practice it is proposed that equal notice periods will apply to the executive directors and the company and that these will normally be six months, although in exceptional circumstances a notice period may be agreed of up to a maximum of 12 months. an executive director’s service contract may be terminated without notice and without any further payment or compensation, except for sums accrued up to the date of termination, on the occurrence of certain events such as gross misconduct. termination payment base salary plus benefits (including pension), subject to mitigation and paid on a phased basis for

degree to which fair value is observable: | level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; | level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly (i.e. prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and | level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data
