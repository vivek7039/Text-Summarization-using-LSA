with the appropriate regulatory requirements regarding margin calculations, capital and default rules. non-clearing foreign exchange (fx) risk is monitored closely and translation risk is managed by matching the currency of the group’s debt to its earnings to protect key ratios and partially hedge currency net assets. the group risk function assesses its dependencies on critical suppliers and

2014 long term incentive plan has one element applicable to executive directors, a conditional award of performance shares. details of the committee’s remit and activities are set out in this directors’ remuneration report. none of these individuals nor the chairman participated in any discussion relating to their own remuneration. separately, other parts of deloitte llp also advised the company during 201 7 in relation to tax, internal audit, consulting and transaction support services. all employees are provided with information on matters of concern to them in their work, through regular briefing meetings and internal publications. we are taking such factors into account in developing products and services that support these aims through companies listed on our markets. impacts on the performance of core revenue streams and segments are modelled through business inputs, with appropriate mitigating factors also considered. examples included customer retention rates within specific business lines and the current returns made on intellectual property. we concluded that the carrying value of goodwill and purchased intangible assets is materially correct as at 31 december 2017. we performed full scope audit procedures over this risk area in 5 components, which covered 99.8% of the risk amount. we have determined this to be a key audit matter having identified 3 revenue streams with heightened risk of misstatement: – secondary capital markets revenue (for certain business lines) involves multiple pricing structures based on product types, customer activity and volumes. – information services revenue accruals can require estimation, for instance based on prior billings or preliminary usage. we adopted a substantive audit approach in relation to the information services revenue accruals process. we also performed cut-off testing to gain assurance that revenue was recognised in the correct period. we agreed a random selection of transactions back to supporting audit evidence, such as invoices and cash receipts. we also used analytical tools to identify outliers in high volumes of transactional data for focused follow-up testing. management engaged a third-party firm to perform the intangible assets fair value calculations and associated purchase price allocation. in the current year, the performance materiality allocated to components was as follows: component allocated performance materiality london stock exchange group plc £2.8m london stock exchange plc £7.7m lch limited £6.3m lch s.a. £4.2m london stock exchange group holdings italy s.p.a. £7.0m lseg us holdco, inc. £5.6m ftse international limited £6.3m all specific scope components £2.8m reporting threshold an amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be clearly trivial. – based on this understanding, we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identified in the paragraphs above. cash flows arising on available for sale financial assets are now presented within investment in government bonds. additionally, the group consolidated financial statements have changed its reporting from 1 decimal place to whole numbers. actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, changes in actuarial assumptions or differences between actual and expected returns on assets are recognised at each period end net of tax in the statement of comprehensive income. deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that they will be recoverable against future taxable profits. d. other financial assets at fair value these represent bond securities in which the ccps invest to hold their significant asset balances securely. they are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. a corresponding deduction or debit is recognised in the employee share scheme reserves within retained earnings. the group’s financial risk management approach is not speculative and adopts a ‘3 lines of defence’ model. we believe that capital held by group companies is sufficient to comfortably support current regulatory frameworks. revised regulations require ccps to ensure that appropriate levels of back up liquidity are in place to underpin the dynamics of a largely secured cash investment requirement, ensuring that the maximum potential outflow under extreme market conditions is covered (see credit and concentration risk section above). the group’s ccps monitor their liquidity needs daily under normal and stressed market conditions. in addition, certain group companies, including the ccps, maintain operational facilities with commercial banks to manage intraday and overnight liquidity. a proportion of the group’s debt is held in or swapped into euro and us dollars. as at 31 december 2017, the group’s designated hedges of its net investments were fully effective. where appropriate, hedge accounting for derivatives is considered in order to mitigate material levels of income statement volatility. the impact on post tax profit and equity for the years ended 31 december is set out in the table below: 2017 2016 post tax profit £m equity

been charged on these assets and instead they are tested for impairment annually. the recoverable amounts of these cgus have been determined based on value in use calculations using discounted cash flow forecasts based on business plans prepared by management for a 3 year period ending 31 december 2020, and then projected for a further 2 years to 31 december 2022. cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using the estimated long term growth rates and applying the pre-tax discount rates referred to below. these factors are considered in conjunction with the group’s long-term strategic objectives to determine appropriate short and medium growth assumptions. pension scheme obligations and costs are determined by an independent qualified actuary on a regular basis using the projected
