out in accordance with the greenhouse gas protocol corporate accounting and reporting standard. our annual charity day raises money for charities worldwide, and we also support employees wishing to volunteer. we know that client experience is ultimately the most important driver of our brand reputation and strength. we have a code of ethics and business conduct policy which is approved by the board. regional health and safety committees ensure there is an effective structure for delivering compliance with the policy. it is the responsibility of managers to provide a healthy and safe working environment for employees. we prefer to work with small organisations where our contribution will make a big difference. the board’s risk appetite provides for nex to materially operate at all times in accordance with its legal, regulatory and contractual obligations. this is a particularly significant risk for nex markets’ trading platforms, which have established well-regarded levels of liquidity that encourage continued use, but could face difficulty replicating those same levels of liquidity if clients were to make a significant and sustained switch to alternative venues. with uk-based regulated platforms that have relied on eu passporting (notably brokertec europe), the group will have to respond to changes in licensing requirements as well as decisions by its clients, all of which may entail added cost and operating complexity. nex’s current core cost base is expected to increase in line with inflation over the medium term. as a result, nex has identified cost savings of approximately £25 million to be delivered by 2019/20. during the year nex acquired enso and abide financial in which it already had minority stakes. fx forwards and swaps volumes continue to grow and attract additional participants, with more than 20 new liquidity consumers added since november 2016. this allows access to a significant part of the fx market in which ebs has never previously participated. cfets contract in june 2016, nex announced that cfets, china’s official interbank market trading platform and infrastructure provider, had chosen nex markets to deliver the underlying technology for fixed income and fx electronic execution services in mainland china. despite the ongoing headwinds from a low interest rate environment, ebs market continues to innovate. this faster data feed is available only to market participants that meet certain trading criteria. the slower data feeds at 100ms and 20ms have been competitively repriced to attract new client interest. in june 2016, it announced that barclays and ubs had gone live on its harmony ccp connect for equities platform. ranging from pre-execution credit checking to multilateral portfolio compression, nex optimisation’s purpose is to simplify its clients’ workflow and help them optimise their resources by mitigating risk, increasing efficiency, reducing costs and streamlining increasingly complex processes. during the year nex optimisation acquired enso financial analytics, a treasury and portfolio finance solution business for the hedge fund industry, with over $1 trillion in assets under advisory, and abide financial, which provides solutions for market participants to meet their regulatory reporting obligations. in addition, a change to direct client billing increased both revenue and the related operating expenses. enso provides a complete view of an individual hedge fund’s relationships across multiple counterparties, delivering insights on counterparty credit risk, collateral management, portfolio financing and treasury. based on current investment plans, enso is expected to achieve run rate break even profitability within the next 18 months. abide financial is expected to achieve run rate break even profitability within the next 18 months. over the medium term free cash flow is expected to be 80-90% of post tax trading profit. there were also £48 million of exceptional items paid during the year in connection with transaction-related expenses. dear shareholders, it is with great pleasure that i am introducing the first corporate governance statement and

icap plc presented the following policy to shareholders at the annual general meeting in july 2015 when it was approved by binding vote. benefits are generally set taking into account affordability and local market practice for comparable roles. the committee may apply malus or clawback to annual bonus awards in certain exceptional circumstances. in future, the committee may decide that it is appropriate to introduce additional measures such as nex group’s key long-term strategic objectives. in any case, at least 80% of the award will continue to be based on financial and share price-based measures. executive directors are required to build up over time, and thereafter maintain, a holding in the company’s shares. termination payment contractual entitlement would be limited to salary and benefits (including pension) over the notice period. he is entitled to receive salary and benefits for the duration of his notice period. he is entitled to receive salary and benefits for the duration of his notice period. availability of documentation directors’ service contracts are available for inspection at the company’s registered office. a significant element of pay, however, is performance-linked, ensuring that all nex’s employees are focused on delivering strong financial results and achieving our strategic goals. consideration of shareholder views the committee is committed to ongoing dialogue with shareholders and seeks the view of its largest shareholders when any major changes are being made to remuneration policy and arrangements for executive directors. the target set was to achieve a 7 .5% increase in prior year total revenue from new products. executive directors are required to defer at least 50% of bonus payments into nex group plc shares vesting after three years. statement of directors’ shareholding and share interests minimum shareholding guidelines for executive directors have been in place since 2012. these shareholdings will be built up over time and, for these purposes, will include vested share awards under long term incentive plans but will not include any unvested rights to shares awarded under long term incentive plans or any unexercised options. any vested shares subject to a holding period under the psp will count towards shareholding guidelines. the group chief financial officer was appointed in september 2015 and has five years from appointment to reach his target. further detail will be provided in next year’s annual report (within commercial constraints) with context on performance against those targets and the resulting bonus. once they have vested, awards will be subject to an additional holding period of at least two years. it did, however, make a commitment to retrospectively disclose the financial targets in this annual report provided they were no longer considered sensitive. we then performed testing over these amounts to ensure that they should be recognised as revenue. we also tested the timing of revenue recognition, assessing whether the necessary contractual obligations had been fulfilled by taking a sample of revenue transactions and agreeing them back to contracts and did not find any exceptions. christopher rowland (senior statutory auditor) for and on behalf of pricewaterhousecoopers llp chartered accountants and statutory auditors london 15 may 2017 independent
