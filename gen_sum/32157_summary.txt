provides for nex to materially operate at all times in accordance with its legal, regulatory and contractual obligations. this is a particularly significant risk for nex markets’ trading platforms, which have established well-regarded levels of liquidity that encourage continued use, but could face difficulty replicating those same levels of liquidity if clients were to make a significant and sustained switch to alternative venues. nex’s current core cost base is expected to increase in line with inflation over the medium term. in june 2016, it announced that barclays and ubs had gone live
