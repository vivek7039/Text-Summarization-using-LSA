One recent example is Axoni which serves the world’s largest financial institutions and capital markets service providers with full stack blockchain solutions. – We are extending the number of senior employees who will receive part of their compensation in shares rather than cash, and ensuring that the Company Sharesave scheme is made available to as wide an employee base as possible across all Group businesses. – The client base for our portfolio reconciliation and counterparty exposure management service has increased to more than 1,900 (2015/16: 1,680) with 476,000 party-to-party reconciliations in 2017 (2015/16: 384,000). – We are redesigning the reward framework to drive strong corporate behaviours, encourage team dynamics and widen share ownership. – We will enhance our solutions that enable clients to manage their margin and collateral calculations against ever increasing market complexity. What we’ve achieved – NEX Markets is working with CFETS, China’s official interbank market trading platform, to deliver the underlying technology for fixed income and FX electronic execution services in mainland China in a three-year deal worth around $65 million to NEX. – We will enable regional banks to create unique sources of liquidity in their local markets and currencies. Performance The decrease in operating margin reflects ongoing investment for growth, impact of hedging losses and certain one-off costs. Performance The decrease in operating margin reflects ongoing investment for growth, impact of hedging losses and certain one-off costs. Natural Capital Partners’ assessment was carried out in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. Our annual Charity Day raises money for charities worldwide, and we also support employees wishing to volunteer. We know that client experience is ultimately the most important driver of our brand reputation and strength. Regional health and safety committees ensure there is an effective structure for delivering compliance with the policy. The board’s risk appetite provides for NEX to materially operate at all times in accordance with its legal, regulatory and contractual obligations. This is a particularly significant risk for NEX Markets’ trading platforms, which have established well-regarded levels of liquidity that encourage continued use, but could face difficulty replicating those same levels of liquidity if clients were to make a significant and sustained switch to alternative venues. NEX’s current core cost base is expected to increase in line with inflation over the medium term. This allows access to a significant part of the FX market in which EBS has never previously participated. In June 2016, it announced that Barclays and UBS had gone live on its Harmony CCP Connect for Equities platform. During the year NEX Optimisation acquired ENSO Financial Analytics, a treasury and portfolio finance solution business for the hedge fund industry, with over $1 trillion in assets under advisory, and Abide Financial, which provides solutions for market participants to meet their regulatory reporting obligations. ENSO provides a complete view of an individual hedge fund’s relationships across multiple counterparties, delivering insights on counterparty credit risk, collateral management, portfolio financing and treasury. Based on current investment plans, ENSO is expected to achieve run rate break even profitability within the next 18 months. Dear shareholders, It is with great pleasure that I am introducing the first corporate governance statement and directors’ report as Chairman of NEX. All board appointments will continue to be made on merit with due regard for the benefits of diversity. Charles Gregson, Michael Spencer and Stuart Bridges were appointed directors of NEX Group plc on its incorporation in February 2016. John Sievwright, Ivan Ritossa and Robert Standing were appointed to the board of NEX Group plc on 15 December 2016.

It also ensures that a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure exists for the appointment of new directors. Any proposed non-audit assignments with fees in excess of £100,000 are subject to the Audit Committee’s prior approval. Its portfolio includes a number of emerging fintech firms bringing new technologies and business models into capital markets. He was previously responsible for developing ICAP’s global broking strategy, focusing on growing revenue, improving the application of technology to its business model and expanding client coverage. He joined ICAP as a graduate trainee and has worked in the Group for more than 20 years. Prior to this, Ken was a managing director at JPMorgan in the Investment Bank focused on e-commerce activities. From 1991 to 2001 he held several roles at Goldman Sachs in emerging markets trading, portfolio structuring and e-commerce. The Group’s viability assessment has been made over a period of three financial years up to 31 March 2020. Robert Standing Chairman, Remuneration Committee 15 May 2017 57 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 Governance and directors’ report DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY ICAP plc presented the following policy to shareholders at the annual general meeting in July 2015 when it was approved by binding vote. In future, the committee may decide that it is appropriate to introduce additional measures such as NEX Group’s key long-term strategic objectives. In any case, at least 80% of the award will continue to be based on financial and share price-based measures. Executive directors are required to build up over time, and thereafter maintain, a holding in the Company’s shares. Termination payment Contractual entitlement would be limited to salary and benefits (including pension) over the notice period. A significant element of pay, however, is performance-linked, ensuring that all NEX’s employees are focused on delivering strong financial results and achieving our strategic goals. Executive directors are required to defer at least 50% of bonus payments into NEX Group plc shares vesting after three years. The Group Chief Financial Officer was appointed in September 2015 and has five years from appointment to reach his target. Details of Michael Spencer’s shareholding, including his connected parties, are set out in a note to the substantial shareholders’ section on page 53. Further detail will be provided in next year’s Annual Report (within commercial constraints) with context on performance against those targets and the resulting bonus. Once they have vested, awards will be subject to an additional holding period of at least two years. It did, however, make a commitment to retrospectively disclose the financial targets in this Annual Report provided they were no longer considered sensitive.
