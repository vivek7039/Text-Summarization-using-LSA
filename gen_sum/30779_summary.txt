I believe that we are seeing the benefit of our focus on operational  excellence, technology investment and disciplined acquisition in   these results. We have moved deliberately away from a business model where our  prosperity was significantly determined by the instabilities of UK rail. Our Spanish long haul services which have RMS installed also saw  revenue increase by 3.9% and seat occupancy rates up over   two percent. Our UK bus business achieved a record- equalling customer satisfaction score of 87% in the independent  Transport Focus survey (also up 1% year-on-year). One area where we have  shown particular leadership is through the installation and use   of smart safety cameras on our vehicles. We have also – uniquely within the industry – installed an online  complaints management system in all of our school bus depots. We are developing Geneva as an emerging  growth ‘hub’ with expansion into local school bus and discretionary  transport alongside the growing transfer business; AlpyBus itself   grew significantly in 2017. We made three acquisitions in North America during 2017,   adding over 800 vehicles across the school bus, paratransit,   transit and special education sectors. Across the Group, our  best markets are often those where we successfully combine service  excellence, competitive pricing and strong relationships. I am   ably supported by a strong, dynamic  management team that operates   National Express’ many businesses   with relentless focus and efficiency. I am ably  supported by a strong, dynamic management team that operates  National Express’ many businesses with relentless focus and  efficiency. The 2017 results therefore include an element of  catch up from prior years that we were not able to recognise before  this year. We continue to deliver  strong performances from our acquisitions, delivering returns on  invested capital of at least 15% in the first full year after acquisition. – 176 concessions: 125 intercity coach concessions, 35 urban  bus contracts, 16 others   – Concessional renewal process restarting  – New contract wins in Spain  – Revenue management generating passenger and revenue  growth in Spain  – Continuing urbanisation of the Moroccan economy with rapid  migration to the major cities  – Building scale and services in Switzerland  – Further bolt-on acquisition opportunities  Market size  €3.9bn Concessions 176 Francisco Iglesias  Chief Executive, ALSA Year ended 31 December 2017 m 2016 m Revenue £663.5 £597.3 Normalised operating profit £94.9 £84.7 Revenue €757.4 €731.2 Normalised operating profit €108.3 €103.7 Normalised operating margin 14.3% 14.2% ALSA has delivered another strong performance, growing normalised  operating profit to €108.3 million (up 4.4% in constant currency),  increasing its margin and carrying more passengers (313.8 million,   up 2.1%) while at the same time improving its customer satisfaction  score (up 4.8% year-on-year). However, we anticipate the renewal process will  resume shortly, with some smaller contracts due for re-bid first and   a larger contract delayed at least until later this year. €m 2016 normalised operating profit 104 Growth 9 Acquisitions 2 Other cost inflation (13) Cost efficiencies 6 2017 normalised operating profit 108 Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 24 Business review: ALSA Operational excellence Already widely recognised as the industry leader, ALSA consolidated  its reputation with a number of important awards to complement its  record customer satisfaction score. Just over a third of the market is outsourced with recent  increases in outsource conversion being driven by pressure on  public funding. Ecolane is also increasingly becoming a key credential in our other  North American bids and we are exploring its broader application  across the Group. We estimate there to be at least a $1.5 billion  annualised market available and National Express only captured  around 3% of it in 2017. They have been profitable from their first full year of operation  and we believe will continue to deliver typical rail margins in   the future. These reviews  have resulted in the introduction of new Group-wide standard operating  excellence procedures and also generated savings for each business’  2018 budget.

National Express Group PLC is a public limited  company incorporated in England and Wales whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange. Except for goodwill impairments, a review is made at each reporting date of any previous impairment losses to assess whether they no longer  exist or may have decreased. Future depreciation or amortisation is then adjusted   to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount over its remaining useful economic life. For hedge accounting we have assessed IFRS 9 and do not expect a material impact on the Group’s financial statements, other than certain disclosure  points as referred to below. 9 Net finance costs    Share options without   nil exercise price  Share options with   nil exercise price   2017  2016  2017 2016   Risk free interest rate 0.44% 0.84% 0.11% 0.37%  Expected volatility  25% 26.0% 22.0% 22.0%  Peer group volatility  – – 28.0%-29.0% 23.0%-25.0%  Expected option life in years  5 years 5 years 3 years 3 years  Expected dividend yield  3.42% 3.42% 0.0% 0.0%  Weighted average share price at grant date 359p 332p 359p 347p  Weighted average exercise price at grant date 364p 329p nil nil  Weighted average fair value of options at grant date 49p 52p 291p 312p    2017   £m  2016  £m  Bond and bank interest payable  (38.0) (50.3)  Finance lease interest payable  (3.9) (3.5)  Other interest payable  (2.7) (1.5)  Unwind of provision discounting  (1.3) (1.2)  Net interest cost on defined benefit pension obligations (2.1) (1.0)  Finance costs  (48.0) (57.5)  Other financial income 10.0 7.5  Net finance costs  (38.0) (50.0)  Of which, from financial instruments:    Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost  (40.7) (51.1)  Derivatives 9.3 7.5  Loan fee amortisation  (1.2) (2.7)  Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2017 Financial Statements 135 136  Notes to the Consolidated Accounts continued  For the year ended 31 December 2017    10 Taxation  (a) Analysis of taxation charge in the year  The tax credit on separately disclosed items of £20.0m comprises an £11.4m tax credit on intangibles, a £7.5m net credit in relation to the US tax  rate reduction (see note 10(c)) and a tax credit of £1.1m for other items.
