shareholder information strategic report 21 strategic report our strategy what drives our success continual research creating strong market positions with innovative products strong market presence and focus on emerging markets global customer support focus on delivering solutions efficient, high-quality manufacturing consistent organic growth supplementing the business via niche acquisitions 8 2 3 4 5 6 7 renishaw fundamentally believes that success comes from patented and innovative products and processes, high-quality manufacturing, and the ability to provide local customer support in all its markets around the globe. we have also made a number of acquisitions over the last five years which expand our product range and will support revenue growth by using the group’s worldwide marketing and distribution infrastructure to expand these businesses. note 24, alternative performance measures, defines how adjusted earnings per share is calculated and why the board has adopted this measure. dividend per share pence in a manufacturing environment, it is crucial that we maintain high standards of health and safety. by having “local” global support through our wholly-owned subsidiary network, we are able to assure customers that whatever their needs, we are able to support and assist them, resulting in a positive return on their investment. it is through this approach that renishaw has been able to deliver such a long-term track record of profitable growth. we are also strengthening our acquisitions process and have considered various potential opportunities during the year. today, most machine tools are equipped with a networking capability and have more accessible software architectures, making it simpler to facilitate communication between systems. traditionally, hydraulic block manifolds are manufactured from an aluminium alloy or stainless steel billet which has been cut and machined to size. whilst the actual parts produced by renishaw for r1 remain highly confidential, the manifolds designed in cad software by land rover bar were sent to renishaw, where they were prepared for production using its quantam software. race to innovate: digital position feedback as mentioned earlier, the control surfaces on r1 are all driven by hydraulic actuators. governance financial statements shareholder information strategic report 29 our products have often been unique and disruptive, offering new ways of solving our customers’ problems, so it has been important to work closely with them to educate and train their engineers. there are also the simple practicalities of having renishaw people easily accessible to provide fast engineering support and answer queries. this is driving the need for more skilled applications engineers and a greater investment to upskill our employees. d tata motors visited the additive manufacturing solutions centre at renishaw’s facility in pune, india. investment has continued in the improvement of key manufacturing processes associated with increased volumes and developing capability for specific product lines such as am. another example is the in-house development of automation systems for assembly of certain products in the uk and ireland facilities, where automation and closed- loop controls have delivered significant reductions in process variation, hence providing enhanced product quality, as well as reducing our costs. in addition, outline planning permission exists for further development and capacity to be provided at that facility. governance financial statements shareholder information strategic report 33 strategic report our strategy in action – continual research creating strong market positions with innovative products atom™ – miniaturising innovation in the encoder business modern high-volume production processes, such as semiconductor manufacturing, demand production-line machines with ever smaller footprints to maximise productivity while also continually improving accuracy and throughput. atom is the only miniature encoder to use renishaw’s unique optics engine with patented filtering technology, which imparts several advantages when compared with other types of miniature encoder, including better dirt immunity, lower cyclic error (improved accuracy) and higher resolution. all parts must first be correctly orientated by means of bowl- feeders and shaped feed-chutes. the readheads are connected, via an analogue filter and analogue-to- digital converter (adc), to revo-2’s electronics. richard toller, technical manager for renishaw’s cmm products division, explains: “the atom encoder provides a level of plug-and-play convenience that simply didn’t exist before. the new building at west dundee, illinois, is much better aligned to our ‘solutions provider’ strategy with excellent customer demonstration and training facilities. a small office has also been established in california to support customers within the electronics sector. d renishaw products, such as the sprint scanning system, are meeting market needs for ever-tighter production tolerances. in mexico, work is nearing completion of a new building that will provide expansion space for sales and marketing operations. we received a highly commended award for the benefits package offered to graduates, rated second behind winner volkswagen uk. we have a planned intake of 45 graduates and 48 apprentices this summer, whilst our in-house academy delivered 3,050 training days (2016: 6,500), with the reduction primarily due to changes to our graduate induction and apprenticeship programmes, which meant that less time was spent with the academy in favour of more ‘on-the job’ training. market conditions as reported last year, we were already seeing a favourable environment for our position encoders line due to new investments in led manufacture and the semiconductor sector. as well as strong trade in the far east electronics sector, on a global basis we are continuing to see ongoing investment in production systems and processes, including automation, aided by an increasing awareness of the benefits to be gained by adopting industry 4.0 and smart factory philosophies (see pages 26–27). renishaw is working with catec and other organisations in a spanish government funded project called futuralve. many of our lines are benefiting from global skills shortages in the engineering sector, requiring increased investments in automation to offset the need for highly-skilled machine operators and demanding user-interfaces and software that are easier to operate. the use of collaborative robots (‘cobots’) is increasing, working closely with people to help finish production tasks through simple, fast programming or even self-learning processes. growth is seen as being due to the rise in middle-income travellers in developing markets such as china and india, and boeing believes that over this period, asia will need more than 16,000 new aircraft (39% of global demand). we continue to position renishaw as a ‘solutions provider’ and reduce the risks of over-reliance on large customers who integrate our products. we will launch a large number of new products at the emo hannover exhibition in september 2017. we have introduced at trade exhibitions a new machining cell concept with integrated process control which demonstrates how complementary technologies from renishaw, including gauging and machine tool probing, can contribute to high levels of productivity and manufacturing capability. these trends should all result in increased demand for our metrology products to help drive efficiencies, reduce waste, increase automation and aid product measurement traceability. the majority of key components on high-end agricultural equipment are subject to process control using renishaw products. there was also a good year of sales for additively manufactured metal dental structures created from cobalt chrome powder using renishaw am machines. in china, the guangdong medical university is developing a method for non-invasive prostate cancer screening (see page 21). likewise, the growing life science market is showing renewed performance there was growth from all our healthcare product lines (spectroscopy, neurological and medical dental). in addition, it allows us to plan trajectories previously impossible with a standard frame, making surgery safer and more accurate.” the medical dental products line experienced good growth from focusing on the sale of renishaw am machines configured for medical and dental applications. the medical dental products line has seen good progress in the supply of additively manufactured laserimplants™, which are craniomaxillofacial patient-specific implants (psis) and associated cutting guides that support reconstructive surgery, typically resulting from head or neck trauma, birth defects or cancer treatment. during the year a collaboration was announced with pdr, the international centre for design and research, based in cardiff, wales, which seeks to pioneer new design methods that will bring engineering levels of precision to complex surgical procedures. d complex reconstructive facial surgery is using renishaw additive manufacturing systems to produce replacement jaw sections and teeth. renishaw plc

will significantly advance our customers’ operational performance by maximising research capabilities, reducing process times and improving the efficacy of medical procedures. cdnf aims to relieve the symptoms of parkinson’s disease by protecting and regenerating dopamine producing neurons. the new centrus ccd detector was also introduced for high-speed raman analysis; giving outstanding performance, even at speeds of over 1,800 spectra per second, it dramatically reduces measurement times and is available on invia microscopes and the ra802 pharmaceutical analyser. outlook increased life expectancy on a global basis means greater incidences of degenerative neurological diseases, which will require surgical therapies. in developing markets, levels of wealth are increasing at a national and individual level, which is driving demand for higher-quality medical treatments, often requiring more technologically advanced products. the market for raman spectroscopy continues to

continuing to develop relationships with key universities that have been identified as having relevant courses for our business needs. the task of developing more engineers is not something that we can do alone and therefore we continue to work with leading industry organisations and engineering peers to advise government on national policy that will benefit the sector. influencers such as teachers and parents are key groups that we focus on to change perceptions. this will encourage more young people to take up apprenticeships, jobs or further education career pathways in high- value engineering. in the usa, we are also developing a new programme that creates partnerships with educational establishments such as technical colleges and universities. a pilot partnership with greenville technical college center for manufacturing innovation, south carolina, is up and running covering a variety of our product lines with two renishaw staff based at the facility to support the

profit before tax disclosure has been adopted to provide stakeholders with a better measure of underlying performance. the contract for external audit will be put out to tender at least every ten years. this year we are seeking approval of a new remuneration policy that is designed to operate over the next three years. stretching performance targets are therefore at the heart of our remuneration approach for executive directors and leaders supporting them. target setting takes place in a strategic context, and seeks to reflect our expectation that renishaw will continue to grow substantially over the long term, but also takes into account the opportunities and challenges that can affect businesses with short order books. historically, feedback from proxy advisors and some institutional shareholders has questioned the absence of a long term incentive for our executives. renishaw is a long-term business, and its leadership has invested significantly in r&d over many decades. executive director salaries are benchmarked against equivalent positions for relevant industrial sectors based on factors such as sector, size and location. any use of this discretion would be accompanied by a full rationale in the relevant annual remuneration report. 50% of any net vested share awards (after sales to meet tax liabilities) must be retained until the minimum shareholding guideline is met. the non-executive directors are appointed for an initial three-year period subject to annual performance review and re-election at agms, unless terminated earlier by either party on
