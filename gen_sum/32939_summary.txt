Best known for its financial services industry, the Island has successfully diversified across sectors including e-business, e-gaming and high-tech manufacturing. As such, the Isle of Man is a growing, affluent, low tax economy keen to embrace new technology. This strategy was supplemented in 2016 by the creation of Vannin Ventures, a 100%-owned business incubator targeting new innovative technologies and opportunities. This supports our progressive dividend policy, which has been maintained since admission at an annual increase of c.5%. 5 4 08 manx telecom plc annual report and accounts 2017 In this section, we illustrate some of our highlights and announcements over 2017. year in review Milestones 31 March Flagship Manx Telecom Parish Walk sponsorship extended to 2020 We were delighted to extend our sponsorship of the Island’s leading mass participation sporting event to 2020, with the Parish Walk being heralded by CEO Gary Lamb as “a shining example of the Island’s tremendous community spirit and enthusiasm for sport”. potential speeds after fibre investment 1Gbps 1 August Another first; inclusive UK and EU roaming for mobile customers We were the first Isle of Man operator to offer our pay monthly customers inclusive roaming within the UK and EU.

Our core domestic business performance in Fixed Line, Broadband, Data and Mobile remained solid during the year. These price reductions were supported by improved cost control and have proved popular with our customer base. In August 2016, we launched Vannin Ventures, a standalone business established to support the Company’s long-term growth strategy. Indeed, wholesale roaming rates made it especially challenging to deliver the value we knew our customers craved, alongside an acceptable margin. Headcount was reduced in Q1 2017 by nearly 15% following a carefully considered voluntary redundancy programme that will deliver net cost savings from 2018 onwards. Our ageing vehicle fleet was refreshed, changing from an outright ownership model to a new leased agreement, also delivering more fuel-efficiency and fewer environmental emissions. Working spaces have also been re-designed to be more modern, open and productive – the first being completed in December 2017 for our Customer Experience Team. Most importantly, we have defined new target operating models for key functions that define a Manx Telecom that is more agile, creative and effective in its ability to rapidly take advantage of market opportunities and deliver a superior customer experience. In the UK alone, nine million people experience varying degrees of hearing loss, affecting their ability to use voice services on mobile phones. As a hearing impaired person myself, I am passionate about the benefits this technology can bring. Global Solutions performed well, with full year revenue of £16.5m (2016: £15.6m), a 6.2% increase year-on-year, driven by continuous growth in our Strongest Signal Mobile solution (branded Chameleon), M2M, and international traveller propositions. Energy costs were down 9% during 2017 due to a full year of customer consolidation in our Data Centre business. This charge does not form part of the underlying results and has no impact on cash. The Group’s definition of these terms may not be comparable with similarly titled performance measures and disclosures by other entities. Such non-GAAP measures should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent GAAP measure. In particular, a number of cloud based technologies have been implemented during the year, each with their own security arrangements. We provide the regulator with annual separated accounts based on a bottom-up cost model that was developed with the assistance of an independent consultant and ensures that they have a proper assessment of our portfolio pricing and margins. Legislative Change Stable Current corporate tax arrangements make the Isle of Man an attractive economy in which to invest and do business.

As in prior years, bonuses were eligible to be earned based on performance against challenging Underlying EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and revenue growth targets. Awards are released subject to continued employment and satisfaction of challenging performance conditions measured over three years. As a result, the metrics and weightings we are to operate in relation to the 2018 annual bonus for Executive Directors are as follows: Metric Weighting Underlying EBITDA 20% Underlying Cash Flow 20% Revenue 20% Customer Experience 20% People Engagement 20% In all cases a threshold level of financial performance (based on predetermined levels of EBITDA and cash flow) must be achieved before bonuses are eligible to become payable. The Customer and People targets are based on our Net Promoter scores (which include data collated externally). However, it is our intention that details of the target ranges, and achievement against them, will be set out in next year’s report. Processing error: Manx Telecom has multiple systems which are used to collect usage data and record revenue. Fair value Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Depreciation is provided on property, plant and equipment from the date they are brought into use, in equal instalments over their estimated useful lives. Any such write-down is charged to operating profit as an impairment loss and separately disclosed if material. They are stated at the lower of cost, including appropriate overheads, and estimated net realisable value. A defined benefit scheme is a pension scheme that sets the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity. The arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on its relative fair value. Their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements. As a result of this ongoing work, it is possible that there may be some changes to the anticipated impact summarised below. IFRS 16 distinguishes leases and service contracts on the basis of whether an identified asset is controlled by a customer. As at 31 December 2017, the Group’s future minimum lease payments under non- cancellable operating leases amounted to £3,146,000 (2016: £3,247,000) on an undiscounted basis (see note 19). Some of the Group’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value for financial reporting purposes. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities. Other includes kit sales, directory revenues, managed service rental charges and revenue from the provision of telecommunications software. These balances are due from large international operators and therefore related recoverability risk is considered to be low. Transaction costs of £1,475,000 were capitalised in 2014 and will be amortised over the loan period (as amended from 30 June 2015). On 1 December 2017, 43,301 new ordinary shares were issued and transferred to the Manx Telecom plc Share Incentive Plan Trust for nil consideration. 93 manx telecom plc annual report and accounts 2017 overview strategic report governance report financial statements other 17 Capital – Company continued Gearing ratio The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows: 2017 £’000 2016 £’000 Secured bank loans (69,288) (68,983) Cash and cash equivalents 12,341 16,674 Net debt (56,947) (52,309) Equity 84,892 82,957 Net debt to equity ratio 0.67 0.63 Debt is defined as long and short-term borrowings (excluding derivatives) as detailed in note 13.
