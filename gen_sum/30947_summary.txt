thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. ifrs requires companies to test their non-current assets, by cash-generating unit (cgu) or relevant group of cgus, for impairment whenever an indicator exists. additionally, ifrs requires testing the cgus for impairment reversal at the end of each reporting period by assessing whether there is any indicator that an impairment loss recognised in prior periods (for an asset other than goodwill) may no longer exist, or may have decreased. t aken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. – based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identified in the paragraphs above. mirco bardella senior statutory

report & accounts 2017 hochschild mining plc 97 strategic report governance financial statements further information 1 corporate information hochschild mining plc (hereinafter ‘the company’) is a public limited company incorporated on 11 april 2006 under the companies act 1985 as a limited company and registered in england and wales with registered number 05777693. the company’s registered office is located at 17 cavendish square, london w1g 0ph, united kingdom. these are based on the group’s current interpretation of ifrs 15 and may be subject to changes as interpretations evolve more generally. the group estimates that approximately us$4,800,000 would be reclassified from selling expenses to cost of sales, based on 2017 figures. – available-for sale financial assets: the equity instruments that are currently classified as available-for-sale financial assets satisfy the conditions for classification as at fair value through other comprehensive income (fvoci) and therefore there is no impact in classification. each item’s life, which is assessed annually, has regard to both its physical life limitations and to present assessments of economically recoverable reserves and resources of the mine property at which the asset is located. assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available. key sources of estimation for all assets include uncertainty around ore reserve estimates and cash flow projections. provisions are also made for uncertain exposures which can have an impact on both deferred and current tax. t ax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained and tax provisions are made if it is probable that a liability will arise (refer to note 34(a)). non-controlling interests’ rights to safeguard their interest are fully considered in assessing whether the group controls a subsidiary. contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised if the acquisition date fair value can be measured reliably. subsidiary financial statements expressed in their corresponding functional currencies are translated into us dollars by applying the exchange rate at period-end for assets and liabilities and the transaction date exchange rate for income statement items. for borrowings associated with a specific asset, the actual rate on that borrowing is used. all other expenditure including repairs and maintenance expenditures are recognised in the income statement as incurred. annual report & accounts 2017 hochschild mining plc 103 strategic report governance financial statements further information 2 significant accounting policies continued (f) evaluation and exploration assets evaluation and exploration expenses are capitalised when the future economic benefit of the project can reasonably be regarded as assured. such review is undertaken on an asset by asset basis, except where such assets do not generate cash flows independent of other assets, and then the review is undertaken at the cash-generating unit level. the provision is reviewed on an annual basis for changes in cost estimates, discount rates and operating lives. revenue is initially recognised on a provisional basis using the group’s best estimate of contained gold and silver. any subsequent adjustments to the initial estimate of metal content are recorded in revenue once they have been determined. revenue is initially recognised when the conditions set out above have been met, using market prices at that date. the selling price of gold and silver can be measured reliably as these metals are actively traded on international exchanges. this involves a significant amount of judgement as tax legislation can be complex and open to different interpretation. when financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss and borrowings, directly attributable transaction costs. gains or losses on financial assets held for trading are recognised in the income statement. (y) hedging the group used commodity swaps and zero cost collar contracts to hedge certain of its cash flows from product sales against price risk. the fair value of these forward contracts was determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. these forward contracts were classified as cash flow hedges as they were hedging the group’s exposure to variability in cash flows that was attributable to a particular risk associated with a highly probable forecast sales transaction. annual report & accounts 2017 hochschild mining plc 109 strategic report governance financial statements further information 3 segment reporting the group’s activities are principally related to mining operations which involve the exploration, production and sale of gold and silver. the group undertakes a number of activities solely to support mining operations including power generation and services. t ransfer prices between segments are set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to that used for third parties. exploration expenses are generally incurred in the following areas: mapping, sampling, geophysics, identification of local targets and reconnaissance drilling. the expenditure incurred was not part of our mine closure provision and reflects an unexpected, one-off event. 13 finance income and finance costs before exceptional items year ended 31 december 2017 year ended 31 december 2016 before exceptional items us$000 before exceptional items us$000 finance income interest on deposits and liquidity funds 1,696 1,011 interest income 1,696 1,011 gain from changes in the fair value of financial instruments 647 – gain on exchange of available-for-sale financial assets 1,386 – gain on discount of other receivables 1,946 – other 252 89 total 5,927 1,100 finance costs interest on secured bank loans (note 25) (185) (2,602) other interest (813) (1,106) interest on bond (note 25) (24,088) (23,925) interest expense (25,086) (27 ,633) unwind of discount on mine rehabilitation (note 26) (280) (46) loss on discount of other receivables – (2,257) loss on sale of available-for-sale financial assets (32) – other (697) (605) total (26,095) (30,541) annual report & accounts 2017 hochschild mining plc 117 strategic report governance financial statements further information 14 income tax expense year ended 31 december 2017 year ended 31 december 2016 before exceptional items us$000 exceptional items us$000 total us$000 before exceptional items us$000 exceptional items us$000 total us$000 current corporate income tax from continuing operations current corporate income tax charge 15,070 – 15,070 31,701 (1,212) 30,489 current mining royalty charge (note 35) 4,201 – 4,201 3,882 – 3,882 current special mining tax charge (note 35) 2,229 – 2,229 3,869 – 3,869 withholding taxes – – – 552 – 552 21,500 – 21,500 40,004 (1,212) 38,792 deferred taxation origination and reversal of temporary differences from continuing operations (note 28) 2,755 (3,279) (524) 6,364 (961) 5,403 effect of change in tax rate 1 (10,780) – (10,780) 1,273 (51) 1,222 (8,025) (3,279) (11,304) 7,637 (1,012) 6,625 total taxation charge/(credit) in the income statement 13,475 (3,279) 10,196 47,641 (2,224) 45,417 1 on 29 december 2017 , the argentinian government enacted the tax reform. 1 mining properties and development costs related to crespo project (us$26,016,000) are not currently being depreciated. management determined there were triggers of impairment in the arcata mine unit as it has experienced difficulties to replace production with incremental resources and to convert resources into reserves, and there was a significant decrease in production during the year. notes to the consolidated financial statements continued annual report & accounts 2017 hochschild mining plc 122 key assumptions 2017 2016 risk adjusted value per in-situ (gold equivalent ounce) us$ 7.10 6.90 us$000 2017 2016 current carrying value volcan cgu 63,968 63,187 sensitivity analysis other than as disclosed below, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions above would cause the carrying value, to exceed its recoverable amount. the warrants were recognised at fair value on acquisition and presented as other financial assets. 2 as at 31 december 2016 the group held an investment in mariana resources ltd which was acquired by sandstorm gold on 12 july 2017 . no security has been granted or guarantees given by the group in respect of these related party balances.
