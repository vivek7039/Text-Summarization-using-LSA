Operating review  Page 22 1 2 Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Hochschild Mining plc  Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Further information 03 Inmaculada –  expansion potential   at our flagship mine We believe that there is strong  upside resource potential at the  Inmaculada deposit with drilling  results from our first campaign in  six years confirming the geological  hypothesis. Consistently meeting  annual production  targets We have built up an enviable track  record of meeting and often  exceeding our annual production  targets, demonstrating the  Company’s sensible approach to  guidance but also the expertise we  have built in managing our portfolio  of complex underground narrow  vein mines. We believe that there are significant  further opportunities to extend   the lives of our mines and expand  their capacity. These  prospects must satisfy our long  held acquisition criteria of assets  that are early-stage with significant  geological upside potential and  where we can acquire a clear path  to control. 12-15 % Return on invested  capital target for   acquisitions Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Hochschild Mining plc  Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Further information 09 Jewellery  62.7% Electronics  7.6% Oﬃcial sector purchases  7.9% Private investor demand  19.2% Dental and other  2.7% Demand % Mine production  72.6% Secondary supply  23.6% Net exports from transitional economies  3.8% Supply % Market review Gold Market  Summary Hochschild is exposed to market dynamics associated with  the precious metals industry, whilst our operations, located in  Peru and Argentina, are exposed to changing country-specific  factors that can impact our business. Central banks remained net buyers  of gold during 2017 as they  continued to diversify their reserve  assets away from FX. US tax reform helped the  stock market repeatedly hit  record highs in December,  further driving investors away  from precious metals. Effective sustainability  programme Promoting education, health and  sustainable economic development   in acknowledgment of our social   licence to operate. This has resulted in us consistently meeting  annual production targets, executing significant  cost reduction programmes, increasing our  resource base and achieving positive results  from brownfield exploration at existing mines. Communities Hochschild has been able to   invest in a number of local  programmes focusing on our   core themes of education,   health and socio-economic  development and allowing us to  operate collaboratively with our   neighbours in the Southern Peru  Cluster for more than 50 years. $10m Recommended  final dividend  for the full   year 2017 81 % workforce  trained in 2017 $5.6m Amount spent  on social and  community  welfare  activities Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Hochschild Mining plc 13 Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Further information Chairman’s statement Fit for an exciting   future of growth I am delighted with the progress made operationally and geologically   in 2017 as well as with our long-term goal of balance sheet optimisation. Low cost, early-stage acquisition  opportunities will continue to be pursued across  the Americas and, in particular, earn-in joint  ventures where operations can benefit from  Hochschild’s technical expertise. Arcata´s costs are  expected to be higher in line with its resource  base despite the implementation of significant  cost control measures. In addition, we  acquired a package of land from Coeur  Mining situated between our joint venture  and Goldcorp’s Cerro Negro deposit to  the south. realised gold price ($/oz) 1,270 1,215   Commercial discounts Commercial discounts refer to refinery treatment charges, refining fees and  payable deductions for processing concentrate, and are deducted from  gross revenue on a per tonne basis (treatment charge), per ounce basis  (refining fees) or as a percentage of gross revenue (payable deductions). $000   unless otherwise indicated Y ear ended   31 Dec 2017 Y ear ended    31 Dec 2016 % change Profit from continuing operations before  exceptional items, net finance cost,  foreign exchange loss and income tax 92,255 148,188 (38) Depreciation and amortisation in cost  of sales 196,150 180,317 9 Depreciation and amortisation in  administrative expenses 1,564 1,331 18 Exploration expenses 17,199 9,193 87 Personnel and other exploration related  fixed expenses (5,395) (3,947) 37 Other non-cash income 8 (1,023) (6,068) (83) Adjusted EBITDA 300,750 329,014 (9) Adjusted EBITDA margin 42% 48% Finance income  Finance income before exceptional items of $5.9 million increased from  2016 ($1.1 million) primarily due to the impact of a higher net present  value of the Patagonian port rebate ($1.9 million) which was discounted in  2016 but collected in 2017.

Our people  Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Hochschild Mining plc 41 Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Further information Sustainability continued Secondary education  Hochschild has continued to support programmes  that promote personal development and basic  economic/business awareness to equip those in  secondary education for their early adult years. A training  programme is being implemented in 2018 to  ensure that full advantage can be taken of the  equipment provided. Socio-economic development Business networks  This successful programme has seen over 250  agricultural and livestock producers flourish in  their trade. Through this monthly  publication, we try to foster healthy competition  amongst the mining units, an effort called Green  Challenge or ‘Reto Verde’ in Spanish. 2017 budgets across the Group continued to focus on maintaining controlled  levels of administrative expenses and sustaining capital expenditure. Even though currently no part of 2018 production has been hedged, the Group’s  flexible policy enables the Board to approve hedging contracts to protect cash  flow as and when appropriate Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Hochschild Mining plc 45 Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Further information Risk management & viability continued Operational risks continued Risk Impact Mitigation Commentary 5. These include the use of non-financial benefits (e.g. flexible  working arrangements for Head Office staff) and tailored personal  development plans. During 2017,  regular meetings were therefore scheduled and held with union  representatives to understand concerns which continue into the current year. Previously Eileen  served as CFO in various  industries including healthcare  consultancy Press Ganey  Associates, investment bank  Houlihan Lokey and BP Amoco  Americas. In addition, the Directors will be able   to impose limits or conditions when giving any  authorisation, if they think this is appropriate. Succession planning As highlighted in last year’s report, a number  of changes at Board level were anticipated  and so I am delighted that despite having lost  the long-standing support of three  Non-Executive Directors, we were well placed  to ensure continuity at Board level. If you should have any queries arising from  this report, please do not hesitate to contact  me at Chairman@hocplc.com. In between Board meetings, Directors are kept  informed of latest developments through  monthly management reports on the Company’s  operations, exploration activity and financial  situation. The interviews were structured to seek  Directors’ views on a number of subject  areas including those outlined below.

IFRS requires companies to test their non-current assets, by  cash-generating unit (CGU) or relevant group of CGUs, for  impairment whenever an indicator exists. Additionally, IFRS requires testing the CGUs for impairment  reversal at the end of each reporting period by assessing whether  there is any indicator that an impairment loss recognised in prior  periods (for an asset other than goodwill) may no longer exist, or  may have decreased. – Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identified in the paragraphs  above. Amendments to standards and interpretations which came into force during the  year did not have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements and are as follows:  – IAS 7 Statement of cash flows, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 The amendments require entities to provide disclosures about changes in their liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising  from cash flows and non-cash changes. These are based on the Group’s current interpretation of IFRS 15 and may be  subject to changes as interpretations evolve more generally. The Group estimates that approximately US$4,800,000 would be reclassified from selling expenses to cost of sales, based on 2017 figures. Provisions are also made for uncertain exposures which can have an impact on both deferred and  current tax. Judgement is required in determining when the future economic benefit of a project can reasonably be regarded as assured, at which point evaluation  and exploration expenses are capitalised. Non-controlling interests’ rights to safeguard their interest are fully considered in assessing whether the Group controls a subsidiary. Contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised  if the acquisition date fair value can be measured reliably. Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Hochschild Mining plc 103 Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Further information 2 Significant accounting policies continued (f) Evaluation and exploration assets Evaluation and exploration expenses are capitalised when the future economic benefit of the project can reasonably be regarded as assured. The  provision is reviewed on an annual basis for changes in cost estimates, discount rates and operating lives. Revenue is initially recognised on a provisional basis using the  Group’s best estimate of contained gold and silver. Any subsequent adjustments to the initial estimate of metal content are recorded in revenue once they  have been determined. Revenue is initially recognised when the conditions set out above have been met, using market prices at that date. The selling price of gold and silver can be  measured reliably as these metals are actively traded on international exchanges. This involves a significant amount of  judgement as tax legislation can be complex and open to different interpretation. (y) Hedging The Group used commodity swaps and zero cost collar contracts to hedge certain of its cash flows from product sales against price risk. T ransfer prices between segments are set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to that used for third parties. Exploration expenses are generally  incurred in the following areas: mapping, sampling, geophysics, identification of local targets and reconnaissance drilling. 2  As at 31 December 2016 the Group held an investment in Mariana Resources Ltd which was acquired by Sandstorm Gold on 12 July 2017 . No security has been granted or guarantees given by the Group in respect of these related party balances. These leases have a life of three years with renewal terms 15 days before the expiration and  no purchase option. This price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative in accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’.
