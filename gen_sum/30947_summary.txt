reversal at the end of each reporting period by assessing whether there is any indicator that an impairment loss recognised in prior periods (for an asset other than goodwill) may no longer exist, or may have decreased. – based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identified in the paragraphs above. these are based on the
