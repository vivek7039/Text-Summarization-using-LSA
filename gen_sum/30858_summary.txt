We serve a large  installed customer base, including many of the world's leading  universities and colleges. As part of this  change, we are transitioning our current hosted customers  to a new data centre, in partnership with Rackspace. Although there  is much still to do in 2018, the overall business structural  changes have largely been made, which should provide a more  settled and certain environment for 2018. Specialist provision comes with unique challenges  and Derwen College needed a flexible student  information system that could easily meet their  exacting requirements. Key measures: Revenue (sales of new modules to existing or new customers) Progress in 2017: The first four Tribal Edge modules moved into beta at the end of 2017 and offer an enhanced student  information mobile app; an integrated, social collaboration platform; full lifecycle student support; and outcomes-based learning  analytics. This will enable an on-going higher value service  provision and a smoother income flow from those customers on SaaS. Key measures: Annually Recurring Revenue; percentage of Revenue annually recurring  Progress in 2017: We established a partnership with the world-wide, market leading managed cloud provider, Rackspace, to  enable us to provide our customers with a rich set of cloud services. We identified areas where we can more effectively align the  Group’s resources to deliver material cost efficiencies and  improve margin without impacting the Group’s ability to serve our  customers or drive our business forward.

Support & Maintenance retention rates remain high, and as a  result, our Annual Recurring Revenue base has continued to  grow. Revenues are typically based  on day rate fees, although we sometimes operate under fixed fee  contracts for defined implementation scopes. These  services have grown by 20.5% in 2017, to £4.0m (2016: £3.3m)  as customers increasingly migrate their IT systems into the  cloud. “I am more than happy to recommend  Tribal and their SchoolEdge  solution to any school considering a  Timetabling solution.” The Australian International School  Singapore Tribal Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 20 Segmental Performance Results for each business segment are shown in the table  below.

The accounting judgements can be complex when associated with  recognition of invoiced and accrued income for contracts where  there are specific ongoing delivery challenges, history of slow or  non-payment, ongoing commercial negotiations, contract claims or  contract losses. There is also a risk that invoiced and accrued revenue  on such contracts may not be recoverable. We sought to identify those contracts where  management may have encountered unexpected  complexities in delivering the project.

The accounting for changes in the fair value of deferred contingent consideration, and non-contingent consideration if applicable,  that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments, and for which consideration is classified as an asset or liability is  remeasured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss. Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives of 2 to 7 years. These assets are amortised on a  straight line basis over their useful economic lives of 5 years. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred  tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary  differences can be utilised. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method,  less any impairment. Programme delivery requirements,  software specification and customer expectations may evolve during the course of these major projects. This may result in  developments to ongoing commercial arrangements that could materially impact the basis of financial judgements made at a period  end. Cash flows beyond the budget and extrapolation period were calculated into perpetuity  using a growth rate of 2%. There are no amounts included in trade and other receivables arising from long-term contracts due for settlement after more than  12 months. The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that  all payables are paid within a reasonable timeframe.
