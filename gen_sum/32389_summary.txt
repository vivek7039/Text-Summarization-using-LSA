market dampened by concerns over brexit was testament to xafinity’s quality of earnings and growth potential, with the offer at 139p per ordinary share being fully subscribed by a shareholder base of longer-term investors. the group achieved a creditable performance for the year ended 31 march 2017, continuing a strong track record of delivering revenue growth, healthy operating margin and strong cash generation, while investing in its operational capabilities to underpin future growth. i look forward to participating with colleagues in the next phase of sustained growth for xafinity. for example, the department of work and pensions recently published a green paper on db pension schemes. data from kpmg shows that the fiduciary market has grown tenfold since 2007 (see chart 2) with three-quarters of those contracts managed by investment consultants. 2017 2007 719 59 2016 33% 2015 23% of new appointments this year were advised by an independent third party chart 2: fiduciary management mandates (source: kpmg) chart 3: fiduciary management advisors for new appointments (source: kpmg) xafinity annual report and accounts 2017 8 the complexity of pension regulation means that barriers to entry are high. chart 4, above, compares the revenues of firms in these three segments during their 2015 financial year 1 . trust based arrangements are either individual standalone arrangements set up by employers to be their own dc pension scheme, or are a ‘master trust’ where there is a common administration and investment platform that multiple employers share. this analysis does not include advisory services provided by pricewaterhousecoopers, deloitte, kpmg and ernst & young due to a lack of segmental information; data was also unavailable for 5-10 regional companies. 0

choice’). this is leading to an increasing popularity of master trusts, which provide such flexibility, as the preferred solution for uk dc schemes. alternatively, employers may seek to use npt as their main arrangement for both accumulation and de-cumulation. there are consolidation opportunities in the ssas and sipp markets a ssas is an occupational pension scheme with no more than 11 members at any time and is established by an employer for the benefit of some or all of its key employees. npt and trivial commutation are 2 of our more recently added services that gathered momentum over the year. much of our growth last year arose from us maintaining and developing existing client relationships. we were awarded work by 8 new long-term clients, several of whom defected from our big 3 competitors. read more on page 16. npt had a strong year, growing in revenue by 49% and adding 28 new employers as participants. we anticipate radar will help us serve our clients better bringing greater insight and thus more value-add services. we did not complete any acquisitions in 2017, but have reviewed prospective acquisition targets and will be looking to enter discussions. it’s a consulting model that is past its sell by date, and radar changes all this, answering key questions such as where is my scheme today, how did we get here, and what levers can we pull to improve things? strategic report governance financial statements company information 19 q: why does xafinity have co-chief executives, and how do you divide responsibilities? we are rolling out our new software system, radar (read more on page 17), and some talented people joined the business. there were serious risks that the members of their pension schemes would see material reductions in benefits. the reality is that these schemes will be around for 50+ years, and clients need more help than ever. having said this, a general issue with our market is that things move quite slowly. it takes people quite a long time to make decisions and do things; however we are perfectly placed for the long-term. ben: the recent highly critical fca report about fiduciary management as a model within investment advisory services also plays to our strengths. npt is a brilliant solution, but we don’t see at the moment that the industry, employers or trustees are moving quickly enough to make sure that dc scheme members, or indeed db scheme members who transfer out of their schemes, are properly protected and finding cost effective, well governed, fully flexible vehicles. npt is ahead of its time in that regard, but the market has been slow to move. we are an equal opportunities employer and do not differentiate on the grounds of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion or physical ability. these, combined with a £38m committed financing facility until february 2022, mean the group is well placed to meet future working capital cash requirements. a performance share plan and sharesave scheme are to be rolled out in july 2017. succession planning is reviewed by the nominations committee. the group may be susceptible to crime which could materially and adversely affect its results of operations. his roles included head of audit, cfo and coo for the bank’s international operations. alan joined robert walters plc as group financial controller in september 2002 and was appointed to the board of robert walters plc as group finance director in march 2007. mike ainslie alan bannatyne ben bramhall words 30 xafinity annual report and accounts 2017 28 tom cross brown chairman i am pleased to introduce our first corporate governance report. he is also responsible for the group’s strategy with regard to acquisitions and technology investment. in advance of scheduled board meetings each director receives documentation providing updates on group strategy, finances, operations and business development. a formal induction programme will be developed and tailored for any new directors joining the board. directors may seek independent professional advice at the company’s expense where they consider it appropriate in relation to their duties. in addition, the auditor has internal processes, which include peer reviews, to ensure that independence is maintained. as such, xafinity looks to focus on key inherent risks that may impact on the achievement of control objectives and embed control measures into its process to render reasonable assurance that they will be achieved in practice. the group achieved a creditable performance for the year ended 31 march 2017, continuing a strong track record of delivering profitable revenue growth, healthy operating margin and strong cash generation, while investing in its operational capabilities to underpin future growth. indeed, we are very keen to encourage an open dialogue with our shareholders on executive remuneration. executive directors are entitled to take all or part of their pension contributions as a cash allowance. the remuneration committee may impose such conditions as it considers appropriate which must be satisfied before any award will vest. the chairman and non-executive directors do not participate in any new cash or share incentive plans. in addition, while performance measures and targets used in the annual bonus plan and psp will generally remain unaltered, if events occur which the committee determines would make a different or amended target a fairer measure of performance, such amended or different targets can be set provided they are not materially more or less difficult to satisfy, having regard to the event in question. the committee may make minor amendments to the remuneration policy set out above for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation, without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment. it may, however, be necessary in some cases to make buy-out awards on terms that are more bespoke than the existing annual bonus plan and psp. the service agreements of all executive directors, which are available for inspection at the company’s registered office, comply with this policy: • the executive directors’ service agreements are terminable by either party on not less than 9 months’ written notice (6 months for cfo and head of pensions) or immediately upon payment in lieu of notice, and contains a garden leave clause. they are entitled to be reimbursed all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the proper performance of their duties. their appointment may be terminated at any time upon 3 months’ written notice by either party and with immediate effect in certain circumstances. other members of senior management participate in similar annual bonus arrangements to the executive directors, although award sizes vary by organisational level. strategic report company information financial statements governance 43 0 200 400 600 800 1000

annual re-election by shareholders. the company does not have agreements with any director or employee that would provide specific compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover, except that provisions of the company’s performance share plan incentive arrangement may cause awards to vest on a takeover. the forecasts and cash flow projections being used to assess going concern have been comprehensively stress-tested by using simulation techniques involving sensitivity analysis. the group has a strong balance sheet, access to financial resources and long term
