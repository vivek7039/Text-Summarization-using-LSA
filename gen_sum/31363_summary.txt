web and mobile channels. the current board recognises stakeholder concern regarding previous investment venture returns and a track record of impairing investments, which unfortunately continued in 2017 as the book valuations of various historic investments have yet again had to be revalued downwards. this was the first time in its recent history that capital has been returned to shareholders. however, the group does operate a significant venue onsite at each of these locations, which therefore restricts its flexibility. wagering revenues softness in the venues business is primarily from our digital platform and at stamford. £’000s 2017 2016 reported service revenue 1,389 5,789 sales revenue 34,080 30,248 total revenues 35,469 36,037 contribution 30,380 28,977 contribution margin

although i joined the board in january 2017. looking forward i see additional opportunities in both the north american and international markets, some of which have already come to fruition. in north america, i am re-examining our digital services business with a focus on improving profitability and cash generation. new products will be added to the quantum™ system software including additional lottery products currently offered by leidsa, (a sportech customer in the dominican republic), which would be suitable for deployment by other small private lottery operators, particularly in latin america and asia. bump 50:50 electronic raffle technologies and proven marketing strategies help foundations maximise the return on their charitable fundraising programs. these additions helped bring the total number of bump 50:50 customers to 68, representing foundations from 16 different professional and collegiate sports leagues. this year bump 50:50 launched a new online and mobile raffle program to supplement in-stadia play and used this new platform to help the tampa bay lightning foundation reach a jackpot record of us$270,000 during the nhl® all-star event. despite this, our brand mywinners.com achieved an 11% increase in 2017 from online and mobile handle versus prior year. indeed, at this juncture i would like to thank all staff across the group for their hard work and commitment. new f&b revenues contributed by stamford following its delayed opening in late june 2017 were £1,471k. the racing and digital business produced a contribution margin of 85.7% (2016: 79.8%)

which by nature or materiality or consistency with 2016 have been regarded by the company as ‘exceptional’. gross employment costs include the cost of field service agents whose time and expense is

significantly overdue debts over a longer period. within the venues division, current trade receivables total £870k (2016: £773k), which equates to 10 days of revenue in both reporting periods. a review of inventory led the board to conclude that given certain spare parts had not been utilised for a considerable period of time, £126k should be recognised as obsolete and provided against, increasing the total inventory provision to £310k. note 25 – liquidity, current assets less current and non-current liabilities the group’s liquidity can be summarised as follows: £000’s 31.12.17

final appraisals before announcing their appointment in due course. this policy precludes pricewaterhousecoopers llp from providing certain services such as internal audit work or accounting services and as of 1 january 2017, tax advice and any advisory service which ultimately has an impact, material in size, on the treatment of items in the financial statements. on this basis, there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks faced by the group. they are also available at other times, outside close periods, to enter into dialogue with these shareholders. all resolutions at the 2017 agm held on 24 may 2017 were voted by way of a manual poll. our approach to remuneration is governed by our directors’ remuneration policy which, along with a new long-term incentive arrangement, the value creation plan (“vcp”), received binding shareholder approval at the general meeting on 24 may 2017 and came into formal effect from that date. implementation of remuneration policy for 2018 the remuneration package for our executive directors will continue to be made up of base salary, plus pension contributions and benefits, and, subject to stretching performance conditions, an annual bonus paid in cash. the committee ensures that performance-related pay structures will not raise environmental, social or governance (“esg”) risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. benefits such as relocation allowances may also be offered if considered appropriate and reasonable by the committee. executive directors will be eligible for any other benefits which are introduced for the wider workforce on broadly similar terms and where executive directors are recruited from overseas, benefits more tailored to their geographical location may be provided. value creation plan to motivate executive directors and incentivise delivery of performance over the long-term. any increase will be guided by changes in market rates, time commitments and responsibility levels. policy on external appointments sportech plc recognises that its directors are likely to be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that such exposure can broaden experience and knowledge, which will benefit the company. the base salaries for 2018 are as follows: director 2018 2017 % change chief executive officer 1 cad$500,000 cad$400,000 25% 1 andrew gaughan was promoted to the position of chief executive officer on 14 march 2018 from his previous position as president - sportech racing and digital. the objectives themselves are considered commercially sensitive and will therefore be disclosed on a retrospective basis in next year’s annual report on remuneration (as long as such targets are no longer considered commercially sensitive at that point). pension arrangements the company will contribute cad$8,000 per annum into a defined contribution scheme for andrew gaughan. it is currently intended that no further awards will be made to executive directors under the psp. all non-executives sit on the subsidiary boards and no additional fees are payable for this. – roger withers stepped down from the board on 24 may 2017 and received £30,000 for payment in lieu of contracted notice. – cliff baty, former chief financial officer, was paid a basic annual salary of £249,000 per annum (stepped down from the board 3 march 2016). 2 2016 awards were deferred until november, because of certain ongoing anticipated corporate activity which delayed their grant and were subject to a relative tsr

remuneration. we performed sensitivity analysis to assess the potential incremental tax liability should different assumptions be adopted. over recent years the business has experienced a number of one off transactions that have significant tax implications. these functions maintain their own localised accounting records and controls, distinct from those at the head office level. further, we have confirmed that the contingent liability in respect of this item is appropriately disclosed (see note 26). during our assessment we have considered a number of factors, which are relevant to nyx acquiring new customers in the remaining period. the company holds all investments in subsidiaries and therefore net assets is deemed a generally accepted auditing benchmark. nigel reynolds (senior
