Venues is taking a much more aggressive competitive stance with regard to its web and mobile channels. However, the Group does operate a significant venue onsite at each of these locations, which therefore restricts its flexibility. It will now be the key variant in achieving or exceeding our internal revenue and profits expectations for 2018. £’000s 2017 2016 Reported Service revenue 1,389 5,789 Sales revenue 34,080 30,248 Total revenues 35,469 36,037 Contribution 30,380 28,977 Contribution margin 85.7% 80.4% Adjusted operated expenses (22,672) (19,601) Adjusted Ebitda 7,708 9,376 Internal software capitalised 3,026 3,022 Purchase of other intangibles 865 113 Purchase of PPE 1,281 2,885 Total capex in year 5,172 6,020 Andrew Gaughan, CEO I am pleased to address the Sportech shareholders as the Group’s new Chief Executive Officer, having been appointed to that position on 14 March 2018, although I joined the Board in January 2017. Looking forward I see additional opportunities in both the North American and international markets, some of which have already come to fruition. In North America, I am re-examining our Digital Services business with a focus on improving profitability and cash generation. New products will be added to the Quantum™ System software including additional lottery products currently offered by LEIDSA, (a Sportech customer in the Dominican Republic), which would be suitable for deployment by other small private lottery operators, particularly in Latin America and Asia. Bump 50:50 electronic raffle technologies and proven marketing strategies help foundations maximise the return on their charitable fundraising programs. These additions helped bring the total number of Bump 50:50 customers to 68, representing foundations from 16 different professional and collegiate sports leagues. Indeed, at this juncture I would like to thank all staff across the Group for their hard work and commitment. Gross employment costs include the cost of field service agents whose time and expense is incurred in servicing terminals at customer sites. Significant savings were made in the corporate function with a downsizing of both staff and office premises. 2016 2016 Constant £000’s 2017 Reported currency Racing and Digital 7,708 9,376 9,715 Venues 1,497 2,448 2,587 Central costs (2,498) (3,307) (3,307) FX and inter-divisional elimination — —(478) 6,707 8,517 8,517 170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt4_170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt4 28/04/2018 01:20 Page 23 Note 6 – Exceptional items other than Spot the Ball On 25 September 2017, the Group sold its shares in NYX for net proceeds of £2,333k. In certain circumstances, arrangements have been reached with other customers to spread significantly overdue debts over a longer period. Within the Venues division, current trade receivables total £870k (2016: £773k), which equates to 10 days of revenue in both reporting periods. In order to progress an appeal, the Group is making one against HMRC for VAT on head office costs going back a number of years.

Wherever possible, waste consumable materials are recycled or disposed of in a manner most suitable to reduce any impact on the natural environment. As announced on Tuesday 24 April 2018, the Company has identified a suitable CFO candidate and is conducting final appraisals before announcing their appointment in due course. This policy precludes PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP from providing certain services such as internal audit work or accounting services and as of 1 January 2017, tax advice and any advisory service which ultimately has an impact, material in size, on the treatment of items in the financial statements. On this basis, there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks faced by the Group. They are also available at other times, outside close periods, to enter into dialogue with these shareholders. Our approach to remuneration is governed by our directors’ remuneration policy which, along with a new long-term incentive arrangement, the Value Creation Plan (“VCP”), received binding shareholder approval at the General Meeting on 24 May 2017 and came into formal effect from that date. The Committee ensures that performance-related pay structures will not raise environmental, social or governance (“ESG”) risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. Benefits such as relocation allowances may also be offered if considered appropriate and reasonable by the Committee. Executive Directors will be eligible for any other benefits which are introduced for the wider workforce on broadly similar terms and where Executive Directors are recruited from overseas, benefits more tailored to their geographical location may be provided. The base salaries for 2018 are as follows: Director 2018 2017 % change Chief Executive Officer 1 CAD$500,000 CAD$400,000 25% 1 Andrew Gaughan was promoted to the position of Chief Executive Officer on 14 March 2018 from his previous position as President - Sportech Racing and Digital. The objectives themselves are considered commercially sensitive and will therefore be disclosed on a retrospective basis in next year’s annual report on remuneration (as long as such targets are no longer considered commercially sensitive at that point). Pension arrangements The Company will contribute CAD$8,000 per annum into a defined contribution scheme for Andrew Gaughan. It is currently intended that no further awards will be made to executive directors under the PSP. – Mickey Kalifa, Chief Financial Officer, was paid a basic annual salary of £254,000 per annum with effect from 1 January 2017. – Roger Withers stepped down from the Board on 24 May 2017 and received £30,000 for payment in lieu of contracted notice. – Cliff Baty, former Chief Financial Officer, was paid a basic annual salary of £249,000 per annum (stepped down from the Board 3 March 2016). 2 2016 awards were deferred until November, because of certain ongoing anticipated corporate activity which delayed their grant and were subject to a relative TSR performance target subject to a financial underpin which was outlined in full in last year’s report.

NBS has no connection with Sportech other than in the provision of advice on executive and Non-executive director remuneration. Over recent years the business has experienced a number of one off transactions that have significant tax implications. These functions maintain their own localised accounting records and controls, distinct from those at the head office level. Further, we have confirmed that the contingent liability in respect of this item is appropriately disclosed (see note 26). During our assessment we have considered a number of factors, which are relevant to NYX acquiring new customers in the remaining period. The company holds all investments in subsidiaries and therefore net assets is deemed a generally accepted auditing benchmark.

Changes to market conditions, including regulatory change and competition from other online gaming suppliers, are the key assumptions used in making these judgements. Assets in the course of construction are capitalised when first brought into use and depreciated from this date. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives or contractual period if shorter (six to ten years). All other individual assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist at each reporting date. The schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or Trustee administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations. Those assets are remeasured to their fair value at the reporting date, with any gains/losses recognised within other comprehensive income. Provisions payable over a period greater than 12 months are discounted using an appropriate market risk-free discount rate. This Group includes Sportech PLC and other companies whose results have been presented as discontinued operations in the year (see note 10). This asset has a book value in USD at the reporting date, prior to any impairment that may be considered necessary, of $23,644k. Note that in previous reporting periods, expected sale proceeds from surplus assets within the Venues division were included. Certain assets have been transferred into alternative sub categories within property, plant and equipment following a detailed review of the asset registers. Those items have been impaired in full to reflect that future profits will not be generated from their use. Those spare parts must be held by the Group for terminals that are in use at customer sites. In this territory, the Group has a number of committed financial obligations which have become onerous contracts. Accordingly the gain from releasing those provisions have been shown within exceptional items rather than included in adjusted EBITDA. The Group has now cancelled its borrowing facilities and operates instead in a cash surplus position. Credit risk in these entities is managed locally by assessing the creditworthiness of each new customer before agreeing payment and delivery terms. The ultimate tax liability due, in all instances, is subject to a degree of management judgment. However the charge does not vary directly with revenues and so they have been reclassified to operating costs. As disclosed in note 10, it is anticipated that a net gain on disposal will arise from the transaction of approximately £0.9m. Contingencies and commitments Operating lease commitments The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2017 2016 £000 £000 No later than one year 140 137 Total 140 137 Contingent items The Company is exposed to certain contingent items for corporation tax, VAT, M&A activity and legal claims.
