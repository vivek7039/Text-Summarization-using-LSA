focused uk investment opportunity in the heavyside construction materials industry. • we are strongly cash- generative, providing more than adequate resources for organic investment and bolt-on acquisitions. • there are also continuing potential opportunities arising from non-core divestments by the major global construction materials groups. in the past, the plant has relied on hope works’ neighbouring shale quarry for this material, but we are increasingly using pulverised fly ash (pfa) as a sustainable alternative source of waste-derived raw material, which is helping to improve our husbandry of our shale resources. we also operate 26 asphalt plants, located mainly in our quarries, which mix aggregates and bitumen to produce coated stone. we maximise the margin on our cement by internalising as large a proportion as possible to our ready-mixed concrete plants, and we also produce a range of packed cements, dry- mixed cementitious mortars and screeds for the builders merchants market. c ost-effective delivery of heavyside construction materials from quarry or plant to site requires highly efficient logistics management, coupled with flexible and responsive customer service. breedon has always prided itself on staying local and being easy to do business with, which means we have no national call centres or centralised shipping for our downstream products, but instead a network of local businesses with an uncompromising commitment to outstanding service. this rail distribution network is complemented by a fleet of more than 850 delivery vehicles, including cement tankers, articulated tipper lorries and ready-mixed concrete trucks, which deliver direct to customers’ sites anywhere from stornoway in the hebrides to the south coast of england. as always, there were marked regional variations, with some parts of the uk significantly outperforming others. restoration has taken a variety of forms, from fields returned to agriculture or wildlife habitats, to lakes used for leisure pursuits – sometimes preceded by landfill where there is a pressing local need for additional waste disposal facilities. our strategy strategic priority

we’ve chosen this measure: this metric tracks improvements in the relative profitability of the group and enables us to monitor progress against our stated objective of achieving a 15 per cent underlying ebit margin by 2020. we also use it as a risk monitor. the impact of this dilution is now behind us and we are making good progress towards our target. remuneration link: this measure is also used to determine award levels in our performance share plans. t he group’s principal risks and uncertainties, together with examples of mitigants, are set out overleaf. we completed the integration of our largest-ever acquisition, concluded two bolt-on purchases and announced an important transaction with tarmac holdings limited (tarmac) that, subject to approval by the competition authorities, will see us streamline our ready-mixed concrete network in exchange for a substantial new reserve of minerals and a strategically valuable asphalt plant. this did not, however, distract us from our operational focus and we once again delivered a solid financial performance. group revenues for the year grew by 43 per cent to £652.4 million and underlying earnings before interest and tax (ebit) increased by 35 per cent to £80.4 million, including a full-year contribution from hope construction materials limited (hope). we have a very straightforward mission: to be the safest and most profitable company in our industry. peter tom cbe executive chairman 7 march 2018 25 01 strategic report 02 03 04 trading performance w e made good progress in 2017, with volumes and revenues comfortably ahead of the prior year. growth was led by healthy increases in residential and infrastructure development, which together account for the majority of our end-use markets. a summary of 2017 market conditions and the outlook for 2018 can be found on page 14. a review of 2017 – group chief executive’s statement we are confident that we can continue to deliver organic growth, complemented by value-enhancing acquisitions.” pat ward group chief executive 26 breedon group annual report 2017 www.breedongroup.com organic development once again we invested well ahead of depreciation in mineral assets, capacity and operational improvements throughout the group, including three new quarries, which will facilitate further internalisation of material to our concrete and asphalt plants. the planned acquisition of minffordd quarry from tarmac will give us another new plant, expanding our asphalt network to 28 plants nationwide. investments last year in equipment upgrades at tom’s forest and dowlow quarries are already producing improved performances. they are enabling us to make clearly measurable improvements to the efficiency and running costs of our fixed plant and drive selective capital investment, thereby ensuring that all our operations are fit for purpose in the years ahead. a: we decided very soon after the acquisition of hope to restructure our management on regional and area general manager lines, in order to ensure that we had ambitious and capable people in those key roles on which the business depends. this approach has enabled us to deliver widespread performance improvements in our quarries and plants. there is no doubt that 2018 will continue to be challenging in some areas of the construction market. our planned acquisition of quarrying and asphalt assets from tarmac will give us an even more powerful platform for growth. we opened a new sand & gravel quarry at low harperley near durham - the only active sand & gravel source in county durham - which will enable us to internalise the supply of more material to our concrete plants. further investments were made in commencing replacement of our asphalt plant at furnace quarry near inverary and installing a new wash plant at our tom’s forest quarry near aberdeen, which will enable us to fully exploit a valuable sand resource in the overburden. we also won significant work at manchester international airport and from a wide range of groundwork specialists servicing the buoyant housebuilding industry. 2017 achievements • strong trading performance • plant reliability ahead of budget • import terminals integrated • bagged cement building solid customer base • major investment programme completed • logistics and service functions streamlined key achievements as planned, we have internalised cement supplies to the great majority of breedon southern’s concrete plants. they also provide a complementary source of supply and back-up support to our

governance across the business through management control, policies, procedures and training. we therefore place a heavy emphasis on visible felt leadership (vfl), led by the executive committee and requiring all our managers to spend a significant proportion of their time out in the business interacting with our operational teams. we also saw a continuing improvement in the reporting of safety observations (formerly known as near-misses), which increased by 16 per cent year-on-year. every safety observation reported is a potential accident avoided, so we are pleased to see this continuing upward trend. this is enabling us to manage our safety learnings, actions and follow-up much more effectively and share them instantly around the group, ensuring that no time is lost in taking action or recommending improvement following any safety incidents. 2.63 2.72 1.87 1.41 3.03 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 employee ltifr employee tifr (12-month rolling average) jan 17.47 14.28 feb mar apr may
