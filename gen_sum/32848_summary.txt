Our strategy is to continue growing through organic improvement and acquisition of businesses in the heavyside construction materials market.

In the past, the plant has relied on Hope Works’ neighbouring shale quarry for this material, but we are increasingly using pulverised fly ash (PFA) as a sustainable alternative source of waste-derived raw material, which is helping to improve our husbandry of our shale resources. We also operate 26 asphalt plants, located mainly in our quarries, which mix aggregates and bitumen to produce coated stone. We maximise the margin on our cement by internalising as large a proportion as possible to our ready-mixed concrete plants, and we also produce a range of packed cements, dry- mixed cementitious mortars and screeds for the builders merchants market. C ost-effective delivery of heavyside construction materials from quarry or plant to site requires highly efficient logistics management, coupled with flexible and responsive customer service. Breedon has always prided itself on staying local and being easy to do business with, which means we have no national call centres or centralised shipping for our downstream products, but instead a network of local businesses with an uncompromising commitment to outstanding service. This rail distribution network is complemented by a fleet of more than 850 delivery vehicles, including cement tankers, articulated tipper lorries and ready-mixed concrete trucks, which deliver direct to customers’ sites anywhere from Stornoway in the Hebrides to the south coast of England.

We completed the integration of our largest-ever acquisition, concluded two bolt-on purchases and announced an important transaction with Tarmac Holdings Limited (Tarmac) that, subject to approval by the competition authorities, will see us streamline our ready-mixed concrete network in exchange for a substantial new reserve of minerals and a strategically valuable asphalt plant. This did not, however, distract us from our operational focus and we once again delivered a solid financial performance. We have a very straightforward mission: to be the safest and most profitable company in our industry. Peter Tom CBE Executive Chairman 7 March 2018 25 01 STRATEGIC REPORT 02 03 04 TRADING PERFORMANCE W e made good progress in 2017, with volumes and revenues comfortably ahead of the prior year. Growth was led by healthy increases in residential and infrastructure development, which together account for the majority of our end-use markets. The planned acquisition of Minffordd quarry from Tarmac will give us another new plant, expanding our asphalt network to 28 plants nationwide. Investments last year in equipment upgrades at Tom’s Forest and Dowlow quarries are already producing improved performances. A: We decided very soon after the acquisition of Hope to restructure our management on Regional and Area General Manager lines, in order to ensure that we had ambitious and capable people in those key roles on which the business depends. There is no doubt that 2018 will continue to be challenging in some areas of the construction market. OUTLOOK Breedon is an appreciably stronger and more strategically well positioned business today than it was two years ago. Our planned acquisition of quarrying and asphalt assets from Tarmac will give us an even more powerful platform for growth. Further investments were made in commencing replacement of our asphalt plant at Furnace quarry near Inverary and installing a new wash plant at our Tom’s Forest quarry near Aberdeen, which will enable us to fully exploit a valuable sand resource in the overburden. We also won significant work at Manchester International Airport and from a wide range of groundwork specialists servicing the buoyant housebuilding industry. 2017 ACHIEVEMENTS • Strong trading performance • Plant reliability ahead of budget • Import terminals integrated • Bagged cement building solid customer base • Major investment programme completed • Logistics and service functions streamlined KEY ACHIEVEMENTS As planned, we have internalised cement supplies to the great majority of Breedon Southern’s concrete plants. They also provide a complementary source of supply and back-up support to our main cement plant.

We also saw a continuing improvement in the reporting of Safety Observations (formerly known as near-misses), which increased by 16 per cent year-on-year. Every Safety Observation reported is a potential accident avoided, so we are pleased to see this continuing upward trend. Breedon Southern achieved transition to the new standard late last year, using West Deeping as an example. Our HR team is working closely with the divisions to identify further apprentice recruitment opportunities, focusing in particular on drivers, operatives and fitters. We have 25 colleagues currently enrolled at Derby University studying the various Foundation Degrees in Mineral Products and Certificate programmes. This means that we have approximately 10 years to source a replacement workforce before the bulk of our present one retires.

BACKGROUND Pat spent 20 years with Aggregate Industries in various roles across their UK and US businesses. He is also responsible for ensuring that the Company maintains an appropriate level of dialogue with its shareholders. Directors and senior managers ensure that the Risk Management Framework is implemented effectively within their respective business areas. In addition, proxy votes will be counted and the results announced after any vote on a show of hands. Both members of the Audit Committee have relevant and recent financial experience at a senior level as set out in their biographies on page 53. In the table below we have set out a summary of our Remuneration Policy for executive directors. Maximum opportunity In line with best and market practice, it is currently intended that rolling annual awards will be made. Targets are set at levels which require stretching performance to be achieved for maximum payout, but without encouraging excessive risk-taking. Operation Non-executive directors each receive a basic fee for holding the office of non-executive director, and may also receive an additional fee for further responsibilities (such as holding the office of Senior Independent Director or chairing a Board committee). • where it is considered appropriate to reimburse the new director for any costs he/she may have incurred as a consequence of resigning from their previous employment. 2 Included in fees above is an amount of £393,750 (2016: £361,000) in respect of services provided by Rise Rocks Limited, a company in which Peter Tom has a beneficial interest, and the sum of £335,560 (2016: £468,750) which was paid to Rise Rocks Limited as a bonus pursuant to the consultancy agreement between the Company and Rise Rocks Limited; further information is given on page 66. These appointments were noted by the Nomination Committee and, in accordance with its terms of reference, it will continue to keep succession planning for all senior executives under review, and it will receive an update on the plan on at least an annual basis. For these residual components, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement present. Underlying measures are presented on a consistent basis over time to assist in the comparison of performance.

The Group classifies interest rate caps as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value. Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments An increase of 100 basis points in interest rates in respect of variable rate instruments at the reporting date would have decreased equity and income and expenditure for a full year by £1,125,000 (2016: £1,454,000). Mineral reserves and resources acquired in the normal course of business are held at historic cost on initial recognition. When mineral assets arise through business combinations, these are initially recognised at fair value as part of the acquisition accounting under IFRS 3. This fair value is based on expert geological surveys which provide an estimate of the accessible reserves and resources.
