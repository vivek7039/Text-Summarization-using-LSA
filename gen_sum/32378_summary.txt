Chairman’s statement continued 4 Lombard Risk Management plc Annual report and accounts 2017 SUMMARY • We are reporting record revenues of £34.3m supported by an increase of 21% in recurring revenue to £12.4m and 35% growth in order book to £10.1m. At the halfway point of that two-year plan, we are delighted to be sharing positive news and significant progress on all fronts. However, in recent years, rising costs and pressure for talent from both local software firms and giant international brands has Alastair Brown Chief Executive Officer Chief Executive Officer’s statement Significant progress on all fronts. Attracting new Futures Commission Merchant (“FCM”) clients in Europe and North America, as well as presenting an important upgrade to existing customers, its immediate success validates our strategy to offer a comprehensive and up-to-date solution suitable for the biggest Tier 1 organisations. However, our collateral expertise is equally relevant across the market, to participants of all sizes, and building on our success of hosting COLLINE ® in the cloud for some clients, we launched AgileCOLLATERAL ® in November. Delivering to such an extensive client community requires a highly skilled professional services organisation, and we pride ourselves on the quality of our implementation support. The magnitude of the client investment projects involving an end-to-end solution offered in partnership with Oracle has meant that deal progression has been slower than both parties would have liked, but with five clients signed and a strong pipeline in North America, Europe and Australia we are extremely optimistic about the opportunities being pursued for fiscal year 2018. With a focus on employee engagement, training, talent management and development, this is an advantage we intend to keep. The Birmingham office allows Lombard Risk to build a development centre within easy travelling time of its London headquarters and will allow the developers to work closely with our business experts.” This is an exciting opportunity for Lombard Risk, an opportunity to establish a first class development centre using the most up-to-date technologies and methods.” Mike Payne Lombard Risk’s Chief Technology Officer Chief Executive Officer’s statement continued 8 Lombard Risk Management plc Annual report and accounts 2017 LOMBARD RISK LAUNCHES AgileCOLLATERAL AgileCOLLATERAL – an ‘out of the box’, cross-product platform that supports your regulatory and strategic collateral management needs. • CONTROL – rapid implementation, flexible pricing models and low cost deployment options allow you to reduce the high cost of collateral management, achieve a greater level of control over operational processes and redirect resources to better serve investors. IMPLEMENT Our professional services team work closely with clients to ensure successful delivery and integration. SATISFY We work closely with our clients to ensure that their business and technology needs are met fully. Lombard Risk’s relationship with Oracle in Asian markets is now opening opportunities there too. • Replacement of manual processes has reduced time producing reports thus freeing resource to review outputs, analyse the data and utilise it for informed business decisions. 13 Annual report and accounts 2017 Lombard Risk Management plc Strategic report Business review Outlook Lombard Risk’s software is designed to help financial institutions continuously meet the seemingly insatiable demands of the global regulators, and to do so efficiently. In addition to these impacts on regulatory reporting driving demand for AgileREPORTER ® , the increasingly strict derivatives margining regime will continue to be extended across the industry, affecting smaller clients, adding new financial services segments and driving demand for COLLINE ® and AgileCOLLATERAL ® . We have had very few client losses over the past few years and when this does occur it is often due to a bank closing a UK or US branch and therefore ceasing to need our services in that branch. Personnel We are headquartered in London, England, but 62.3% of our 385 employees work outside the UK. Extracurricular activities are proactively encouraged in all the Group comprising both charitable and social events. The Company complies with the laws to which it is subject in not trading in countries where this is prohibited by sanctions, and takes account of Foreign Office warnings on travel to dangerous areas. These policies have remained unchanged from previous years and are detailed in note 14 to the accounts. Nigel Gurney Chief Financial Officer Financial review Group results Group revenue increased by 44.8% to a record £34.3m compared with £23.7m in the prior year, with strong growth recorded in the Risk Management and Trading division, which saw revenues increase by 83.1%. Internally the Group’s operating budget and monthly management accounts measure financial performance assuming no such capitalisation. These policies have remained unchanged from previous years and are detailed in note 14 to the accounts. Increased cost of hiring and retaining skilled labour due to competitive pressures in the employment market. Focus sales activities on date-driven imperatives such as AgileREPORTER ® and regulatory components of COLLINE ® ; qualify client opportunities in collateral space to ensure major cost savings are evident; and continue to support clients writing cost-saving business cases. Mature and responsive support model in place to meet any live production incidents experienced by clients.

The Executive Directors have service contracts which are terminable upon between three and six months’ notice.

Capital management The Group generally seeks to finance all operational financing requirements through cash flows generated from operating activities, although this may be supplemented through capital injections if mutually beneficial to the Group, current shareholders and prospective investors. Accounting policies (A) Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements are for the year ended 31 March 2017. Accounting policies continued (C) Segment reporting In identifying its operating segments, management generally follows the Group’s product lines. Enhancements to a separately identifiable intangible asset that is already available for use in the manner originally intended by management are expensed as incurred. Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. (N) Share options issued to employees All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. All equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding credit to “other reserves”. Accounting policies continued (O) Impairment testing of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. In addition, judgement is used to determine future profitability of the products and timing thereof. In addition, the Group prepares working capital forecasts that incorporate sensitivity analysis on exchange rate fluctuations. The sensitivity analysis is based on the Group’s foreign currency financial instruments held at each reporting date and also takes into account forward exchange contracts that offset effects from changes in currency exchange rates. These changes are considered to be reasonably possible based on observations of current market conditions. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date, as summarised below: Classes of financial assets – carrying amounts Held for trading (FVTPL) 2017 £000 Loans and receivables (amortised cost) 2017 £000 Total 2017 £000 Held for trading (FVTPL) 2016 £000 Loans and receivables (amortised cost) 2016 £000 Total 2016 £000 Cash and cash equivalents — 7,008 7,008 — 3,342 3,342 Derivative financial instruments — — — 17 — 17 Trade and other receivables — 10,225 10,225 — 6,193 6,193 — 17,233 17,233 17 9,535 9,552 The Group’s derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and are summarised below: 2017 £000 2016 £000 Chinese Yuan forward currency contracts (held for trading) — 17 The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate exchange rate exposure arising from forecast costs in Chinese Yuan.
