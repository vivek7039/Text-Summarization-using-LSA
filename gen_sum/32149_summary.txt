Dear Shareholder Pennon Group performed well in the year, delivering on its strategy of market-leading performance, efficiency and investing for growth. We have no shortage of new talent joining the company too, through graduate recruitment and our award-winning apprenticeship programmes. Sir John Parker Chairman Pennon Group plc 23 May 2017 Boardroom diversity Our Board is made up of 2 women and 4 men. We expect that new ERFs being constructed will increase the UK’s energy from waste capacity to c.15-16 million tonnes by 2020. Employee training courses have been developed around the Code of Conduct that focus on specific aspects relating to legal and ethical behaviour. We are committed to improving senior management gender ratios in time across the Group through initiatives such as informal mentoring programmes and family friendly policies. South West Water once again outperformed its regulatory contract to achieve a sector-leading RoRE (return on regulated equity) of 12.6%. We continued to drive returns from recycling through broader ‘self-help’ measures that are reducing the cost base and improving utilisation of assets. Due for completion by March 2018, Mayflower uses the innovative treatment processes of suspended ion exchange, inline coagulation and ceramic membrane filtration. Our operations are deeply embedded into local communities and we believe this is one of the reasons Ofwat responded so positively to South West Water’s latest business plan. Our gross greenhouse gas emissions increased by 14%, primarily as a result of Viridor’s newly commissioned ERFs reaching full operating capacity. Good progress has been made since this date in engaging sub-contractors and progressing construction which is expected to be complete within a revised timetable agreed with our customer, Glasgow City Council. Viridor and its joint venture partner John Laing have been actively engaging with GMWDA as they consider their options. Chris Loughlin Chief Executive Officer Pennon Group plc Avonmouth ERF: investing for growth Viridor, with its joint venture partners, is already one of the largest independent power generators from waste. Supporting contracts we already have, an additional volume of some 800,000 tonnes is available from local municipal, commercial and industrial sources. South West Water’s RoRE would remain sector leading and by the end of K6 period overall performance will converge. Support for those who need it There was also good progress in helping vulnerable customers, including developing affordability schemes. Wholesale services, providing water to premises and taking wastewater away, are unaffected, but business customers can choose who provides their retail service. 30 Pennon Group plc Annual Report 2017 From September 2016 South West Water fully engaged in a period of ‘shadow operation’ to ensure that systems and processes were ready for market opening, operating as closely as possible to the market conditions and requirements whilst ensuring customer service levels were maintained. A series of workshops were delivered to almost 2000 staff with messaging subsequently reinforced using an innovative web-based knowledge-testing application. Through our energy recovery facility (ERF) portfolio we are delivering on the Group’s strategy to invest for growth. This significant investment in environmental infrastructure is helping us to transform our business model with an increasing focus on ERFs and recycling. By doing this, we are supporting development of a circular economy with greater resource productivity leading to reduced waste and pollution. Our ERF portfolio is a significant asset base comprising eight plants in operation with four under construction, including Avonmouth. Our energy recovery facility (ERF) portfolio provides an excellent example of how the Group is executing its strategy to invest for growth. This major participation in UK environmental infrastructure is helping us transform our business model with an increasing focus on ERFs and recycling. This has been achieved through an increase in profits from Viridor, together with continuing strong South West Water financial performance and efficient ongoing finance costs across the Group. In addition the joint ventures have non-recourse net debt from third parties (excluding shareholder loans) of which Pennon’s share is £194 million. The Group engages with HMRC in an open and transparent way, identifying potential areas of uncertainty on a timely basis. The Group manages this risk and accrues for areas of tax uncertainty in line with accounting standards requirements, where appropriate. We recognise customer affordability challenges and that given the inability to disconnect domestic customers, some risk of uncollectable debt remains. Viridor has in place a regional adverse weather management strategy, aimed at reducing disruption to site operations and transport logistics. They involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. Further details of the review, which was facilitated by an external governance consultancy, are set out later in this report. Sir John’s commitments are expected to reduce in 2017, when he retires from the board of Anglo American plc. Prior to joining Pennon he was chief operating officer with Lloyds Register and before that executive chairman of Magnox Electric plc. Martin Angle is also a member of the Audit Committee and he has relevant financial experience as set out in his biography on page 57. This approach is compatible with Ofwat’s principles for holding companies in respect of Board leadership, transparency and governance. This approach seeks to ensure that there is a programme of internal and external audit reviews focused on identified key risk areas throughout the Group. Action is being taken to improve diversity across the workforce which will assist in increasing female representation at senior management level as described on page 19.

All Group companies benefitted from a reduction in the UK’s average electricity grid emissions conversion factor which fell sharply by 11% between 2015/16 and 2016/17. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have been impaired are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. An impairment loss on any assets dedicated to that contract is also recognised as described in accounting policy (j). The fair value of assets on transfer from customers is determined using a cost valuation approach allowing for depreciation. Consequently the Group’s income and cash generated from operations (note 38) are independent of changes in market interest rates. The Board has agreed a policy for managing such risk which is controlled through credit limits, counterparty approvals, and rigorous monitoring procedures. The fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market (for example over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments. Estimates are based on factors including historical experience and expectations of future events that management believe to be reasonable. Where a restoration provision gives access to future economic benefits, an asset is recognised and depreciated in accordance with the Group’s depreciation policy. The mortality assumption uses a scheme-specific calculation based on CMI 2015 actuarial tables with an allowance for future longevity improvement. Management has determined the value assigned to each assumption based on historical experience, market surveys, industry analysis and current legislation. Customer contracts are amortised over the useful life of each contract which at acquisition ranged between two and 15 years. Details of the Group’s principal subsidiary, joint venture and unconsolidated structured entity undertakings are set out in note 40. The fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market (level 2, for example over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments. The mortality assumption uses a scheme-specific calculation based on CMI 2015 actuarial tables with an allowance for future longevity improvement.
