processes the use of new technologies helps to improve both the performance and efficiency of our operational assets. south west water once again outperformed its regulatory contract to achieve a sector-leading rore (return on regulated equity) of 12.6%. we continued to drive returns from recycling through broader ‘self-help’ measures that are reducing the cost base and improving utilisation of assets. it is 22 pennon group plc annual report 2017 encouraging to see these initiatives supporting an increasing ebitda. during the year, we completed our shared services review to drive value through efficiency, synergy and best practice. other efficiency successes include the group’s energy trading team which has developed a portfolio management strategy. at viridor, for example, we have increased contracted volumes better aligning with the life cycle of our assets. striking an appropriate balance between operational risk and reward is a key part of our strategy. due for completion by march 2018, mayflower uses the innovative treatment processes of suspended ion exchange, inline coagulation and ceramic membrane filtration. our operations are deeply embedded into local communities and we believe this is one of the reasons ofwat responded so positively to south west water’s latest business plan. furthermore, we recognise that making responsible and sustainable business decisions is critical to achieving long-term investor confidence. our gross greenhouse gas emissions increased by 14%, primarily as a result of viridor’s newly commissioned erfs reaching full operating capacity. ed brings with him a wealth of experience, having spent eight years at the environment agency. good progress has been made since this date in engaging sub-contractors and progressing construction which is expected to be complete within a revised timetable agreed with our customer, glasgow city council. viridor and its joint venture partner john laing have been actively engaging with gmwda as they consider their options. chris loughlin chief executive officer pennon group plc avonmouth erf: investing for growth viridor, with its joint venture partners, is already one of the largest independent power generators from waste. supporting contracts we already have, an additional volume of some 800,000 tonnes is available from local municipal, commercial and industrial sources. south west water’s rore would remain sector leading and by the end of k6 period overall performance will converge. mayflower will be one of only two plants in the world to use transformational ceramic membrane filter technology. this delivered a significant improvement in numeric compliance (the percentage of wastewater treatment works deemed compliant). we could look solely at costly end-of-pipe solutions that might have had less preferable environmental impacts. mayflower will be one of only two plants in the world to use transformational ceramic membrane filter technology. support for those who need it there was also good progress in helping vulnerable customers, including developing affordability schemes. wholesale services, providing water to premises and taking wastewater away, are unaffected, but business customers can choose who provides their retail service. our continued investment in sustainability includes £5 million as part of our downstream thinking programme, which seeks to reduce sewer flooding by improving urban drainage, and £20 million for improvements in bathing waters and shellfish waters around plymouth. we also invested over £1 million to support the exeter flood defence scheme at countess wear wastewater treatment works. 30 pennon group plc annual report 2017 from september 2016 south west water fully engaged in a period of ‘shadow operation’ to ensure that systems and processes were ready for market opening, operating as closely as possible to the market conditions and requirements whilst ensuring customer service levels were maintained. our community regional economy south west water is one of the largest companies in its region. activities included a 2-day wildlife celebration at trebah gardens in cornwall and 55 school visits to wembury marine centre in devon • surf life saving gb – in support of the nippers & youth championships and a three-year graduate lifeguard project programme for young people who will be able to gain a

report 2017 ma t erial r e c y cling facility ener gy r e c o v ery facility 33 strategic report our operations waste management continued strong momentum our energy recovery and waste recycling business enjoyed strong momentum in 2016/17. through our energy recovery facility (erf) portfolio we are delivering on the group’s strategy to invest for growth. this significant investment in environmental infrastructure is helping us to transform our business model with an increasing focus on erfs and recycling. by doing this, we are supporting development of a circular economy with greater resource productivity leading to reduced waste and pollution. our erf portfolio is a significant asset base comprising eight plants in operation with four under construction, including avonmouth. once the total committed erf portfolio is completed in 2020/21 our erfs alone will provide 276mw of energy generation capacity. for the operational plants, our focus was on optimisation and during 2016/17 we achieved average availability in excess of 90%. delays at glasgow’s recycling and renewable energy centre led viridor to terminate the construction contract with interserve. we are implementing that strategy by increasing long-term contracted revenue to match the life cycle of our assets. viridor is in the process of establishing energy efficiency projects at key sites although, in the long term, we believe our energy recovery activities and their related combined heat and power schemes will help to deliver a distinct improvement over landfill. joint ventures the lakeside erf (a 50/50 joint venture with grundon waste management) continued to operate efficiently while viridor laing greater manchester (a joint venture between viridor and john laing infrastructure) is delivering the 25-year greater manchester waste private finance initiative (pfi) contract, which was the uk’s largest waste and energy project entered into in 2009. solid recovered fuel produced from greater manchester’s residual waste is used to generate heat and power at runcorn 1 erf (tpsco, a joint venture between viridor, john laing infrastructure and inovyn). sites have been restored to heathland, grassland, woodland, agriculture, amenity parkland or a combination of these. viridor currently has eight sites that have achieved the wildlife trust’s biodiversity benchmark, which includes two heathland restorations (t atchells and warmwell in dorset) and a grassland restoration that has national significance for birdlife (beddingham in sussex). our 11 educational facilities have received 19,327 visitors over the year and helped deliver 122 outreach events to 6,848 people. (1) we operate active community liaison groups to ensure effective dialogue with the local community and as part of our major construction projects we work hard to ensure maximum benefit is achieved for local communities in the surrounding area. our energy recovery facility (erf) portfolio provides an excellent example of how the group is executing its strategy to invest for growth. this major participation in uk environmental infrastructure is helping us transform our business model with an increasing focus on erfs and recycling. viridor’s revenue decreased by 1.6% to £793.5 million (2015/16 £806.2 million) due to the expected decrease in construction spend on service concession arrangements as plants come on stream and lower landfill volumes, partly offset by the growing contribution of operational erfs. this has been achieved through an increase in profits from viridor, together with continuing strong south west water financial performance and efficient ongoing finance costs across the group. viridor has four further erfs under construction, including avonmouth which we committed to during the year. during the year erf earnings included contractual compensation (1) of £12.7 million, a similar level to previous years. we remain cautious about future recyclate price growth and are not relying on a near-term recovery. landfill ebitda from power generation and waste disposal are down compared to last year by £3.7 million. the group interest rate on average net debt for 2016/17 has slightly increased to 3.4% (2015/16 3.3%) reflecting increases in rpi. following the conclusion of discussions with hmrc, no further amounts are required to be recognised by pennon. in addition investment has been targeted to improve wastewater compliance with process upgrades and improvements at six sites. in addition the joint ventures have non-recourse net debt from third parties (excluding shareholder loans) of which pennon’s share is £194 million. the group manages this risk and accrues for areas of tax uncertainty in line with accounting standards requirements, where appropriate. these principal risks have been considered in preparing the viability statement on page 51. countess wear wastewater treatment works the group faces a number of risks which, if they arise, could affect its ability to achieve its strategic objectives. full engagement in consultations on reform of policy and legislation, helps influence change through effective stakeholder relationships. viridor’s debt collection risk is lower due to the high proportion of public sector accounts. we recognise customer affordability challenges and that given the inability to disconnect domestic customers, some risk of uncollectable debt remains. contingency plans, emergency resources and investment through a planned capital programme mitigates the risks of extreme weather incidents. viridor has in place a regional adverse weather management strategy, aimed at reducing disruption to site operations and transport logistics. targeted improvements made to improve customer service including south west water’s relative industry standing during the k6 period. we need a team with the necessary commercial acumen to help our businesses grow and prosper. appropriate skills and experience in place, with good succession plans to mitigate impact on strategic plan. corruption or loss of data could result in detriment to our customers, financial penalties and reputational damage. ofwat’s principles for holding companies – board leadership, transparency and governance ofwat requires that holding companies manage their risks in such a way that the regulated company is protected from risk elsewhere in the group. they involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. further details of the review, which was facilitated by an external governance consultancy, are set out later in this report. in addition, this year we held a site visit to viridor’s ardley energy recovery facility near oxford. sir john’s commitments are expected to reduce in 2017, when he retires from the board of anglo american plc. prior to joining pennon he was chief operating officer with lloyds register and before that executive chairman of magnox electric plc. all directors are subject to re-election each year in accordance with provision b.7.1 of the uk code. this approach is compatible with ofwat’s principles for holding companies in respect of board leadership, transparency and governance. training consists of attendance at external courses organised by professional advisers and also internal presentations from senior management. we continue to monitor carefully the effectiveness of our external auditor as well as its independence, bearing in mind that it is recognised there is a need to use our external auditor’s firm for certain non-audit services. debbie o’hanlon is the audit partner and has been in that role since ernst & young’s appointment. this approach seeks to ensure that there is a programme of internal and external audit reviews focused on identified key risk areas throughout the group. neil cooper stood down from the committee on 1 april 2016 and steve johnson, who was a member of the south west water sustainability committee, resigned on 28 april 2016 as a non-executive director of south west water. in addition, the south west water sustainability committee continues to provide oversight of south west water’s performance against its sustainability targets and the sustainability activities that are core to the successful delivery of south west water’s k6 business plan 2015-2020. this is consistent with ofwat’s requirement for independent governance of our regulatory business. pennon sustainability report pennon’s sustainability reporting is integrated throughout the strategic report and specifically in the following sections: • chairman’s statement (page 8) • business model (page 14) • strategic priorities (page 16) • our people (page 18) • review of the chief executive officer (page 20) • our operations (pages 26 to 37) south west water and viridor sustainability reports the sustainability report for viridor will be published in june 2017, and south west water will incorporate its sustainability reporting in its company annual performance report and regulatory accounts, which will be published in july 2017. both documents will be available to view at www.pennon-group.co.uk and also on the subsidiaries’ websites. pension provides funding for retirement and aids retention of key skills to assist in meeting the company’s strategic objectives. shareholdings requirements will significantly increase (see below) but are no longer linked to the ltip. in the event that an executive director is required to relocate, relocation benefits may be provided. a portion of any bonus is

(j) impairment of non-financial assets assets with an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment, or whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. non-financial assets other than goodwill that have been impaired are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. where a previously impaired asset or cash generating unit’s recoverable amount is in excess of its carrying amount, previous impairments are reversed to the carrying value that would have expected to be recognised had the original impairment not occurred. following initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method. an impairment loss on any assets dedicated to that contract is also recognised as described in accounting policy (j). (w) transfers of assets from customers where an item of property, plant and equipment that must be used to connect customers to the network is received from a customer, or where cash is received from a customer for the acquisition or construction of such an item, that asset is recorded and measured on initial recognition at its fair value. the fair value of assets on transfer from customers is determined using a cost valuation approach allowing for depreciation. monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated at the closing balance sheet rate. (z) non-underlying items non-underlying items are those that in the directors’ view are required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence to enable a full understanding of the group’s financial performance. i) liquidity risk the group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities which are designed to ensure the group has sufficient available funds for operations and planned expansions equivalent to at least one year’s forecast requirements at all times. details of undrawn committed facilities and short-term facilities are provided in note 28. refinancing risk is managed under a group policy that requires that no more than 20% of group net borrowings should mature in any financial year. consequently the group’s income and cash generated from operations (note 38) are independent of changes in market interest rates. the board has agreed a policy for managing such risk which is controlled through credit limits, counterparty approvals, and rigorous monitoring procedures. at 31 march 2017 the group had cash and facilities, including restricted funds, of £1.4 billion, meeting this objective. the group’s financial instruments are valued principally using level 2 measures as analysed in note 23. the fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market (for example over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. a variety of methods and assumptions are used based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments. estimates are based on factors including historical experience and expectations of future events that management believe to be reasonable. where a restoration provision gives access to future economic benefits, an asset is recognised and depreciated in accordance with the group’s depreciation policy. the mortality assumption uses a scheme-specific calculation based on cmi 2015 actuarial tables with an allowance for future longevity improvement. following engagement and subsequently resolution with hmrc across a number of areas, achieved through a process designed to expedite outstanding tax matters, these items are no longer an area of significant judgement and there is no such range related to ongoing uncertain tax items. judgements impairment of non-financial assets in order to determine whether impairments, or reversals of previous impairments, are required for non-financial assets, the group assesses whether there are any indicators for further impairment or reversal during the year. discount rates are required to be derived independently of the group’s capital structure and those used reflect management’s prudent estimate of a rate that investors would require if they were to choose a similar investment ranging from 6-9% across the cgus business activities. these plans are based on detailed market-by-market forecasts of projected volumes, prices and costs for each business activity. management has determined the value assigned to each assumption based on historical experience, market surveys, industry analysis and current legislation. customer contracts are amortised over the useful life of each contract which at acquisition ranged between two and 15 years. the group’s operating businesses specifically review separate categories of debt to identify an appropriate provision for impairment. at 31 march 2017 the group had interest rate swaps to swap from floating to fixed rate and hedge financial liabilities with a notional value of £1,078.0 million and a weighted average maturity of 2.9 years (2016 £1,078.0 million, with 3.9 years). during the year this derivative position was unwound as set out in note 6. the periods for which cash flow hedges are expected to affect future profit or loss are as follows: due within 1 year £m due between 1 and 2 years £m due between 2 and 5 years £m due over 5 years £m total £m group 31 march 2017 assets 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.1 1.3 liabilities (16.0) (12.1) (11.3) (0.6) (40.0) 31

addition, the group has cash flow hedges that are expected to affect future amounts recognised in property, plant and equipment, amounting to assets of £4.9 million (2016 £2.9 million). the fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market (level 2, for example over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. a variety of methods and assumptions are used based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments. 27.
