ourboardandgovernance our board was chosen to ensure that, as a fast-growing public company, energean demonstrates best practice governance standards and provides sound stewardship. our strategy revolves around identifying and exploring undeveloped areas where we have technical experience of similar geologies to minimise exploration risk. as our track record demonstrates, energean continually assesses ways to create further sustainable value and act upon value- accretive opportunities. chief executive’s review continued 1 strategic report other information financial statements corporate

2018 outlook energean is currently the only upstream company on the lse with considerable exposure to the eastern mediterranean, an area which is attracting increasing interest from global oil and gas majors. energean’s hse record has been an important factor in our successful bids for licences, including karish and tanin. by maintaining a focused approach to this region, we believe the group has developed strong relationships with all key stakeholders. as an independent, locally-based e&p company, energean is well positioned to move swiftly on opportunities in the eastern mediterranean. as our track record demonstrates, energean continually assesses ways to create further sustainable value and act upon value- accretive opportunities. a mou has already been signed between israel, greece, italy and cyprus to support the expected us$6–7 billion pipeline construction. energean’s conservative financial management and its focus on operating costs give the group confidence that it can prosper under a range of oil prices. this approach removes the need to land hydrocarbon liquids in israel, minimising environmental impacts, and will establish a hub through which other discoveries could be developed. in order to achieve final investment decision energean met the following key milestones: x finalisation of field development plan that was submitted to and approved by the israeli authorities x execution of 12 long term gas sales agreements totalling an estimated 61 bcm on an acq basis (up to 74 bcm including or gas supply agreement) with reputable and credible counterparties x agreement of financing terms for a us$1.275m project finance with major international banks. this cash flow together with increased debt facilities funded the group’s us$54 million capital expenditure on exploration and development. these non-ifrs measures include adjusted ebitdax, cost of oil production capital expenditure, cash capex, net debt and gearing ratio are explained overleaf. marine contingency plan we have developed and tested emergency response procedures for handling specific incidents such as oil spills. a key aspect of this is designing and monitoring an internal control system in order to manage these risks. any delay in project delivery could have an impact under the group’s gas sales and purchase contracts. x continuous implementation and monitoring of the company’s it security policy, which includes measures to protect against cyber-attacks. x epsilon development has secured funding to first oil by a combination of ongoing operating cash flow from prinos field and the rbl facility. x bp is an investment grade a- credit rated company with minimal risk of being unable to meet its lifting and payment obligations under the prinos offtake agreement. as and when those provisions are no longer applicable, a more standard equity settlement approach will be adopted. at least one-third of any bonus earned by the executive directors in 2018 will be deferred for two years. no person has any special rights of control over the company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. these policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements unless otherwise stated. where appropriate, the cost of acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. this is usually at the individual royalty, stream, oil and gas or working interest level for each property from which cash inflows are generated. if the group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment. the group does not have any financial liabilities classified as fair value through profit or loss except derivative instruments. the group has considered their carrying value at each balance sheet date and concluded that, based on management’s estimates, sufficient taxable profits will be generated in future years to recover such recognised deferred tax assets. this improvement did not have an effect on the group financial statements: – ifrs 12 disclosure of interests in other entities: the amendments clarify that the disclosure requirements in ifrs 12, other than those of summarised financial information for subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, apply to an entity’s interest in a subsidiary, a joint venture or an associate that is classified as held for sale, held for distribution, or as discontinued operations in accordance with ifrs 5. accounting policies continued strategic report other information financial statements
