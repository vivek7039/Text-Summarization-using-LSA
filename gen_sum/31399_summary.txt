OurBoardandgovernance Our Board was chosen to ensure that, as a fast-growing public Company, Energean demonstrates best practice governance standards and provides sound stewardship. This strategy is underpinned by our key competitive strengths: X We are an experienced offshore operator, operating the majority of assets in our portfolio X We are well-positioned as an independent, Eastern Mediterranean E&P to move quickly in an increasingly active region X We have a track record of value creation through timely acquisitions and efficient development X We have the depth and diversity across a series of assets at various stages of development to position us as a full-cycle, sustainable business X We have an experienced management team, with an international oil industry track record, who are significantly invested in Energean X We have a strong health and safety track record X We have world class industry partners such as TechnipFMC, BP and Repsol and strong financial capacity 1 Maximising output and cash flow from our producing assets The Prinos and Prinos North oil fields, offshore North Eastern Greece, are low-cost producing assets that have already delivered 115 million barrels of oil to date. At the time of acquisition, Karish and Tanin were stranded assets with no gas contracts in place. Our strategy revolves around identifying and exploring undeveloped areas where we have technical experience of similar geologies to minimise exploration risk. As our track record demonstrates, Energean continually assesses ways to create further sustainable value and act upon value- accretive opportunities.

Energean’s HSE record has been an important factor in our successful bids for licences, including Karish and Tanin. By maintaining a focused approach to this region, we believe the Group has developed strong relationships with all key stakeholders. As an independent, locally-based E&P company, Energean is well positioned to move swiftly on opportunities in the Eastern Mediterranean. At the time Energean acquired them, Karish and Tanin were stranded assets with no gas contracts in place. As our track record demonstrates, Energean continually assesses ways to create further sustainable value and act upon value- accretive opportunities. Strong health & safety record Energean’s exemplary HSE performance is a key aspect of our overall success. These are on a par with recent oil discoveries in northern Albania, such as the onshore Shpirag-2 discovery. To date, over 5 billion barrels of oil in place have been discovered within this prolific carbonate play. A MoU has already been signed between Israel, Greece, Italy and Cyprus to support the expected US$6–7 billion pipeline construction. Energean’s conservative financial management and its focus on operating costs give the Group confidence that it can prosper under a range of oil prices. This approach removes the need to land hydrocarbon liquids in Israel, minimising environmental impacts, and will establish a hub through which other discoveries could be developed. This requires the installation of a new drilling platform plus three 3.5km long pipelines connecting it to Prinos. Options to extend the existing B platform were generated and will be compared with a new bridge-linked jacket. In order to achieve Final Investment Decision Energean met the following key milestones: X finalisation of Field Development Plan that was submitted to and approved by the Israeli authorities X execution of 12 long term gas sales agreements totalling an estimated 61 BCM on an ACQ basis (up to 74 BCM including OR gas supply agreement) with reputable and credible counterparties X agreement of financing terms for a US$1.275m Project Finance with major international banks. Cash from operating activities Net cash flows from operating activities increased to US$29.1 million for the reporting period (2016: US$15.2 million) and was primarily attributable to an increase in the realised oil price and decrease in inventory balance. This cash flow together with increased debt facilities funded the Group’s US$54 million capital expenditure on exploration and development. These non-IFRS measures include adjusted EBITDAX, cost of oil production capital expenditure, cash capex, net debt and gearing ratio are explained overleaf. Biodiversityprotection We aim to conserve the biological diversity of terrestrial, marine and avian migratory species throughout their range. Marine contingency plan We have developed and tested emergency response procedures for handling specific incidents such as oil spills. A key aspect of this is designing and monitoring an internal control system in order to manage these risks.

Where appropriate, the cost of acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. Strategic report Other information Financial statements Corporate governance Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 91 90 Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 Financial statements continued Accounting policies continued 3.7 Impairment of non-financial assets At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its depreciable property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. This is usually at the individual royalty, stream, oil and gas or working interest level for each property from which cash inflows are generated. If the Group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment. The Group does not have any financial liabilities classified as fair value through profit or loss except derivative instruments. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. This assessment is based on all available evidence and, where appropriate, in the light of external advice. The Group has considered their carrying value at each balance sheet date and concluded that, based on management’s estimates, sufficient taxable profits will be generated in future years to recover such recognised deferred tax assets. 3.19 Equity, reserves and dividend payments Share capital represents the nominal (par) value of shares that have been issued. The specific issues where diversity in practice existed relate to: the existence of a deductible temporary difference upon a decrease in fair value, recovering an asset for more than its carrying amount, probable future taxable profit and combined versus separate assessment. X IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group’s carrying amount of oil and gas properties for all periods presented is shown in Note 6. This assessment is based on all available evidence and, where appropriate, in the light of external advice. The Group has considered their carrying value at each balance sheet date and concluded that, based on management’s estimates, sufficient taxable profits will be generated in future years to recover such recognised deferred tax assets. There are no recoverable costs associated with West Kom Ombo and the asset has been fully written off in 2017. West Kom Ombo is an exploration block in Upper Egypt, the licence for which expired on 2 October 2017. There are no recoverable costs associated with West Kom Ombo and the asset has been fully written off in 2017. The credit quality of non-trade financial receivables that are neither past due nor impaired is assessed by reference to historical information about counterparty default rates. 18.1 Provision for retirement benefits As at 31 December 2017 (US$ 000) 2016 (US$ 000) Defined benefit obligation 3,288 2,425 Provision for retirement benefits recognised 3,288 2,425 Allocated as: Non-current portion 3,288 2,425 3,288 2,425 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Strategic report Other information Financial statements Corporate governance Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 123 122 Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 Financial statements continued 18.2 Defined benefit obligation As at 31 December 2017 (US$ 000) 2016 (US$ 000) At 1 January 2,425 2,115 Current service cost 296 253 Interest cost 43 39 Extra payments or expenses 34 43 Actuarial losses – from changes in financial assumptions 258 148 Benefits paid (86) (89) Exchange differences 318 (84) Total 3,288 2,425 The average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2017 is 25 years (year ended 31 December 2016: 25 years).
