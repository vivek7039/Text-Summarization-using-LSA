chairman’s statement embarking on an exciting chapter in our history dear shareholder, i was delighted to join the board of energean as chairman in july 2017. since then, i have been impressed by how much the company has achieved in a few months in running the day-to-day business, making significant progress on both the karish and tanin project and the prinos basin expansion, and, most recently, becoming a premium listed company on the london stock exchange (‘lse’) in march 2018, the first significant european oil and gas e&p listing since 2014 and the largest ever primary raise for a premium-listed e&p company on the lse. ourboardandgovernance our board was chosen to ensure that, as a fast-growing public company, energean demonstrates best practice governance standards and provides sound stewardship. the past decade has been one of considerable growth, learning, investment and achievement for energean. this strategy is underpinned by our key competitive strengths: x we are an experienced offshore operator, operating the majority of assets in our portfolio x we are well-positioned as an independent, eastern mediterranean e&p to move quickly in an increasingly active region x we have a track record of value creation through timely acquisitions and efficient development x we have the depth and diversity across a series of assets at various stages of development to position us as a full-cycle, sustainable business x we have an experienced management team, with an international oil industry track record, who are significantly invested in energean x we have a strong health and safety track record x we have world class industry partners such as technipfmc, bp and repsol and strong financial capacity 1 maximising output and cash flow from our producing assets the prinos and prinos north oil fields, offshore north eastern greece, are low-cost producing assets that have already delivered 115 million barrels of oil to date. at the time of acquisition, karish and tanin were stranded assets with no gas contracts in place. our strategy revolves around identifying and exploring undeveloped areas where we have technical experience of similar geologies to minimise exploration risk. as our track record demonstrates, energean continually assesses ways to create further sustainable value and act upon value- accretive opportunities. chief executive’s review continued 1 strategic report other information financial statements corporate governance energean oil & gas plc annual report 2017 09 08 energean oil & gas plc annual report 2017 chief executive’s review continued a sustainable growth story karish & tanin project milestones 2018 outlook energean is currently the only upstream company on the lse with considerable exposure to the eastern mediterranean, an area which is attracting increasing interest from global oil and gas majors. energean’s hse record has been an important factor in our successful bids for licences, including karish and tanin. exploring the eastern mediterranean with low commitment, high impact assets in greece, montenegro and israel transformational development of us$1.6 billion project in israel multiple growth opportunities in a highly prospective region material and de-risked development project low-cost efficient production base production from low cost assets in greece low-cost producer with stable cash flow historically, we have been able to respond to oil price volatility by reducing our cost of production per barrel (excluding depreciation) at prinos, largely through increased production. strategically positioned in an increasingly active region our operations are focused on the eastern mediterranean, with the most significant assets located in israel and greece, which are both oecd countries and strategically attractive for investment. by maintaining a focused approach to this region, we believe the group has developed strong relationships with all key stakeholders. as an independent, locally-based e&p company, energean is well positioned to move swiftly on opportunities in the eastern mediterranean. at the time energean acquired them, karish and tanin were stranded assets with no gas contracts in place. as our track record demonstrates, energean continually assesses ways to create further sustainable value and act upon value- accretive opportunities. strong health & safety record energean’s exemplary hse performance is a key aspect of our overall success. these are on a par with recent oil discoveries in northern albania, such as the onshore shpirag-2 discovery. to date, over 5 billion barrels of oil in place have been discovered within this prolific carbonate play. our opportunity energean is well positioned to target and compete for opportunities in this region. increasing m&a activity the eastern mediterranean has recently received investment from world class companies. a mou has already been signed between israel, greece, italy and cyprus to support the expected us$6–7 billion pipeline construction. energean’s conservative financial management and its focus on operating costs give the group confidence that it can prosper under a range of oil prices. the fdp for phase 1 of the project was approved by the israeli government on 27 august 2017, with the final investment decision taken in the first quarter of 2018 and first gas expected in

development well pa-36) contingent resources were recognised and a development well is being planned for inclusion in the ongoing prinos infill drilling campaign. in western greece, energean successfully farmed out 60% of our interest and operatorship for our ioannina and aitoloakarnania blocks, onshore western greece, to repsol in september 2017, who will carry 90% of the gross exploration costs, up to us$49.9 million. this approach removes the need to land hydrocarbon liquids in israel, minimising environmental impacts, and will establish a hub through which other discoveries could be developed. this requires the installation of a new drilling platform plus three 3.5km long pipelines connecting it to prinos. options to extend the existing b platform were generated and will be compared with a new bridge-linked jacket. this new facility will be required after the drilling of epsilon development wells is completed. in order to achieve final investment decision energean met the following key milestones: x finalisation of field development plan that was submitted to and approved by the israeli authorities x execution of 12 long term gas sales agreements totalling an estimated 61 bcm on an acq basis (up to 74 bcm including or gas supply agreement) with reputable and credible counterparties x agreement of financing terms for a us$1.275m project finance with major international banks. cash from operating activities net cash flows from operating activities increased to us$29.1 million for the reporting period (2016: us$15.2 million) and was primarily attributable to an increase in the realised oil price and decrease in inventory balance. this cash flow together with increased debt facilities funded the group’s us$54 million

matters. we believe that adjusted total assets provides us with a suitable basis for setting materiality for immature emerging oil and gas exploration and production companies, providing a reliable measure to assess the size of the group’s operations. during the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and no changes were made. these policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements unless otherwise stated. strategic report other information financial statements corporate governance energean oil & gas plc annual report

comprehensive income (oci) are attributed to owners of the group and to the non- controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. where appropriate, the cost of acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under ifrs 3 business combinations (revised 2008) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that: x deferred tax assets or liabilities, and assets or liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements, are recognised and measured in accordance with ias 12, ‘income taxes’ and ias 19, ‘employee benefits’ respectively; x liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree or share-based payment arrangements of the group entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree are measured in accordance with ifrs 2 share-based payment at the acquisition date; and x non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with ifrs 5 ‘non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations’, are measured at fair value less costs to sell. 3.6 intangible assets computer software costs that are directly associated with identifiable and unique computer software products controlled by the group and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year are recognised as intangible assets. costs

group reviews the carrying amounts of its depreciable property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. this is usually at the individual royalty, stream, oil and gas or working interest level for each property from which cash inflows are generated. assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. the group has not designated any financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss. if the group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment. the group does not have any financial liabilities classified as fair value through profit or loss except derivative instruments. 3.10 fair value measurement fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. this generally occurs when product is physically transferred into a vessel, pipe or other delivery mechanism. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. this assessment is based on all available evidence and, where appropriate, in the light of external advice. the group has considered their carrying value at each balance sheet date and concluded that, based on management’s estimates, sufficient taxable profits will be generated in future years to recover such recognised deferred tax assets. 3.19 equity, reserves and dividend payments share capital represents the nominal (par) value of shares that have been issued. the specific issues where diversity in practice existed relate to: the existence of a deductible temporary difference upon a decrease in fair value, recovering an asset for more than its carrying amount, probable future taxable profit and combined versus separate assessment. this improvement did not have an effect on the group financial
