people on our sites every day. i believe this is an example of ibstock continually pushing the boundaries to protect our employees. our new roof tile line at leighton buzzard commenced commissioning in late 2016 and has improved its performance during 2017 . this has been a massive project to deliver and i am pleased that we achieved it with only one lost time accident over the entire two-year

a growth strategy underpinned by organic growth opportunities in uk clay and concrete products. we will shortly complete our ceo succession plan with the business in a good position. as we moved into the spring, it became clear that our markets had shrugged-off brexit – economic forecasters had been overly pessimistic – and our volumes were progressing strongly into the new build sector in particular. consequently, i am very pleased that we still managed to record a small improvement in our overall net promoter score this year. ibstock’s investment in new additional roof tile capacity for its forticrete subsidiary has proven to be timely. on this basis, we entered 2018 with the plant performing to expectation and providing product into a market showing strong demand growth. supreme also installed its first new fully automated concrete casting machine to manufacture fence posts, gravel board and rail products. we began 2018 with new capacity at a time when it is clearly much

our operations, constantly looking for more efficient ways of doing things and embracing technology wherever possible. since 2012 we have enhanced this programme through central co-ordination and standardisation to ensure all apprentices are trained to a consistent standard, including specific sign off within the organisation over and above that of the training provider. employee engagement delighted customers can only be delivered through highly competent, engaged and diligent people. this internal network is intended to ensure women across our companies feel supported in achieving their career aspirations, through peer support and focused coaching, as appropriate. the award recognises ibstock’s commitment, engagement and support in helping jewson to improve its brick offering for customers. also, to help us encourage the highest standards of ethical behaviour, corporate governance and accountability in our business activities, the group operates an anonymous whistleblowing hotline, which is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. this sets out several case studies from across the group illustrating how we have engaged with local communities. the group has used co 2 per tonne of production as its intensity ratio as this is the most appropriate and relevant factor associated with our activities and should provide an appropriate basis on which to compare trends over time. in the uk, the group predominantly outsources its haulage to two contractors who, as significant companies in their own right, maintain high standards of road safety and strive to minimise their own environmental impact. these are set out within our environmental report, which the group issued most recently in may 2017 . mitigation the group has a service‑ led ethos with many top customer relationships lasting over 40 years. the group’s customer focus is supported by a commitment to quality, service and consistency. management do not underestimate the potential impact that

personal injury and other damages. apprenticeship schemes are in operation with a yearly intake across the business (engineering and technical based). all accredited staff undergo rigorous training programmes on quality and the group’s technical teams carry out regular testing of all of our products to provide full technical data on our product range. – liquidity risk – insufficient funds could result in the group being unable to fund its operations. strategy link – 11 cyber security recent high‑ profile attacks on companies across a number of industry sectors (including one of our own major customers) have highlighted the damage that can now be caused by hackers and cyber terrorists. – interest rate risk – the group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings. following closure, the scheme’s statement of investment principles, which documents the scheme’s investment strategy to provide appropriate security and achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return, was subject to review. we are now well-placed to benefit from the additional capacity available against a backdrop of continuing favourable market conditions. we have amended our roce calculation during 2017 in light of the recent guidance on apms from the frc and esma regulatory bodies and in order to provide a clearer, more comparable definition with other companies. financial review group results we are now well-placed to benefit from the additional capacity available against a backdrop of continuing favourable market conditions. taxation payments in the prior year were reduced due to tax relief on refinancing expenses incurred in 2015. a net working capital balance at 31 december 2017 of £48.2 million compares to £46.1 million at 31 december 2016. despite inventory destocking within our uk clay operations, the movement reflects increased inventory in our us operations and uk concrete products (particularly roof tiles) as management sought to build inventory levels towards the year end. these covenant requirements are consistent with our prior debt facility and the group remains significantly within both limits. all members consented to this change and, from 1 february 2017 , have joined the uk defined contribution scheme. there have been no other material related party transactions during the year ended 31 december 2017 . the group’s risk management approach together with these principal risks and mitigating actions are set out on pages 32 to 37 . i am pleased to confirm that we have achieved full compliance with the uk corporate governance code throughout 2017 . your board manages the company in a transparent, open and honest manner, which we achieve by maintaining high standards of corporate governance. as announced on 11

its first years as a public listed company. the board is required to make a number of specific statements on certain governance matters. permission must be sought from the chairman before other external directorships, which may affect existing time commitments, are accepted. training is made available to members of the board in accordance with their requirements. independent external legal

has assessed the group’s risk appetite, which is set to balance opportunities for business development and growth in areas of potentially higher risk, whilst maintaining our reputation and high levels of customer satisfaction. this considered any specific areas of risk identified by either party in formulating the schedule. accounting and key areas of judgement a key factor in the integrity of financial statements is ensuring that suitable accounting policies are adopted and applied consistently on a year on year basis. the audit committee specifically uses the audit planning meetings in may and november each year to consider proposed accounting treatments for major transactions, significant reporting judgements and key assumptions related to those judgements. the group maintains a record of all employees who have received this guidance and training. it’s all about the people tim senavaitis factory manager, mid-atlantic plant, glen-gery tim joined glen-gery as an engineering

expenditure within ‘mineral reserves’ commences when there is a high degree of confidence that the group will determine that a project is commercially viable, i.e., the project will provide a satisfactory return relative to its perceived risks, and therefore it is considered probable that future economic benefits will flow to the group. mineral reserves may be declared for an undeveloped project before its commercial viability has been fully determined. intangible assets separately acquired brands and non-contractual customer relationships are shown at historical cost. prior impairments of non-financial assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date. cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition. if collection is expected in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. detailed descriptions of apms used throughout these financial statements are included within note 3. apms used by the group are generally not defined under ifrss and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. however, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. due to the inherent uncertainty in making these critical judgements and estimates, actual outcomes could be different. in making these estimates and assumptions, management considers advice provided by external advisers, such as actuaries. a requirement for an impairment test also arises when a non- current asset is classified as being held for sale, at which time it must be remeasured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. it is not intended that apms are a substitute for, or superior to, statutory measures. year ended 31 december 2017 uk £’000 us £’000 unallocated £’000 total £’000 clay revenue 265,358 88,994 – 354,352 concrete revenue 97,231
