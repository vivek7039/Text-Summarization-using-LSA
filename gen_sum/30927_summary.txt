Succession planning has always been  a high priority for us, including my own,  as I will reach the age of 60 in 2019. I am  delighted that Joe Hudson joined Ibstock  in early 2018 to allow a thorough handover  of responsibilities (see inset on page 14). Our new roof tile line at Leighton Buzzard  commenced commissioning in late 2016  and has improved its performance during  2017 . This has been a massive  project to deliver and I am pleased that we  achieved it with only one lost time accident  over the entire two-year build programme  involving several million man hours. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 10 Ibstock plc It’s all about the people Mark Brind Production Director,   Forticrete  Mark may be relatively new to  Forticrete having joined at the  beginning of 2017 but he brings over  20 years’ experience employed within  tier 1 automotive manufacturers. It’s all about the people Julie Lee Northern National Sales Manager,  Supreme   Julie has worked for Supreme  Concrete for 10 years and is  passionate about customer service  and developing long-term working  relationships with her customers in  the North. This project was  completed in 2017 and is at an advanced  stage of commissioning with blue bricks  being produced to meet customer demand. Wayne Sheppard welcomes our  new Chief Executive designate   I am delighted that Joe Hudson joined  Ibstock in early 2018. Joe has very  relevant experience in building materials,  most recently with Lafarge Holcim where  he was responsible for their UK cement,  Bradstone paving and concrete block  businesses. Chief Executive designate Chief Executive’s statement continued Annual Report and Accounts 2017 14 Ibstock plc Summary Supported by strong market  fundamentals, Ibstock continues to follow  a growth strategy underpinned by organic  growth opportunities in UK clay and  concrete products. Finally I should like to thank all of my  Ibstock colleagues for their hard work and  commitment over many years that has  been instrumental in the Group’s strong  performance. Consequently, I am  very pleased that we still managed to  record a small improvement in our overall  Net Promoter Score this year. Ibstock’s investment in new  additional roof tile capacity for its Forticrete  subsidiary has proven to be timely. On this basis, we  entered 2018 with the plant performing to  expectation and providing product into a  market showing strong demand growth. Supreme also installed its first new fully  automated concrete casting machine to  manufacture fence posts, gravel board  and rail products. We began 2018  with new capacity at a time when it is  clearly much needed to support strong  market demand.

The  ‘grey’ concrete products, such as fence  posts, are made using a semi-dry or wet  cast process. As a  full-range supplier, our concrete businesses  provide customers with broad product set  upon which to base their buying decisions. Nine Ibstock Brick projects were  recognised for their commitment to  Health and Safety at the British Ceramic  Confederation’s Pledge awards in  October 2017. Additionally, production  ramped up following the installation of  a new bespoke machine at our Barnwell  concrete factory in Cambridgeshire. We will take the opportunity  to further develop our emphasis on  people by including a clearly defined  health and wellbeing programme. Additionally, communities  in which we operate, our  lenders, pension schemes,  governments and other  regulatory bodies have an  important relationship with  the Group. This internal  network is intended to ensure women  across our companies feel supported in  achieving their career aspirations, through  peer support and focused coaching, as  appropriate. The award recognises  Ibstock’s commitment, engagement and  support in helping Jewson to improve its  brick offering for customers. This sets  out several case studies from across the  Group illustrating how we have engaged  with local communities.

It is the Committee’s intention that commitments made in line with its policies prior to Admission will be honoured, even if satisfaction  of such commitments is made post the Company’s first AGM following Admission and may be inconsistent with policy. Agreed upon  procedures were performed by a local audit  team in respect of the US trading component,  Glen-Gery. Mineral reserves may be declared for an undeveloped project  before its commercial viability has been fully determined. Prior  impairments of non-financial assets (other than goodwill) are  reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date. Due to the inherent uncertainty in making these critical  judgements and estimates, actual outcomes could be different. A requirement for an impairment test also arises when a non- current asset is classified as being held for sale, at which time it  must be remeasured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair  value less cost to sell.
