statement the underlying business performance is strong and we remain confident in the long-term prospects for the group. partially offsetting this was strong growth in dash cams, in-car connectivity equipment and car cleaning products. our service capability continues to be a key focus for us, with the gears training programme providing depth and breadth of experience for colleagues, supporting our ability to establish halfords as a differentiated, service-led specialist retailer. t o benefit colleagues, we have introduced a new technician pay grading system this year, to reward both teamwork and training. we see a number of sales and cost synergies as well as the opportunity for halfords to trial an innovative mobile delivery proposition for motoring services, which fits squarely with our focus on improving our service and convenience credentials. taking these factors into account we anticipate fy18 profit to be in line with current market expectations. this, combined with our leading positions in fragmented markets, gives us clear competitive advantages and a solid platform from which to drive sustainable long-term growth. there is no single equivalent competitor of halfords in the uk and these motoring markets are highly fragmented. our own market research indicates that 80% of halfords customers want advice or service with their purchase. we are a market leading retailer of in-car cameras (“dash cams”) which continued to grow fast in fy17. we are also uniquely placed to offer a fitting service for these products; with around 40% of dash cam sales fitted into the car. as a business-to-consumer company, we need strong omnichannel exposure to connect with customers and our wider stakeholder audience. • cycle to work policy campaigning • dab radio

agile approach to web development, whereby we complemented the core digital team at our support centre in redditch with a separate web development team in central london. this programme was a success with positive customer feedback and sales uplifts that justified the capital investment. however we are encouraged by the initial response, both in terms of customer feedback and sales uplifts.

alternative earnings per share measure, with profit adjusted for non-recurring items. the income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to sterling at an average exchange rate. foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and a separate component of equity. the group pays fixed contributions and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further

amortised over three to five years depending on the estimated useful economic life. provision is also made for onerous contracts in loss-making stores and autocentres which management do not expect to become profitable. the company is fully committed to complying with all of its tax payment and reporting obligations. product rights of £0.2m, which are fully amortised, have been included within
