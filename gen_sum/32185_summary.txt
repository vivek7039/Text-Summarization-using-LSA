This was also confirmed by an increased internally measured engagement score, improved customer ratings and lower colleague turnover. T o benefit colleagues, we have introduced a new technician pay grading system this year, to reward both teamwork and training. This, combined with our leading positions in fragmented markets, gives us clear competitive advantages and a solid platform from which to drive sustainable long-term growth. There is no single equivalent competitor of Halfords in the UK and these motoring markets are highly fragmented. We are a market leading retailer of in-car cameras (“dash cams”) which continued to grow fast in FY17. We are also uniquely placed to offer a fitting service for these products; with around 40% of dash cam sales fitted into the car. As a business-to-consumer company, we need strong omnichannel exposure to connect with customers and our wider stakeholder audience. • Cycle to Work policy campaigning • DAB Radio working groups • Driver training and vehicle safety enhancements • Engaging with VOSA, DVLA, TSI, ASA and HSE • Transport policies and schemes • CO 2 reduction strategies 14 Halfords Group plc Integrated Annual Report for the period ended 31 March 2017 Halfords Annual Report 2017.indd 14 07/06/2017 16:36:21 slugline of Retail store management vacancies filled internally Fast Fact * Nearly 50% we won Retail Week’ s “CSR Initiative of the Y ear” for our work at Onley prison Fast Fact * CSR Achievements Read more on Corporate Social Responsibility on pages 30 to 35 STRATEGIC REPORT / OUR GOVERNANCE / FINANCIAL STATEMENTS / SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 15 STOCK CODE: HFD halfords.annualreport2017.com Halfords Annual Report 2017.indd 15 07/06/2017 16:36:27 slugline Our Strategy In November 2015 we launched the Moving Up a Gear strategy This strategy is an evolution from the previous Getting Into Gear strategy and comprises five pillars. T o grow the dividend every year with cover of around 2x underlying earnings on average over time. We launched our new brand positioning in June 2016, under the strapline of Halfords - For Life’s Journeys. The new campaign is helping to drive a clearer understanding of Halfords’ offer, particularly amongst younger customers. We will be launching many more in-store services across both Motoring and Cycling in the months ahead. The outcome is that all store colleagues will be qualified to serve customers confidently and receive a pay award. The previous store programme had been successful, delivering good sales uplifts, and therefore did not require fundamental changes. Building on this success we will continue to roll out more stores and further develop the online presence. This programme was a success with positive customer feedback and sales uplifts that justified the capital investment. Examples of initiatives completed during the year include: • A new stock put-away process, saving around 3 hours per store per week; • Installing a Click & Collect cabinet at the front of shops, saving time for customers and colleagues; • “Jade”, a secure tool box positioned in the car park, saving around 2.5 hours per week for colleagues; and • Rolling-out colleague headsets, enabling colleagues to share knowledge, free-up time and improve customer service. c.10,000 Number of colleagues 80% Employee Engagement Score 33% Retail Colleague turnover Our Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) strategy centres on four key areas: Colleagues: finding, supporting and developing great people throughout their Halfords journey Community: helping to keep families safer on their journeys and encouraging an active lifestyle Environmental Management: managing our impact on the environment in a responsible and ethical manner Responsible Trading: building and maintaining the highest standards amongst our suppliers Developing, rewarding and retaining our colleagues, ensuring they are fully engaged to drive our long term sustainable growth ambitions Colleagues Awards: The CSR Policy is available at www.halfordscompany.com/investors/governance 30 Halfords Group plc Integrated Annual Report for the period ended 31 March 2017 Halfords Annual Report 2017.indd 30 07/06/2017 16:37:12 The scheme opened my eyes to a possible career path.

In seeking to ensure that CSR initiatives are increasingly integrated into our business we have developed the programme significantly from when I gave my first report last year. There have been three such meetings in the period ended 31 March 2017 and nothing of note was reported. Consideration has been given to ensuring that cash flow models, discount rates, sensitivity analysis and centre profitability are all reasonable. Remuneration arrangements are set at levels appropriate to achieving this goal without paying more than is considered necessary. Executives will be required to retain 75% of any post-tax shares that vest under share incentive plans until this shareholding is reached. Deferred awards normally vest three years from award (or after such other period as the Committee determines) and have no additional performance conditions. Performance Measures For 2017 awards will vest subject to the achievement of stretching Revenue and EPS growth targets. Where appropriate, some groups of colleagues are eligible for a quarterly or full year bonus, although the type, limits and performance conditions vary according to job level.

Executives will be required to retain 75% of their vested shares under the Deferred Bonus Plan and PSP until this guideline is met. Non-Executive Directors do not have a shareholding guideline but they are encouraged to buy shares in the Company.
