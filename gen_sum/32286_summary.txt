governance strategic report chairman’s statement bpha’s success has helped attract good people and good people are key to continued success. paul high, a co-opted independent board member with extensive sector house building experience, has been appointed to chair this committee. as detailed on page 7, we have established a new business unit operational model that has been designed to be both scalable and modular. fundamental to all of this are the many different people who play key roles within bpha. we continue to operate within a tight geographical area between oxford and cambridge, centred on bedford. £ 08 this year, we have reviewed our corporate values to ensure they fit the future direction of bpha. • effective relationships – we take responsibility for our actions and look to achieve more by working effectively with others. creating the right culture we work from modern open-plan offices which enables closer collaborative working across departments. we have an employee management forum which provides opportunity for engagement and consultation with representative members of staff. during this time, she has completed two housing qualifications paid for by us, and she became a home processing manager in june 2017. annie says: “i love working for bpha because of the people, not just my colleagues but our customers as well. we believe good board leadership is all about constructive challenge and strategic thinking, focusing energies on always looking a little further into the future. it’s about really ensuring that all angles have been looked at and always pushing to see if our performance could be better. jill says: “i’ve been pleased to see the level of commercial awareness and corporate efficiency at bpha. across our core operating area, high property values make it difficult for aspiring home owners to get on the property ladder, ensuring high demand for our shared ownership properties which in turn supports the development of much needed affordable homes. working closely with bedford borough council, it was recognised that affordable shared ownership properties offered the best value for money alternative. bedford faces a shortage of affordable housing and, in this town alone, it is estimated that another 5,000 new homes are needed by 2031. hermitage road, earith, cambridgeshire rural exception scheme hermitage road is scheme of 11 new bungalows with private gardens and car parking provision. bushmead homes, our build for private sale subsidiary, is continuing to grow at a measured pace but without creating an undue level of sales risk exposure. we are fortunate to have significant recycled capital grant funds (rcgf), totalling £10.8m (2016: £19.2m), which can provide future subsidy. over the same period, despite growth in stock and associated funding, interest costs are little changed. the board has concluded that we have been successful in delivering vfm, having continued to maintain tight control of operational costs, invest in improvements to service delivery and existing stock, deliver new homes and restructure our funding at lower cost. over the past year, we have delivered vfm across three areas: return on assets • developed and acquired 508 homes at a cost of £57.3m. the independent board members are drawn from a wide background bringing together professional, commercial and local experience. we have insurance policies which indemnify our directors, officers and committee members against liability when acting for us. the board has reserved to itself, through its terms of reference, essential functions and significant matters which cannot be delegated. the service improvement panel comprises residents and operates independently to ensure we meet our co-regulatory requirements. governance report continued the board is supported by committees whose members have relevant specialist skills and experience. the board receives minutes of all audit and risk committee meetings, which normally take place four times a year. this approach is underpinned by the iso 9001 registration, which provides a recognised quality assurance standard for managing and auditing our operational procedures. 35 report and financial statements 2017 financial statements additional information strategic report governance likelihood scoring impact scoring assurance we have a framework in place to provide assurance that risks are properly managed: 1–2 rare 3–4 unlikely 7–8 likely 5–6 possible 9–10 almost certain 1–2 very low 3–4 low 7–8 high 5–6 medium 9–10 very high when scoring we consider all possible impacts including impact on service and people, reputation and ﬁnancial. training includes consideration of how current or proposed activities fall within bpha’s defined risk appetite. for example, during 2016/17 we have implemented enhanced firewalls, improved website security and introduced email screening software. finance and treasury 2 cautious we are prepared to accept the possibility of some well managed risk in this area. we will therefore accept some clearly defined risk but only on the basis of well assessed opportunities within a controlled and measurable framework. revenue grants are recognised when the conditions for receipt of agreed grant funding have been met. rental income is recognised from the point when properties under development reach practical completion or otherwise become available for letting. major components are treated as separable assets and depreciated over their expected useful economic lives as detailed below: assets years structure 100 kitchens 20 bathrooms 30 heating systems – boilers 12 heating systems – radiators 30 roofs 60 windows and doors 30 electrics 30 lift – refurbishment 20 lift – renewal 60 freehold land is not depreciated. fair value is determined annually by appropriately qualified external valuers and is derived from current market rents and investment property yields for comparable properties, adjusted if necessary for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specific asset. net realisable value is based on estimated sales price after allowing for all further costs of completion and disposal. interest-bearing borrowings classified as basic financial instruments – recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the straight line method, less any impairment losses. 53 report and financial statements 2017 financial statements
