Paul High, a co-opted independent Board member with extensive sector house building experience, has been appointed to Chair this committee. As detailed on page 7, we have established a new business unit operational model that has been designed to be both scalable and modular. Fundamental to all of this are the many different people who play key roles within bpha. We are a strong, financially viable organisation with an efficient operating model that delivers Value for Money, and we are well placed to continue supplying new homes to meet the strong housing demand in our geographic area. We continue to operate within a tight geographical area between Oxford and Cambridge, centred on Bedford. £ 08 This year, we have reviewed our corporate values to ensure they fit the future direction of bpha. • Effective relationships – We take responsibility for our actions and look to achieve more by working effectively with others. Creating the right culture We work from modern open-plan offices which enables closer collaborative working across departments. We have an Employee Management Forum which provides opportunity for engagement and consultation with representative members of staff. Annie Lougheed Annie joined us in 2004 as a Homeless Admin Assistant and has risen through the ranks in various housing roles since then, including Housing/Income Officer, Family Intervention Case Worker, Assistant Housing Manager and Project Manager. Annie says: “I love working for bpha because of the people, not just my colleagues but our customers as well. He became a Senior IT Support Analyst, and was then promoted to IT Service Desk Lead in December 2016, with responsibility for Help Desk service and supporting the transition of staff to mobile working through better technology. Outside of work and family commitments she joined Bedfordshire Police as a Special Constable in November 2016. We believe good Board leadership is all about constructive challenge and strategic thinking, focusing energies on always looking a little further into the future. It’s about really ensuring that all angles have been looked at and always pushing to see if our performance could be better. Jill says: “I’ve been pleased to see the level of commercial awareness and corporate efficiency at bpha. And I’ve seen first-hand how customers are at the heart of everything bpha does. He was appointed as a civil servant Senior Policy Advisor to Tony Blair for Environment, Planning and Housing in 2002. Across our core operating area, high property values make it difficult for aspiring home owners to get on the property ladder, ensuring high demand for our shared ownership properties which in turn supports the development of much needed affordable homes. The newbuild scheme of affordable homes is nestled within a larger mixed tenure residential development. Working closely with Bedford Borough Council, it was recognised that affordable shared ownership properties offered the best Value for Money alternative. Bedford faces a shortage of affordable housing and, in this town alone, it is estimated that another 5,000 new homes are needed by 2031. Our development model enables us to grow both bottom line surplus and balance sheet strength. Bushmead Homes, our build for private sale subsidiary, is continuing to grow at a measured pace but without creating an undue level of sales risk exposure. This level of delivery has been consistently achieved over the five year period from 2013 to 2017. We are fortunate to have significant Recycled Capital Grant Funds (RCGF), totalling £10.8m (2016: £19.2m), which can provide future subsidy. Whilst such surpluses help fund further development, our business model does not rely upon this. Over the same period, despite growth in stock and associated funding, interest costs are little changed. Our total assets less current liabilities have reached £1,118m (2016: £1,097m) and this has risen steadily from £909m in 2013. Accordingly bpha’s rating was restated as A+ in line with our stand-alone credit profile (SACP). The Board has concluded that we have been successful in delivering VfM, having continued to maintain tight control of operational costs, invest in improvements to service delivery and existing stock, deliver new homes and restructure our funding at lower cost. Over the past year, we have delivered VfM across three areas: Return on assets • Developed and acquired 508 homes at a cost of £57.3m. The independent Board members are drawn from a wide background bringing together professional, commercial and local experience. Its central role is to lead, direct, control, scrutinise and evaluate the organisation’s work. We have insurance policies which indemnify our directors, officers and committee members against liability when acting for us. The Board has reserved to itself, through its terms of reference, essential functions and significant matters which cannot be delegated. The Service Improvement Panel comprises residents and operates independently to ensure we meet our co-regulatory requirements. Governance report continued The Board is supported by committees whose members have relevant specialist skills and experience. The Board receives minutes of all Audit and Risk Committee meetings, which normally take place four times a year. This approach is underpinned by the ISO 9001 registration, which provides a recognised quality assurance standard for managing and auditing our operational procedures. 35 Report and financial statements 2017 Financial statements Additional information Strategic report Governance Likelihood scoring Impact scoring Assurance We have a framework in place to provide assurance that risks are properly managed: 1–2 RARE 3–4 UNLIKELY 7–8 LIKELY 5–6 POSSIBLE 9–10 ALMOST CERTAIN 1–2 VERY LOW 3–4 LOW 7–8 HIGH 5–6 MEDIUM 9–10 VERY HIGH When scoring we consider all possible impacts including impact on service and people, reputation and ﬁnancial. Training includes consideration of how current or proposed activities fall within bpha’s defined risk appetite. For example, during 2016/17 we have implemented enhanced firewalls, improved website security and introduced email screening software. Finance and treasury 2 Cautious We are prepared to accept the possibility of some well managed risk in this area. We will therefore accept some clearly defined risk but only on the basis of well assessed opportunities within a controlled and measurable framework.

Joint arrangements are held as fixed asset investments, shown at cost, less any amounts written-off. Revenue grants are recognised when the conditions for receipt of agreed grant funding have been met. Rental income is recognised from the point when properties under development reach practical completion or otherwise become available for letting. Major components are treated as separable assets and depreciated over their expected useful economic lives as detailed below: Assets Years Structure 100 Kitchens 20 Bathrooms 30 Heating systems – boilers 12 Heating systems – radiators 30 Roofs 60 Windows and doors 30 Electrics 30 Lift – refurbishment 20 Lift – renewal 60 Freehold land is not depreciated. Fair value is determined annually by appropriately qualified external valuers and is derived from current market rents and investment property yields for comparable properties, adjusted if necessary for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specific asset. Net realisable value is based on estimated sales price after allowing for all further costs of completion and disposal. Interest-bearing borrowings classified as basic financial instruments – recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the straight line method, less any impairment losses. Social housing and other grant Social housing grants received in relation to assets that are presented at deemed cost at the date of transition to FRS 102 have been accounted for using the performance model as required by SORP 2014. In applying this model, such grant has been presented as if it were originally recognised as income within the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year it was receivable and is therefore included within brought forward reserves. These interest rate swaps are classified either as basic or other financial instruments in accordance with the requirements of FRS 102.
