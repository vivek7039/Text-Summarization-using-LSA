centred in bedford, we own or manage over 18,000 homes across the oxford to cambridge geographic arc and employ around 350 people. paul high, a co-opted independent board member with extensive sector house building experience, has been appointed to chair this committee. as detailed on page 7, we have established a new business unit operational model that has been designed to be both scalable and modular. we believe good board leadership is all about constructive challenge and strategic thinking, focusing energies on always looking a little further into the future. it’s about really ensuring that all angles have been looked at and always pushing to see if our performance could be better. working closely with bedford borough council, it was recognised that affordable shared ownership properties offered the best value for money alternative. bushmead homes, our build for private sale subsidiary, is continuing to grow at a measured pace but without creating an undue level of sales risk exposure. over the past year, we have delivered vfm across three areas: return on assets • developed and acquired 508 homes at a cost of £57.3m. the board has reserved to itself, through its terms of reference, essential functions and significant matters which cannot be delegated. this approach is underpinned by the iso 9001 registration, which provides a recognised quality assurance standard for managing and auditing our operational procedures. we will therefore accept some clearly defined risk but only on the basis of well assessed opportunities within a controlled and measurable framework. rental income is recognised from the point when properties under development reach practical completion or otherwise become available for letting. subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the straight line method, less any impairment losses. 57 report and financial statements 2017 financial statements additional information governance strategic report 16. creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year 2017 group £’000 2017 association £’000 2016 group £’000 2016 association £’000 debt (note 18) 737,803 738,454 752,382 752,382 recycled capital grant fund (note 17) 10,793 10,793 15,750 15,750 disposal proceeds fund (note 17) 246 246 555 555 deferred government grant 32,737 32,737 18,813 18,813 grant on homebuy and mychoice homebuy loans 31,832 31,832 35,825 35,825 major repairs fund held on behalf of • oxfordshire care partnership 3,231 3,231 2,971 2,942 • leaseholders 2,336 2,336 2,068 2,068 bond premium 10,898 10,898 11,303 11,303 829,876 830,526 839,667 839,638 17. recycled capital fund (rcgf) and disposal proceeds fund (dpf) 2017 2016 rcgf £’000 dpf £’000 group total £’000 rcgf £’000 dpf £’000 group total £’000 at 1 april 19,176 555 19,731 14,782 590 15,372 grants recycled • housing properties 1,056 (1) 1,055 971 – 971 • mychoice homebuy 2,211 – 2,211 1,977 – 1,977 • open market homebuy 1,513 – 1,513 2,618 – 2,618 interest accrued 67 – 67 105 – 105 purchase/development of properties (13,230) – (13,230) (1,277) (35) (1,312) balance at 31 march 10,793 554 11,347 19,176 555 19,731 due within one year – 308 308 3,426 – 3,426 due after more than one year 10,793 246 11,039 15,750 555 16,305 10,793 554 11,347 19,176 555 19,731 included within the rcgf and dpf figures above are amounts that, at 31 march 2017, were over three years old and which potentially could become repayable to the hca. the above commitments will be financed primarily through borrowings, under existing loan arrangements or from access to debt capital markets, together with social housing grant and sale of shared ownership properties. 28. related party transactions board members cllr shan hunt is the appointee of bedford borough council, a local authority having nomination rights over initial tenancies to new build association properties in its area.
