Devices from these batches were tested at three UK hospital sites, on sufficient numbers of patient samples to demonstrate that we now have a method for manufacturing devices which consistently meets our design goal specifications regarding sensitivity and specificity. We continually assess the market landscape for this product and it seems clear that there is an increasing emphasis on the continued need for monitoring CD4 levels in people living with HIV, particularly those patients with low CD4 counts who are at significant risk of contracting opportunistic infections. We are also in the process of evaluating additional rapid tests for dengue, syphilis, leptospirosis, brucella and S. typhi. On a constant currency basis, revenue would have been ahead of last year by 3%. Since December last year, the Company has been seeking to agree global distribution terms with its Allersys ® licensor (Immunodiagnostic Systems Holdings plc (IDS)).

Andrew Shepherd Chief Executive IN SUMMARY • Group revenue increased by 12% to £14.2 million • Adjusted profit before tax of £1.1 million • Significant progress on three-year growth plan • Design freeze achieved on VISITECT ® CD4 • CE mark achieved for 41 allergens to run on IDS-iSYS platform We are pleased to announce the launch of the VISITECT ® Malaria range of rapid diagnostic tests.” Andrew Shepherd Chief Executive With the Company moving into an accelerated growth phase we have very exciting times ahead of us www.omegadiagnostics.com Annual Report and Group Financial Statements 2017 09 Strategic Report Sales of Genarrayt ® /Foodprint ® reagents grew by 34% to £4.67 million (2016: £3.47 million), with strong performances in Europe, North America and the Middle East. Outlook Food intolerance continues to keep up its good performance and we expect to see this continuing in the year ahead with the strategic marketing initiatives being planned and executed as part of our accelerated growth strategy. Andrew Shepherd Chief Executive 29 June 2017 We are evaluating opportunities to bring other rapid tests to the market that will complement VISITECT ® CD4 in helping public health practitioners combat HIV in low and middle-income countries.” Andrew Shepherd Chief Executive www.omegadiagnostics.com Annual Report and Group Financial Statements 2017 11 Strategic Report PRODUCTS AND MARKETS OVERVIEW Providing a range of tests for allergy diagnostics We have successfully optimised 50 Allersys ® allergens for use on the IDS-iSYS system that are ready for commercial launch. IgE mediated allergies are defined by their rapid onset and can cause a variety of symptoms ranging from mild (rhinitis) to severe (anaphylaxis). Allergodip ® is an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) dipstick test for the semi-quantitative determination of Specific IgE in serum/plasma. Foodprint ® /Genarrayt ® is a laboratory-based system for the testing of IgG immune response related food sensitivity. Food intolerance revenues 15 16 17 £6.0m £7.0m £8.0m For more on Food intolerance 8 www.omegadiagnostics.com Annual Report and Group Financial Statements 2017 13 Strategic Report Providing a range of tests for infectious disease We have achieved a significant milestone of attaining formal design freeze with our VISITECT ® CD4 test. Its main product line includes a range of screening and confirmatory tests for syphilis. Its core focus is to save lives, reduce or eliminate disease and have an impact on public health. In addition, there is an existing range of rapid diagnostic tests under the VISITECT ® brand designed to detect malaria, syphilis, leptospirosis and dengue fever. However, these products are coming under threat from advances in technology and competitive activity. The formation of Omega’s Global health division has allowed us to formulate a strategy aimed at delivering innovative diagnostic solutions that address significant unmet diagnostic needs and establish a profitable and growing business with mid to long-term outlook. Omega’s partnership with the Burnet Institute has focused efforts in expanding rapid test manufacturing capabilities and providing a means to diversify routes to market via the non-governmental organisation (NGO) arena and associated funding. We have also just completed a key part of this strategy to define our core values. These values will help to guide the culture during this high growth phase we are entering as a business. Her name is Vutomi and she has been our inspiration to support getting the vegetable garden started. Just as the drought ended, Cape Town was hit by a storm resulting in major flooding and damage to infrastructure. This has encouraged different team members’ involvement with lots of discussion, planning and feedback. Failure to comply with the various regulatory laws can have adverse consequences including increased costs, restrictions, recalls or product suspensions. The Group also uses external consultancies to assess and strengthen its quality management system. Identify risk Assess risk D e v e l o p p l a n to mitigate risk R e a s s e s s r i s k after mitigation R e p o r t t o management www.omegadiagnostics.com Annual Report and Group Financial Statements 2017 17 Strategic Report Risk and description Mitigating actions Change Funding risk The success of growing the business can sometimes depend on the ability of the Directors to access external funding, of which there can be no guarantee, beyond the level of existing internal cash generation. The Group seeks to mitigate this risk by maintaining good relationships with a number of funding sources, including shareholders and banks that could provide additional debt facilities. Equity funding markets may experience volatility with the latest UK general election delivering a hung parliament. Eurozone risk The euro area combines 19 countries with multiple domestic policies all having to operate under common monetary conditions. There is no guarantee that development activity will lead to the future launch of products. Taxation Our UK companies continue to benefit from government policies on tax that encourage investment in research and development activities. Foreign-denominated receivables, payables and bank balances are restated into sterling at closing balance sheet dates, which also gives rise to foreign exchange differences. The difference between these historic balances and their restated amounts at the most recent closing balance sheet rates gives rise to movements which are recorded through other comprehensive income and carried as a balance sheet reserve. As Financial Director he was a key member of the team that floated Shield Diagnostics Limited in 1993. Andrew is responsible for corporate strategy, general management, technical direction and global health development opportunities. These roles enabled him to acquire experience in corporate acquisitions, disposals and intellectual property matters. In 2009 he left his position of Northern Europe Marketing Manager to join Serco Health, where he helped create the first joint venture within UK pathology between Serco and Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital. He is also past Chairman and current Treasurer of the British In Vitro Diagnostics Association (BIVDA). No Director or manager shall be involved in any decisions regarding their own remuneration.

Authorisation of financial statements The financial statements of Omega Diagnostics Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2017 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 29 June 2017, and the balance sheets were signed on the Board’s behalf by David Evans and Kieron Harbinson. Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. Thereafter, expenditure on product development which meets certain criteria is capitalised and amortised over its useful life. Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis as follows: Land and property – 33 years, straight line with no residual value Leasehold improvements – ten years, straight line with no residual value Plant and machinery – three to ten years, straight line with no residual value Motor vehicles – five years, straight line with no residual value The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount. Significant financial difficulty or significantly extended settlement periods are considered to be indicators of impairment. www.omegadiagnostics.com Annual Report and Group Financial Statements 2017 39 Financial Statements 2 Accounting policies continued Pensions Contributions to personal pension plans of employees on a defined contribution basis are charged to the income statement in the year in which they are payable. The Group also operates two defined benefit plans in Germany, which are closed to new members. Inter-segment transfers or transactions are entered into under the normal commercial conditions that would be available to unrelated third parties. Information about major customers No single customer accounts for 10% or more of Group revenues. This further rate reduction was included in the Finance Bill 2016, which received Royal Assent on 15 September 2016. The net book value of plant and machinery held under finance leases at 31 March 2017 is £488,870 (2016: £569,886).
