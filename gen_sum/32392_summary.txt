the immune status of people living with hiv following the successful manufacture of three pilot batches. devices from these batches were tested at three uk hospital sites, on sufficient numbers of patient samples to demonstrate that we now have a method for manufacturing devices which consistently meets our design goal specifications regarding sensitivity and specificity. we continually assess the market landscape for this product and it seems clear that there is an increasing emphasis on the continued need for monitoring cd4 levels in people living with hiv, particularly those patients with low cd4 counts who are at significant risk of contracting opportunistic infections. we are also in the process of evaluating additional rapid tests for dengue, syphilis, leptospirosis, brucella and s. typhi. since december last year, the company has been seeking to agree global distribution terms with its allersys ® licensor (immunodiagnostic systems holdings plc (ids)). andrew shepherd

for infectious disease we have achieved a significant milestone of attaining formal design freeze with our visitect ® cd4 test. its core focus is to save lives, reduce or eliminate disease and have an impact on public health. in addition, there is an existing range of rapid diagnostic tests under the visitect ® brand designed to detect malaria, syphilis, leptospirosis and dengue fever. the formation of omega’s global health division has allowed us to formulate a strategy aimed at delivering innovative diagnostic solutions that address significant unmet diagnostic needs and establish a profitable and growing business with mid to long-term outlook. we have also just completed a key part of this strategy to define our core values. these values will help to guide the culture during this high growth phase we are entering as a business. her name is vutomi and she has been our inspiration to support getting the vegetable garden started. just as the drought ended, cape town was hit by a storm resulting in major flooding and damage to infrastructure. failure to comply with the various regulatory laws can have adverse consequences including increased costs, restrictions, recalls or product suspensions. the group seeks to mitigate this risk by maintaining good relationships with a number of funding sources, including shareholders and banks that could provide additional debt facilities. equity funding markets may experience volatility with the latest uk general election delivering a hung parliament. eurozone risk the euro area combines 19 countries with multiple domestic policies all having to operate under common monetary conditions. there is no guarantee that development activity will lead to the future launch of products. taxation our uk companies continue to benefit from government policies on tax that encourage investment in research and development activities. foreign-denominated receivables, payables and bank balances are restated into sterling at closing balance sheet dates, which also gives rise to foreign exchange differences. the difference between these historic balances and their restated amounts at the most recent closing balance sheet rates gives rise to movements which are recorded through other comprehensive income and carried as a balance sheet reserve. andrew is responsible for corporate strategy, general management, technical direction and global health development opportunities. these roles enabled him to acquire experience in corporate acquisitions, disposals and intellectual property matters. he is also past chairman

acquired as part of a business combination are recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. thereafter, expenditure on product development which meets certain criteria is capitalised and amortised over its useful life. depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis as follows: land and property – 33 years, straight line with no residual value leasehold improvements – ten years, straight line with no residual value plant and machinery – three to ten years, straight line with no residual value motor vehicles – five years, straight line with no residual value the carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount. significant financial difficulty or significantly extended settlement periods are considered to be indicators of impairment. www.omegadiagnostics.com annual report and group
