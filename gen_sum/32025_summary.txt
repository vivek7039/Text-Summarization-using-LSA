CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MAY 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 44 NWF GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 1. None of these standards and interpretations have had any material effect on the Group’s results or net assets. Adoption of this standard is likely to result in an increase in gross assets and gross liabilities, and the consolidated income statement is expected to have an increased depreciation expense; however, the lease expense will reduce by a similar amount. Food Revenue from storage, distribution, handling and re-packaging of clients’ products is recognised when the relevant service has been performed. Segment reporting A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments. A geographical segment is engaged in providing products and services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns which are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments. However, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profits or losses. Capitalised computer software costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis (3 to 7 years). Net defined benefit pension scheme deficits before tax relief are presented separately on the balance sheet within non-current liabilities. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use calculations. Valuation of acquired intangibles IFRS 3(R) requires separately identifiable intangible assets to be recognised on acquisitions. Inter-segment transactions are entered into under the normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available to unrelated third parties. The value in use calculations described above, together with sensitivity analysis using reasonable assumptions, indicate ample headroom and therefore do not give rise to impairment concerns. Management does not consider that there is any reasonable downside scenario which would result in an impairment.

IFRS 13 (amended) ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ requires disclosure of financial instruments measured at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 below, based on the degree to which fair value is observable: » Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; » Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1 above, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and » Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of medium-term and short-term debt finance, which is designed to ensure that it has access to sufficient available funds for ongoing working capital needs as well as planned capital investment and expansion generally. These shares will only be issued subject to satisfying certain performance criteria (see Directors’ Remuneration Report and note 23). If the return on plan assets is below this rate, it will create a scheme deficit.
