Our Genedrive® HCV ID Kit was submitted for CE registration in April 2017 based on excellent performance data from clinical validation studies. Post year end, I am delighted that we obtained CE marking, a vital first step to commercialization. Away from our core human healthcare focus, we enjoyed success with funded field trials of Genedrive® for white-spot disease detection in farmed shrimp. The results validated Genedrive®’s potential as a rapid cost effective system for disease detection in animals. Matthew Fowler joined the Board on 13 December 2016 in his role as Chief Financial Officer. We look forward to updating investors during the year on further progress and delivery against our strategic objectives. With the HCV ID kit now CE registered we are in a position to begin commercialisation efforts. Our Genedrive® HCV ID kit will initially be launched and sold into decentralised laboratories; being facilities outside of large hospitals. To support future positioning in this user segment, the Company has secured a £0.6m conditional offer of development funding from Innovate UK. When confirmed the grant will be used to further our Centrifuge Free Plasma Separation device concept, so that Page Title at start: Content Section at start: Chief Executive’s Review Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report genedrive plc Annual Report 2017 7 smaller facilities without centrifuges can also use Genedrive® HCV ID. We do believe that focusing our efforts on Genedrive® should remain a core strategic priority. In the current financial year, we will be working with our distribution partner(s) to begin commercialisation efforts and secure requisite regulatory approvals. Awareness is lacking, reliable diagnostics that are appropriate for the setting of intended use and testing services are not sufficiently available and laboratory capacity is weak.’ – World Health Organisation Page Title at start: Content Section at start: Market Opportunity Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report genedrive plc Annual Report 2017 9 Clinical validation performed by Institute Pasteur, Paris and Queens Medical Centre Nottingham. – CE marking obtained September 2017 Availability of new treatments at sustainable developing world prices is driving the need for decentralised diagnostics.

Risk is an inherent feature of business and set out below are some key risks, together with associated mitigating factors. The Group monitors industry trends and customer needs to ensure that its development targets remain relevant. It is unlikely that dual sourcing of supply will be achievable in the short term. The Group seeks to mitigate this risk by establishing effective management organisation and leading staff incentive schemes. The Group seeks to mitigate this risk by operating a diversified business model across various technologies and territories.
