molecular testing market. our genedrive® hcv id kit was submitted for ce registration in april 2017 based on excellent performance data from clinical validation studies. post year end, i am delighted that we obtained ce marking, a vital first step to commercialization. away from our core human healthcare focus, we enjoyed success with funded field trials of genedrive® for white-spot disease detection in farmed shrimp. the results validated genedrive®’s potential as a rapid cost effective system for disease detection in animals. we look forward to updating investors during the year on further progress and delivery against our strategic objectives. following these successful studies that showed overall sensitivity of greater than 99% and specificity of 100%, the product was submitted for ce marking in april 2017. i am pleased that in september 2017 the product obtained its ce registration. with the hcv id kit now ce registered we are in a position to begin commercialisation efforts. our genedrive® hcv id kit will initially be launched and sold into decentralised laboratories; being facilities outside of large hospitals. to support future positioning in this user segment, the company has secured a £0.6m conditional offer of development funding from innovate uk. when confirmed the grant will be used to further our centrifuge free plasma separation device concept, so that page title at start: content section at start: chief executive’s review financial statements governance strategic report genedrive plc annual report 2017 7 smaller facilities without centrifuges can also use genedrive® hcv id. this additional funding is expected to generate approximately $1.4m in development and commercial income of $0.5m for the financial year to 30 june
