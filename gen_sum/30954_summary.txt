Unrivalled proprietary data • Our extensive database means we  understand the likely impact of medical and  lifestyle information on life expectancy. Strong financial model The Group creates value by taking on  those risks which we believe can be   fairly rewarded. • The majority of our financial asset portfolio is  held in investment grade, fixed income  securities such as government and corporate  bonds. Our DB sales are made via employee benefits  consultants (“EBCs”) who advise pension  schemes’ trustees and we have developed  strong relationships in this area. Performance review We compete in attractive growth markets  and our strategy is focused on growing  profits not headline sales. Furthermore, the Group improved its  liquidity options by agreeing a £200m  revolving credit facility with three banks,  which remains undrawn. The PRA continues to publish industry-wide  consultation papers and supervisory  statements setting out its expectations for  certain aspects of prudential regulation. We diversify to grow  and also to reduce dependency on any one  business line, distributor or market Why this is important Our current markets have growth potential,  but we already have substantial market  shares and a focus on profitable new  business over growth for the sake of it. Just as importantly, new markets are  a means to diversify away from any  concentration in market, regulatory or  balance sheet risk. With diversification we can seek to develop  businesses that have a lower new business  strain on capital, meaning growth is not  constrained by our balance sheet. — B D E B C D E A C E F 18 Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017 Strategy in Action DELIVERING  PROFIT We are a pioneer in medically  underwritten Guaranteed  Income for Life solutions and  have collected more details,   of more customers, for longer  than our competitors HUGH MCKEE MANAGING DIRECTOR,   UK RETAIL BUSINESS Delivering profit from  sustainable advantage Our focus on effective use of capital leads to  attention on margin over market share. By closely aligning our operational processes and  underwriting approach we are able to optimise  outcomes for both customers and shareholders, a  win-win that provides a great return on the  investments we have made over many years in these  key components of our business model. By  applying stress and scenario testing, we gain insights into how risks  might impact the Group in different circumstances. We actively seek to participate in all  regulatory initiatives which may affect or  provide future opportunities for the Group. Low credit spreads similarly affect the income  that can be made available, although  margins from our equity release portfolio  help offset this risk. Conversely, significant future rises in  property values could increase early  mortgage redemptions, leading to an earlier  receipt of anticipated cash flows and  reinvestment risk. In a low interest rate environment, improved  returns are sought by diversifying the types,  geographies and industry sectors of  investment assets. Liquidity risk is managed by ensuring that  assets of a suitable maturity and  marketability are held to meet liabilities as  they fall due. The margin improvement was achieved  through risk selection, pricing discipline, lower unit costs from synergy  savings, and more efficient asset-liability management. In addition,  the investment returns within our new business margin assumptions  benefited from sustained attractive lifetime mortgage spreads. The Group’s capital position has benefited from our continued focus  on margin and pricing discipline together with careful asset liability  management.
