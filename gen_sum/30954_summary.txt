2017 growing markets a sustainable model in growing markets chairman’s statement i am pleased to introduce just group plc’s 2017 annual report. operating these schemes has become unattractive and more costly for employers over the last decade and this has created an opportunity for guaranteed income providers to de-risk, fully or partially, an employer’s existing defined benefit obligations to its members. the solutions for de-risking can be medically underwritten, meaning that insurers use individual members’ medical and lifestyle information to assess their longevity as opposed to relying on proxies such as the member’s age, pension amount and possibly postcode. defined benefit pension schemes with fewer members offer the greatest opportunity for medical underwriting to deliver benefits. current market and outlook there are approximately £2tn in uk defined benefit pension scheme obligations (source: ppf), which is driving high demand for de-risking solutions, with buy-in transactions forecast over the next decade to be approximately £350bn (source: hymans robertson). 07 just group plc annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report 0 20 40 60 80 100 85% of defined benefit pension

security and peace of mind the proportion of people purchasing an individually underwritten gifl is continuing to increase and our view is this will become the minimum standard for all providers over

an existing base of pension savings customers. under current rules this income is tax free when paid directly to the registered care provider. there are very limited underwritten guaranteed income for life options available to consumers in the us market. staff numbers (dec 2017) 1,108 communities we are a significant local employer in our home community of reigate. corporation tax and national insurance paid in 2017 £56m suppliers we maintain a significant supply chain, working with businesses of all sizes. unrivalled proprietary data • our extensive database means we understand the likely impact of medical and lifestyle information on life expectancy. the insight this gives us into customer lifestyle and medical outcomes is a significant competitive advantage. strong financial model the group creates value by taking on those risks which we believe can be fairly rewarded. • just retirement limited, the group’s principal life assurance company, uses an internal model to calculate our capital requirements more accurately than a standard model and approval is only granted to companies who have met the prudential regulation authority’s (“pra”) requirements. • the majority of longevity risk for both db and gifl business is held by high quality international reinsurers. • the majority of our financial asset portfolio is held in investment grade, fixed income securities such as government and corporate bonds. 12 just group plc annual report and accounts 2017 our customers are the focus of everything that we do. just has a highly effective multi- channel distribution strategy which is one of our key strengths. our db sales are made via employee benefits consultants (“ebcs”) who advise pension schemes’ trustees and we have developed strong relationships in this area. this has helped our corporate partners to develop improved outcomes for their at- and in-retirement customers. performance review we compete in attractive growth markets and our strategy is focused on growing profits not headline sales. capital and dividends during the year the group’s primary insurance subsidiary, just retirement limited (“jrl”), achieved an inaugural insurer financial strength credit rating of a+, and in addition jrl and just group plc achieved issuer default ratings of single a. furthermore, the group improved its liquidity options by agreeing a £200m revolving credit facility with three banks, which remains undrawn. chief executive officer’s statement 15 just group plc annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report lifetime mortgage advances £510.0m 2016:

december 2016: 151%), as expected due to the transitional measures for technical provisions (“tmtp”) recalculation and strong new business volumes written during the year, with the majority of our own funds comprised of tier 1 capital. since year end our capital position has been strengthened further by our successful issue of £230m 7 year tier 3 capital at a 3.5% coupon in february 2018. the pra continues to publish industry-wide consultation papers and supervisory statements setting out its expectations for certain aspects of prudential regulation. it is the hard work, creativity and determination of these teams that enable just to succeed. we are working hard to ensure that our post- merger culture embraces the brand promise and customer perspective. we diversify to grow and also to reduce dependency on any one business line, distributor or market why this is important our current markets have growth potential, but we already have substantial market shares and a focus on profitable new business over growth for the sake of it. just as importantly, new markets are a means to diversify away from any concentration in market, regulatory or balance sheet risk. with diversification we can seek to develop businesses that have a lower new business strain on capital, meaning growth is not constrained by our balance sheet. — b d e b c d e a c e f 18 just group plc annual report and accounts 2017 strategy in action delivering profit we are a pioneer in medically underwritten guaranteed income for life solutions and have collected more details, of more customers, for longer than our competitors hugh mckee managing director, uk retail business delivering profit from sustainable advantage our focus on effective use of capital leads to attention on margin over market share. by closely aligning our operational processes and underwriting approach we are able to optimise outcomes for both customers and shareholders, a win-win that provides a great return on the investments we have made over many years in these key components of our business model. by applying stress and scenario testing, we gain insights into how risks might impact the group in different circumstances. the solvency ii risk margin is particularly sensitive to movements in interest rates, which can increase its volatility. the group is also engaging with industry bodies to ensure an appropriate implementation of supervisory statements. we actively seek to participate in all regulatory initiatives which may affect or provide future opportunities for the group. an adverse economic environment could increase the risk of credit downgrades and defaults in our corporate bond portfolio. low credit spreads similarly affect the income that can be made available, although margins from our equity release portfolio help offset this risk. as the group’s defined benefit de-risking business volumes grow, its exposure to inflation risk increases. conversely, significant future rises in property values could increase early mortgage redemptions, leading to an earlier receipt of anticipated cash flows and reinvestment risk. in a low interest rate environment, improved returns are sought by diversifying the types, geographies and industry sectors of investment assets. liquidity risk is managed by ensuring that assets of a suitable maturity and marketability are held to meet liabilities as they fall due. any failure of the group’s it and communications systems and/ or third party infrastructure on which it relies could lead to costs and disruptions that could adversely affect its business as well as harm its reputation. the group is no exception and a cyber-attack could affect customer confidence, or lead to financial losses. additionally, the group’s brands and reputation could be threatened by external risks such as regulatory intervention or enforcement action, either directly or as a result of contagion from other companies in the sectors in which we operate. the group actively seeks to differentiate its business from competitors by investing in brand-enhancing activities. the margin improvement was achieved through risk selection, pricing discipline, lower unit costs from synergy savings, and more efficient asset-liability management. in addition, the investment returns within our new business margin assumptions benefited from sustained attractive lifetime mortgage spreads. the group’s capital position has benefited from our continued focus on margin and pricing discipline together with careful asset liability management. eev reporting is not a statutory requirement, but supplementary disclosure intended to facilitate users’ understanding of the group. as expected, this ratio reduced due to tmtp recalculation and strong new business volumes written during the year. key performance indicators year ended 31 december 2017 £m 18 months ended 31 december 2016 £m new business sales 2,457.1 3,480.6 new business

ifrs 4 from 1 january 2018 is that additional disclosures will be required to allow comparison with those entities which have adopted ifrs 9 from 1 january 2018. on application of ifrs 9 there is potential for certain financial assets that are currently classified as fair value through profit or loss to be reclassified as fair value through other comprehensive income. however, the group anticipates that it will continue to designate these assets as fair value through profit or loss under ifrs 9 under the option to do so when it eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch which would otherwise occur. the valuation discount rates are derived from yields on supporting assets after deducting allowances for default. an operating segment is a component of the group that engages in business activities from which it earns revenues and incurs expenses. in addition, operating income includes fees from software licensing which are recognised across the licence period. obligations for contributions to the defined contribution pension scheme are recognised as an expense in profit or loss when due. the determination of whether an active market exists for a financial investment requires management’s judgement. the group establishes fair value for these financial investments by using quotations from independent third parties or internally developed pricing models. where reinsurance contracts entered into by the group require deposits received from reinsurers to be repaid, such amounts are classified as “deposits received from reinsurers” and included in other financial liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position. 1.23 investment contract liabilities investment contracts are measured at fair value through profit and loss in accordance with ias 39. the fair value of investment contracts is estimated using an internal model and determined on a policy-by-policy basis using a prospective valuation of future retirement income benefit and expense cash flows, but with an adjustment to amortise any day-one gain over the life of the contract. these balances are being amortised over their remaining useful economic lives, in accordance with the group’s accounting policies. 3 net investment income year ended 31 december 2017 £m 18 months ended 31 december 2016 £m interest income: assets at fair value
