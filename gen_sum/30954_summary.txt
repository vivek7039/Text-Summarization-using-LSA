just group plc annual report and accounts 2017 strategy in action delivering profit we are a pioneer in medically underwritten guaranteed income for life solutions and have collected more details, of more customers, for longer than our competitors hugh mckee managing director, uk retail business delivering profit from sustainable advantage our focus on effective use of capital leads to attention on margin over market share. by applying stress and scenario testing, we gain insights into how risks might impact the group in different circumstances. we actively seek to participate in all regulatory initiatives which may affect or provide future opportunities for the group. low credit spreads similarly affect the income that can be made available, although margins from our equity release portfolio help offset this risk. conversely, significant future rises in property values could increase early mortgage redemptions, leading to an earlier receipt of anticipated cash flows and reinvestment risk. in a low interest rate environment, improved returns are sought by diversifying the types, geographies and industry sectors of investment assets. liquidity risk is managed by ensuring that assets of a suitable maturity and marketability are held to meet liabilities as they fall due. the margin improvement was achieved through risk selection, pricing discipline, lower unit costs from synergy savings, and more efficient asset-liability management. the group’s capital position has benefited from our continued focus on margin and pricing discipline together with careful asset liability management. looking forward offering greater help to vulnerable customers will be an important focus for our company over the coming years. paul also spent 18 months on secondment at
