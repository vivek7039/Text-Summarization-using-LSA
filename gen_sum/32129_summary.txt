strategy-led talent management long-term market growth drivers our business model and strategy inputs £ financial our operations are inherently cash generative and the group has access to competitively priced finance, which provides good liquidity and support for the growth ambitions of halma. each business builds strong application knowledge and technology by focusing on its specific market niche where there are often barriers to entry. halma has had a well-established financial target that aims to double our earnings every five years, without becoming highly geared or seeking further equity, provided there are similar rates of organic, acquisitive and dividend growth. many of our businesses have been using or experimenting with technologies such as robotics and 3d printing for some time. board members from all halma companies attended a three-day event which included sessions focused on harnessing new technologies, developing more ambitious growth strategies and understanding the value of strategic partnerships. first prize in the process award was fortress interlocks’ online interactive tool which helps customers easily configure and order customised products from a standard product platform. these chronic diseases are the leading cause of mortality worldwide due to population ageing, more sedentary lifestyles, changing diets and rising obesity. according to the united nations, almost 3 billion people in 48 countries will be facing water shortages within 10 years that could cause conflict and political destabilisation. global electricity demand is forecast to double by 2060. rising energy consumption and water usage is driven by four key trends: — population growth — economic growth — rising living standards — dietary and agricultural changes during the 20 th century water consumption grew twice as fast as the world population. over 4 billion people (about two thirds of the global population) currently live with severe water scarcity for at least one month a year. rising temperatures in agricultural areas increase the rate of water evaporation from soil and crop transpiration, raising irrigation demand. we expect several of our businesses will see a continued fall in revenue from upstream oil and gas projects. as global demand for water resources becomes unsustainable, the value of conservation, improving efficiency and effective monitoring is growing. — the group’s acquisition model supports retention of management and staff in acquired businesses, meaning that local expertise is retained. — the group’s

may introduce additional risk while we develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure necessary to build a direct presence. the industrial processes supporting this development are at risk from accidents caused by explosions, radiation, fire, corrosion and other hazards. supported by our brazil sector hub, we were able to achieve some growth, mainly in the explosion protection market. investment in innovation and application engineering capabilities was increased, providing local markets with quick product adaptation for specific requirements. this has improved the business agility, impacting sales, engineering and technical support to provide a better quality of service for customers. bea has developed the lzr flatscan, an extremely small, thin door sensor that uses a laser for detection rather than conventional infra-red. there was significant investment in capitalised r&d programmes and substantial spend on targeted automation of our manufacturing processes. our new product pipeline is strong, with significant products due to be launched across multiple sub-sectors in the next year. by investing in our current portfolio, and through acquiring additional companies, we aim to deliver growth rates above group kpi targets. the world population is expected to increase by 1 billion by 2025 with 300 million of that increase predicted to come from people over 65. because eyesight problems and high blood pressure are both age-related, population ageing is a key driver for our businesses, especially in ophthalmology and hypertension management. currently, one in every three us adults has high blood pressure and only half of these individuals have their condition under control. this market for high-revenue, personal payment premium procedures is of increasing importance to our ophthalmic companies which focus on improved patient outcomes. telemedicine is growing at almost 19% annually as it offers dramatically different ways to deliver healthcare by sharing information and data across a wide range of service providers. the steady global rise in middle class affluence, combined with urbanisation, means that people are living more sedentary lifestyles which raises obesity and diseases like diabetes. case study telemedicine prevents baby blindness louise allen, consultant paediatric ophthalmologist for addenbrooke’s hospital in cambridge, uses our digital ophthalmoscopes, from keeler, to diagnose babies’ eye conditions remotely. two thirds of the world’s population currently live in areas that experience water scarcity for at least one month a year. by looking at specific spectral bands, they provide much more information in far less time than traditional methods, thus allowing for higher efficiency and decreased waste. we are targeting acquisitions in segments that tie to our existing technologies and/or market knowledge, have good long-term growth drivers and defensible positions through regulations or intellectual property. our decentralised management structure allows local managers to be autonomous and responsible for making timely decisions in the best interests of their business. we support the concept of sustainability and recognise that, in common with all businesses, our activities have an environmental impact. a senior executive in each of our higher impact businesses is responsible for implementing the carbon policy at local level. during 2017, we are rolling out a programme of online health & safety training with mandatory and optional modules being offered to all employees across the group. total invested capital, which includes significant us dollar and euro assets, has typically been affected by currency movements more than the post-tax return. we benefit from widely claimed r&d related tax incentives, exemptions and reliefs (for example under the uk ‘patent box’ rules). this outflow was higher than typical following strong revenue growth in the final quarter leading to increased year end debtor balances. investment for organic growth all sectors continue to innovate and invest in new products with r&d spend determined by each individual halma company. deferred contingent consideration previously provided for of £10m has been released in 2016/17 relating to a specific customer where sales targets will not be achieved. forward looking statements should be regarded with caution because of the inherent uncertainties in economic trends and business risks. the board is also responsible for ensuring appropriate resources are in place to achieve its strategy and deliver sustainable performance. the review is principally based on reviewing reports from management to consider whether significant risks have been identified, evaluated, managed and controlled. halma’s strategy is to build a strong competitive advantage in specialised safety, health and environmental technology markets with resilient growth drivers. no person has any special rights of control over the company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. initial performance awards were made to executive directors and selected senior management in july 2015, following shareholder approval of the plan. there is a risk that acquisitions are not accounted for correctly in line with ifrs 3 ‘business combinations’ where material judgements exist. we further challenged management’s judgement through sensitivity over the key growth assumptions to determine alternative scenarios, and therefore a range of possible outcomes. − amendments to ifrs 2: classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018. as a result, the net book value of goodwill recognised as an intangible asset under uk gaap at 3 april 2004 was brought forward unadjusted as the cost of goodwill recognised under ifrs at 4 april 2004 subject to impairment testing on that date; and goodwill that was written off to reserves prior to 28 march 1998 under uk gaap will not be taken into account in determining the profit or loss on disposal or closure of previously acquired businesses from 4 april 2004 onwards. for trade receivables that are not past due, taking into account good historical collection experience, management records an impairment charge only where there is a specific risk of non-collection.
