maximise value through our strategy our strategy to acquire and grow businesses in relatively non-cyclical, specialised global niche markets. halma has had a well-established financial target that aims to double our earnings every five years, without becoming highly geared or seeking further equity, provided there are similar rates of organic, acquisitive and dividend growth. the usa remained our largest regional market with revenue increasing by 27% to £345m (2016: £273m) and 1% organic constant currency growth. we are also able to sell and merge businesses relatively easily should specific market dynamics change. mainland europe saw organic revenue decline after weaker demand from certain oem customers headquartered in the region. this highlights the need for us to build strong relationships with business owners, sometimes over a number of years, so that they already see halma as a great home for their business when they eventually decide to sell. over the past decade, our primary focus has been on talent development, innovation and international expansion. many of our businesses have been using or experimenting with technologies such as robotics and 3d printing for some time. board members from all halma companies attended a three-day event which included sessions focused on harnessing new technologies, developing more ambitious growth strategies and understanding the value of strategic partnerships. our investment in new product development increased substantially, with a record r&d spend up by 23% to £50.6m (2016: £41.2m). first prize in the process award was fortress interlocks’ online interactive tool which helps customers easily configure and order customised products from a standard product platform. a detailed report on our approach to corporate responsibility, including our co 2 emissions reduction performance, is on pages 56 to 59. outlook halma operates in a diverse range of market niches where demand is supported by resilient long-term growth drivers. andrew williams chief executive 1 see highlights 2 see note 1 to the accounts strategic report governance financial statements halma plc annual report and accounts 2017 9 understanding our stakeholders’ needs chief executive q&a q what is halma’s financial model? our aspiration is to double every five years, through a mix of acquisitions and organic growth. we choose markets with resilient growth drivers, including increased safety regulation, increasing demand for healthcare and life-critical resources (e.g. water). within these markets, we select product niches with strong intellectual property that deliver high, sustainable returns. we have an agile, de-centralised operating model which makes sure resources are placed close to customers. having an agile and flexible operating model means our businesses can adjust quickly to their markets, as opportunities change. this has enabled us to increase our dividend by 5% or more every year for the past 38 years. we typically acquire relatively small businesses, in the £10m to £100m price range, that share halma’s key characteristics. our strong financial resources have enabled us to spend £645m on 26 acquisitions since 2007. in the last few years, we have added dedicated m&a resources at sector level, making us well placed to continue this successful track record. halma is exposed to a very diverse range of carefully selected niche markets, each with its own unique drivers. however, greater investment and advances in occupational safety are reducing the number of fatal accidents at work. about 9% of china’s population is currently aged over 65, but the proportion is expected to rise to around 12% in 2020. by that time health services for the elderly will account for nearly 23% of china’s total healthcare spending. these chronic diseases are the leading cause of mortality worldwide due to population ageing, more sedentary lifestyles, changing diets and rising obesity. according to the united nations, almost 3 billion people in 48 countries will be facing water shortages within 10 years that could cause conflict and political destabilisation. global electricity demand is forecast to double by 2060. rising energy consumption and water usage is driven by four key trends: — population growth — economic growth — rising living standards — dietary and agricultural changes during the 20 th century water consumption grew twice as fast as the world population. over 4 billion people (about two thirds of the global population) currently live with severe water scarcity for at least one month a year. rising temperatures in agricultural areas increase the rate of water evaporation from soil and crop transpiration, raising irrigation demand. water used in energy production can also degrade freshwater resources by reducing the downstream volume and quality. energy is vital to provide fresh water, powering the systems that collect, transport, distribute and treat it. it is estimated that around us$620 billion of projects through to 2020 have been deferred or cancelled. we expect several of our businesses will see a continued fall in revenue from upstream oil and gas projects. as global demand for water resources becomes unsustainable, the value of conservation, improving efficiency and effective monitoring is growing. the measure of how successful we are in growing our business organically and by acquisition coupled with strong financial disciplines, including those related to tax and capital allocation, is captured in the group’s adjusted earnings per

chinese market business review process safety our process safety sector makes products which protect assets and people at work. the second half saw improvements with a combination of stabilised oil prices and positive progress in our diversification strategy. the industrial processes supporting this development are at risk from accidents caused by explosions, radiation, fire, corrosion and other hazards. this drives the demand for our products at rates that are higher than general economic growth. oil prices fell from a high in 2014 due to oversupply and reduced demand as economic growth slowed. oil price stability offered some comfort, but overall, capital expenditure in upstream and midstream markets remained subdued. strategic report governance financial statements 31 u.s. energy

source: u.s. energy information administration business review process safety continued in the second half of 2016/17 the oil and gas market was more active, with oil price stability, cost-efficiency efforts, and non-conventional oil extraction in the us creating a slightly more positive environment for our businesses. uk market activities were flat compared to last year, with continuing low activity in the north sea. sales in the middle east grew strongly by 37% as oil and gas production has been maintained at reasonable levels. supported by our brazil sector hub, we were able to achieve some growth, mainly in the explosion protection market. this strategy has led to faster product innovation, increased geographic market reach and improved customer service. investment in innovation and application engineering capabilities was increased, providing local markets with quick product adaptation for specific requirements. the newly combined sequential safety businesses delivered excellent performance thanks to strong regional activity and centrally-located innovation. our machine automation business continues to perform well, with good progress in north america and china. r&d spend has remained at good levels, providing new products and innovations to support our growth ambitions. non-conventional us oil extraction is set to rebound in 2017 and we will benefit from this increased activity. each business unit now offers products from all three companies and operates in a specific geographic region. this has improved the business agility, impacting sales, engineering and technical support to provide a better quality of service for customers. they are used in many different industries including all types of manufacturing, logistics, power, chemical processing and railways. bea has developed the lzr flatscan, an extremely small, thin door sensor that uses a laser for detection rather than conventional infra-red. for example, china’s fire regulator (cccf) will introduce more stringent standards in the next few years. this trend is driving increased collaboration between our companies as they co-operate on joint development programmes. there was significant investment in capitalised r&d programmes and substantial spend on targeted automation of our manufacturing processes. our new product pipeline is strong, with significant products due to be launched across multiple sub-sectors in the next year. by investing in our current portfolio, and through acquiring additional companies, we aim to deliver growth rates above group kpi targets. volk optical’s pictor plus is a handheld digital imaging device that enables convenient, portable ophthalmology in any setting. the world population is expected to increase by 1 billion by 2025 with 300 million of that increase predicted to come from people over 65. because eyesight problems and high blood pressure are both age-related, population ageing is a key driver for our businesses, especially in ophthalmology and hypertension management. currently, one in every three us adults has high blood pressure and only half of these individuals have their condition under control. cataract surgery is one of the most frequent surgical operations carried out worldwide at more than 25 million annually. this market for high-revenue, personal payment premium procedures is of increasing importance to our ophthalmic companies which focus on improved patient outcomes. telemedicine is growing at almost 19% annually as it offers dramatically different ways to deliver healthcare by sharing information and data across a wide range of service providers. one of our ophthalmology companies is using remote diagnosis via telecoms to help prevent blindness in diabetic patients. the steady global rise in middle class affluence, combined with urbanisation, means that people are living more sedentary lifestyles which raises obesity and diseases like diabetes. during 2017 we will expand our collaborative efforts in china, jointly marketing a wider range of ophthalmic and diagnostic products. case study telemedicine prevents baby blindness louise allen, consultant paediatric ophthalmologist for addenbrooke’s hospital in cambridge, uses our digital ophthalmoscopes, from keeler, to diagnose babies’ eye conditions remotely. addenbrooke’s charitable trust has now provided our indirect ophthalmoscopes to other hospitals throughout the region. working closely with customer affinity water, hwm used their in-depth knowledge of the market to develop permanet +. global emphasis on climate change and pollution monitoring continues to strengthen the position of our environmental applications. our photonics businesses continued to find new applications in a variety of diversified markets and industries. at the same time, limited water resources are increasingly stressed by over abstraction, pollution and climate change. two thirds of the world’s population currently live in areas that experience water scarcity for at least one month a year. outdoor air pollution is a major environmental health risk affecting everyone in developing and developed countries alike. for example, in china only 25 of 190 cities studied could meet the country’s national ambient air quality standards. strategic report governance financial statements 49 source: world resources institute

contaminants as well as other products that aid in the calibration of pollution monitoring equipment. by looking at specific spectral bands, they provide much more information in far less time than traditional methods, thus allowing for higher efficiency and decreased waste. we are targeting acquisitions in segments that tie to our existing technologies and/or market knowledge, have good long-term growth drivers and defensible positions through regulations or intellectual property. our acquisition pipeline is growing and we expect to add complementary businesses in the coming years. our decentralised management structure allows local managers to be autonomous and responsible for making timely decisions in the best interests of their business. through collaboration and sharing best practice we continue to deliver market-leading innovations that create benefits for our customers. our biennial hitex (halma innovation, technology and experimentation) conference was held recently in san diego, california. we held our biennial innovation focused event in san diego, california over three days in april 2017. the goal for hitex 2017 was to launch a new spirit for innovation and collaboration, and to be the start of us creating a living, learning community across halma. employee representatives are consulted routinely on a wide range of matters affecting their current and future interests. we support the concept of sustainability and recognise that, in common with all businesses, our activities have an environmental impact. halma brands lead the world in a number of technologies which help to minimise environmental damage. therefore, responsibility for vetting and managing suppliers is devolved to local management while meeting the group’s ethical standards. we have developed performance indicators that assist local management in implementing the policy and ultimately developing an ems. recent examples include: — apollo china, bea, fiberguide and perma pure replacing lighting installations with more energy efficient led lamps — keeler replacing their ageing oil boilers with more efficient gas boilers — medicel recovering heat from machinery connected to cooling circuits and utilising it for heating opportunities are also being explored by some businesses to expand existing solar installations or switch to green energy suppliers. a senior executive in each of our higher impact businesses is responsible for implementing the carbon policy at local level. during 2017, we are rolling out a programme of online health & safety training with mandatory and optional modules being offered to all employees across the group. topics being covered include: — health & safety at work — control of substances hazardous to health (coshh) awareness — display screen equipment & workstation safety — repetitive strain injury — slips trips and falls — manual handling — working with hazardous substances given the autonomous structure of the group, operational responsibility for compliance with relevant local health and safety regulations resides with the board of each operating company. halma has a code of conduct which applies to all group company employees and our external business partners. an independent third party provider, expolink, has been appointed to operate a confidential reporting service which enables employees to raise any concerns they may have in confidence and, if they wish, anonymously via the telephone or by web-reporting. during 2017, we are rolling out anti- bribery and corruption training to senior management across the group. managers and supervisors must provide leadership that promotes human rights as an equal priority to other business issues. the group will publish its next annual modern slavery act statement for this year in september 2017. strategic report governance financial statements halma plc annual report and accounts 2017 59 financial review continued investment delivering growth our objective is to achieve long-term sustainable growth. total invested capital, which includes significant us dollar and euro assets, has typically been affected by currency movements more than the post-tax return. a significant proportion (approximately one quarter) of group profit is generated and taxed in the uk. we benefit from widely claimed r&d related tax incentives, exemptions and reliefs (for example under the uk ‘patent box’ rules). this outflow was higher than typical following strong revenue growth in the final quarter leading to increased year end debtor balances. investment for organic growth all sectors continue to innovate and invest in new products with r&d spend determined by each individual halma company. one acquisition in the year acquisitions and disposals are an important part of our growth strategy. deferred contingent consideration previously provided for of £10m has been released in 2016/17 relating to a specific customer where sales targets will not be achieved. the group continues to operate well within its banking covenants with significant headroom under each financial ratio. pensions update we closed the two uk defined benefit (db) plans to new members in 2002. in december 2014 we ceased future accrual within these plans with future pension benefits earned within the group’s defined contribution (dc) pension arrangements. the audit committee took a key role in assessing compliance with reporting requirements supported by robust management processes. forward looking statements should be regarded with

consultancies used and any connections with the company. each committee operates under its own terms of reference, which have been approved by the board. a time commitment of around 20 days per annum is the anticipated requirement for each non-executive director. confirmation is obtained on appointment from each non-executive director that they can allocate sufficient time to the role. the board engage with employees through a wide range of development programmes and regular site visits. the review is principally based on reviewing reports from management to consider whether significant risks have been identified, evaluated, managed and controlled. halma’s strategy is to build a strong competitive advantage in specialised safety, health and environmental technology markets with resilient growth drivers. this strategy has long been underpinned by the remuneration framework which balances a short-term incentive related to improvements in the economic value added (eva) in a financial year – including an element deferred for two years in the form of shares – with a longer-term share incentive related to return on total invested capital (rotic), earnings per share (eps) and, formerly, total shareholder return (tsr). of these amounts one third will be deferred for two years and is payable in shares. the committee is satisfied that there has been a robust link between reward and performance over these periods. executive directors participate in either a group defined contribution pension plan or the us 401k money purchase arrangement. the policy also seeks to reward achievement of stretching performance targets without driving unacceptable behaviours or encouraging excessive risk-taking. executive directors participate in either a group defined contribution pension plan or the us 401k money purchase arrangement. it entitles all uk- based employees to receive halma shares in a potentially tax- advantageous manner. selection of performance

£139,185 and is increased annually thereafter by cpi (£155,528 for 2016/17). no person has any special rights of control over the company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. a holder of ordinary shares can lose the entitlement to vote at general meetings where that holder has been served with a disclosure notice and has failed to provide the company with information concerning interests held in those shares. the remuneration committee believes that the ability to continue to grant long term share-based incentives as part of a balanced remuneration package will create a strong alignment of long term interest between senior management and shareholders. initial performance awards were made to executive directors and selected senior management in july 2015, following shareholder approval of the plan. it is anticipated that renewal of the authority will be requested at subsequent annual general meetings. scoping we focused our group audit primarily on the full scope and specified procedures audits at 60 locations. there is a risk that acquisitions are not accounted for correctly in line with ifrs 3 ‘business combinations’ where material judgements exist. we further challenged management’s judgement through sensitivity over the key growth assumptions to determine alternative scenarios, and therefore a range of possible outcomes. this included reviewing available yield curves and inflation data to recalculate a reasonable range for the key assumptions. additionally we benchmarked key assumptions against other listed companies to check for any outliers in the data used. the group audit team have established a programme of planned component visits based on their risk assessment. see note 24. the financial statements of halma plc, company

sensitive to the following assumptions: − cgu specific operating assumptions that are reflected in the budget period for the financial year to march 2018; − discount rates; and − growth rates used to extrapolate risk adjusted cash flows beyond the budget period. 2 technical know-how assets are amortised over their useful economic lives, estimated to be between three and ten years. 4 internally generated capitalised development costs are amortised over their useful economic lives estimated to be three years. for trade receivables that are not past due, taking into account good historical collection experience, management records an impairment charge only where there is a specific risk of non-collection. the royalty element which is payable based on gross margin on sales to one particular customer has been revised downwards to nil as at the year end as a result of a change of strategic focus by that customer. the associated customer relationship intangible was also impaired in full as discussed in note 12. the core element which is payable on a multiple of ebitda for each calendar year to december 2018 has been revised downwards based on current estimates of future trading. however, no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties against group companies unless the directors, taking into account professional advice
