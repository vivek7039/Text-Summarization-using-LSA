nothing in this year’s annual report and financial statements should be construed as a profit forecast. company number: 6018973. percentage change figures for all performance measures, other than profit or loss before taxation and earnings per share, unless otherwise stated, are quoted after restating prior year figures at a constant exchange rate (‘cer’) for 2017 in order to present the underlying performance variance. our strategy is focused on delivering sustainable growth, enhancing profitability and making efficient use of capital. we made more good progress against our strategy in 2017 and it is particularly pleasing to see the strong performance delivered by ipf digital. rate cap proposals, changes to tax law and more stringent creditworthiness assessment requirements impacted how we do business. additionally, a comprehensive set of changes to polish corporate income tax came into force on 1 january 2018. the main impact for our business is a one-off deferred tax charge of £30 million which has been reflected in the 2017 financial statements. we have strong leaders and talented people who are delivering on our strategy and, on behalf of the board, i would like to thank our team for their contribution in delivering the results set out in this annual report. home credit our customers strategic report international personal finance plc annual report and

on pages 36-43 14 delivering on our multi-channel strategy chief executive officer’s review q. international personal finance has changed in the six years you have led the group. today, we face competition from multiple digital lenders and banks are taking a keen interest in our best customers. as a result, we have developed a programme of increased engagement with those who are likely to influence how business is conducted and we now work more effectively through local trade bodies to help put the case forward for sensible and well thought through regulation. while there is some truth to this, and we have seen an explosion in the number of digital providers, to be successful requires experienced leadership, well-developed scorecards, the right products, trusted brands and an excellent customer journey. our digital business, having been in existence for more than ten years, meets all of these criteria and its results are a clear indicator that we are on the right path to build a large and complementary business to our home credit operation. growing our digital lending business and demonstrating that the ipf digital business model can deliver a good financial return are key strategic priorities for the group, and we made good progress against both of these objectives. if consumers have not dealt with us before, they may choose to obtain a loan from our purely digital brands. i’m sure that most ceos would say that ethics are very important for their business, but, in our case, we would not have a sustainable business without a very clear and strong ethical culture throughout the organisation. key performance indicators customer numbers ('000) customer retention (%) employee and agent retention (%) 2,290 59.7% home credit 70.6% ipf digital 75.2% employee

2016 24.4% 2017 performance roa is measured as profit before interest and exceptional items, after pre- exceptional tax, and divided by average net receivables. performance revenue, which is income generated from customer receivables, increased by 1% driven by our customer retention strategy to serve customers with longer- term, lower-yielding products and the impact of the lower total cost of credit rate cap in poland. why we measure it profitability is maximised by optimising the balance between growth and credit quality. our home credit business model has operated for over 130 years and proven resilient to economic downturns. we provide customers with an entry point to access mainstream consumer finance and we have found that, over the years, many of our customers entrust us with their borrowing needs time after time, demonstrating the confidence they place in our service. supporting people who are not well served by other mainstream credit providers or excluded altogether comes with higher risks and we understand that some of our home credit customers will take a little bit longer than contractually obliged or won’t fully repay their loans, and so we price our loans to take this into account. our previous guidance, based on accounting standard ias39, was that we expected ipf digital to deliver its maiden profit in 2018. under the new accounting standard ifrs 9, the timing of impairment and therefore profit recognition, particularly in our new markets which are growing strongly, will be negatively impacted. in addition, we believe that the group return on equity (roe) metric is a good measure of overall returns for shareholders. 34 under ifrs 9, our preliminary assessment is that profit in 2017 would have been around 6% to 8% lower than under the current accounting standard which is principally due to lower net revenue generation in ipf digital and our mexican home credit business, where receivables portfolios are growing. ifrs 9 is an accounting change that has no impact on the business model, credit quality, cash flows and economic value or returns. the policies are designed to provide robust risk management, even in more volatile financial markets and economic conditions within our planning horizon. we choose not to hedge the translational risk of foreign currency movements on accounting profits and losses. we maintain our euro medium term note programme as the main platform for bond issuance across a range of currencies. therefore, we do not expect fluctuations in the value of sterling to have a major impact on our funding

technological remit and we are rolling out mobile technology applications to agents. we strengthened our group- level leadership team with the appointment of a new group hr director and chief legal officer. likelihood while we operate in numerous markets, the likelihood of a change in economic markets that we are unable to respond to, and that impacts our strategy, is minimised by our short-term lending business models. we strive to ensure that our agents and employees can carry out their work without risk of harm. the credit risk environment in our established ipf digital markets is generally stable with very low loss rates. adherence to board-approved policies monitored through the treasury committee, finance leadership team and regular board reporting. gerard ryan chief

positions: ipf operates in multiple jurisdictions where the taxation treatment of transactions is not always certain. pwc and kpmg were engaged to support specific thematic audits where specialist

supervised by the national bank of romania for the first time. we introduced an ethics board game which is tailored to our business and allows home credit employees in the field to discuss and explore our code of ethics within the context of their everyday roles. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. in addition going concern is not a key audit matter, and has therefore been considered above. in years when we do not visit a significant component we will include the component audit partner and team in our team briefing, discuss their risk assessment, and review documentation of the findings from their work. peter birch fca (senior

receivable from customers are stated at amortised cost an d calculated in accordance with the group’s accounting policie s. those amounts receivable from customers th at are neither past due nor

significant proportion of the amounts receivable from customers attracting an impairment charge. 122 notes to the financial statements continued 122 21. risks arising from financial instruments
