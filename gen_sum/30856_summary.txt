we made more good progress against our strategy in 2017 and it is particularly pleasing to see the strong performance delivered by ipf digital. if consumers have not dealt with us before, they may choose to obtain a loan from our purely digital brands. supporting people who are not well served by other mainstream credit providers or excluded altogether comes with higher risks and we understand that some of our home credit customers will take a little bit longer than contractually obliged or won’t fully repay their loans, and so we price our loans to take this into account. in addition, we believe that the group return on equity (roe) metric is a good measure of overall returns for shareholders. ifrs 9 is an accounting change that has no impact on the business model, credit quality, cash flows and economic value or returns. the policies are designed to provide robust risk management, even in more volatile financial markets and economic conditions within our planning horizon. we maintain our euro medium term note programme as the main platform for bond issuance across a range of currencies. therefore, we do not expect fluctuations in the value of sterling to have a major impact on our funding position. in an environment of increasing competition and broadening customer choice, ensuring our product meets customers’ needs is critical to delivering growth. lead responsibility: chief executive officer our change programme encompasses a broad technological remit and we are rolling out mobile technology applications to agents. we strengthened our group- level leadership team with the appointment of a new group hr director and chief legal officer. in addition, we only engage executive search firms, which have signed up to the voluntary code of conduct on

years since tony hales was first elected to the board. • provision for uncertain tax positions: ipf operates in multiple jurisdictions where the taxation treatment of transactions is not always

approved remuneration policy, based on a combination of market information, internal relativities and individual experience. gerard ryan – chief executive officer category objectives results people resource and build a high-performance senior management team with capabilities linked to delivering our group strategy. in a challenging regulatory and commercial environment the group maintained adequate headroom on undrawn bank facilities, alongside continued successful access to bond markets. executive directors are required to retain half of any vested company share scheme options until the shareholding requirement is met. other members of management may attend meetings by invitation except when matters relating to their own remuneration are being discussed. externally facilitated evaluation was last undertaken in late 2016, led by david mensley of equitycommunications limited, who has no other connection with ipf. it was, therefore, pleasing that shareholders also overwhelmingly approved new rules for equity incentive schemes, which cover a broad range of employees in the organisation. financial instruments are moved back to stage 1 once they no longer meet the
