We have held 95 meetings with investors during the year and I am delighted to welcome a number of new shareholders onto our register. Culture, values and ethics The NHS is Assura’s prime customer, accounting for 86% of our total rent roll. We have robust ethical policies and control procedures which help us ensure that good business ethics are embedded across the Group. Simon Laffin Non-Executive Chairman 22 May 2017 Read about our business model and strategy on page 10 www.assuraplc.com 5 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information CEO review Investment in primary care premises is an essential enabler for the necessary NHS transformations. Jonathan Murphy CEO Overview A year of political disruption has contributed towards uncertainty in the financial and commercial property markets. Despite this backdrop Assura has continued to deliver superior risk adjusted returns built on a secure and long-term income stream funded by the NHS. The strong returns achieved in this five-year period are even more creditable given the development activity of this time has been at historically low levels, as development activity is a key driver of Assura’s returns in two ways. Firstly, we are typically able to source developments at an effective yield on cost that is 100 basis points higher than through acquisitions. We also maintain a database of every primary care property in the UK that enables us to identify and analyse potential acquisition opportunities. This was Assura’s first issue in the US private placement market and demonstrates our ability to attract a new source of long-term funding at an attractive rate. This unsecured funding increases operational flexibility and reduces transaction costs associated with financing the expanding property portfolio. More community pharmacists, nurse practitioners, physician associates and mental health therapists will operate from the primary care setting; however, if primary care premises do not have the capacity to host them, these desperately needed boosts to staffing levels simply cannot be achieved. In recent years investment has dropped to historically low levels despite a number of seemingly positive central initiatives.

This integrated approach enables us to benefit both the tenants and our shareholders in securing lease renewals, property extensions or co-locating appropriate partners such as pharmacies. Communities Our medical centres provide a crucial community resource to aid improved health outcomes in their locations. Using the very latest in solar technology, it is designed to be carbon neutral, generating its own energy for heating and lighting. In order to measure ourselves against this objective we have a wide range of key performance indicators (“KPIs”). Firstly, Total Property Return, which measures our success in choosing the right investments and managing these over time. Strong performance against these measures demonstrates our commitment to building sustainable buildings that improve the local infrastructure. Total Accounting Return 12.0% 2016: 7 .2% Total Shareholder Return 13.2% 2016: (11.4%) Strategic priority KPI and benchmark 22 Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Focus Maintaining a strategic focus on a highly attractive market Rental growth from rent reviews 1.6% 2016: 1.2% IPD annualised five-year Total Return 8.9% IPD: 7 .0%  Rental growth, being the weighted average annualised uplift on reviews settled during the year, provides an indicator of how cost inflation is translated into increased rent. Strong performance against these measures demonstrates our commitment to building sustainable buildings that improve the local infrastructure. This overriding objective is reflected in the long-term management incentive schemes implemented, with rewards linked to both TSR and NAV growth over a three-year period. In order to achieve these objectives, we have four strategic priorities and how we monitor ourselves against them is outlined below: www.assuraplc.com 23 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Resources and relationships Managing our resources to maximise value in the long-term. We also seek to promote from within and there have been several internal promotions during the past few years. In our most recent survey, over 95% of tenants who responded said they would recommend us as potential landlords to other GPs. “ I have worked in conjunction with Assura within my role as a Practice Manager for the past four years. www.assuraplc.com 29 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Principal risks and uncertainties Strategic risks Changes to government policy Risk Avoid Trap Mitigate Movement in year Reduced funding for primary care premises’ expenditure could lead to a reduction in our development pipeline and growth prospects. Net risk rating Comment Estates strategies and STPs have recommended increasing investment in the primary care estate. The Board receives regular property reports, highlighting where we have lost to competitors and when new entrants are identified. Net risk rating Comment The level of gearing is currently at 37% and this provides generous covenant headroom.

A high level of due diligence is undertaken before works commence and detailed designs are negotiated to prevent variations. The appraisal process acts as a two way discussion forum to identify employee aspirations and any dissatisfaction. We liaise with GPs and NHS commissioning bodies to ensure continuing provision of services from that practice. Key: New No change Low Medium High www.assuraplc.com 33 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Business review A year of growth delivering further scale benefits. Our portfolio benefits from a 28% weighting in fixed, RPI and other uplifts which generated an average uplift of 2.49% during the period. During the period we have secured 15 new tenancies with an annual rent roll of £0.4 million covering 4,377 square metres. It is expected that some proportion of dividends paid out in the 2017/18 financial year will need to include a PID element. Simon Laffin Non-Executive Chairman 40 Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 We were delighted to confirm Jonathan’s permanent appointment as CEO in February 2017. We have commenced the search for a new independent Non-Executive Director who will join these Committees and ensure that we comply with Code Provision B.1.2, which requires at least half the Board to be independent, when a new Finance Director is appointed.

Jonathan qualified as a Chartered Accountant with PricewaterhouseCoopers, holding management roles in both the UK and Asia. However, specific pieces of work are commissioned by the Audit Committee to examine particular processes and controls as deemed necessary. 2016/17 also saw various changes in the structure of our Executive Board to reflect Graham Roberts’ very sad death. Remuneration in 2017/18 We do not intend to alter our approach to executive remuneration in the forthcoming year, the main features of which will be:  Base salaries: Jonathan Murphy’s and Andrew Darke’s base salaries will be £335,000 (unchanged) and £225,000 (increased by £5,000) respectively. Our success is measured by three KPIs:  Total Property Return – measuring income and capital appreciation generated from the portfolio.

The Board monitors these systems on an ongoing basis and this year’s review found them to be operating effectively. This has been calculated by reference to kilowatt hours used and miles driven, with appropriate conversion factors applied. We also considered the reasonableness of other assumptions that are not so readily comparable to published benchmarks, such as Estimated Rental Value and void rates. Significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments and investment properties, including investment properties under construction and land which are included at fair value. At the first Measurement Date in August 2015, nil-cost options over 24,999,450 Ordinary Shares were awarded to scheme participants. The Group manages its liquidity risk by ensuring that it has a spread of sources and maturities. Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Sensitivity analysis As at 31 March 2017, 81% of debt drawn by the Group is subject to fixed interest rates. A 0.25% movement in interest rates would change profit by £0.2 million based on the amount of variable rate debt drawn. The Group monitors capital structure with reference to LTV, which is calculated as net debt divided by total property.
