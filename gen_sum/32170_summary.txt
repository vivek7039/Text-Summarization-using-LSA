simon laffin non-executive chairman dear shareholder assura has continued to grow over the last 12 months. last year we set a lower medium-term loan to value (“ltv”) target range of between 40% and 50%. we have held 95 meetings with investors during the year and i am delighted to welcome a number of new shareholders onto our register. our investment case by following our strategies we can deliver long-term shareholder value through:  low volatility of property returns  low default risk  linkage to cost inflation  scalable, internally managed model  covered, progressive dividends  excellent risk adjusted returns. culture, values and ethics the nhs is assura’s prime customer, accounting for 86% of our total rent roll. we have robust ethical policies and control procedures which help us ensure that good business ethics are embedded across the group. although the nhs and primary care policy consensus across all mainstream parties is now more positive than ever before, we remain frustrated by the slow progress in transforming policy into meaningful investment in primary care premises. simon laffin non-executive chairman 22 may 2017 read about our business model and strategy on page 10 www.assuraplc.com 5 strategic report governance financial statements additional information ceo review investment in primary care premises is an essential enabler for the necessary nhs transformations. jonathan murphy ceo overview a year of political disruption has contributed towards uncertainty in the financial and commercial property markets. despite this backdrop assura has continued to deliver superior risk adjusted returns built on a secure and long-term income stream funded by the nhs. the strong returns achieved in this five-year period are even more creditable given the development activity of this time has been at historically low levels, as development activity is a key driver of assura’s returns in two ways. firstly, we are typically able to source developments at an effective yield on cost that is 100 basis points higher than through acquisitions. this means that they are influenced by land and construction cost inflation over the medium term. our in-house development team is currently busier than it has been for a number of years. we also maintain a database of every primary care property in the uk that enables us to identify and analyse potential acquisition opportunities. this was assura’s first issue in the us private placement market and demonstrates our ability to attract a new source of long-term funding at an attractive rate. this unsecured funding increases operational flexibility and reduces transaction costs associated with financing the expanding property portfolio. more community pharmacists, nurse practitioners, physician associates and mental health therapists will operate from the primary care setting; however, if primary care premises do not have the capacity to host them, these desperately needed boosts to staffing levels simply cannot be achieved. yet the level of government investment in primary care premises remains at historically low levels. however, there is a risk that this fails to convert into significant investment on the ground. in recent years investment has dropped to historically low levels despite a number of seemingly positive central initiatives. assura is uniquely placed both to deliver and support in this time of unprecedented change. read more on pages 18–19 focus maintaining a strategic focus on a highly attractive market sustainability investing in our people and social infrastructure expertise responding to the nhs agenda effectiveness leveraging our team’s skills to maximum advantage customer relationships knowledge of gps’ evolving requirements through our involvement in the design and management of medical centres gives us a unique insight into their property needs. this integrated approach enables us to benefit both the tenants and our shareholders in

to take us into the next stages of primary care, and provide our patients with a whole range of new services closer to home.” dr nick pulman, lead gp, long lane surgery. in order to measure ourselves against this objective we have a wide range of key performance indicators (“kpis”). firstly, total property return, which measures our success in choosing the right investments and managing these over time. strong performance against these measures demonstrates our commitment to building sustainable buildings that improve the local infrastructure. total accounting return 12.0% 2016: 7 .2% total shareholder return 13.2% 2016: (11.4%) strategic priority kpi and benchmark 22 assura plc annual report and accounts 2017 focus maintaining a strategic focus on a highly attractive market rental growth from rent reviews 1.6% 2016: 1.2% ipd annualised five-year total return 8.9% ipd: 7 .0%  rental growth, being the weighted average annualised uplift on reviews settled during the year, provides an indicator of how cost inflation is translated into increased rent. strong performance against these measures demonstrates our commitment to building sustainable buildings that improve the local infrastructure. this overriding objective is reflected in the long-term management incentive schemes implemented, with rewards linked to both tsr and nav growth over a three-year period. we also seek to promote from within and there have been several internal promotions during the past few years. thank you for your very kind support.” dr eddie f lee featherstone family health centre 24 assura

facilities increases operational flexibility and reduces transaction costs associated with financing properties. in our most recent survey, over 95% of tenants who responded said they would recommend us as potential landlords to other gps. “ i have worked in conjunction with assura within my role as a practice manager for the past four years. in addition, the long-term nature of leases and debt

darke, property director, to the board in october 2016, retaining responsibility for the property operations and developments. we have commenced the search for a new independent non-executive director who will join these committees and ensure that we comply with code provision b.1.2, which requires at least half the board to be independent, when a new finance director is appointed. copies of these announcements and any accompanying presentational materials are available on the company’s website at www.assuraplc.com. jonathan was previously finance director for the fund management business of brooks macdonald and braemar group plc. jonathan qualified as a chartered accountant with pricewaterhousecoopers, holding management roles in both the uk and asia. however, simon laffin stepped down from the audit committee during his period as executive chairman. time commitments other directorships of the board members are set out on pages 44 and 45. executive directors are permitted to serve on other boards if they can demonstrate this will not interfere with their time commitment to the company. jonathan will continue to fulfil the finance director role until a suitable candidate is found. however, specific pieces of work are commissioned by the audit committee to examine particular processes and controls as deemed necessary. 2016/17 also saw various changes in the structure of our executive board to reflect graham roberts’ very sad death. remuneration in 2017/18 we do not intend to alter our approach to executive remuneration in the forthcoming year, the main features of which will be:  base salaries: jonathan murphy’s and andrew darke’s base salaries will be £335,000 (unchanged) and £225,000 (increased by £5,000) respectively. our success is measured by three kpis:  total property return – measuring income and capital appreciation generated from the portfolio. our remuneration arrangements either directly or indirectly encourage delivery of outstanding performance against these kpis. however, for convenience we have set out opposite a summary of the policy’s key terms: remuneration report continued 54 assura plc annual report and accounts 2017

individual changes position or responsibility. pension/benefits a market competitive suite of benefits is provided, which are reviewed periodically to ensure that they remain appropriate. long-term

with a post vesting holding period also potentially applying. total equity exposure of executives at 31 march 2017 jonathan murphy and andrew darke owned 1,640,346 and 1,159,115 shares respectively as at 31 march 2017. a table summarising their interests is included in the annual report on remuneration (part b below) on page 62). figures provided have been calculated in accordance with the

64. 3. andrew darke joined the board on 3 october 2016 and figures above relate to amounts after appointment only. this involved establishing in advance what would constitute success for good, strong or outstanding performance. up to 50% of any bonus earned by an executive director must be deferred into shares for two years to the extent that the executive director does not already hold shares worth at least 300% of salary. this means that awards rolled over (i.e. accrued but not vested) from previous measurement dates must sustain an 8% p.a. in accordance with guidelines set out by the investment association the company can issue a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling 10-year period to employees under all its share plans, with an inner 5% limit applying to discretionary plans. relative importance of spend on pay the table below sets out the overall spend on pay for all employees compared with the returns distributed to shareholders: significant

approached as follows:  graham received his usual pay, pension and car allowance plus contractual benefits up to his death. the board monitors these systems on an ongoing basis and this year’s review found them to be operating effectively. the views of employees are taken into account when making decisions that might affect their interests. we also considered the reasonableness of other assumptions that are not so readily comparable to published benchmarks, such as estimated rental value and void rates. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. this results in full scope audit procedures performed on 99% of the group’s net assets. 2. significant accounting policies basis of preparation the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments and
