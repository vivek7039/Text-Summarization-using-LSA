it is disappointing that reduced client activity impacted revenue performance for much of the year, but i am pleased that the strength of our platform, team and service proposition has continued to attract new, high quality clients and our existing clients are putting more money to work with us. clearly regulatory change is likely to have some impact on the business, but we believe we are well

whilst i am pleased to present the group’s results in our first full year since listing on the london stock exchange, there is no doubt that the past year has been challenging and disappointing with net operating income down 5% and underlying profit before tax down 22%. we aim to have a long relationship with our clients and this has been achieved as illustrated through the fact that approximately 32% of our active clients have been with us for over three years which is significantly higher than the industry average. from a digital perspective we have focussed on our mobile marketing capabilities, whilst also continuing to improve websites and the client journey. we have very talented people across all areas of the group and their commitment is key to our future success. these are exciting times for the group as we progress our diversification across different continents, products and technology. spread betting provides similar economic benefits to those experienced

benefits: taxable value of benefits received in the year by executive directors comprise private health insurance and, in addition for the ceo, dental insurance. in next year’s directors’ remuneration report, we will provide a full retrospective rationale of why bonuses were paid to ensure that shareholders can clearly identify the close link between pay and performance. in making this assessment the committee looks particularly at sector peers and other ftse 250 (excluding investment trusts) companies. it is anticipated that salary increases will generally be in line with those awarded to the wider employee population. increases may be above this level if there is an increase in scale, scope, market comparability or responsibilities of the role. unpaid/ unvested awards are subject to malus and paid/vested awards are subject to clawback for a three year period from award in the event of a material financial misstatement, gross misconduct, calculation error, failure of risk management, or in any other circumstance the committee considers appropriate. key senior managers are also eligible for ltip awards to further support long term alignment with shareholder interests. ltip performance conditions are consistent for these employees, while award opportunities may vary by organisational level or business area. key senior managers are eligible for consideration of ltip awards, with any vesting based on performance over at least three years. annual incentive awards are subject to malus and clawback for all ltip participants in various circumstances, including a failure of risk management. upon exit or change of control, sip awards will be treated in line with the approved plan rules. we have concluded that the greatest risk of fraud in revenue recognition arises from super user access to systems. individuals with such access could have the opportunity and incentive to commit fraud, including through inappropriate manipulation of revenue recognition. these reconciliations mitigate the risk that super user access to systems could result in inappropriate or fraudulent recognition of revenue. cmc markets plc annual report 2017 financial statements

principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the leasing activities of both lessees and lessors. goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is included within ‘intangible assets’ at cost less accumulated impairment losses. in reassessing asset lives, factors such as technological innovation, product life cycles and maintenance programmes are taken into account. net realisable value is the estimated amount at which an asset can be disposed of, less any direct selling costs. after initial recognition, loans and receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. amounts due from brokers represent funds placed with hedging counterparties, a proportion of which is posted to meet broker margin requirements. after initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. in respect of these losses, £55,258,000 relates to the group’s australian subsidiaries and there are no time limits on their utilisation. for instruments where there is no equivalent underlying market (e.g. countdowns) the group controls its risk through setting low position/exposure limits. client exposures can vary significantly over a short period of time and are highly dependent on underlying market conditions. interest rate risk is felt by the group through a limited number of channels: income on segregated client and own funds; debits on client balances that are over a pre-defined threshold; changes to the value of fixed rate uk government securities held. credit ratings, rating outlooks and cds spreads are reported to senior management on a weekly basis with any changes highlighted. as an alternative, the group reviews negative rating action and large cds spread widening to cis on a case-by-case basis. 30. share-based payment the company operates both equity and cash
