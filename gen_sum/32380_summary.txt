it is disappointing that reduced client activity impacted revenue performance for much of the year, but i am pleased that the strength of our platform, team and service proposition has continued to attract new, high quality clients and our existing clients are putting more money to work with us. clearly regulatory change is likely to have some impact on the business, but we believe we are well positioned to beneﬁt from market share gains in the medium to long term, with our ability to adapt our leading proprietary technology and focus on client service and regulatory compliance supported by

whilst i am pleased to present the group’s results in our first full year since listing on the london stock exchange, there is no doubt that the past year has been challenging and disappointing with net operating income down 5% and underlying profit before tax down 22%. with our award winning technology, focus on client service and strong balance sheet, we believe that as the industry adjusts to these changes we will be in a position to emerge as a stronger business, delivering future growth and shareholder value. however, with this operational leverage we anticipate that when revenues increase there will be a low incremental increase in cost, and therefore believe that our strong client metrics are a good foundation for future earnings growth. this transaction is expected to be highly profitable for both cmc markets and anz bank once we have fully integrated the software and migrated their clients onto our platform which is expected to commence in september 2018. combined with our existing business we will have in excess of 300,000 annually active stockbroking retail clients, a number of intermediaries and total client assets in excess of a$53 billion. cmc markets targets experienced clients through a more feature rich trading platform and excellent client service. we aim to have a long relationship with our clients and this has been achieved as illustrated through the fact that approximately 32% of our active clients have been with us for over three years which is significantly higher than the industry average. when looking solely at financial performance, it has been a mixed year for the initiatives, but we are continuing to make progress across each of them, and will continue to refine them as the regulatory outlook becomes clear. from a digital perspective we have focussed on our mobile marketing capabilities, whilst also continuing to improve websites and the client journey. throughout the year we have continued to make improvements and enhance our award winning next generation technology. i would like to thank our staff for their continued hard work and dedication throughout the year. we have very talented people across all areas of the group and their commitment is key to our future success. these are exciting times for the group as we progress our diversification across different continents, products and technology.

bonuses were paid to ensure that shareholders can clearly identify the close link between pay and performance. following a further review in january 2017, willis t owers watson were appointed as advisors to the committee. the original and adjusted target ranges will be disclosed in next year’s annual report. the table below sets out the performance conditions applicable to these awards: eps

salaries are reviewed on an annual basis, with any increase normally taking effect from 1 april. it is anticipated that salary increases will generally be in line with those awarded to the wider employee population. increases may be above this level if there is an increase in scale, scope, market comparability or responsibilities of the role. over the term of this policy, performance will be predominantly dependent on financial, and/or share price-related measures. unpaid/ unvested awards are subject to malus and paid/vested awards are subject to clawback for a three year period from award in the event of a material financial misstatement, gross misconduct, calculation error, failure of risk management, or in any other circumstance the committee considers appropriate. minor changes the committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without requiring prior shareholder approval for that amendment. remuneration policy for other employees cmc markets' approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the group. key senior managers are also eligible for ltip awards to further support long term alignment with shareholder interests. ltip performance conditions are consistent for these employees, while award opportunities may vary by organisational level or business area. for example, all employees receive a salary which reflects their market value, responsibilities and experience. key senior managers are eligible for consideration of ltip awards, with any vesting based on performance over at least three years. annual incentive awards are subject to malus and clawback for all ltip participants in various circumstances, including a failure of risk management. non-executive directors’ letters of appointment are available to view at the company’s registered office. ‘bad leaver’ not applicable individuals lose the right to their annual incentive and unvested deferred share awards. upon exit or change of control, sip awards will be treated in line with the approved plan rules. consideration of shareholder views the committee is committed to an on-going dialogue on directors’ remuneration. this is used in conjunction with external assumptions such as a region-by-region review of the regulatory environment and incorporation of any anticipated regulatory changes into revenue modelling, market volatility, interest rates and industry growth which materially impact the business. any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. we have concluded that the greatest risk of fraud in revenue recognition arises from super user access to systems. individuals with such access could have the opportunity and incentive to commit fraud, including through inappropriate manipulation of revenue recognition. these reconciliations mitigate the risk that super user access to systems could result in inappropriate or fraudulent recognition of revenue. cmc markets plc is a global company with significant operations in the uk, europe and asia pacific. as

• ifrs 16, ‘leases’ addresses the definition of a lease, recognition and measurement of leases and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the leasing activities of both lessees and lessors. in principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences may be utilised. exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the group’s translation reserve. goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is included within ‘intangible assets’ at cost less accumulated impairment losses. amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives. in reassessing asset lives, factors such as technological innovation, product life cycles and maintenance programmes are taken into account. net realisable value is the estimated amount at which an asset can be disposed of, less any direct selling costs. after initial recognition, loans and receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. economic hedges (held as hedges of monetary assets and liabilities, financial commitments or forecast transactions) these are derivatives held to mitigate the foreign exchange risk on monetary assets and liabilities, financial commitments or forecast transactions. subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against other operating costs in the income statement. amounts due from brokers represent funds placed with hedging counterparties, a proportion of which is posted to meet broker margin requirements. after initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. the group also makes these services available to institutional partners through white label and introducing broker arrangements. group £‘000 year ended 31 march 2017 year ended 31 march 2016 listing costs – 5,884 share based payments (including social security) to directors and employees – 6,214 exceptional costs – 12,098 on 5 february 2016 the company’s ordinary shares were listed on the london stock exchange. in making this assessment account is taken of business plans including the board-approved group budget. in respect of these losses, £55,258,000 relates to the group’s australian subsidiaries and there are no time limits on their utilisation. there are no further netting arrangements or collateral posted which would impact the settlement of these balances. due to the high level of notional turnover there is a high level of internal crossing and natural hedging across instruments and asset classes to mitigate significant single instrument concentration risk within the portfolio. this ‘portfolio effect’ leads to a significant reduction in the group’s net market risk exposure. for instruments where there is no equivalent underlying market (e.g. countdowns) the group controls its risk through setting low position/exposure limits. client exposures can vary significantly over a short period of time and are highly dependent on underlying market conditions. it should be noted that the group not only runs likely and probable scenarios but also extreme case stress scenarios on a daily basis, where the stress factors simulate almost black swan type events to ensure capital adequacy is maintained. interest rate risk is felt by the group through a limited number of channels: income on segregated client and own funds; debits on client balances that are over a pre-defined threshold; changes to the value of fixed rate uk government securities held. cmc is exposed to foreign exchange risk in the form of transaction and translation exposure. credit ratings, rating outlooks and cds spreads are reported to senior management on a weekly basis with any changes highlighted. as an alternative, the group reviews negative rating action and large cds spread widening to cis on a case-by-case basis. negative rating action on cis rated below a3/a-/a- (by moody’s, s&p and fitch respectively) would be escalated directly to the chief financial officer & head of risk in the first instance to decide if any management actions were required. client credit risk the group operates a real-time mark-to-market leveraged trading facility where clients are required to lodge collateral against positions, with any profits and losses generated by the client credited and debited automatically to their account. additionally, short term financial investments, amounts due from brokers and amounts receivable / (payable) on the derivative financial instruments have been included within ‘own funds’ in order to provide a clear presentation of the group’s potential cash resources. 30. share-based payment the company operates both equity and cash settled share options schemes for certain employees including directors. the options have dividend equivalence where additional shares will be awarded in place of dividends on vesting. the options have dividend equivalence where additional shares will be awarded in place of dividends on vesting. movements in the
