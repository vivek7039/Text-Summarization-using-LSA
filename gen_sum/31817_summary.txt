strategic report 16 strategic report measurement why it’s important results link to strategy year-end cash and short-term deposits this measures the availability of cash for corporate purposes. availability of sufficient liquidity is essential, especially where commitments are made to carry out self-funded research and development activities. cost savings were implemented during the year, a fundraise of £8.0 million was completed post-year end and cash will continue to be prudently managed. the placing proceeds and other cash balances will be invested across a number of financial institutions which have investment-grade credit ratings. nanoco has participated actively with regulators on the use of cadmium-based quantum dots in displays and led light products. our laboratories require continuous negative pressure environments and, consequently, it is not possible to set realistic reduction targets in the consumption of electricity. displ a y 30 strategic report
