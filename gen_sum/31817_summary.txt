specialised lighting focus horticulture phototherapy we are focused on continually developing and scaling up cfqd ® quantum dots that are fit for purpose across large addressable markets. nanoco is a global business with its headquarters in manchester, where the group’s r&d activities are based. however, significant progress has been made in developing demand for our cfqds; an increasing number of manufacturers are now producing demonstration displays incorporating our technology and we are confident that sales will result as these move into commercial production. i am pleased to say that the recent announcement of an equity placing has alleviated liquidity concerns. the company has a compelling go-to-market strategy, with a partnership with taiwan’s wah hong industrial corporation (“wah hong”), alongside its two licensees, the dow chemical company (“dow”) and merck kgaa (“merck”). these routes to market are supported by the company’s own manufacturing facility in runcorn. important progress was made during 2017 in two of the group’s three other target markets: life sciences and specialised lighting. • new production methods have achieved a substantial reduction in costs while increasing the productivity of installed capacity. following detailed technical discussions to establish the customer specification and nanoco film solution options, an iterative program of work is undertaken. this involves computer simulation modelling and multiple film samples to best fit the customer’s display system. we now have a three-pronged go-to-market strategy which will enable us to capitalise on the expected demand for our cfqds. new production methods have achieved a substantial reduction in costs while increasing the productivity of installed capacity. strategic report 08 strategic report commercialisation continued commercialisation – runcorn continued we were pleased to announce in december 2016 that the company had been awarded iso 9001:2015 certification for our production and supply processes, underlining the robust nature of our systems. we will generate revenue from the sale of resin to wah hong and receive a licence fee from wah hong based on its sales and two further milestone payments dependent on the volume of film sold. product from nanoco/ wah hong was used by three manufacturers, hisense, tcl and tpv philips, at ces in january 2017, to demonstrate prototype large screen, uhd, wide colour gamut lcd tvs. the group’s key short-term focus is on tv and monitor projects with near term potential. merck is actively engaged with its potential customers on various cfqd application projects and sells under the livilux ® brand. nanoco also strengthened its intellectual property in electroluminescence with the acquisition of a patent portfolio from kodak eastman. 3.2 million cfqd tvs sold in 2016 24 million displays will be cadmium- free by 2021 read about our markets pages 12-13 read about our sustainability pages 25-31 chief exe

operations. nanoco has participated actively with regulators on the use of cadmium-based quantum dots in displays and led light products. our laboratories require continuous negative pressure environments and, consequently, it is not possible to set realistic reduction targets in the consumption of electricity. audits are performed every three years in line with our duty of care as a waste producer. in addition, group employees come from a range of business backgrounds, not purely research and development. equal opportunities nanoco is committed to a policy of treating all its employees

agm on 10 december 2015 and has been applied throughout the year ended 31 july 2017. transitioning to a commercial organisation presents many challenges to a remuneration process. as a committee, we believe that ongoing dialogue with our major shareholders is of key importance. executive directors are also eligible to participate in the company’s defined contribution scheme (or such other pension plan as may be deemed appropriate). in appropriate circumstances, such as where contributions exceed the annual or lifetime allowance, executive directors may be permitted to take a cash supplement instead of contributions to a pension plan (this would not count towards the bonus or ltip opportunity). under the ltip, awards of conditional shares, restricted stock or nil-cost options (or similar cash equivalent) can be made with vesting dependent on the achievement of performance conditions, normally, over a three-year performance period. stretching performance targets are set each year by the committee taking into account a number of different factors. awards under the ltip will vest early on a takeover, merger or other relevant corporate event. this may include agreement on future increases up to a market rate, in line with increased experience and/or responsibilities, subject to good performance, where it is considered appropriate; • benefits will only be provided in line with the above policy; • pension contributions will only be provided in line with the above policy; • the committee will not offer non-performance related incentive payments (for example a “guaranteed sign-on bonus” or “golden hello”); • other elements may be included in the following circumstances: • an interim appointment being made to fill an executive director role on a short-term basis; • if exceptional circumstances require that the chairman or a non-executive director takes on an executive function on a short-term basis; • if an executive director is recruited at a time in the year when it would be inappropriate to provide a bonus or long-term incentive award for that year as there would not be sufficient time to assess performance. any such payments or awards are excluded from the maximum level of variable remuneration referred to above. where a position is filled internally, any ongoing remuneration obligations or outstanding variable pay elements shall be allowed to continue in accordance with their terms. these other appointments enable directors to accrue further skills and experience from which the company benefits. the remuneration of the directors who served on the

(c) segmental reporting an operating segment is a component of an entity that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. the following bases and rates are used to depreciate classes of assets: laboratory infrastructure – straight line over remainder of lease period (two to ten years) fixtures and fittings – straight line over five years office equipment – straight line over three years plant and machinery – straight line over five years the carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount. (m) intangible assets intangible assets acquired either as part of a business combination or from contractual or other legal rights are recognised separately from goodwill provided they are separable and their fair value can be measured reliably. this includes the costs associated with acquiring and registering patents in respect of intellectual property rights. the nature of those intangibles recognised and their estimated useful lives are as follows: patents – straight line over ten years (n) impairment of assets at each reporting date the group reviews the carrying value of its plant, equipment and intangible assets to determine whether there is an indication that these assets have suffered an impairment loss. cost based on latest contractual prices includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition. (w) new accounting standards and interpretations the following amendments to ifrs became mandatory in this reporting period. ifrs 15 requires the identification of deliverables in contracts with customers that qualify as performance obligations. a cumulative retrospective approach as modified in accordance with the standard is expected to be taken. the group expects to recognise certain assets and liabilities (as outlined in note 25) on initial recognition of this standard, although it is not expected to have a major impact on the consolidated income statement as the group only has a limited number of off-balance sheet leases classified as operating leases under current lease accounting requirements per ias 17 leases. 5. other operating income 31 july 2017 £’000 31 july 2016 £’000 government grants 213 284 other income -
