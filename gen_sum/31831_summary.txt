and making them easier to use. > net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of 0.9x after two acquisitions completed in the year. > oem (torin‑ sifan) launched its new high‑ efficiency revolution 360 range of ec fans into volume production during the year, which offers benefits in both high efficiency and low noise to the european heating, ventilation and air conditioning industry. dear shareholder, i am pleased to present our annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 july 2017, a year in which we have continued to make strong progress in building a more valuable volution group. you can find further details on the group’s three strategic pillars on pages 18 to 19. summary > a further set of strong results in line with our expectations > completed two value‑ adding acquisitions, enhancing our strategic positioning > strong cash generation which supports our continuing strategy to grow through acquisition > full year dividend increased by 9.2% > product innovation receiving industry accolades and underpinning our growth it was a historic year in which vent‑ axia, the uk’s leading ventilation company, celebrated 80 years of innovation since the brand was founded by joe akester in 1936. since then volution has gone from strength to strength, by building on the heritage of our brands. peter hill, cbe chairman strategic report volution group plc annual report 2017 07 performance and results another strong set of results reflects the growth achieved, both organically and through acquisitions, with the group’s revenue increasing by 19.8% to £185.1 million. during the year we commenced a project to rationalise part of our uk manufacturing footprint into one location. although it is still too early to assess the implications for our business and operations over the longer term, we do not believe that there will be any material near‑ term impact on demand for our products. following the completion of ten acquisitions since september 2012, volution is now a more diversified and flexible business. in april 2017 we completed our second internal management development programme (mdp), which consisted of 15 high potential managers from across the group. as a result, the board is confident of delivering good progress in this financial year. the company is now the uk’s leading provider of controlled hybrid and natural ventilation systems, which can help reduce energy consumption by up to 60% for a building that would otherwise be mechanically ventilated and air conditioned. by joining the volution group in december 2016, breathing buildings has greatly widened its market potential. up to 60% more efficient the acquisition of breathing buildings enhances our commercial proposition by providing unique natural and hybrid product solutions. ronnie george chief executive officer up to 60% more efficient volution group plc annual report 2017 14 strategic report high heat recovery efficiency, flexible configuration and low power consumption lead to the lowest life cycle cost on the market. the voltair system solution incorporates a patented cross‑ flow heat exchanger specifically designed with high thermal efficiency, and to eliminate cross‑ contamination of airflows. in addition, voltair system is capable of designing highly flexible configurations for its modular systems. this can be attractive in building consultants’ calculations of whole life costs for voltair system products. excellence in ventilation continued the acquisition of voltair system strengthens our product solutions by offering unique air handling unit design to deliver high efficiencies. voltair system has market‑ leading flexible products which have low environmental impact and provide good, healthy indoor climates. we are delighted to have voltair system as part of the volution group, which is highly complementary to our strong position in the nordic residential refurbishment ventilation products market and further develops our commercial proposition. we continuously develop the four key differentiators that are central to our success: innovation, scale, people and brands. we intend to achieve our goals through a combination of organic growth and selective acquisitions. continue to grow through a focused sales strategy for each of our core market sectors. these relationships between our products will continue to deliver optimised performance and automation, therefore increasing value over time. this introduced a new generation of the intellivent fan, which is our most sophisticated to date. in addition, the intellivent sky was also nominated for an elfack design award due to its innovative interface and modern aesthetics. the flexible design means a solution can be created to fit into any building, no matter how it is configured. the technology can therefore be used in residential buildings, offices, schools, hospitals, nursing homes and industry, all with great results. this unique approach is often preferred by customers as the voltair system units are significantly easier to accommodate in a building. this not only assists with production and purchasing efficiencies, but has also assisted in the extension of product ranges across our sales channels. voltair system air handling unit breathing buildings range extension volution group plc annual report 2017 24 strategic report people in

members are adrian barden, paul hollingworth, tony reading and claire tiney, all of whom are independent non-executive directors, the company complies with this code recommendation. when identifying candidates for appointment to the board, any search firm engaged will be instructed to include gender diversity and a range of diverse backgrounds and capabilities in formulating a long-list of candidates. further details can be found in the governance report on page 55. i am pleased to confirm that this process concluded that the committee had fulfilled its role effectively and did not

new proposed remuneration policy, this is being increased to 200% of salary. 3. ltip awards in this column consist of all awards granted as at the date of this report which are structured as nil-cost options subject to the same performance conditions (being tsr vs direct peer group index, tsr vs ftse companies of a similar size and cumulative average eps growth), with performance measured over three financial years. other benefits received comprise of an annual car allowance paid in cash of £20,000 per annum for the chief executive officer and £15,000 per annum for the chief financial officer, life assurance equivalent to four times annual salary and private medical insurance. this will result in significantly more of the bonus being deferred into shares, creating further alignment with shareholders. ernst & young llp has expressed its willingness to be re-appointed as auditor of the company. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as

statements key audit matters continued management override arising from the presentation of recurring items as exceptional. we determined that exceptional items contain a risk of material misstatement as adjusted performance measures are regularly referred to by management in describing the group’s performance and form the basis of bonuses payable to executive directors. these visits involved discussing the audit approach with the component team and any issues arising from their work, meeting with local management, attending planning and closing meetings, reviewing key audit working papers on risk areas. materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures. we have used calculated materiality based on the group’s profit before tax after adding back non-recurring exceptional items. c) reporting threshold an amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial. volution group plc annual report 2017 98 financial

statements notes to the consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 july 2017 14. intangible assets – other accounting policy intangible assets acquired in a business combination intangible assets acquired in a business combination are identified and recognised separately from goodwill where they satisfy the definition of an intangible asset and their fair values can be measured reliably. where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated, for impairment testing purposes, to a group of cash generating units (cgus). the value in use headroom, for each cash generating unit where these sensitivities would be applicable, has been set out above. goodwill of £5,527,000 reflects certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature. goodwill of £12,000 reflects certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature. goodwill of £3,859,000 reflects certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature. it is expected that the full contractual amounts for trade and other receivables can be collected. goodwill of £3,415,000 reflects certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due

interest method. provisions for the expected costs of maintenance guarantees are charged against profits when products have been invoiced. 2017 product warranties £000 property dilapidations £000
