during the year we commenced a project to rationalise part of our uk manufacturing footprint into one location. in april 2017 we completed our second internal management development programme (mdp), which consisted of 15 high potential managers from across the group. up to 60% more efficient the acquisition of breathing buildings enhances our commercial proposition by providing unique natural and hybrid product solutions. the voltair system solution incorporates a patented cross‑ flow heat exchanger specifically designed with high thermal efficiency, and to eliminate cross‑ contamination of airflows. excellence in ventilation continued the acquisition of voltair system strengthens our product solutions by offering unique air handling unit design to deliver high efficiencies. we continuously develop the four key differentiators that are central to our success: innovation, scale, people and brands. in addition, the intellivent sky was also nominated for an elfack design award due to its innovative interface and modern aesthetics. the flexible design means a solution can be created to fit into any building, no matter how it is configured. the technology can therefore be used in residential buildings, offices, schools, hospitals, nursing homes and industry, all with great results. this unique approach is often preferred by customers as the voltair system units are significantly easier to accommodate in a building. this not only assists with production and purchasing efficiencies, but has also assisted in the extension of product ranges across our sales channels. we continue to provide differentiation for each of our brands through advanced controls, modified functionality and other added value features. financial performance tracks our performance

reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated, for impairment testing purposes, to a group of cash generating units (cgus). the value in use headroom, for each cash generating unit where these sensitivities would be applicable, has been set out above. goodwill of £5,527,000 reflects certain intangible assets that cannot be
