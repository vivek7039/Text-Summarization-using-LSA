During the year we commenced a project to rationalise part of our UK manufacturing footprint into one location. Following the completion of ten acquisitions since September 2012, Volution is now a more diversified and flexible business. VoltAir System has a capability to supply highly configurable, specialised solutions for heat recovery ventilation in new construction projects. In April 2017 we completed our second internal Management Development Programme (MDP), which consisted of 15 high potential managers from across the Group. Up to 60% more efficient The acquisition of Breathing Buildings enhances our commercial proposition by providing unique natural and hybrid product solutions. The VoltAir System solution incorporates a patented cross‑ flow heat exchanger specifically designed with high thermal efficiency, and to eliminate cross‑ contamination of airflows. Excellence in Ventilation continued The acquisition of VoltAir System strengthens our product solutions by offering unique air handling unit design to deliver high efficiencies. VoltAir System has market‑ leading flexible products which have low environmental impact and provide good, healthy indoor climates. We continuously develop the four key differentiators that are central to our success: Innovation, Scale, People and Brands. These relationships between our products will continue to deliver optimised performance and automation, therefore increasing value over time. In addition, the Intellivent Sky was also nominated for an Elfack Design Award due to its innovative interface and modern aesthetics. The flexible design means a solution can be created to fit into any building, no matter how it is configured. The technology can therefore be used in residential buildings, offices, schools, hospitals, nursing homes and industry, all with great results. This unique approach is often preferred by customers as the VoltAir System units are significantly easier to accommodate in a building. This not only assists with production and purchasing efficiencies, but has also assisted in the extension of product ranges across our sales channels. We continue to provide differentiation for each of our brands through advanced controls, modified functionality and other added value features.

The plastic injection moulding facility located in Gemla in Sweden benefited from an investment programme which enabled the installation of a new, highly efficient injection moulding machine together with a pair of pick and pack robots, enabling lights‑ out night‑ time operation to increase capacity and reduce cost. Our range of large EC blowers has also performed well within the fan refurbishment and OEM production segments.

Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated, for impairment testing purposes, to a group of cash generating units (CGUs). The value in use headroom, for each cash generating unit where these sensitivities would be applicable, has been set out above.
