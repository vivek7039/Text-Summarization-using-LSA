On 30 September, Melanie Gee stood  down as a Non-Executive Director and  Chair of the Remuneration Committee,  having served for six years. In January 2018, Stephen Young, former  CEO of Meggitt plc, joined the Board and  he will succeed Alan Ferguson as Audit  Committee Chairman from 28 April 2018. They are:  • Improved sustainable engagement   and organisational effectiveness • Increased market share • Improved percentage of revenues   from new solutions • Sustainably higher margins through   the cycle These indicators will guide our short-   to medium-term progress and will   require excellent execution of our  strategy, building on the good   progress delivered in 2017. Oil  & Gas also outperformed North American  rig count growth, leveraging their key  account management programme to build  even closer relationships with leading  oilfield services companies. As a  result of previous reductions in fixed   costs, the facility delivered excellent  operating leverage that contributed   to its overall performance. Our medium-term key performance indicators are shown below:   People Improved sustainable engagement  score and increased organisational  effectiveness   Customers Increased market share   Technology Improved percentage of revenues  from new solutions   Performance Sustainably higher margins  through cycle Outlook for 2018 Customers in our main markets are  expected to increase investment in 2018  with global mining expenditure expected  to increase after a prolonged downturn. Increasing customer productivity Overview Part of the Group’s strategy has been to  extend into adjacent markets where we  can leverage our technology leadership  and materials science expertise. These include smart  factories and advanced manufacturing,  where we have already seen initial  benefits from the 3D printing of some  component parts. For example, by capturing  vibration data on a mining screen, we can  gain detailed insights into the equipment’s  behaviour. Strategy in Action:  Performance Utilising Value Chain Excellence (VCE)  to deliver improved efficiencies for   our customers and drive change   across the organisation. By adopting lean manufacturing  tools such as value stream mapping,  ‘kaizens’ and a daily ‘war room’ for team  meetings, they identified opportunities   to increase productivity. Flow Control revenue increased by   4% on a constant currency basis to  £365m (2016: £350m), with aftermarket  revenues unchanged from the prior year  and original equipment revenues up 7%  driven by delivery of a large part of the  legacy order book for downstream oil   Results summary Continuing operations 1  £m 2017 2016 As  reported Constant  currency 2 Orders 2 2,395 1,989 n/a 20% Revenue 2,356 1,845 28% 19% Operating profit 3 292 214 36% 25% Operating margin 3 12.4% 11 .6% +80bps +60bps Net finance costs 3 (42) (44) 5% 2% Profit before tax 3 250 170 47% 32% Reported profit after tax 162 43 274% n/a Cash from operations 4 221 293 -25% n/a Net debt 843 835 -£8m n/a Net debt / EBITDA 5 2.5 2.8 11% n/a Effective tax rate 23.9% 22.5% +140bps n/a Earnings per share 3 86.7p 61 .2p 42% n/a Dividend per share 44.0p 44.0p – n/a ROCE 6  10.4% 7 .5% +290bps n/a The Financial Review includes a mixture of GAAP measures and   those which have been derived from our reported results in order   to provide a useful basis for measuring our operational performance. While overall mining capital spending   was stable, sustaining expenditure  increased by 5% as miners sought to  optimise production from existing assets. While there was no significant new  investment in oil sands projects, production  increased overall, supporting demand for  aftermarket spares and services. This close customer intimacy gave the  division improved insight, allowing it to  anticipate additional demand, particularly  for integrated solutions that optimise  production of existing assets. Good progress was  made globalising newer product lines  such as the comminution offering and  Delta Valves while new technology  introductions included advanced spools  for oil sands applications. The divisional workforce  grew by approximately 1,000 with   its main manufacturing facility in Fort  Worth, Texas, moving from one shift   to three. This  continuous-duty pump delivers   a 17% reduction in total cost  of ownership through reduced  downtime as fewer backup   pumps are required on site. Short term margin dilution is acceptable in  gaining market entry but over the cycle we  aim for top quartile operating margins and  returns on capital. Otherwise, we are at risk of incurring  unnecessary costs during downturns,   and not maximising our potential for   growth in buoyant markets. Mark Claffey stated: “I am proud of the  Ipswich plant employees who have  embraced and actively participated in  this safety process. This was followed   by regular CEO briefings and the  introduction of a direct ‘AskJon’ email  address via which employees can raise   any issues they may have. Further details of our people   development programmes can   be found at www.careers.weir These innovations were in addition   to more established communications  channels such as the Group intranet   and bulletin newsletter.

Stage 2 Interviews held with 22 individuals, namely:   the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer,   Chief Financial Officer, Senior Independent  Director, all Non-Executive Directors,  Company Secretary and General Counsel,  all members of the Group Executive  Committee, Group Financial Controller,   Head of Internal Audit, PwC Audit Partner,  Remuneration Advisers EY and Deloitte. As part of their inductions, both   Clare and Barbara attended a briefing  session with external legal counsel   on Directors’ Duties. There   are monitoring controls at operating  company, regional, divisional and   Group level, including standard key  performance indicators, with action   plans to address underperforming areas. We have committed  to ensure that a third of the Board,  Group Executive members, and their  direct reports are female by 2020. Our work has focused on ensuring that these items were  exceptional due to their size, nature and/or frequency,  taking cognisance where appropriate of multi-year  restructuring programmes. Restricted   Share awards do not have conventional  performance conditions which might  apply to an LTIP, reflecting their  different purpose and design.

We also delivered strong  order growth in both our Oil & Gas and  Minerals divisions as demand for their  solutions increased. Maximum award size significantly reduced by 50% from previous LTIP  award levels (the rationale for this discount is discussed in more detail   in the next section):  • CEO 125% of base salary • CFO 100% of base salary Vesting phased over a five-year period, with vested shares released  between five and seven years from grant. With Restricted Shares, executives are  strongly incentivised to take actions that  will enhance long-term performance  rather than short-term shareholder  value given the phased vesting and  release profile. Our ‘starting  point’ for the conversion was to confirm  that total compensation is positioned  around median against similarly sized   UK companies and therefore we were  not embedding any excessive quantum. All financial measures are calibrated with payment   on a straight line basis between threshold (up to   20% of maximum bonus payable) and stretch.

Accordingly, the gain or loss on disposal of a foreign operation does not include currency translation differences arising before  that date. Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arm’s length basis, in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. There are certain intangible assets included in the £51.6m of goodwill recognised that cannot be individually separated and  reliably measured due to their nature. The Group tests goodwill and intangible  assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired. It is expected that all costs related to such claims will have been incurred within five years of the balance sheet date. The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, for which a deferred  tax liability has not been recognised, aggregate to £1,971.9m (2016: £1,986.6m). As at 31 December 2017, the Group had derivative financial instruments of £10.2m which  were subject to master netting arrangements but not offset. Exposures to those counterparties are regularly reviewed and, when the market  view of a counterparty’s credit quality changes, adjusted as considered appropriate.
