board changes as previously announced, there were some significant changes to the composition of your board in 2017. on 30 september, melanie gee stood down as a non-executive director and chair of the remuneration committee, having served for six years. the group’s total incident rate (tir), our primary measure of safety performance, reduced from 0.66 to 0.53, a 20% improvement. that includes agreeing new key performance indicators to be delivered over the medium term, starting in 2018. they are: • improved sustainable engagement and organisational effectiveness • increased market share • improved percentage of revenues from new solutions • sustainably higher margins through the cycle these indicators will guide our short- to medium-term progress and will require excellent execution of our strategy, building on the good progress delivered in 2017. this time last year i set out our new ‘we are weir’ strategic framework. as 2017 progressed, ‘we are weir’ gained real traction across the business with teams from all over the world contributing to a vibrant debate about how best to execute our new strategy and deliver strong returns for all our stakeholders. this approach helps embed weir even further into the operations of our customers and differentiates us more clearly from competitors. oil & gas also outperformed north american rig count growth, leveraging their key account management programme to build even closer relationships with leading oilfield services companies. as a result of previous reductions in fixed costs, the facility delivered excellent operating leverage that contributed to its overall performance. after a restructuring of its sales and marketing capability, the division is now clearly focused on capturing future growth opportunities. our medium-term key performance indicators are shown below: people improved sustainable engagement score and increased organisational effectiveness customers increased market share technology improved percentage of revenues from new solutions performance sustainably higher margins through cycle outlook for 2018 customers in our main markets are expected to increase investment in 2018 with global mining expenditure expected to increase after a prolonged downturn. 10 the weir group plc annual report and financial statements 2017 jon stanton chief executive officer chief executive officer’s q&a building a stronger legacy q what are your reflections on your first full year as weir ceo? i think we’ve done that well, particularly in oil & gas, where the recovery was steepest. as a truly global business that serves natural resources and energy customers, there are many issues we look at. take comminution (crushing, grinding and screening), where we increased capability with the acquisition of trio engineered products in 2014. this allowed us to offer our mining customers a wider portfolio of products while also giving us access to sand and aggregates markets. so where there are opportunities to accelerate our strategy through disciplined mergers and acquisition activity, we’ll take them. • refreshed leadership training and undertook a global programme of increased employee engagement to embed we are weir. • refreshed leadership training and undertook a global programme of increased employee engagement to embed we are weir. overall, this emphasis on behavioural safety helped achieve a 20% improvement in total incident rate to 0.53. roberto kuahara, divisional vice president of operations and value chain excellence at weir oil & gas, led the team that delivered behavioural safety training to 90% of weir pressure pumping. 15 the weir group plc annual report and financial statements 2017 strategic report corporate governance financial statements additional information strategy in action: customers the group is moving from a traditional focus on selling individual products to a solutions mindset across our new and established markets. increasing customer productivity overview part of the group’s strategy has been to extend into adjacent markets where we can leverage our technology leadership and materials science expertise. this approach, combined with the division’s integrated solutions strategy to focus on helping customers improve the productivity of their existing or brownfield assets, has increased weir’s installed base of original equipment in markets that generate significant aftermarket demand for spares and services. the aggregates plant, which has been operating since 2006, used older model crushers and screens with outdated technology. this led to high wear on crusher liners, increased oil consumption and costly unplanned downtime, that all impacted productivity. these include smart factories and advanced manufacturing, where we have already seen initial benefits from the 3d printing of some component parts. for example, by capturing vibration data on a mining screen, we can gain detailed insights into the equipment’s behaviour. readings and critical extracts of the real-time data are sent to the cloud where it can be displayed on our customers’ performance dashboard, sent as an alert to their mobile device or stored for further analysis using analytical tools. 19 the weir group plc annual report and financial statements 2017 strategic report corporate governance financial statements

capital spending was stable, sustaining expenditure increased by 5% as miners sought to optimise production from existing assets. while there was no significant new investment in oil sands projects, production increased overall, supporting demand for aftermarket spares and services. this close customer intimacy gave the division improved insight, allowing it to anticipate additional demand, particularly for integrated solutions that optimise production of existing assets. 29 the weir group plc annual report and financial statements 2017 strategic report corporate governance financial statements additional information to take full advantage of these positive trends the division was proactive, investing in additional sales, engineering and project management capability. good progress was made globalising newer product lines such as the comminution offering and delta valves while new technology introductions included advanced spools for oil sands applications. outlook for 2018 miners are expected to increase sustaining capital expenditure in 2018, supporting global ore production growth. assuming supportive market conditions continue, it is anticipated the division will deliver moderately higher constant currency revenues and slightly higher full year operating margins, with performance supported by both the strong order book and investment in growth initiatives in 2017. operational review: weir minerals continued 30 the weir group plc annual report and financial statements 2017 1,140 1,201 1,287 2015 2016 2017 revenue 1 £m 220 234 227 2015 2016 2017

data allows us to make informed decisions about our business. progress to strengthen the group’s defences in this respect is being made through our it next programme. we continually review the effectiveness of our key it security controls in consultation with external experts. there is regular reporting of unplanned outages and potential security breaches, with lessons learned across the group. all businesses now complete vce self-assessments, including value stream segmentation, model design and improvement project identification. we continue to monitor the direction of brexit negotiations and any potential impacts directly on our uk manufacturing base. otherwise, we are at risk of incurring unnecessary costs during downturns, and not maximising our potential for growth in buoyant markets. impact on strategy why we think this is important we operate in an increasingly complex and competitive environment where customers are not only highly focused on price and service but are also more challenging in contract negotiations. the tools and training available to employees responsible for contract management are similarly under continuous review. there is a formal she assurance programme with issues escalated as required through the reporting structures. the output of this plan is used to perform central debt and headroom profile analysis, which includes a review of sensitivity to ‘business as usual’ risks, such as profit growth, working capital variances and return on capital investment. mark claffey stated: “i am proud of the ipswich plant employees who have embraced and actively participated in this safety process. diversity and inclusion (d&i) as a global company operating in over 70 countries, we benefit from a wide diversity of talents and aim to ensure everyone is given the opportunity to flourish regardless of their gender, race, beliefs or background. • d&i plans were developed by every business unit and there has been good initial progress. this was followed by regular ceo briefings and the introduction of a direct ‘askjon’ email address via which employees can raise any issues they may have. there was a strong uptake, with more than 4,000 members regularly sharing stories and collaborating across the world. further details of our people development programmes can be found at www.careers.weir these innovations were in addition to more established communications channels such as the group intranet and bulletin newsletter. jenny mcgeough manufacturing director, weir minerals netherlands we need to encourage and attract more women at all levels of the organisation. • driving best practice: a cross- business group working on group- wide d&i priorities including diversity training. during 2017, we established #weirunitedindiversity, on yammer, which is being used by our employees to share knowledge, learning and best practice. leaders’ awards is a free-to-schools programme, where pupils from both primary and secondary schools engage with engineers. as part of the programme, pupils interview an engineer and then, inspired by them, use engineering to solve a problem. they illustrate their invention and all entries are marked by engineers or those working in the industry. weir’s own engineers are also working with primary engineer in schools where they have a presence, attending some of these sessions. • we are a member of opportunity now which empowers employers to accelerate change for women in the workplace. this membership enables us to support transparency international’s global movement of seeking a world free from corruption. the code of conduct provides a clear framework for decision-making in line with our values and behaviours. introduction 62 the weir group plc annual report and financial statements 2017 conflicts of interest our conflicts of interest policy places particular emphasis on outlining what may constitute a conflict and the correct process for disclosing any perceived conflict to management. our human rights policy has also been updated to ensure it reflects recent legal developments in this area. along with internal briefings and updates, we have prepared a conflict minerals policy in order to ensure compliance as necessary. 63 the weir group plc annual report and financial statements 2017 strategic report corporate governance financial statements additional information sustainability review our communities building relationships with our local communities weir is a global business which operates in over 70 countries. we strive to build close relationships in our communities by keeping local people informed about projects which might affect them. we recognise that as an organisation with a global reach, our influence is not insignificant, particularly in developing countries. we recognise that contributing to these important areas can have an enduring positive effect on the local area. although our focus is on engineering, we also provide work placements and internships across all sectors. weir minerals are very proud to be a part of this reputable academic competition and would like to thank every university that has taken part over the last 30 years — the competition wouldn’t be where it is today without their ongoing support and participation. in a competitive world with finite resources, managing the environmental performance of our operations makes good business sense. we are pleased to report a 2.5% increase in overall compliance with environmental standards across our businesses during 2017, compared to that assessed in 2016. environmental protection no environmental incidents, penalties or fines were reported at sites under the operational control of the group during the year ended 31 december 2017. operational resilience as a business with global reach we can be exposed to a wide range of extreme weather events in different geographic locations. the facility is being

oil & gas division were affected to varying degrees. for example, the total mine dewatering solutions provided by weir minerals, drawing on extensive engineering and application expertise. it is important, particularly where water is in short supply that we continue to develop technology to ensure that the water drawn out by dewatering systems becomes a resource for mining or even for other uses by communities surrounding the mine sites. this comprises a 2% decrease in total absolute ghg emissions for the group when compared with 2016 figures. once built, our equipment will enable the advanced washing installation to recycle up to 500,000 tonnes of bottom ash, a by-product from the incineration of household waste in nearby waste-to- energy plants, into valuable raw materials,

management’s assumptions, calculation methodology and treatment of transitional credits as exceptional items were acceptable. as a result, we have seen ‘all or nothing’ vesting outcomes from our ltip

bonus ltip rs directors’ remuneration report continued in developing the proposals set out in this report, we engaged extensively with major investors and shareholder bodies. by increasing the direct exposure to shares both during and post employment, executives have wealth at risk. with restricted shares, executives are strongly incentivised to take actions that will enhance long-term performance rather than short-term shareholder value given the phased vesting and release profile. we recognise that the conversion rate between ltip and restricted shares is a key issue for investors. our

management base these judgements on a combination of past experience, professional expert advice and other evidence that is relevant to each individual circumstance. actual results may differ from these judgements and the resulting estimates which are reviewed on an ongoing basis. provisions for uncertain tax positions are included in current tax liabilities and total £26.6m at 31 december 2017. the group believes it has made adequate provision for such matters although it is possible that amounts ultimately paid will be different from the amounts provided. iii) regular training is organised by the group in our key jurisdictions and encouraged elsewhere to ensure we maintain appropriate standards of technical competence. iv) all personnel involved in filing tax returns are encouraged to share knowledge and seek input on best practice across the group. as permitted by ifrs 1, the group elected to deem cumulative currency translation differences to be £nil as at 27 december 2003. accordingly, the gain or loss on disposal of a foreign operation does not include currency translation differences arising before that date. bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances. after initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. assets held under finance leases are included within property, plant & equipment, initially measured at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, and a corresponding liability is recognised within obligations under finance leases. this information, along with comparable gaap measurements, is useful to investors in providing a basis for measuring our operational performance. fcf reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that we believe is useful to investors as it represents cash flows that could be used for repayment of debt or to fund our strategic initiatives, including acquisitions, if any. ebitda is used in conjunction with other gaap and non-gaap financial measures to assess our operating performance. transfer prices between business segments are set on an arm’s length basis, in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. year ended 31 december 2017 uk £m us £m canada £m europe & fsu £m

has been made from exceptional rationalisation to the warranties and onerous sales contract provision. the temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised, aggregate to £1,971.9m (2016: £1,986.6m). as at 31 december 2017, 3,803 shares (2016: 5,590) were held by the kleinwort employee benefit trust (ebt) with a market value of £0.1m (2016: £0.1m). all leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments. the fair value of occasional one-off conditional awards at grant date is also estimated on this basis. as at 31 december 2017, the group had derivative financial instruments of £10.2m which were subject to master netting
