We invest a great deal of time and resource helping to improve each branch’s revenue. Independent agents that converted to the Hunters brand during the three years to December 2015 have produced revenue in 2017 that is 29% higher; illustrating that our well known national brand, quality and good reputation has delivered improved revenue for our network 1 Source: Price Paid Data to December 2017, Land Registry 2 Source: 2015 survey by The Property Academy 3 Source: Countrywide plc – 8th March 2018, Foxtons plc – 28th February 2018, LSL Property Services plc – 6th March 2018 partners, even against a challenging backdrop as well as significantly reducing their cost of key operating costs, such as portal subscriptions, through our economies of scale and purchasing power. Customer satisfaction is always a key measure and at 95% customer satisfaction rating over the year (2016: 96%) is our sixth year in a row at over 90%, which remains significantly higher than the industry average of 73% 2 . The case to encourage independent operators becomes even more persuasive in providing a way to be part of a stronger group that can also offer significant cost reductions, particularly in terms of portal charges for Rightmove, Zoopla and OnTheMarket. We are already seeing an improved level of enquiries from high quality independent businesses. Our pipeline of new outlets remains healthy and I look forward to updating you as the year progresses. This, alongside its strong reputation for good customer service, has added stature to the brand. EXPERIENCED TEAM An experienced management team with a long track record The Group’s executive management has a long track record of operating both sales and lettings estate agencies, as owners and in developing estate agency franchises. This, alongside its strong reputation for good customer service, has added stature to the brand. These core values are as integral to our internal environment for staff and Franchisees. These values ensure that, as we expand, customers continue to receive the best possible service from us. The great feedback we receive assures us we get this right.” LISA PRESTON, TEESSIDE 1 Source: 2015 survey by The Property Academy 2 Source: Residential Landlords Association – June 2015 Our network has grown to 213 branches (2016: 186 branches).

Chief Executive’s statement The Group has grown its market share of homes sold and let in 2017. So despite market transaction volumes having reduced by 15% turnover, EBITDA and pre-tax profitability have increased. We were delighted that we have converted some stronger independents this year with the average of their incomes before conversion at £173,000 (2016: £153,000) a sign of our increasing success in attracting increasingly stronger businesses. We were delighted that we have converted some stronger independents this year with the average of their incomes before conversion at £173,000 (2016: £153,000) a sign of our increasing success in attracting increasingly stronger businesses. We have devoted over £500,000 this year in training and now provide 114 courses, a 41% increase through the Hunters Vocational Qualification, endorsed by Propertymark. Having been one of the first estate agents to launch a national TV advert in 2015, our TV advertising campaign has been followed by a number of our larger and better funded peers. For branches that joined in the three years to December 2015 their revenue is up, on average, by 29%. Nor is improvement just short-term, those who have been converted for 6 years are up, on average, by 84%. Every region we trade in has increased over the last four-year period 2013 to 2017 on average at a Compound Annualised Growth Rate (“CAGR”) of 27%. It is expected that 2018 will see continued network growth, both through conversions of existing businesses and cold starts although we expect conversions to account for a more significant portion of branch growth. We see the uncertainty and impact of proposed tenant fee ban as driving enquiries towards Hunters’ market leading conversion package, designed to allow independent agencies to join with minimal cost, whilst benefiting from a full estate agency package. 2017 43% 16% 41% 2016 North South London 41% 41% 18% “The brand, systems and support offered through Hunters has helped me develop my agency into an award winning business with a formula for success.” HARI PATEL, HUNTERS FRANCHISE PARTNER, HARROW, LONDON. FINANCIAL POSITION The Group has generated strong cashflow from operations of £1.6m (2016: £1.7m) which is expected to continue in 2018. However, it is possible that a Franchisee may from time to time behave in a way that potentially damages the Group, for example, by retaining tenants’ deposits outside the government endorsed tenancy deposit protection scheme. Her roles within Walkers Snack Foods (Division of PepsiCo) included running key accounts, training and integrating sales forces. In 2008 Kevin founded Vizzihome, a market research business, which was later sold to Zoopla. Prior to this, from 2000 to 2006 he was an executive at Williams de Broë PLC in corporate broking where he acted for a number of publicly listed companies, advising on flotations, takeovers, mergers and acquisitions, fund raising and regulatory compliance. Dean subsequently served as Group Finance Director of LSL Property Services plc from 2004 to 2010. The Group appoints based entirely on merit regardless of gender, age, marital status, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, ethnicity or disability. The AGM is set for 10:00am 18 May 2018 at our Head Office, Apollo House, Eboracum Way, York YO31 7RE. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Area of focus How addressed Revenue recognition The Group has several material revenue streams, the most significant of which we consider to be residential property agency sales through own branches, franchising income (through the managed service fee (“MSF”) and any sign-up fees) and lettings income (whether managed properties or lettings only). We included within our cut-off procedures sample testing of deferred income arising on lettings fees in advance. Goodwill in both the consolidated accounts and relevant subsidiaries (as relevant for any goodwill generated on acquisitions of assets and trade) is required to be assessed for impairment annually as it is not amortised. We considered sensitivity analysis, especially where a reasonably possible change in assumptions might give rise to an impairment. For the Parent Company, as a holding company, we considered net assets to be the most appropriate benchmark; we used 4% of net assets restricted to a threshold lower than Group materiality.

The Group recognises identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination regardless of whether they have been previously recognised in an acquired subsidiary’s (or unincorporated business’s) financial information prior to the acquisition. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. After initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The Company has not designated any financial assets upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for any directly attributable transaction costs. 1.11 Equity instruments Share capital represents the nominal value of shares that have been issued. Full details on share options existing as at the year end is given in note 25. • IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’: amendment in relation to the recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses. The Group does not have any major customers which account for 10% or more of revenues. These rates have therefore been considered when calculating deferred tax at the reporting date. No reasonably possible change in assumptions has been identified that would lead to a material impairment. This impairment has been determined by reference to past default experience and known issues.
