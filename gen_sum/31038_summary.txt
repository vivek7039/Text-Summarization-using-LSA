customers, these are the same principles that drive the business today. we invest a great deal of time and resource helping to improve each branch’s revenue. independent agents that converted to the hunters brand during the three years to december 2015 have produced revenue in 2017 that is 29% higher; illustrating that our well known national brand, quality and good reputation has delivered improved revenue for our network 1 source: price paid data to december 2017, land registry 2 source: 2015 survey by the property academy 3 source: countrywide plc – 8th march 2018, foxtons plc – 28th

subscriptions, through our economies of scale and purchasing power. customer satisfaction is always a key measure and at 95% customer satisfaction rating over the year (2016: 96%) is our sixth year in a row at over 90%, which remains significantly higher than the industry average of 73% 2 . the case to encourage independent operators becomes even more persuasive in providing a way to be part of a stronger group that can also offer significant cost reductions, particularly in terms of portal charges for rightmove, zoopla and onthemarket. our pipeline of new outlets remains healthy and i look forward to updating you as the year progresses. this, alongside its strong reputation for good customer service, has added stature to the brand. experienced team an experienced management team with a

business model start-up costs are borne by franchisees but the model makes use of investment made by hunters. we have devoted over £500,000 this year in training and now provide 114 courses, a 41% increase through the hunters vocational qualification, endorsed by propertymark. for branches that joined in the three years to december 2015 their revenue is up, on average, by 29%. nor is improvement just short-term, those who have been converted for 6 years are up, on average, by 84%. every region we trade in has increased over the last four-year period 2013 to 2017 on average at a compound annualised growth rate (“cagr”) of 27%. we see the uncertainty and impact of proposed tenant fee ban as driving enquiries towards hunters’ market leading conversion package, designed to allow independent agencies to join with minimal cost, whilst benefiting from a full estate agency package. however, it is possible that a franchisee may from time to time behave in a way that potentially damages the group, for example, by retaining tenants’ deposits outside the government endorsed tenancy deposit protection scheme. her roles within walkers snack foods (division of pepsico) included running key accounts, training and integrating sales forces. in 2008 kevin founded vizzihome, a market research business, which was later sold to zoopla. ed jones chief financial officer ed jones

context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. we included within our cut-off procedures sample testing of deferred income arising on lettings fees in advance. goodwill in both the consolidated accounts and relevant subsidiaries (as relevant for any goodwill generated on acquisitions of assets and trade) is required to be assessed for impairment annually as it is not amortised. we considered sensitivity analysis, especially where a reasonably possible change in assumptions might give rise to an impairment. richard metcalfe (senior statutory auditor) for and on behalf of mazars llp chartered accountants and statutory auditor 11 april 2018 tower bridge house st katharine’s way

been previously recognised in an acquired subsidiary’s (or unincorporated business’s) financial information prior to the acquisition. where intangible assets are acquired as part of a business combination, cost is determined by reference to a fair value estimation technique as disclosed further in note 15. after initial recognition, intangible assets are recognised at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually. with the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. after initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for any directly attributable transaction costs. full details on share options existing as at the year end is given in note 25. • ias 12 ‘income taxes’: amendment in relation to the recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses. the group does not have any major customers
