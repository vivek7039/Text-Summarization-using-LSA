profit before tax was $40.7m, compared to $34.2m in 2016. this 19% increase reflects a much lower exceptional charge of $0.5m (2016: $2.9m) showing tangible benefit from the successful completion of our pension de-risking exercise. i would like to thank each member of our dedicated team for their remarkable efforts during the year. accordingly, we have developed new balance sheet funding guidelines that will allow us to retain financial and operational flexibility through different economic cycles. the group is financially strong and we have exciting plans for the future.” paul moody an evolving strategy 2012 to 2016 2018 to 2022 2017 focus on direct marketing as the group’s core business — attractive market opportunity — effective business model: organic revenue growth driven by innovative marketing — target to double revenue achieved (17% average annual growth) de-risk legacy defined benefit pension scheme — use proceeds from disposal of non-core businesses and increasing free cash flow generated by operations — culminating in full pensioner buy-out in 2016 capital allocation — pension de-risking clear first priority — regular dividends growing in line with increasing profitability refine strategic priorities moving forward — set strategic plan for further development of the business — funding and capital allocation priorities reassessed — shareholder returns: supplementary dividend announced establish foundation for the next phase — reaffirm focus on organic revenue growth — wrap-up of pension de-risking exercise — confirm unencumbered financial base for the future continued focus on organic revenue growth and market leadership — existing markets still fragmented and attractive — diversify marketing portfolio adding brand awareness component establishing clear position as market leader — revenue target of $1bn by 2022 profitability and cash generation — initial investment phase to test new brand awareness initiatives — marketing projects evaluated based on multi-year revenue/return — business remains highly cash generative throughout funding — maintain stable and secure balance sheet through the cycle — cash ‘buffer’ to retain financial and operational flexibility capital allocation — prioritise organic growth projects — commitment to progressive regular dividends — residual legacy pension funding — mergers and acquisitions — further shareholder distributions as appropriate 06 4imprint group plc annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report chief executive’s review the 2017 financial results represent another year of healthy, profitable organic growth. kevin lyons-tarr chief executive officer underlying operating profit, excluding head office expenses, increased over prior year by 8%. a budget of around $7m has been allocated to this project in 2018. this new initiative will represent incremental investment; it will not be funded through re-allocation of resources away from our existing, proven marketing engine which continues to be an effective growth generator. in recent years our financial strategy has been to maintain a broadly constant operating margin. north america the us and canadian promotional products markets together are estimated to total around $25bn in annual revenue. our product range comprises tens of thousands of individual products ranging from basic giveaways such as pens, bags products available for 24 hour shipment 5,000+ exclusive products 600+ top product categories 1. apparel 2. bags 3. drinkware 4. writing 5. technology 6. stationery 7. tradeshows & signage 8. outdoor & leisure 9. auto, home & tools 10. awards & office product trends our merchandisers track market trends to identify the products customers are looking for: vacuum tumblers were among the top ten hottest items in 2017, with double-wall construction and other insulating advances proving very popular with customers. demand was also strong for bluetooth ® speakers, ear buds and other items driven by the increased use of mobile devices. as such, the group’s cash position is sensitive to foreign exchange movements between these two currencies. since this exercise is now complete, it is not anticipated that there will be an exceptional charge in 2018. net finance expense net finance expense for the year was $0.12m (2016: expense of $0.03m), reflecting non- utilisation fees on the us line of credit, plus interest on tax paid relating to prior years, offset partially by modest interest received on the investment of cash balances in short-term deposits. the board will keep these guidelines under review and is prepared to be flexible if circumstances warrant. the group’s capital allocation priorities are: organic growth investments — either capital projects or those expensed in the income statement — market share opportunities in existing markets interim and final dividend payments — increasing broadly in line with earnings per share through the cycle — aim to at least maintain dividend per share in a downturn residual legacy pension funding — in line with agreed deficit recovery funding schedule — further de-risking initiatives, if viable mergers & acquisitions — not a near term priority — opportunities that would support organic growth other shareholder distributions — quantified by reference to cash over and above balance sheet funding requirement — supplementary dividends most likely method; other methods may be considered in keeping with these capital allocation priorities, and taking into account both the cash generative nature of business operations and the group’s investment plans for 2018 and beyond, the board has recommended a return to shareholders of around $16.8m by way of a supplementary dividend of 60.00c per share, payable in may 2018. financial review continued 17 4imprint group plc annual report and accounts 2017 overview strategic report governance financial statements additional information overview strategic report treasury policy the financial requirements of the group are managed through a centralised treasury policy. the conclusion of this review is that the group has significant financial flexibility, starting with a net cash position, but remaining cash positive even under severe economic stress and able to continue investing in marketing, people and technology, which are key differentiators in its strategy. it is important to note that business operations are conducted from centralised facilities in each territory, with short reporting lines. the list is not exhaustive and other, as yet unidentified, factors may have an adverse effect. potential impact — aggressive competitive activity could result in pressure on prices, margin erosion and loss of market share. — the group’s strategy based on achieving organic growth in fragmented markets may need to be reassessed. potential impact — the financial results of trading operations, and therefore overall profitability, may be negatively affected. in an extreme scenario, the group’s strategic objectives around capital structure and regular dividend commitments could be disrupted. — the group uses forward contracts to hedge anticipated cash receipts from its overseas operations, giving some certainty of amounts receivable in sterling. — relationships are maintained with third party embroidery contractors to provide backup in the event of facility unavailability. mitigating activities — offline: developments in the us postal service are closely monitored through industry associations and lobbying groups. link to strategy — market leadership — organic revenue growth — cash generation and profitability direction there has not been a major movement in these risk factors during the year 22 4imprint group plc annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report principal risks & uncertainties continued operational risks continued reliance on key personnel description of risk performance depends on the business’s ability to continue to attract, motivate and retain key staff. mitigating activities — the business is proactive in aiming to deliver a first class working environment. — an event of this nature might result in significant expense, impacting the group’s ability to meet its strategic objectives. we are committed to a culture that encourages the training, development, wellbeing and participation of every team member. a great place to work business objectives are shared with team members via quarterly briefings, and everyone participates in a quarterly “gain share” bonus plan that is based on achievement of tangible, clearly communicated performance targets. in addition, the pursuit of external educational opportunities and professional qualifications is encouraged through our popular tuition reimbursement programme. the welfare of our team members is also addressed through a competitive benefits package, including strong medical, dental and pension offerings. our intention is to make that impact positive from a social, economic and environmental perspective. the policy addresses such issues as working hours, wages, discrimination, collective bargaining, health & safety and child labour. these ethical sourcing expectations are communicated and reviewed through our document “4imprint’s expectations of supplier factory & product compliance”, signature of which reaffirms the supplier’s commitment to these principles within their own organisation and supply base. 4imprint is run in accordance with the golden rule – treat others as you would wish to be treated yourself. printed marketing materials such as catalogues use paper sourced from sustainable forests, conforming to forestry stewardship council (fsc) requirements. led is essentially maintenance-free and the fixtures will last at least five times longer than fluorescent. the strategic report was approved by the board on 7 march 2018. kevin lyons-tarr david seekings chief executive officer chief

audit procedures at group and significant component level to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. we noted that all assumptions applied were in line with our independently formed assessments, within an acceptable range. these relate to volume based rebates on purchases made from key product suppliers throughout the financial period. the percentage of purchases paid as a rebate from certain suppliers increases based on predetermined thresholds within supplier agreements. we did not identify any material differences between either confirmed rebate income or our expectation and the amounts recognised. we tested purchase transactions around the period end to confirm whether purchases upon which rebate income and receivables are based had been recorded in the correct accounting period and we noted no material exceptions from this testing. the period of total uninterrupted engagement is 25 years, covering the years ended 2 january 1993 to 30 december 2017. ian marsden (senior statutory auditor) for and on behalf of pricewaterhousecoopers llp chartered accountants and statutory auditors manchester 7 march 2018

information 4imprint group plc, registered number 177991, is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the uk and listed on the london stock exchange. the assumptions used are disclosed in note 17. critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgments or estimates and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions or conditions. period end recognition of the liabilities under this scheme and the return on assets held to fund these liabilities require a number of significant actuarial assumptions to be made including inflation rate, discount rate and mortality rates. however, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. on disposal of an operation any cumulative exchange differences held in shareholders’ equity are recycled to the income statement. cash deposits with an original maturity in excess of three months are classified as other financial assets. trade and other payables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material. the group sponsors a defined benefit scheme, which is closed to new members and future accruals. ifrs 16 will result in an increase to both assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, but have no material impact upon operating profit or profit before tax, based upon current lease commitments of the group. at 30 december 2017, the
