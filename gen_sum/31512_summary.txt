tax was 40.7m, compared to 34.2m in 2016. this 19% increase reflects a much lower exceptional charge of 0.5m (2016: 2.9m) showing tangible benefit from the successful completion of our pension

organic growth. kevin lyons-tarr chief executive officer underlying operating profit, excluding head office expenses, increased over prior year by 8%. a budget of around 7m has been allocated to this project in 2018. this new initiative will represent incremental investment; it will not be funded through re-allocation of resources away from our existing, proven marketing engine which continues to be an effective growth generator. north america the us and canadian promotional products markets together are estimated to total around 25bn in annual revenue. demand was also strong for bluetooth ® speakers, ear buds and other items driven by the increased use of mobile devices. as such, the group’s cash position is sensitive to foreign exchange movements between these two currencies. the board will keep these guidelines under review and is prepared to be flexible if circumstances warrant. the conclusion of this review is that the group has significant financial flexibility, starting with a net cash position, but remaining cash positive even under severe economic stress and able to continue investing in marketing, people and technology, which are key differentiators in its strategy. it is important to note that business operations are conducted from centralised facilities in each territory, with short reporting lines. potential impact — aggressive competitive activity could result in pressure on prices, margin erosion and loss of market share. — the group’s strategy based on achieving organic growth in fragmented markets may need to be reassessed. in an extreme scenario, the group’s strategic objectives around capital structure and regular dividend commitments could be disrupted. — the group uses forward contracts to hedge anticipated cash receipts from its overseas operations, giving some certainty of amounts receivable in sterling. — relationships are maintained with third party embroidery contractors to provide backup in the event of facility unavailability. mitigating activities — offline: developments in the us postal service are closely monitored through industry associations and lobbying groups. — an event of this nature might result in significant expense, impacting the group’s ability to meet its strategic objectives. we are committed to a culture that encourages the training, development, wellbeing and participation of every team member. in addition, the pursuit of external educational opportunities and professional qualifications is encouraged through our popular tuition reimbursement programme. the welfare of our team members is also addressed through a competitive benefits package, including strong medical, dental and pension offerings. the policy addresses such issues as working hours, wages, discrimination, collective bargaining, health & safety and child labour. 4imprint is run in accordance with the golden rule – treat others as you would wish to be treated yourself. printed marketing materials such as catalogues use paper sourced from sustainable forests, conforming to forestry stewardship council (fsc) requirements. the strategic report was approved by the board on 7 march 2018. kevin lyons-tarr david

assurance of up to four times base salary; (iv) income protection insurance; and (v) access to independent professional advice when necessary. opportunity the maximum potential award relating to performance in a single financial year is 100% of base salary. we noted that all assumptions applied were in line with our independently formed assessments, within an acceptable range. the percentage

rebate income or our expectation and the amounts recognised. the period of total uninterrupted engagement is 25 years, covering the years ended 2 january 1993 to 30 december 2017. ian marsden (senior
