Kevin Lyons-Tarr Chief Executive Officer Underlying operating profit, excluding Head Office expenses, increased over prior year by 8%. North America The US and Canadian promotional products markets together are estimated to total around $25bn in annual revenue. Awards & office Product trends Our merchandisers track market trends to identify the products customers are looking for: Vacuum tumblers Were among the top ten hottest items in 2017, with double-wall construction and other insulating advances proving very popular with customers. Demand was also strong for Bluetooth ® speakers, ear buds and other items driven by the increased use of mobile devices. As such, the Group’s cash position is sensitive to foreign exchange movements between these two currencies. The Board will keep these guidelines under review and is prepared to be flexible if circumstances warrant. The Group’s capital allocation priorities are: Organic growth investments — Either capital projects or those expensed in the income statement — Market share opportunities in existing markets Interim and final dividend payments — Increasing broadly in line with earnings per share through the cycle — Aim to at least maintain dividend per share in a downturn Residual legacy pension funding — In line with agreed deficit recovery funding schedule — Further de-risking initiatives, if viable Mergers & acquisitions — Not a near term priority — Opportunities that would support organic growth Other Shareholder distributions — Quantified by reference to cash over and above balance sheet funding requirement — Supplementary dividends most likely method; other methods may be considered In keeping with these capital allocation priorities, and taking into account both the cash generative nature of business operations and the Group’s investment plans for 2018 and beyond, the Board has recommended a return to Shareholders of around $16.8m by way of a supplementary dividend of 60.00c per share, payable in May 2018. The conclusion of this review is that the Group has significant financial flexibility, starting with a net cash position, but remaining cash positive even under severe economic stress and able to continue investing in marketing, people and technology, which are key differentiators in its strategy. It is important to note that business operations are conducted from centralised facilities in each territory, with short reporting lines. The list is not exhaustive and other, as yet unidentified, factors may have an adverse effect. Potential impact — Aggressive competitive activity could result in pressure on prices, margin erosion and loss of market share. — The Group’s strategy based on achieving organic growth in fragmented markets may need to be reassessed. Potential impact — The financial results of trading operations, and therefore overall profitability, may be negatively affected. In an extreme scenario, the Group’s strategic objectives around capital structure and regular dividend commitments could be disrupted. — The Group uses forward contracts to hedge anticipated cash receipts from its overseas operations, giving some certainty of amounts receivable in Sterling. — Relationships are maintained with third party embroidery contractors to provide backup in the event of facility unavailability. Mitigating activities — Offline: Developments in the US Postal Service are closely monitored through industry associations and lobbying groups. Link to strategy — Market leadership — Organic revenue growth — Cash generation and profitability Direction There has not been a major movement in these risk factors during the year 22 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT Principal Risks & Uncertainties continued Operational risks continued Reliance on key personnel Description of risk Performance depends on the business’s ability to continue to attract, motivate and retain key staff. — An event of this nature might result in significant expense, impacting the Group’s ability to meet its strategic objectives.

Our audit approach Overview — Overall Group materiality: $2,000,000 (2016: $1,850,000), based on 5% of profit before tax and exceptional items. We noted that all assumptions applied were in line with our independently formed assessments, within an acceptable range. These relate to volume based rebates on purchases made from key product suppliers throughout the financial period. The percentage of purchases paid as a rebate from certain suppliers increases based on predetermined thresholds within supplier agreements. We did not identify any material differences between either confirmed rebate income or our expectation and the amounts recognised. We tested purchase transactions around the period end to confirm whether purchases upon which rebate income and receivables are based had been recorded in the correct accounting period and we noted no material exceptions from this testing.

number 177991, is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK and listed on the London Stock Exchange. Period end recognition of the liabilities under this scheme and the return on assets held to fund these liabilities require a number of significant actuarial assumptions to be made including inflation rate, discount rate and mortality rates. However, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. On disposal of an operation any cumulative exchange differences held in Shareholders’ equity are recycled to the income statement. Cash deposits with an original maturity in excess of three months are classified as other financial assets. The Group sponsors a defined benefit scheme, which is closed to new members and future accruals.
