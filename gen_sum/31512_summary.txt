04 4imprint group plc annual report and accounts 2017 overview chairman’s statement the group delivered another strong operational and financial performance in 2017. profit before tax was $40.7m, compared to $34.2m in 2016. this 19% increase reflects a much lower exceptional charge of $0.5m (2016: $2.9m) showing tangible benefit from the successful completion of our pension de-risking exercise. accordingly, we have developed new balance sheet funding guidelines that will allow us to retain financial and operational flexibility through different economic cycles. demand was also strong for bluetooth ® speakers, ear buds and other items driven by the increased use of mobile devices. the conclusion of this review is that the group has significant financial flexibility, starting with a net cash position, but remaining cash positive even under severe economic stress and able to continue investing in marketing, people and technology, which are key differentiators in its strategy. it is important to note that business operations are conducted from centralised facilities in each territory, with short reporting lines. potential impact — aggressive competitive activity could result in pressure on prices, margin erosion and loss of market share. in an extreme scenario, the group’s strategic objectives around capital structure and regular dividend commitments could be disrupted. — the group uses forward contracts to hedge anticipated cash receipts from its overseas operations, giving some certainty of amounts receivable in sterling. mitigating activities — offline: developments in the us postal service are closely monitored through industry associations and lobbying groups. — an event of this nature might result in significant expense, impacting the group’s ability to meet its strategic objectives. in addition, the pursuit of external educational opportunities and professional qualifications is encouraged through our popular tuition reimbursement programme. the welfare of our team members is also addressed through a competitive benefits package, including strong medical, dental and pension offerings. printed marketing materials such as catalogues use paper sourced from sustainable forests, conforming to forestry stewardship council (fsc) requirements. the strategic report was approved by the board on 7 march 2018. kevin lyons-tarr

thresholds within supplier agreements. we did not identify any material differences between either confirmed rebate income or our expectation and the amounts recognised. the period of total uninterrupted engagement is 25 years, covering the years ended 2 january 1993 to 30 december 2017. ian marsden (senior statutory auditor) for and on behalf of pricewaterhousecoopers llp chartered
