financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. impairment reviews require significant judgement from management and are

and licence compliance that required disclosure or required provisions to be made in the financial statements. we also agreed to report differences below this threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. a full reconciliation between the actual and adjusted results is provided in note 5. playtech plc annual report and accounts 2017 financial statements 111
