New B2B operators or licensees are not able to undertake significant product development as they lack economies of scale. The players of 2018, whether playing online, on mobile or through traditional retail channels, are looking for a seamless experience. Omni-channel is a word you will come across a lot in the gambling industry as operators and content providers alike have realised that they need to provide the same level of service and style of content for customers across different channels be it land based retail or on mobile or desktop. In partnership with licensees GPAS develops content to any precise requirement, flexibly and efficiently, no matter what the need. Logging into the app store style layout operators can access, browse, install and manage any or all their Playtech Omni-channel games content on Marketplace in an instant.

This performance was achieved despite 2017 being an unusual year for headwinds faced, with so many combining including currency headwinds as well as issues in H2 in Asia and the expected loss of Marvel, certain Mobenga contracts and the contract with Poker Stars for Poker Strategy. Most importantly, R&D now has its own line item which serves to highlight the technology base of Playtech’s B2B Gaming business. It is imperative to ensure compliance with all relevant tax regulations and requirements in each jurisdiction that Playtech operates. They have endorsed a fully comprehensive roadmap and been provided with frequent progress updates from the Group Data Protection Office. Likelihood: Medium Impact: High The Group adopts industry standard protections to detect any intrusion or other security breaches, together with preventative measures safeguarding against sabotage, hacking, viruses and cybercrime. This programme aims to ensure our senior leaders are champions in driving a culture of compliance and ethical behaviour. When engaging with local policy makers, Playtech shares its experience in regulated markets to promulgate best practices regarding responsible gambling and consumer protection. The Company’s presence in some markets, such as Austria, Australia and Denmark is a result of acquisitions. Playtech engages constructively with local tax authorities, either directly or through trade associations and other similar bodies, as appropriate. The workshops also provided senior leaders with an in depth understanding of actions and timelines required for compliance. To build on Playtech’s market-leading position, the Company acquired BetBuddy, a leading responsible gambling analytics solution provider, in late 2017. Playtech is now exploring options for future advanced responsible gambling tools to assist game designers, licensees and players. As with iPoker, the Live Casino operation has very limited access to personal information, but Live’s customer support personnel have been trained to identify risky player behaviour and employ a machine learning application that analyses chat for phrases that could indicate a player is at risk. During this period, Playtech completed an AML risk assessment for its B2C operations, using the Gambling Anti- Money Laundering Group’s methodology. As a result of the assessment, Playtech has enhanced its operational procedures relating to VIP & high-risk players, e-wallets and customers changing personal details online. In 2017, Playtech partnered with GamCare to deliver targeted responsible gambling training across B2C operations, including customer service staff, chat moderators, product leads, VIP teams and senior managers. Playtech Estonia also participated in a government initiative called ‘Choose IT’; an adult retraining programme aiming to give participants basic software developer skills. Our 2018 AGM is scheduled for 10.00 am on 16 May 2018 at The Sefton Hotel, Douglas, Isle of Man and we look forward to seeing you there.

NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION Where the Company has control over an investee it is classified as a subsidiary. PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 117 NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS Certain employees participate in the Group’s share option plans which commenced with effect from 1 December 2005. Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated income statement. Other non-financial assets are subject to annual impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. They are classified between current and non-current assets in accordance with the contractual repayment terms of each loan agreement. • Material one-off items, e.g. gain on sale of investment in associates, professional services cost related to acquisitions and other exceptional projects. The Group is required to test other intangibles if events of changes in circumstances indicated that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. NOTE 4 – SEGMENT INFORMATION The Group’s reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services. Where the Group has generated a significant amount of cash, it will invest in higher earning interest deposit accounts. These deposit accounts are short term and the Group is not unduly exposed to market interest rate fluctuations. CREDIT RISK CONTINUED Wherever possible and commercially practical the Group invests cash with major financial institutions that have a rating of at least A- as defined by Standard & Poors.
