With its growing capabilities, following the acquisition of Integritie in May 2017, Rosslyn Data Technologies is well positioned to become the go-to company for organisations seeking to accelerate business outcomes by creating new opportunities from data. Rosslyn Data Technologies has built a powerful platform that provides more than just business insight; the data used by customers for reporting and analysis automatically informs users of what decisions must be taken next. The acquisition of Integritie extends and expands our technological capabilities to meet the growing information needs of operational teams seeking to effectively obtain a complete view of their customers, suppliers and employees.” Roger Bullen CEO, Rosslyn Data Technologies 04 / Rosslyn Data Technologies plc / Annual report and accounts 2017 AT A GLANCE / OUR TECHNOLOGY Enabling organisations to transform raw data into actionable insight. This is all performed over a secure cloud connection, giving access from mobile, laptop or tablet. We deployed a significant element of the IPO funds into our partnership, sales and marketing strategies, whilst ensuring we did not miss any developments that would enable the business to transform to profitability and organic cash generation. We have developed a number of new partnership agreements and continue to roll this programme out around the globe. Microsoft recognised the RAPid platform as one of the top cloud-based platform products in October 2016 and also recognised Rosslyn as a preferred partner, issuing us with their “Co-Sell Recommended Partner” status, a significant achievement for us. Our RAPid Cloud Platform features a comprehensive suite of self-service tools business users need to automatically extract, integrate, load, transform and enrich data. With the development of new data sets becoming available from clients, partners and third parties this trend will continue. Social media and unstructured data sets are now often used for sharing business information. These partnership arrangements allow revenue to grow more quickly than through direct sales alone. Partnerships are already being planned in mainland and northern Europe, whilst our US footprint is nearly all partner led. The joint offering, available now, uses the RAPid cloud-based platform self-service model to integrate global business data to help procurement professionals better identify and manage ever-changing business risks and market opportunities. The solution aims to help organisations find greater savings faster and gain deeper insights into their supply base. With this partnership, Rosslyn Data Technologies is addressing a gap in the market by giving companies self-service tools to access, manage and create unique proprietary business insights previously unavailable with traditional, IT-centric technologies. Downtime arising from such events may have a material detrimental effect upon the Group’s performance and profitability. However, certain events are beyond the management’s ability to build cost- effective solutions. Nevertheless some client turnover can be expected for reasons which do not necessarily reflect poor service. The Group has entered into contractual agreements with these staff members but their continued employment cannot be guaranteed. It is possible that key staff members may join competitors or establish competitor businesses in their own right. Products and new releases are rolled out to the market, after extensive internal testing, in a progressive manner. Such changes in demand may cause an adverse impact on the Group’s performance. It is not always possible to foresee the impact of legislative or regulatory change. These changes may also have an adverse impact on the Group’s financial performance. In virtually all cases these grants are competitive and no guarantee can be made as to the likely success of such applications. Since January 2017, Rosslyn has been facilitating a series of workshops to address this challenge. Through this important ongoing work, we will collaboratively deliver a user-driven, user-accepted and user-maintained analytics asset to support HR leaders make the right decisions for their people.
