My predecessor,  Alastair Lyons, who ably steered the ship for  over 16 years, has left some large shoes to  fill. Most significantly, we have launched  personal loans, firstly unsecured, then car  finance as part of our new Admiral Financial  Services business. It can be distilled into   the following areas: • Highly talented team – David Stevens  leads a strong, capable and experienced  management team which engages the  whole business • Focus – targeted diversification building  on our core skills • Pricing – data analysis lies at the heart   of what we do • Prudent reserving – continuing our  conservative approach to claims reserving • Claims management – consistent positive  feedback from customers on the service  they receive • Controlled test and learn – organic growth  with measured expansion steps • Low-cost approach – constantly  challenging ourselves on how we can   do things more cost effectively  • Shareholder returns – we believe in  returning excess capital to shareholders. The first reason Admiral has been, and  remains, good news for customers is that  we operate at a lower cost than almost all  our competitors. Most of  those are long gone, under the pressure from  upstarts like Admiral and other, lower-cost,  Admiral-like, operators who have followed  in our footsteps. And you cannot build  four million plus customers in the fiercely  competitive UK insurance market without  delivering a good customer experience. Again, this allows us  to be the top most often on price comparison  sites, while also making a profit. Q There has been a change of CEO at   your US insurance operation, Elephant  Auto – what does that mean for   future strategy? A Geraint: It’s still early days for Admiral Loans,  though we’re very pleased with the way  things are going so far.

Over that time, our customer focused  approach and strategy of providing excellent  service at an affordable price has attracted  more than 4.5 million customers. Aside from Car Insurance, our Household  business performed very well once again,  and continues to show significant promise.

Similarly, Great Lakes  reimburses the Group for its proportional share of expenses incurred in acquiring and  administering this business. The Group also purchases excess of loss  reinsurance to provide protection against  large claims and reviews this cover annually. For 2018, the Group  has reduced this level of cover to be back in  line with more recent levels. We continued growth, 23% in  written premiums, while at the same time  drastically reduced our acquisition cost per  policy. This was due to a growing  aggregator market and some effective  TV investments that improved our brand  awareness. Two years ago, a new regulation  was passed helping French customers to  switch their motor insurance more easily.

We believe  these innovative products will reinforce our  position as the go-to place for all things driver  related.

European Car Insurance  A record profit in the Group’s Italian business  ConTe, which also grew its customer base to 0.5  million customers. These risks have been summarised as those which would  threaten its business model, future performance, liquidity and solvency. 33 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction Group Risk Insurance Risk continued Erosion of competitive advantage in UK Car Insurance Admiral typically maintains a significant combined ratio advantage over the UK market. Mitigating Factors Admiral mitigates the risk to its reinsurance arrangements by ensuring that it has a diverse range   of financially secure partners. A collective failure of these  businesses would threaten  Admiral’s objective to  diversify its earnings by  expanding into new markets  and products. International Insurance  businesses have generally executed cautious launch strategies and are all backed by proportional  reinsurance support which provides substantial mitigation against start-up losses in the early years. New price comparison businesses have aligned their marketing investment with the extent of  improvement in key performance indicators such as average cost per quote and conversion ratio. Succession planning is based on targeted recruitment, identifying potential leaders through internal  development, talent management and retention processes. At its core insurance  serves a real social purpose, protecting people  from the adverse impact of potentially life  changing events.

The initial three-year period  may be extended for two further three- year periods subject to re-election by  shareholders. These procedures were reviewed by the  Board in April 2017 and it was concluded that  they continued to operate effectively. A significant amount of time has also been  dedicated to developing the Group’s Partial  Internal Model for Solvency II. External recruitment consultants have  been engaged to lead the search for further  Non-Executive appointments, particularly  those with marketing and digital expertise. Each Committee member met separately  with Andy and agreed that he would  bring invaluable experience to the Board. As part of their  review, the Committee will focus on how the  Group should develop a process to identify,  develop and promote ethnic diversity such  that a pipeline of suitable candidates is  available for consideration for future Board  and senior manager positions. Accordingly, appointments will  always be made on merit against objective  criteria, including diversity, and not just to  achieve an externally prescribed number. This is the first report I have prepared since  being proposed as new Committee Chairman,  to replace Annette Court. I am currently  undertaking the role of asking Chairman,  whilst my permanent appointment remains  subject to regulatory approval. The Committee also concluded  that a couple of areas in our previous  Remuneration Policy should be updated  to align with evolving best practice and  regulatory requirements. An additional  two-year holding period will apply, during  which time shares may not be sold, save to  meet income tax, NI or other regulatory  obligations. More  significant increases may be awarded in certain  circumstances including, but not limited to:  where there has been a significant increase  in role size or complexity, to apply salary  progression for a newly appointed Executive  Director, or where the Executive Director’s  salary has fallen significantly behind market. Includes (but not limited to): • Death in service scheme • Private medical cover • Permanent health insurance • Relocation, at the Committee’s discretion All benefits are non-pensionable. Details of any such payments will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise. Selection of performance measures Vesting under the DFSS is currently linked to EPS vs. LIBOR, ROE, and relative TSR. This has been selected to reflect value creation for Admiral’s shareholders as compared with the general market. In general, the Remuneration Policy which applies to other senior executives is consistent with that for Executive Directors. In light of this, David Stevens’  remuneration package consists only of a cash salary, benefits such as private medical cover, permanent health insurance and death in service  cover, and matching pension contributions from the Company under the Group’s Personal Pension Plan. Under all scenarios, potential reward opportunities are based on the proposed Remuneration Policy  and expected awards for 2018, applied to salaries as at 1 January 2018.

Vested DFSS awards are subject to clawback provisions in exceptional circumstances, such as material misstatement or gross misconduct. DFSS bonus payments are subject to clawback provisions in exceptional circumstances, such as material misstatement or gross misconduct. The award will vest dependent on three-year EPS growth vs. LIBOR, TSR vs. FTSE 350 (excluding investment companies), and ROE, weighted  equally. An additional two-year holding period will apply,  during which time shares may not be sold, save to meet income tax, NI or other regulatory obligations. 74.3% of Geraint Jones’ 2015 DFSS award will vest in September 2018 subject to his continued employment on the vesting date. This  means they are recognised as going the   extra mile to make sure disabled people   get a fair chance. We  also completed procedures to specifically assess the competence and objectivity of management’s expert in their role. (ii) Revenue – profit commission Under some of the co-insurance and reinsurance contracts under which motor premiums are shared or ceded, profit commission may be  earned on a particular year of account, which is usually subject to performance criteria such as loss ratios and expense ratios. The Group assesses its reinsurance assets for impairment on a regular basis, and in detail every six months. As described in note 3, critical accounting judgements and estimates, the methodology determines that reserves should be set within a  range above projected best estimate outcomes to allow for unforeseen adverse claims development. An allowance is made for expected cancellations where the customer may be entitled to a refund of amounts charged. For cash settled schemes, the fair value of services received are also recognised as an expense, with a corresponding  increase in liability. Internally  generated software is recognised as an intangible asset, with directly attributable costs incurred in the development stage capitalised. Accounting policies (i) Share capital Shares are classified as equity when there is no obligation to transfer cash or other assets.
