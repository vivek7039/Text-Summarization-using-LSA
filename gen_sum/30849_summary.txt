finance as part of our new admiral financial services business. our successful model which has been maintained since launch is definitely worth a further mention. it can be distilled into the following areas: • highly talented team – david stevens leads a strong, capable and experienced management team which engages the whole business • focus – targeted diversification building on our core skills • pricing – data analysis lies at the heart of what we do • prudent reserving – continuing our conservative approach to claims reserving • claims management – consistent positive feedback from customers on the service they receive • controlled test and learn – organic growth with measured expansion steps • low-cost approach – constantly challenging ourselves on how we can do things more cost effectively • shareholder returns – we believe in returning excess capital to shareholders. further details are provided in the governance report on pages 46 to 81. admiral’s incentive schemes remain distinctive, as every employee is a shareholder. owen clarke was announced as taking the remuneration committee chair in april, subject to regulatory approval. personal loans launched admiral group was named the 6th best multinational workplace in europe thank you on behalf of the board i would like to thank everyone at admiral for their continued hard work and contribution to the group’s results in 2017. this coming year is an exciting one as we hope to continue the group’s growth trajectory, building on our fledgling loans business and other businesses in uk motor, uk non-motor and overseas insurance and price comparison businesses. we invest in our people and provide exciting opportunities for them to develop their careers. the first reason admiral has been, and remains, good news for customers is that we operate at a lower cost than almost all our competitors. most of those are long gone, under the pressure from upstarts like admiral and other, lower-cost, admiral-like, operators who have followed in our footsteps. and you cannot build four million plus customers in the fiercely competitive uk insurance market without delivering a good customer experience. again, this allows us to be the top most often on price comparison sites, while also making a profit. how do we achieve lower costs while delivering a great product (5 star defaqto ratings available across all admiral’s motor products) and (normally) a positive customer experience, and why don’t most of our competitors manage all three? here’s how we are doing… but progress continues in 2018… 09 admiral

the international insurance businesses have been part of the strategy for a number of years but have yet to deliver meaningful profits – does it make sense to keep them? we recognise, however, that the household market is very different from motor insurance, so whilst our growth has been very strong since launch we continue to adopt a test and learn approach to our underwriting. q there has been a change of ceo at your us insurance operation, elephant auto – what does that mean for future strategy? a geraint: it’s still early days for admiral loans, though we’re very pleased with the way things are going so far. q can you give us an update on the internal model and what this means for capital? a david: there are widely varying views on when to expect autonomous technology but considerably less uncertainty about the impact; once we are in a world of autonomous vehicles, the requirement for motor insurance, as we currently know it, will change. admiral group plc · annual

2017 financial statements additional information corporate governance strategic report introduction great place to work we go out of our way to make admiral a great place to work and believe that if people like what they do, they’ll do it better. focus on customer retention by putting customers at the front of all that we do. develop websites that allow consumers to compare a range of general insurance, financial services and other products. a ratio of over 200% is still higher than we’d expect to report in the medium/ long-term. aside from the catastrophe events, estimated sensitivities have not been calibrated to individual return periods. over that time, our customer focused approach and strategy of providing excellent service at an affordable price has attracted more than 4.5

reinsurance admiral makes significant use of proportional risk sharing agreements, where insurers outside the group underwrite a majority of the risk generated, either through co-insurance or quota share reinsurance contracts. similarly, great lakes reimburses the group for its proportional share of expenses incurred in acquiring and administering this business. the group also purchases excess of loss reinsurance to provide protection against large claims and reviews this cover annually. for 2018, the group has reduced this level of cover to be back in line with more recent levels. we continued growth, 23% in written premiums, while at the same time drastically reduced our acquisition cost per policy. during 2017, elephant insurance made good progress towards becoming a growing, profitable, sustainable company centered around our customers. our key focus was on attracting, servicing and retaining more customers with a longer policy lifetime. while hurricane claims did impact our loss ratio, by approximately 5 points, elephant was still able to deliver overall loss ratio improvements on the back of better risk selection and rate increases that were in line with the market.

strategic report introduction group risk insurance risk continued erosion of competitive advantage in uk car insurance admiral typically maintains a significant combined ratio advantage over the uk market. this risk could be exacerbated by irrational competitor pricing and/or new technologies used within the insurance market. mitigating factors admiral mitigates the risk to its reinsurance arrangements by ensuring that it has a diverse range of financially secure partners. admiral continues to enjoy a long-term relationship with some of the world’s largest reinsurers. admiral seeks to minimise reliance on any single source by earning revenue from a range of products. one or more of the operations could fail to become a sustainable, profitable long-term business. a collective failure of these businesses would threaten admiral’s objective to diversify its earnings by expanding into new markets and products. international insurance businesses have generally executed cautious launch strategies and are all backed by proportional reinsurance support which provides substantial mitigation against start-up losses in the early years. new price comparison businesses have aligned their marketing investment with the extent of improvement in key performance indicators such as average cost per quote and conversion ratio. however, a more competitive market might benefit the car insurance business through lower acquisition costs. the group’s mitigation for interest rate risk resulting from long duration ppo liabilities includes a comprehensive level of reinsurance cover and continuing focus on strategies to ensure that the risks relating to both assets and liabilities are appropriately matched. succession planning is based on targeted recruitment, identifying potential leaders through internal development, talent management and retention processes. admiral operates the three lines of defence model for overseeing its products, processes and service. at its core insurance serves a real social purpose, protecting people from the adverse impact of potentially life changing events. that is why we continue to base our business model around building sustainable operations for the long-term. it is these four stakeholders who drive the core focus of our corporate social responsibility strategy. as an employer, we promote payroll giving and provide matched
