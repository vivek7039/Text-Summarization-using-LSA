As ‘The Food Travel Experts’ we operate over 2,500 outlets from quick service to fine dining, and serve, on average, one million customers each day. Outlook Looking forward, we have secured some important new business wins, which means our pipeline is encouraging. I am confident that SSP can continue to benefit from these trends and deliver sustainable value creation for shareholders. The equivalent market in 2015 amounts to c. £14bn at average exchange rates, or c. £15bn on a constant currency basis. We have made further good progress on optimising our product ranges and the development of premium products to provide customers with additional choice. We have strong disciplines around the contract tendering process which support our ability to deliver attractive returns from new business investment. We are continuing to look at how shared back office services can reduce cost and drive simpler , more efficient processes. Both of these will contribute to maintaining balance sheet efficiency and reflect our confidence in the business. Revenue in outlets which have been open for less than 12 months are excluded from like-for -like sales and classified as contract gains. Prior period revenues in respect of closed outlets are excluded from like-for -like sales and classified as contract losses. 3 Revenue in outlets which have been open for less than 12 months are excluded from like-for-like sales and classified as contract gains. Prior period revenues in respect of closed outlets are excluded from like-for-like sales and classified as contract losses. The Group also conducts extensive research to understand current levels of customer satisfaction and gathers feedback on changing requirements. The Group also has an annual online and interview-based client survey to ensure any concerns are being addressed. The Group’s pricing and range initiatives are driven by continuous monitoring of consumer spend benchmarks. 11 Insufficient business development capability and investment The Group may not be successful in winning new contracts on commercially acceptable terms. This requires the adoption of stricter data management processes in order to address greater rights for individuals, mandatory breach reporting and more rigorous compliance obligations. We seek to do this in a way which also supports the Group’s commercial strategy by improving our risk management or supporting operational efficiencies. Animal welfare is another focus, and this year we have carried out a review of our egg sourcing strategy. We achieve this through a regular programme of briefings, huddles, employee conferences and updates via our enterprise social network, SSP Connections. This will enable us to provide the same level of training and opportunities across all our markets. Environment Reducing the environmental impacts of our operations also make them more efficient, so makes good business sense. We have also installed half hour meters across a number of our European sites, which allow us to check how much energy is being used at all times of the day, and new software which switches off non-essential refrigeration cases on store closing. Where applicable, we have also installed a last person out switch linked into the system to shut down non-essential supplies on store closing. This year SSP America has provided extensive support to charities working with communities affected by the Houston flooding. The Company’s Articles of Association provide that at every Annual General Meeting (AGM), each Director shall retire and seek re-election. In order to help ensure the Board has the appropriate balance of skills and attributes required for effective decision making and strategy, Board appointments are made purely on merit – regardless of a person’s gender, age, disability, race or religion. Where control deficiencies are noted through the assurance work performed, Deloitte will perform follow-up reviews and visits.

At 21 November 2017 , other than as set out below, there had been no movement in Directors’ shareholdings and share interests from 30 September 2016. This population was chosen as a suitable comparator group because it is considered to be the most relevant in terms of employment location and remuneration structure. 2017 2016 Percentage change T otal staff costs £687.2m £581.6m 18.2% Dividends £29.0m £22.3m 30.0% CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017 41 Fees from external directorships Kate Swann was a Non-Executive Director of England Hockey during the 2017 financial year, but did not receive a fee in respect of that directorship for the year ended 30 September 2017 . Our aim is to reward management for delivering sustainable long-term performance and support the retention of critical talent. None Pension T o provide an income following retirement and assist the Executive Director in building wealth for their future. Awards will normally be subject to performance conditions set by the Committee measured over a period of at least three years. The Committee would seek to consult with its major shareholders as appropriate on any proposed material changes. Under Kate Swann’s service contract, if her employment is terminated by the Company making a payment in lieu of notice and the Company subsequently discovers that there were grounds for her summary dismissal, Kate Swann may be required to make a repayment equal to the net of tax value of any payments, benefits or shares received under any relevant bonus or incentive plan. Any such bonus will be determined by the Committee, taking into account time in employment and performance. These lines of communication ensure that emerging best practice principles are factored into the Committee’s decision-making. Other agreements The Company does not have agreements with any Director or Officer that would provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover, except that provisions of the Company’s employee share plans may cause options and awards granted under such plans to vest on a takeover . As a result, the Directors have also reviewed forecasts which include sensitivities that make allowance for this risk. Accordingly, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare this financial information on a going concern basis. We consider revenue to be the most appropriate benchmark as it provides a more stable measure year -on-year than Group profit before tax.

The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements. Accordingly, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare these financial statements on a going concern basis. The Group’s investment in associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. Investments in associates are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. T o calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined plans are recognised in the income statement. No disclosure is made for net assets/liabilities as these are not reported by segment to the chief operating decision-maker . 1.18 Supplier income The Group enters into agreements with suppliers to benefit from promotional activity and volume growth. For other intangible assets, reviews are performed if events or circumstances indicate that this is necessary. As a result the Group recognises tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. 2017 UK £m Continental Europe £m North America £m RoW £m Non- attributable £m Total £m Revenue 787.7 910.3 372.9 308.2 – 2,379.1 Underlying operating profit/(loss) 82.1 77.8 14.3 21.2 (32.5) 162.9 2016 Revenue 749.4 796.8 262.7 181.4 – 1,990.3 Underlying operating profit/(loss) 66.4 60.1 12.5 8.6 (26.2) 121.4 Disclosure in relation to net assets and liabilities for each reportable segment is not provided as these are only reported on and reviewed by management in aggregate for the Group as a whole.
