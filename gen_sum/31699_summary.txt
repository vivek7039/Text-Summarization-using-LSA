secured some important new business wins, which means our pipeline is encouraging. i am confident that ssp can continue to benefit from these trends and deliver sustainable value creation for

our desire to maintain an efficient balance sheet. the equivalent market in 2015 amounts to c. £14bn at average exchange rates, or c. £15bn on a constant currency basis. we are able to achieve this through a combination of international scale and local expertise. we have demonstrated an ability to win, build and maintain strong, profitable client relationships. we have made further good progress on optimising our product ranges and the development of premium products to provide customers with additional choice. we have strong disciplines around the contract tendering process which support our

requirements. the group has an established contact strategy with key clients to establish and/or maintain ongoing relationships. the group also has an annual online and interview-based client survey to ensure any concerns are being addressed. 4 labour laws and unions approximately 46% of the group’s employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. these are principally in france, germany, spain, denmark, finland, norway, sweden and the united states. the group’s contact strategy with key stakeholders and clients helps to mitigate this risk. senior resources have been strengthened in a number of strategically important and growing businesses. the group’s pricing and range initiatives are driven by continuous monitoring of consumer spend benchmarks. 11 insufficient business development capability and investment the group may not be successful in winning new contracts on commercially acceptable terms. the group has processes in place to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations. t raining sessions are also held in country to ensure compliance with these procedures. these risks are also reviewed as part of the board’s annual risk assessment process. this includes: one that uses as its reference point the 2008/09 financial crisis, when global economic conditions adversely impacted both passenger volumes and the spending habits of customers, leading to a rapid and unprecedented drop in like-for -like sales; one that envisages an external event that has a significant impact on the travel sector for a number of months; and one that considers the impact of a combined short-term decrease in sales and longer -term sustained decline in like-for -like sales. we seek to do this in a way which also supports the group’s commercial strategy by improving our risk management or supporting operational efficiencies. sustainable and ethical sourcing it is a priority for us that the products we sell should come from sustainably managed sources and that the people working within our supply chain should be fairly treated. in addition to this work, and in line with the requirements of the 2015 modern slavery act, we operate a due diligence process to ensure that modern slavery risks are closely monitored within our business and supply chain. animal welfare is another focus, and this year we have carried out a review of our egg sourcing strategy. we achieve this through a regular programme of briefings, huddles, employee conferences and updates via our enterprise social network, ssp connections. we have commenced a roll-out to launch the academy in all our other markets. this will enable us to provide the same level of training and opportunities across all our markets. we offer apprenticeship qualifications in a number of our european operations, such as germany, norway and the uk, and these programmes seek to give our team members the opportunity to develop their careers into junior managerial roles. environment reducing the environmental impacts of our operations also make them more efficient, so makes good business sense. we have also installed half hour meters across a number of our european sites, which allow us to check how much energy is being used at all times of the day, and new software which switches off non-essential refrigeration cases on store closing. where applicable, we have also installed a last person out switch linked into the system to shut down non-essential supplies on store closing. our units across the world have developed partnerships with local charities to donate unsold food. this year ssp america has provided extensive support to charities working with communities affected by the houston flooding. current external appointments: vagn is a senior

maximum potential value performance metrics executive directors base salary a core element of the remuneration package used to recruit, reward and retain executive directors who can deliver our strategic objectives. none pension t o provide an income following retirement and assist the executive director in building wealth for their future. for 2017 /18 maximum annual opportunities are: • chief executive officer, kate swann – 200% of salary per annum. awards will normally be subject to performance conditions set by the committee measured over a period of at least three years. the committee would seek to consult with its major shareholders as appropriate on any proposed material changes. all-employee share plans executive directors may participate on the same basis as other employees. under kate swann’s service contract, if her employment is terminated by the company making a payment in lieu of notice and the company subsequently discovers that there were grounds for her summary dismissal, kate swann may be required to make a repayment equal to the net of tax value of any payments, benefits or shares received under any relevant bonus or incentive plan. any such bonus will be determined by the committee, taking into account time in employment and performance. the committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax, administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment. in reviewing and setting remuneration, including that of executive directors, the committee receives updates on investors’ views, and may from time to time engage directly with investors and/or investor representative organisations on remuneration topics as appropriate. these lines of communication ensure that emerging best practice principles are factored into the committee’s decision-making. the company’s registered office and principal place of business is at 169 euston road, london nw1 2ae. in addition, the directors are recommending a final dividend of 4.9 pence per share amounting to £23.3m which will result in a total dividend per share of 8.1 pence for the year amounting to £38.5m (2016: £25.6m). other agreements the company does not have agreements with any director or officer that would provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover, except that provisions of the company’s employee share plans may cause options and awards granted under such plans to vest on a takeover . as a result, the directors have also reviewed forecasts which include sensitivities that make allowance for this risk. accordingly, the directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare this financial information on a going concern basis. our procedures included: • benchmarking assumptions: we challenged the assumptions for key inputs used by the group in their forecasts, such as projected market growth, future capital expenditure levels, revenue growth rates, cost projections and inflation, by comparing them to external data, industry norms and our expectations based on our knowledge and experience of the group. we consider revenue to be the most appropriate benchmark as it provides a more stable measure year -on-year than group profit before tax. based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the other information. the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud or other irregularities is higher than for one resulting from error, as they may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control and may involve any area of law and regulation not just those directly affecting the financial statements. a fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the frc’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. consolidated income statement for the year ended 30

items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by frs 101. deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. in order to make this assessment, future cash flows were forecast for the next five years with growth rates of between 2% and 5% per
