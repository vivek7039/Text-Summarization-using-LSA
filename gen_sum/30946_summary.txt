Our agile, data driven business  model and strong reputation have  attracted some very experienced  colleagues this year into senior roles  that will help us deliver ambitious  growth plans. We also made significant  investment in Guidewire our new  system that will help both colleagues  and customers. Q What do you think Toby van der  Meer will bring to the role of Chief  Executive Officer? We expect future premium rate changes  to follow claims inflation, which may be  impacted by the proposed changes to the  Ogden rate, and any effect this may have  on personal injury settlement amounts  and excess of loss reinsurance rates. We have an ongoing programme of investment in the key areas  that drive our value creation process. Both Retail and Underwriting employ teams of highly specialised people  who are empowered to drive sophisticated pricing capabilities. 1  Hastings Insurance Services Limited (HISL) and Advantage Insurance Company Limited (AICL) deployed capital represents respectively, the average  of HISL’s total capital resources as stipulated by FCA regulations and the average of AICL’s net assets during each year.
