us in 2011 as managing director for retail and in this role has been responsible for the development of the company’s uk retail business, which covers around two thirds of our group profits. the internet and digital age have enabled customers to access a large amount of information about their car insurance quickly and the growth of price comparison websites (pcw) has been instrumental in creating such an environment. in such an intensely competitive market, only the most agile and adaptive businesses can outperform. we expect future premium rate changes to follow claims inflation, which may be impacted by the proposed changes to the ogden rate, and any effect this may have on personal injury settlement amounts and excess of loss reinsurance rates. we have an ongoing programme of investment in the key areas that drive our value creation process. both retail and underwriting employ teams of highly specialised people who are empowered to drive sophisticated pricing capabilities. with strong operational cash inflows and growth in adjusted operating profit, the group is on track to deliver a net debt leverage multiple of 1.0x during 2019, with a reduction to 1.4x
