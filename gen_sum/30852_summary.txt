our printers are environmental management system iso 14001-accredited and forest stewardship council® (fsc®) chain of custody certified. this paper is environmentally friendly ecf (elemental chlorine-free) and wood free with a high content of selected pre-consumer recycled material. our companies and services have a focus on marine related activities which operate in potentially demanding environments where specialist skills are rewarded. tankships continued its run of profit increases generated by high vessel utilisation levels and careful attention to costs. this build-up squeezed our cash conversion rate to 56% in 2017 and despite this, the year-end balance sheet gearing remained at a conservative 47% (2016: 41%) with the ratio of net debt (excluding bonds) to underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation at 1.6 times (2016: 1.4 times). this growth in turn has built an ever wider international presence, so that the group is not dependent on any one geographical market. tankships continues to perform well in a relatively stable market: this position will be underpinned by the introduction of more modern tonnage on some routes. the strength of our balance sheet enables us to invest in development projects alongside a full capital investment programme. he will bring the right balance of continuity and change to this role going forward. he has played a senior role in our marine support division during the past year. specialist technical continues to work through its strong order book and has a good pipeline of active prospects. charles rice 26 february 2018 financial statements governance strategic report charles rice, chairman cobra – jfd’s new diver breathing system jfd has successfully completed its first deep-water commercial dive project with its new diver breathing system cobra (compact bailout rebreathing apparatus), a sophisticated system that was designed and developed to provide divers with an emergency supply of breathing gas in the event of a primary failure. 4 james fisher and sons plc annual report and accounts 2017 chief executive’s review nick henry, chief executive officer group strategy the group’s strategy is to grow its business organically by leveraging its existing marine skill base in specialist expertise to a global market, supplemented by selective bolt- on acquisitions which broaden the group’s range of services, products or geographical coverage. the company repairs offshore wind farm rotor blades through innovative use of suspended work platforms and ultra violet resin curing techniques which reduce operational downtime. in december 2017, eds was acquired for an initial £9.0m with a potential further £5.6m based on profit targets over the next two years. the group’s tankships division continued its progress and increased earnings before interest, tax, depreciation by 6% to £15.8m (2016: £14.9m). the market for uk nuclear decommissioning, which represents around one third of the division, continued to be challenging and resulted in marginally lower revenue, but this was offset by our specialist diving and submarine rescue business, jfd, which increased sales by 6%. however the business faced a slower market for new projects in its main uk markets. revenue was 2% higher at £56.4m but after adjusting for the impact of exchange rates, sales were 1% lower. rmspumptools, our artificial lift company, had a steadily improving order book over the year and a strong finish to 2017. tankships 2017 2016 underlying operating profit (£m) 8.8 8.2 underlying operating margin 15.4% 14.8% return on capital employed 34.2% 31.9% tankships continued its recent track record of profitability and strong cash generation. subsequent strong organic growth has been achieved through investment in people, working capital and equipment. the businesses acquired have a good track record and typically need additional resources for their next growth phase. this is supported by selective acquisitions to broaden the product and service range or geographical coverage. the demand for these services is driven by the volume of oil trading between oil majors and independent traders and also by production where local port infrastructure is unable to accommodate large tankers. subtech provides a range of marine services to the middle eastern and africa region. other subsea services provided to the defence sector include diving equipment and special operation swimmer delivery vessels. scantech offshore is a leading provider of air compressors, steam generators, heat suppression equipment and qualified personnel for the well testing market worldwide. rmspumptools is a world leader in artificial lift specialist completion technology and innovative accessory tools for electrical submersible pumps. james fisher is also established as a world leader in artificial lift specialist completion technology and innovative accessory tools for electrical submersible pumps. shipping clean petroleum products dramatically reduces our customers’ carbon footprint compared to other modes of transportation. shipping’s co2 emissions are half that produced by road freight, and just one full ship keeps more than 150 trucks off the roads. the division performs over 1,000 voyages each year carrying fuel from refineries and terminals to major coastal storage facilities. underlying operating profit (£m) revenue (£m) return on capital employed (%) 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 57.0 55.5 52.5 54.3 61.3 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 8.8 8.2 7.1 4.7 3.2

which is a self-assessment of operational controls and compliance with group policies, applicable laws and regulations relating to their business. contractual risk as the group continues to grow, wins larger contracts and operates in more geographies, sometimes with local partners, the company is potentially exposed to increased risks such as late payment or cost overruns. the group utilises

interest rate changes in its borrowings. gains or losses arising on any portion deemed to be ineffective are recognised immediately in the income statement. finance charges, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption of debt instruments including preference shares and the direct costs of issue, are accounted for on an amortised cost basis in the income statement. the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment but more regularly if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. (b) acquired intangible assets intangible assets that are acquired as a result of a business combination including but not limited to customer relationships, supplier lists, patents and technology and that can be separately measured at fair value on a reliable basis are recorded initially at fair value and amortised over their expected useful life. refit costs relating to vessels are capitalised when incurred and amortised over their estimated useful economic life of 30 months. 31.6 impairment of tangible and intangible assets at each reporting date the group assesses whether there are any indications that an asset has been impaired. these calculations are determined for an individual asset unless that asset does not generate cash inflows independently from other assets, in which case its value is determined as part of that group of assets. capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost and amortised over its expected useful life on a straight-line basis. cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition. deferred tax arising on actuarial gains and losses relating to defined benefit pension funds is recorded in other comprehensive income. dividend income arising on own shares is excluded in arriving at profit before taxation and deducted from aggregate dividends paid. when the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably no profit is recognised. inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting future cash flows is a key area of judgement. the group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax risk issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. these estimates are subject to agreement with the relevant tax authorities and may be revised in future periods. as a result of this on-going work, it is possible that there may be changes to the impact outlined below. as at 31 december 2017, the group’s future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases of vessels amounted to £12.8m, on an undiscounted basis (see note 28). as part of its assessment the group will determine whether it is appropriate to restate comparative information, or adopt a modified retrospective approach. e-69g-20, po box 51602, hamriyah free zone - sharjah, united arab emirates 50% strainstall saudi arabia limited po box 30124, riyadh 11372, saudi arabia
