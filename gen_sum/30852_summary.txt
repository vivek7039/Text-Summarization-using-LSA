This paper is  environmentally friendly ECF (elemental chlorine-free) and wood free with a high content of selected pre-consumer  recycled material. Our companies  and services have a focus on  marine related activities which  operate in potentially demanding  environments where specialist skills  are rewarded. Tankships continued its run of  profit increases generated by high vessel  utilisation levels and careful attention to  costs. This build-up squeezed our cash  conversion rate to 56% in 2017 and  despite this, the year-end balance sheet  gearing remained at a conservative 47%  (2016: 41%) with the ratio of net debt  (excluding bonds) to underlying earnings  before interest, tax, depreciation and  amortisation at 1.6 times (2016: 1.4 times). This growth in turn has  built an ever wider international presence,  so that the Group is not dependent on  any one geographical market. Tankships continues to perform well in a  relatively stable market: this position will be  underpinned by the introduction of more  modern tonnage on some routes. The strength of our balance sheet  enables us to invest in development  projects alongside a full capital investment  programme. This will free up  more time for Nick Henry as CEO to lead  the Group’s further development. Specialist  Technical continues to work through its  strong order book and has a good pipeline  of active prospects. Charles Rice 26 February 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT  Charles Rice, Chairman COBRA – JFD’s new diver breathing system  JFD has successfully completed its first deep-water commercial dive project with  its new diver breathing system COBRA (Compact Bailout Rebreathing Apparatus),  a sophisticated system that was designed and developed to provide divers  with an emergency supply of breathing gas in the event of a primary failure. The company repairs offshore  wind farm rotor blades through innovative  use of suspended work platforms and  ultra violet resin curing techniques which  reduce operational downtime. In December 2017, EDS was acquired  for an initial £9.0m with a potential  further £5.6m based on profit targets  over the next two years. The Group’s Tankships division continued  its progress and increased earnings  before interest, tax, depreciation by 6%  to £15.8m (2016: £14.9m). The market  for UK nuclear decommissioning, which  represents around one third of the  division, continued to be challenging  and resulted in marginally lower revenue,  but this was offset by our specialist  diving and submarine rescue business,  JFD, which increased sales by 6%. The  businesses acquired have a good track  record and typically need additional  resources for their next growth phase. Other subsea services provided to the defence sector  include diving equipment and special operation swimmer delivery vessels. Scantech Offshore is a leading provider  of air compressors, steam generators,  heat suppression equipment and qualified  personnel for the well testing market  worldwide. RMSpumptools is a world leader in artificial  lift specialist completion technology and  innovative accessory tools for electrical  submersible pumps. James Fisher is also established as a world leader in artificial  lift specialist completion technology and innovative accessory tools for electrical  submersible pumps. Shipping’s CO2  emissions are half that produced by road  freight, and just one full ship keeps more  than 150 trucks off the roads. The division  performs over 1,000 voyages each year carrying fuel from refineries and terminals to  major coastal storage facilities.

Repairs to twenty-seven turbines  were carried out within a 90 day  period, and in accordance with  rigorous standards. Contingent  consideration releases are based on  latest estimates of obligations in relation  to targets originally agreed within a sale  and purchase agreement. There are several management development  programmes in place for individuals who have been identified as potential  senior managers. This is overseen by Nick Henry, the  Chief Executive Officer, who has overall  responsibility for health and safety. Under this  policy, the Company states that it will,  where possible, try and accommodate  an employee’s needs. We strive to select  individuals on merit and do not consider  that targets or quotas are appropriate. The Group does not permit bribery, nor  illegal or corrupt business practices  and our whistleblowing procedure  allows employees to raise any  malpractice concerns they may have  in an appropriate forum without fear  of recourse. The Group aims to provide  superior customer service through value  added solutions combined with high  quality products. Before joining Linklaters, Aedamar worked for two years as a  consultant with Accenture in Dublin, Chicago and Belfast. As part of its internal control procedures, the Group has a  whistleblowing policy which encourages employees to report  in good faith any genuine suspicions of fraud, bribery or  malpractice in order to identify any problems within the Group  at an early stage. In addition, during 2017 we engaged the  services of PricewaterhouseCoopers to support our internal  audit resources particular at overseas offices. This decision was made after receiving confirmation that the  necessary steps for a smooth transition were in place.

FRM provides submarine  rescue services to the Singapore government under a 20 year service contract which commenced in March 2009. 98 JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 29 Related party transactions continued Britannia’s Gold Limited (BGL) During the year the Group acquired an option to subscribe for ordinary shares in Britannia’s Gold Limited, in exchange for marine services provided to BGL at a  cost of £0.9m. 30 Post balance sheet event On 19 February 2018, the Group acquired Cowan Manufacturing Pty Limited, based in New South Wales, Australia for £1.5m. Gains or losses arising on any portion deemed to be ineffective are recognised immediately in the income statement. The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment but more regularly if events or changes in circumstances  indicate that it may be impaired. Refit costs relating to vessels are capitalised  when incurred and amortised over their estimated useful economic life of 30 months. 31.6 Impairment of tangible and intangible assets At each reporting date the Group assesses whether there are any indications that an asset has been impaired. Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost and amortised over its expected useful life on a  straight-line basis. Deferred tax arising on actuarial gains and losses relating to defined benefit pension funds is recorded in other comprehensive income. Dividend income  arising on own shares is excluded in arriving at profit before taxation and deducted from aggregate dividends paid. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax risk issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. These estimates are subject to agreement with the relevant tax authorities and may be revised in future  periods. As a result of this on-going  work, it is possible that there may be changes to the impact outlined below. As at 31 December 2017, the Group’s future  minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases of vessels amounted to £12.8m, on an undiscounted basis (see note 28). As part of its assessment the Group will determine whether it is appropriate to restate comparative information, or adopt a modified retrospective approach.
