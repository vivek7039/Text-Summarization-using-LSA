whether there are any indications that an asset has been impaired. capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost and amortised over its expected useful life on a straight-line basis. deferred tax arising on actuarial gains and losses relating to defined benefit pension funds is recorded in other comprehensive income. dividend income arising on own shares is excluded in arriving at profit before taxation and deducted from aggregate dividends paid. the group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax risk issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. these estimates are subject to agreement with the relevant tax authorities and may be revised in future periods. as a result of this on-going work, it is possible that there may be changes to the impact outlined below. as at 31 december 2017, the group’s future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases of vessels amounted to £12.8m, on an undiscounted basis (see note 28). as part of its assessment the group will determine whether it is appropriate to restate comparative information, or adopt a modified retrospective approach. e-69g-20, po box 51602, hamriyah free zone -
