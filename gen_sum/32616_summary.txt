The division also operates a dedicated aseptics compounding unit that manufactures bespoke intravenous specials to order. The division has a growing portfolio and pipeline of UL2L products, as well as complementary larger niche generic products across a number of therapeutic areas that the Group aims to commercialise either independently or in partnership with other pharmaceutical businesses. Some of the Group’s difficulties this year are rooted in persevering with products where it has not been first to market. It would require substantial investment and time in advance of securing meaningful revenues for the Group to build this capability. More information about our corporate governance controls and processes is contained within the Directors’ report starting on page 28. This is partly the result of a reduction in the mean cost of sourcing and manufacturing specials but also reflects products moving from an unlicensed-to-licensed status, at which point they are no longer classified as a special.

The Specials division’s reputation for reliability and quality has helped it to build long-term relationships with several key customers that are underpinned by exclusive supply contracts. Lamda, based in Athens, Greece, has sole responsibility for managing the development and regulatory approval process. Our focus on the two core pillars of Specials and Niche will continue to drive performance improvement. Broadening our commercial partnerships Our non-UL2L portfolio is comprised of niche generic products where, although we will not have first-mover advantage and significant sales and marketing capability will likely be required to market them, we believe there remains a market opportunity. 2017 Niche portfolio breakdown 57 Total products 1 “We are well-placed to deliver future growth by focusing on our core Niche and Specials businesses.” In development/licensing process Product licence received, awaiting launch Launched or out-licensed 1 The portfolio breakdown defines individual products as those which vary with respect to their active pharmaceutical ingredient, strength, form or branding. The business has also continued to generate strong development, supply and royalty revenue from a range of third-party projects. QPL was also successful in retaining all major key accounts during the year, including securing a five-year exclusive supply relationship with our largest customer, AAH Pharmaceuticals Limited, which supplies over 1,800 Lloyds Pharmacy stores and 8,000 independents 13 Quantum Pharma Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report across the UK. We exited the financial year with a much improved profitability run-rate that is supportive of market expectations for the current financial year and we are well-placed to deliver future growth by focusing on our core Niche and Specials businesses. It operates in a challenging market that is subject to regulated pricing across some of the division’s product range. This revised strategy has been implemented successfully resulting in a number of important contracts with large pharmaceutical companies and NHS Trusts being secured during the financial year. The loss after tax from continuing operations includes non-cash charges relating to depreciation, amortisation and impairment of £12.9m (2016: £1.6m). All adjustments made to adjusted EBITDA as set out in the definition above are net of tax where applicable. The Group is also looking to partner with other businesses who have experience of commercialising non-UL2L products, where maximising their potential typically requires more time, investment and marketing expertise. 19 Quantum Pharma Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report ACTIVITIES • Strategic review performed in August 2016 to assess the Group’s direction, businesses, products and priorities, leading to increased focus on UL2L developments in the Niche division. • Discontinued unprofitable product lines within the Niche Pharmaceuticals division, allowing management to focus on those offering best opportunities for growth. • Renewal of exclusive contractual relationship with AAH Pharmaceuticals Limited, the Group’s largest specials customer, for a further five years. 21 Quantum Pharma Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report 2015 1.3 4.7 (6.7) 2016 2017 2015 3.1 6.4 4.0 2016 2017 2015 9.0 24.6 13.0 2016 2017 KPI PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT COMMENT (Loss) earnings per share from continuing operations 1 (6.7p) Statutory profit after tax divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the financial year.

RISK IMPACT MITIGATION MOVEMENT Key products The Group is exposed to a variety of product risks. There are risks that these key customer relationships could come to an end for a variety of commercial reasons, which would adversely impact Group revenues. The Group operates under a robust and compliant Quality Management System that is verified by regulators through frequent routine compliance inspections. The Group works hard to develop and maintain close, co-operative relationships with inspectors at a number of levels within their respective organisations. Risk trend Increasing Unchanged Decreasing 23 Quantum Pharma Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report RISK IMPACT MITIGATION MOVEMENT Marketing authorisations (‘product licences’) for new products Success in the Group’s product development and licensing business is dependent on achieving licensed status for products in the pipeline. There is a risk that revenue and profit could be impacted should any of the Group’s facilities become damaged. Work together Foster a supportive and inclusive culture in which strong working relationships are built. Be accountable Take responsibility for one’s actions, admit mistakes and do what is right. Similarly, as an AIM company, Quantum Pharma Plc is not required to prepare or publish a report on Directors’ remuneration. Both of these companies experienced considerable growth and change during the periods that Gerard served on their respective boards. As a corporate lawyer by background with more than 15 years’ experience in private practice he oversees and is responsible for the Group legal function. His appointment will further strengthen the positive relationships he has developed with all of Lamda’s suppliers and clients. The Non-executive Directors’ focus, in particular, on ensuring that strategic matters are carefully assessed and implemented. Ian Johnson, Dr John Brown and Christopher Mills were each appointed to the Board on 19 October 2016.

Directors are subject to retirement by rotation and may offer themselves for re-election in accordance with the Articles of Association. 40 Quantum Pharma Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Directors’ report Independent Auditor KPMG LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office as Auditor and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Financial statements 1 Accounting policies Quantum Pharma Plc (the ‘Company’) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 February 2011, goodwill is included at transition date on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP which was broadly comparable save that only separable intangibles were recognised and goodwill was amortised. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest- bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. 1.15 Post retirement benefits The Group makes contributions to employee’s personal pension schemes in line with UK auto-enrolment legislation. New standards awaiting EU endorsement include IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
