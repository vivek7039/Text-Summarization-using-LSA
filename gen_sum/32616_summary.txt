service-led niche pharmaceutical developer, manufacturer and supplier to the health and care sectors the group operates through three trading divisions incorporating eight business units across seven locations in the uk and europe, offering a portfolio of innovative and synergistic products and services. the division also operates a dedicated aseptics compounding unit that manufactures bespoke intravenous specials to order. the division has a growing portfolio and pipeline of ul2l products, as well as complementary larger niche generic products across a number of therapeutic areas that the group aims to commercialise either independently or in partnership with other pharmaceutical businesses. some of the group’s difficulties this year are rooted in persevering with products where it has not been first to market. it would require substantial investment and time in advance of securing meaningful revenues for the group to build this capability. the group has also taken action this year to remove distractions and address underperforming businesses. this is partly the result of a reduction in the mean cost of sourcing and manufacturing specials but also reflects products moving from an unlicensed-to-licensed status, at which point they are no longer classified as a special. 5. uk-manufactured special in mhra-licensed facilities 8 quantum pharma plc annual report and accounts 2017

medicines limited (‘ulm’), occupies a market-leading position that provides the group with insight into prescribing trends across a large swathe of the specials market. the specials division’s reputation for reliability and quality has helped it to build long-term relationships with several key customers that are underpinned by exclusive supply contracts. lamda, based in athens, greece, has sole responsibility for managing the development and regulatory approval process. our focus on the two core pillars of specials and niche will continue to drive performance improvement. broadening our commercial partnerships our non-ul2l portfolio is comprised of niche generic products where, although we will not have first-mover advantage and significant sales and marketing capability will likely be required to market them, we believe there remains a market opportunity. 2017 niche portfolio breakdown 57 total products 1 “we are well-placed to deliver future growth by focusing on our core niche and specials businesses.” in development/licensing process product licence received, awaiting launch launched or out-licensed 1 the portfolio breakdown defines individual products as those which vary

third-party projects. qpl was also successful in retaining all major key accounts during the year, including securing a five-year exclusive supply relationship with our largest customer, aah

successfully resulting in a number of important contracts with large pharmaceutical companies and nhs trusts being secured during the financial year. discontinued operation in july 2015 the group acquired nupharm laboratories limited (‘nupharm’), a small- scale batch-made specials manufacturer, which was intended to provide the group with an internal capability to batch manufacture both unlicensed and licensed medicines. the loss after tax from continuing operations includes non-cash charges relating to depreciation, amortisation and impairment of £12.9m (2016: £1.6m). all adjustments made to adjusted ebitda as set out in the definition above are net of tax where applicable. the group is also looking to partner with other businesses who have experience of commercialising non-ul2l products, where maximising their potential typically requires more time, investment and marketing expertise. 19 quantum pharma plc annual report and accounts 2017 strategic
