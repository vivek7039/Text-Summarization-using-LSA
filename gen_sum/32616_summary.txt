• successfully launched a number of new products during the year and post year-end, including key unlicensed- to-licensed product glycopyrronium bromide oral solution 1mg/5ml. some of the group’s difficulties this year are rooted in persevering with products where it has not been first to market. it would require substantial investment and time in advance of securing meaningful revenues for the group to build this capability. the specials division’s reputation for reliability and quality has helped it to build long-term relationships with several key customers that are underpinned by exclusive supply contracts. 2017 niche portfolio breakdown 57 total products 1 “we are well-placed to deliver future growth by focusing on our core niche and specials businesses.” in development/licensing process product licence received, awaiting launch launched or out-licensed 1 the portfolio breakdown defines individual products as those which vary with respect to their active pharmaceutical ingredient, strength, form or branding. it operates in a challenging market that is subject to regulated pricing across some of the division’s product range. this revised strategy has been implemented successfully resulting in a number of important contracts with large pharmaceutical companies and nhs trusts being secured during the financial year. the group is also looking to partner with other businesses who have experience of commercialising non-ul2l products, where maximising their potential typically requires more time, investment and marketing expertise. • discontinued unprofitable product lines within the niche pharmaceuticals division, allowing management to focus on those offering best opportunities for growth. • renewal of exclusive contractual relationship with aah pharmaceuticals limited, the group’s largest specials customer, for a further five years. (loss) earnings per share from continuing operations is calculated using the average number of shares in issue for each period. there are risks that these key customer relationships could come to an end for a variety of commercial reasons, which would adversely impact group revenues. the group operates under a robust and compliant quality management system that is verified by regulators through frequent routine compliance inspections. the group works hard to develop and maintain close, co-operative relationships with inspectors at a number of levels within their respective organisations. there is a risk that revenue and profit could be impacted should any of the group’s facilities become damaged. similarly, as an aim company, quantum pharma plc is not required to prepare or publish a

there were no potentially dilutive shares or other instrument that have been excluded from diluted eps because they are antidilutive. the accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements. subsequent to initial recognition, interest- bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
