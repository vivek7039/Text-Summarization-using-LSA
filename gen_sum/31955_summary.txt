investment universe continues to grow rapidly and now comprises us$44.6 trillion of fixed income and equity securities, an increase of 12% or us$4.7 trillion over the past 12 months. it therefore remains the case that as emerging nations continue to grow more rapidly than developed countries, and their capital markets increase their representation in global markets and benchmark indices, the pressure on investors to address this underweight position will increase. this includes developing a meaningful retail business that sources high net worth capital through agents such as private banks, broker-dealers, wirehouses, wealth advisers and other intermediaries. client relationships are managed by a 40-strong distribution team that is located throughout ashmore’s worldwide office network. the emerging markets allocation opportunity described above is substantial and predominantly relates to developed world institutions. group headcount has fallen over the period, which largely reflects natural levels of turnover and where business processes have been made more efficient. us$58.7bn 2016: us$52.6bn 86% 2016: 63% 14 ashmore group plc | annual report and accounts 2017 66% 2016:

operating profit excluding depreciation and amortisation against net revenues. developed world central banks have become more hawkish, which has put pressure on the returns available from their fixed income markets that still have a significant amount, nearly us$9 trillion, of bonds with negative yields and a further substantial amount with historically low real yields. emerging markets bonds and currencies have therefore performed well in absolute terms, but also relative to developed world assets. equity markets have performed strongly, and the high absolute and relative returns achieved in emerging markets reflect accelerating gdp growth across a wide range of countries as their economic cycles turn more positive after a period of adjustment. a weaker us dollar has contributed to good returns for local currency investors, and more stable commodity prices over the period, particularly oil, have improved investor sentiment towards emerging markets. yet, despite these headwinds, emerging markets economic and political fundamentals held up far better than most investors expected. in the emerging markets corporate high yield sector, default rates remain materially lower than for similarly-rated us companies. this resilience can be attributed to emerging markets’ stronger fundamentals, such as low debt levels, inflation targeting by central banks, the establishment of domestic pension funds, greater prevalence of floating exchange rates with high levels of foreign exchange reserves, high savings and investment rates, room to ease both fiscal and monetary policies, better demographics, and a greater proclivity to reform as soon as challenges arise. – many emerging markets countries have pursued deep structural reforms in recent years, including argentina, brazil, colombia, india, indonesia, mexico and russia. – foreign investor capital flows back into emerging markets should ease financial conditions, which in turn will stimulate economic growth. higher us interest rates appear to be more than priced in by the relative yields available across emerging markets. significant value available across emerging markets although emerging markets assets have performed well recently, there remains substantial value available and the recovery should be supported over the medium term by inbound capital flows from underweight foreign institutional investors. these are likely to proceed at a measured pace because investors are mindful of the market volatility caused by the 2013 us taper tantrum and, ironically, there is a degree of risk aversion influenced by concerns about elevated asset price levels in developed markets. as evidenced by the high yields and attractive equity valuations in emerging markets, there is a very significant value opportunity available and specialist, active investment management can deliver outperformance across a broad range of emerging markets asset classes. when compared with us corporates, there is a clear value argument in favour of emerging markets credit, as it has a lower default rate, wider spreads, particularly in the hy market, and typically less leverage than identically-rated us companies. the typical blended debt portfolio is positioned for further market strength, with a current overweight allocation to local currency markets. there are several established growth trends in emerging markets that require long-term investment, such as infrastructure development, private healthcare provision, and renewable energy. the group’s experience of structuring funds and sourcing investors who can make multi-year capital commitments means it is in a good position to capitalise on these growth trends. us$1.1bn aum top 10 domestic equity manager indonesia 13.8 12.0 6.1 all cap fund small

compensation, consolidated fund expenses and adverse currency effects of £4.4 million, operating costs were reduced by 11%. this represents 21% of ebvcit (fy2015/16: 20%), reflecting the improved

under review. ebvcit is defined as operating profit excluding the charge for variable compensation and seed capital-related items. first: risk ownership this rests with line managers, whether they are in portfolio management, distribution or support functions. third: independent assurance group internal audit is the third line of defence and provides independent assurance over agreed risk management, internal control and governance processes as well as recommendations to improve the effectiveness of these processes. the inherent risk within each business activity is identified, with the adequacy and mitigating effect of existing processes being assessed to determine a current residual risk level for each such activity; – on the basis that further mitigants and/ or controls may be employed over time, a target residual risk for each activity after one to two years is defined and progress to target is formally tracked as appropriate; – key risk indicator (kri) statistics are reported to and analysed by the rcc. investments have also been made in a chinese company which manufactures wind turbines with both local and growing global supplies. these investments on behalf of clients reflect ashmore’s overall approach to combining ethical investing with sound business practice. examples of investment areas where screening of portfolios can be offered based on (or informed by) client requirements (using recognised investment industry identifiers and coding into ashmore’s portfolio management system) include alcohol, animal/food products, armaments manufacturers or dealers, gambling, pornography and tobacco. ashmore’s top down allocation model evaluates country metrics relative to history and one year forward. to make this more explicit ashmore reviews esg rankings of countries within its mandate using third party data sources. ashmore’s investment committee meetings start off with a macro discussion and then move to the individual countries. finally, the technical factors affecting asset prices in various markets are important considerations leading to investment decisions. in addition, the investment committee will consider the assessment for each country on an ad-hoc basis as it discusses country visit reports from portfolio managers returning from research trips, or when discussing significant events such as elections. therefore, credit and esg analysis are an integral part of ashmore’s investment process for publicly traded fixed income securities. ashmore has developed detailed guidelines to guide voting decisions, but will, as appropriate, consider resolutions on a case-by-case basis taking into account all available information. however, at a country level, ashmore believes that it is able to exert an influence through dialogue with governments and central banks. ashmore’s people have always been its most important asset, at the heart of everything it does. ashmore works to ensure employee policies and procedures reflect best practice within each of the countries where it has a presence. ashmore has provided data to the 2017 hampton alexander review and this information is contained in ashmore’s separate corporate social responsibility report which can be found on its website at www.ashmoregroup.com 1 6 male female board 1 6 male female board 2 10 operating committee (senior managers) 83 169 all employees gender diversity (number of employees) employee development ashmore believes that constructive performance management is an essential tool in the effective management of its people and business. output from this performance process is used to assist with decisions on remuneration, career development and progression. ashmore also affirms and/or attests with key partners on an annual basis that they have not been susceptible to cyber security attacks and vendors have taken all reasonable steps to continuously monitor and protect themselves on cyber security weaknesses. environment as a company whose business is fundamentally based on intellectual capital and does not own its business premises, ashmore has a limited direct impact on the environment and there are few environmental risks associated with the group’s activities. ashmore does not own any of the buildings where it occupies floor space and invariably buildings in which it does have a lease are multi-tenanted and costs are apportioned to each tenant pro-rated according to occupancy. crucially, this support from employees extends beyond financial aid to active engagement with ngos through mentoring and helping them expand their network of contacts. today people still bear the scars of this conflict, with mistrust and prejudice towards other religions common. traditionally, gender roles have been defined by culture and religion; women are seen as second-class citizens with no place in public life. this project seeks to support women’s leadership through the development of income generating activities by establishing rural enterprises and garbage banks. they have helped support immediate relief efforts, providing vital items such as medical supplies, water and war-wound treatment kits to those injured in the conflict. ied-vital works with displaced families, ethnic minorities, and victims of the armed conflict through financial education programmes. through this partnership ied-vital will increase coverage of their micro-franchise model, working with communities to establish 800 new micro-franchises. he is currently a non- executive director of aspect capital

on fixed salaries, currently £100,000 for executive directors, and variable awards that genuinely reflect performance. – additional performance conditions for executive directors that put a significant proportion of their total pay at risk. the current policy therefore ensures that between 40% and 77% of an executive director’s variable pay is deferred for five years. the committee has a demonstrable record of paying executive directors only for performance, with zero awards in some years. employees other than executive directors may elect to receive up to the first £50,000 (or local currency equivalent) of their annual bonus delivered as 90% cash and 10% as restricted shares, rather than in the company’s usual proportions of 60% cash and 40% restricted shares. the high proportion of variable compensation deferral, with vesting after five years and subject in part to ongoing performance conditions, encourages a prudent approach to risk management, in support of the company’s risk and compliance controls. below executive director level, while the same five-year deferral policy applies, share awards are not subject to additional performance conditions. employees other than executive directors may elect to receive up to the first £50,000 (or local currency equivalent) of their annual bonus delivered as 90% cash and 10% as restricted shares, rather than in the company’s

consistent with market practice, the remuneration committee retains discretion over a number of areas relating to operating and administrating these plans. below executive director level, while the

from all international offices, in some cases information was not available. where no country data was available for the current reporting year, previous years have been used to estimate 2017 consumption. a number of offices were only able to provide data for the whole building in which they reside. this figure is broadly consistent with the average ‘per employee’ consumption of those offices which were able to provide data. this category, however, still remains the largest contributor to ashmore group’s emissions breakdown with 890 tco 2e. ashmore group has used a customised tool, developed by ricardo energy & environment, to undertake the emissions calculations. the data inputs and outputs have been reviewed by ricardo energy & environment on behalf of ashmore. for this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements. complete and accurate transmission of assets under management data to the rebate calculation system is a key

fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. at 30 june 2017, if interest rates over the year had been 50 basis points higher/lower with all other variables held constant, profit before tax for the year would have been £2.0 million higher/lower (fy2015/16: £1.0 million higher/lower), mainly as a result of higher/lower interest on cash balances. the group also holds a number of seed capital investments denominated mainly in us dollars, colombian pesos and indonesian rupiah. such price risk is borne by the group directly through interests in available-for-sale and non-current asset seed capital investments or indirectly either through line-by-line consolidation of underlying financial performance and positions held in certain funds or potential impairments when fair values less costs to sell of seed investments held for sale are less than carrying amounts. the group also holds a number of seed capital investments denominated mainly in us dollars, colombian pesos and
