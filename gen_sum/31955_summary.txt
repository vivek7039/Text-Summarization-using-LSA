This includes developing a meaningful retail business that sources high net worth capital through agents such as private banks, broker-dealers, wirehouses, wealth advisers and other intermediaries. Group headcount has fallen over the period, which largely reflects natural levels of turnover and where business processes have been made more efficient. Emerging Markets bonds and currencies have therefore performed well in absolute terms, but also relative to developed world assets. A weaker US dollar has contributed to good returns for local currency investors, and more stable commodity prices over the period, particularly oil, have improved investor sentiment towards Emerging Markets. – Many Emerging Markets countries have pursued deep structural reforms in recent years, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Mexico and Russia. – Foreign investor capital flows back into Emerging Markets should ease financial conditions, which in turn will stimulate economic growth. Higher US interest rates appear to be more than priced in by the relative yields available across Emerging Markets. The typical blended debt portfolio is positioned for further market strength, with a current overweight allocation to local currency markets. There are several established growth trends in Emerging Markets that require long-term investment, such as infrastructure development, private healthcare provision, and renewable energy. The Group’s experience of structuring funds and sourcing investors who can make multi-year capital commitments means it is in a good position to capitalise on these growth trends. Equities saw momentum in the specialist products, particularly frontier markets, and local market platforms such as Indonesia including global institutional clients allocating to single country funds.

Stronger markets enabled a higher level of performance fees to be generated, which offset lower foreign exchange translation revenues. Both AIML and AIAL held excess capital resources relative to their requirements at all times during the period under review. Investments have also been made in a Chinese company which manufactures wind turbines with both local and growing global supplies. These investments on behalf of clients reflect Ashmore’s overall approach to combining ethical investing with sound business practice. To make this more explicit Ashmore reviews ESG rankings of countries within its mandate using third party data sources. Therefore, credit and ESG analysis are an integral part of Ashmore’s investment process for publicly traded fixed income securities. These metrics are reviewed against yields and spreads to determine if an appropriate risk premium has been built into Ashmore’s scenario analyses. Ashmore has developed detailed guidelines to guide voting decisions, but will, as appropriate, consider resolutions on a case-by-case basis taking into account all available information. However, at a country level, Ashmore believes that it is able to exert an influence through dialogue with governments and central banks. Ashmore works to ensure employee policies and procedures reflect best practice within each of the countries where it has a presence. Crucially, this support from employees extends beyond financial aid to active engagement with NGOs through mentoring and helping them expand their network of contacts. Traditionally, gender roles have been defined by culture and religion; women are seen as second-class citizens with no place in public life. This project seeks to support women’s leadership through the development of income generating activities by establishing rural enterprises and garbage banks. They have helped support immediate relief efforts, providing vital items such as medical supplies, water and war-wound treatment kits to those injured in the conflict. Below is a summary of this year’s remuneration outcomes, which have been delivered under the current Policy, approved in 2014. Below is a summary of this year’s remuneration outcomes, which have been delivered under the current Policy, approved in 2014. The current Policy therefore ensures that between 40% and 77% of an Executive Director’s variable pay is deferred for five years. The Committee has a demonstrable record of paying Executive Directors only for performance, with zero awards in some years. Below Executive Director level, while the same five-year deferral policy applies, share awards are not subject to additional performance conditions. Service agreements contain no contractual entitlement to receive variable pay; participation in these arrangements is at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion. As is consistent with market practice, the Remuneration Committee retains discretion over a number of areas relating to operating and administrating these plans.

Had he not waived these amounts, Mark Coombs’ total bonus in respect of the year ending 30 June 2017 would have been £3,200,000. From the year ending 30 June 2015 onward, additional performance conditions are applied to 50% of any restricted or matching share award. These amounts represent the cash value of shares awarded at grant, which will vest after five years subject to continued employment.

Exclusions Whilst every effort has been made to collect full and consistent data from all international offices, in some cases information was not available. Where no country data was available for the current reporting year, previous years have been used to estimate 2017 consumption. This figure is broadly consistent with the average ‘per employee’ consumption of those offices which were able to provide data. Complete and accurate transmission of assets under management data to the rebate calculation system is a key audit risk.
