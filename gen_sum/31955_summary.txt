resolutions on a case-by-case basis taking into account all available information. however, at a country level, ashmore believes that it is able to exert an influence through dialogue with governments and central banks. ashmore works to ensure employee policies and procedures reflect best practice within each of the countries where it has a presence. crucially, this support from employees extends beyond financial aid to active engagement with ngos through mentoring and helping them expand their network of contacts. traditionally, gender roles have been defined by culture and religion; women
