Together with significantly reduced finance costs following important refinancing activity, this has driven strong growth in earnings over the year. See page 140 Chairman’s Statement I am delighted to report another strong set of results, following a busy and successful year for the Group. This valuation uplift has been offset partly by the cost of terminating our remaining legacy interest rate swaps, which amounted to 20 pence per share.

Our restaurants, cafés, bars and shops are reporting resilient trading growth, better enabling them to absorb upward pressures on operating costs currently faced by all businesses. Occupiers of large space on streets where rental levels are above our average have seen greater increases, and only limited transition provisions. Last year’ s introduction of 24-hour running at weekends on certain underground lines has been well-received, and initial passenger numbers have exceeded forecasts. 9 STRATEGIC REPORT OVERVIEW CHIEF ExECUTIVE’S STATEMENT Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017 Refinancing legacy debt and hedging T aking advantage of low long-term interest rates, over the year, we have taken important steps to refinance the remainder of our legacy debt and hedging, whilst adding to our financial resources.

Limited obsolescence An important aspect of restaurant, leisure and retail accommodation is that we provide it in shell form only. When tenants vacate, we re-let the shell of space without incurring significant refurbishment costs, limiting our exposure to obsolescence. By establishing ownership clusters, we can take a long-term holistic view in our investment and management strategies. Growing rents, unlocking value, ensuring long-term sustainability We estimate that the average age of our buildings is around 150 years. Additionally , we are supported by a broad range of external advisors, who bring us both ideas and their wide experience, gained from other clients. During the year, we have focussed our sustainability efforts on developing an air quality strategy and supply chain management which involves working in partnership with a number of stakeholders. We have developed a Supplier Code of Conduct which has been circulated to our principal suppliers for inclusion in contracts.

This is not limited to gender diversity, but includes a wide spectrum of attributes and backgrounds we look for when recruiting new employees. This is reflected in our membership of both Real Estate Balance and the RICS Inclusive Employer Quality Mark. This heightening of demand is particularly evident for properties close to prime streets, where lower rental levels offer better growth prospects. Demand for the smaller space typically we have to offer is healthy, particularly from independent operators, established street-food concepts and start-ups seeking their first site. At 30 September 2017, EPRA vacancy for these uses was 3.7%, and included 3.1% in respect of the recently completed Central Cross scheme. Newer leases provide us with more flexibility Tenants invest considerable sums fitting out their space, sometimes spending the equivalent of 3-5 years’ rent and, therefore, we grant longer leases than for shops, to provide an extended period over which occupiers can amortise this cost. 1% o f restau ran t, ca f és & lei s u re E R V) 19 NEW LETTINGS 6 LEASE RENEW ALS 44 RENT REVIEWS 1 % of annualised current income 2 Wholly-owned portfolio 3 At 30 September 2017 4 Leasing activity during the year ended 30 September 2017 43 SHOPS RESTAURANTS, CAFÉS AND PUBS OFFICES RESIDENTIAL TYPICAL LEASE TERMS HISTORICAL LEASES NEW LEASES Term 25 years 15 years Rent reviews Five-yearly, upward- only Five-yearly, upward-only Security of tenure on expiry Yes No Turnover-related top-up No Yes Space leases typically granted over Whole buildings Operational space only (i.e. not upper floors) Proportion of our restaurant leases (by income) 60% 40% Incentives N/A Short rent-free period to help cover tenant fit-out time.

This included £14.5 million in respect of our three larger schemes: Thomas Neal’ s Warehouse, Central Cross and 57 Broadwick Street. This decrease was largely due to the completion of our Thomas Neal’ s Warehouse and Central Cross schemes. Like-for-like growth was 5.0%, as we continue to convert our portfolio’ s reversionary potential into contracted cash flow. Having terminated our remaining interest rate swaps during the year, there is now no adjustment to EPRA NAV in respect of these. Furthermore, the importance of our ownership clusters in long-term value creation means that opportunities to recycle capital are limited. 61 STRATEGIC REPORT ANNUAL REVIEW RISK MANAGEMENT Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017 GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION RISK RISK POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION COMMENTARY HOW RISK HAS EVOLVED Events which discourage visitors to the West End e.g. • Threats to security or public safety due to terrorism • H e a l t h c o nc er n s (e.g. pandemics) • Reduced visitor numbers, spending and occupier demand • Reduced rental income and/or capital values • Potential increased vacancy and declining profitability • Damage to property • Inherent risk given the geographic concentration of our investments in a high profile location • Insurance cover maintained for terrorism and loss-of-rent • Close liaison with statutory authorities to maximise safety of visitors • D e t ai l e d e m er g e n c y response plans London has a growing population, is the most visited city destination for international tourists in the western world, and current forecasts are for further growth in visitor numbers. Scenario analysis In carrying out this review, we assumed no further acquisitions nor capital expenditure, other than that which was committed or approved by the Board. The Group maintains a prudent approach to gearing, with debt facilities which are largely fixed and long-term in nature. In accordance with good governance, each of my fellow directors and I will stand for re-election at the AGM. I have spent time this year getting to know, not only my fellow Board members, but also everyone who works for us.

Issue costs and premiums are written-off to the Statement of Comprehensive Income using an effective interest rate method. In deriving fair value, the valuer also makes a series of assumptions, using professional judgement and market observations. ERVs are calculated using a number of factors which include current rental income, market comparatives and occupancy levels.
