years portfolio highlights financial management 2 annualised current income erv strategic report overview shaftesbury annual report 2017 our business over the 31 years since shaftesbury was formed, we have assembled an impossible-to-replicate portfolio in the heart of london’ s west end of some 600 buildings across 14½ acres. together with significantly reduced finance costs following important refinancing activity, this has driven strong growth in earnings over the year. see page 140 chairman’s statement i am delighted to report another strong set of results, following a busy and successful year for the group. this valuation uplift has been offset partly by the cost of terminating our remaining legacy interest rate swaps, which amounted to 20 pence per share. our restaurants, cafés, bars and shops are reporting resilient trading growth, better enabling them to absorb upward pressures on operating costs currently faced by all businesses. occupiers of large space on streets where rental levels are above our average have seen greater increases, and only limited transition provisions. last year’ s introduction of 24-hour running at weekends on certain underground lines has been well-received, and initial passenger numbers have exceeded forecasts. 9 strategic report overview chief executive’s statement shaftesbury annual report 2017 refinancing legacy debt and hedging t aking

implementing our strategy and contributing to its evolution. this is not limited to gender diversity, but includes a wide spectrum of attributes and backgrounds we look for when recruiting new employees. this heightening of demand is particularly evident for properties close to prime streets, where lower rental levels offer better growth prospects. demand for the smaller space typically we have to offer is healthy, particularly from independent operators, established street-food concepts and start-ups seeking their first site. see page 40 for further information on thomas neal’ s warehouse and central cross west end retail rental tones 5 (prime zone a per sq.ft.) during the year , we have seen a slight softening in rental levels, owing to increased availability of newly-built

visitors to the west end e.g. • threats to security or public safety due to terrorism • h e a l t h c o nc er n s (e.g. pandemics) • reduced visitor numbers, spending and occupier demand • reduced rental income and/or capital values • potential increased vacancy and declining profitability • damage to property • inherent risk given the geographic concentration of our investments in a high profile location • insurance cover maintained for terrorism and loss-of-rent • close liaison with statutory authorities to maximise safety of visitors • d e t ai l e d e m er g e n c y response plans london has a growing population, is the most visited city destination for international tourists in the western world, and current forecasts are for further growth in visitor numbers. scenario analysis in carrying out this review, we assumed no further acquisitions nor capital expenditure, other than that which was committed or approved by the board. i have spent time this year getting to know, not only my fellow board members, but also everyone who works for us. t o manage executive di rector succession, we address continuity in, and development of, the management team below board
