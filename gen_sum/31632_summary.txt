report overview shaftesbury annual report 2017 our business over the 31 years since shaftesbury was formed, we have assembled an impossible-to-replicate portfolio in the heart of london’ s west end of some 600 buildings across 14½ acres. together with significantly reduced finance costs following important refinancing activity, this has driven strong growth in earnings over the year. see page 140 chairman’s statement i am delighted to report another strong set of results, following a busy and successful year for the group. this valuation uplift has been offset partly by the cost of terminating our remaining legacy interest rate swaps, which amounted to 20 pence per share. see page 140 dividends per share 16.0p +8.8% epra nav per share 1 £9.52 +7.2% epra earnings 1 £45.2m +15.9% 8 strategic report overview chief executive’s statement shaftesbury annual report 2017 a unique portfolio in an exceptional location our portfolio extends to some 600 buildings across 14½ acres of london’ s west end. our restaurants, cafés, bars and shops are reporting resilient trading growth, better enabling them to absorb upward pressures on operating costs currently faced by all businesses. occupiers of large space on streets where rental levels are above our average have seen greater increases, and only limited transition provisions. with all our portfolio in close proximity to these hubs, we anticipate being a major beneficiary of these changes, with a number of our streets expected to see much increased footfall and profile, enhancing their long-term rental growth prospects. last year’ s introduction of 24-hour running at weekends on certain underground lines has been well-received, and initial passenger numbers have exceeded forecasts. their availability is always limited, as existing owners are reluctant to sell in our sought-after areas. understandably, competition to purchase is intense, as other investors appreciate the long-term prospects and security they offer. 9

important aspect of restaurant, leisure and retail accommodation is that we provide it in shell form only. when tenants vacate, we re-let the shell of space without incurring significant refurbishment costs, limiting our exposure to obsolescence. by establishing ownership clusters, we can take a long-term holistic view in our investment and management strategies. growing rents, unlocking value, ensuring long-term sustainability we estimate that the average age of our buildings is around 150 years. additionally , we are supported by a broad range of external advisors, who bring us both ideas

annual growth rate in annualised current income and erv of our portfolio has been 4.9% p.a. during the year, we have focussed our sustainability efforts on developing an air quality strategy and

sustainability and stakeholders shaftesbury annual report 2017 employees our employees play a vital role in implementing our strategy and contributing to its evolution. diversity is important to ensure that we have a mix of views and inputs into our business. this is not limited to gender diversity, but includes a wide spectrum of attributes and backgrounds we look for when recruiting new employees. this is reflected in our membership of both real estate balance and the rics inclusive employer quality mark. also, it takes into account expectations of further rental growth, good occupancy levels, and low capital expenditure. sustained investor demand yet limited supply of assets to acquire during the year, we have seen a sharpening of investor appetite, especially for freehold properties in our locations, which offer investment security, growing returns and limited exposure to obsolescence. this heightening of demand is particularly evident for properties close to prime streets, where lower rental levels offer better growth prospects. rents for commercial uses were, on average, 6.7% above erv at 30 september 2016. our share of lettings, lease renewals and rent reviews in the longmartin joint venture was £3.9 million (2016: £2.7 million), with commercial rents achieved broadly in line with erv at 30 september 2016. accounting for £3.2 million, rent reviews delivered average increases of 36.4% compared with previous rental levels, an equivalent 5-year cagr of 6.4%. we will be patient in selecting occupiers which meet our objective of delivering long-term rental growth. thomas neal’ s warehouse in the heart of seven dials, our scheme created a unique 22,800 sq. generally, tenants ensure they preserve their valuable occupation rights and our bad debt history is negligible. demand for the smaller space typically we have to offer is healthy, particularly from independent operators, established street-food concepts and start-ups seeking their first site. at 30 september 2017, epra vacancy for these uses was 3.7%, and included 3.1% in respect of the recently completed central cross scheme. newer leases provide us with more flexibility tenants invest considerable sums fitting out their space, sometimes spending the equivalent of 3-5 years’ rent and, therefore, we grant longer leases than for shops, to provide an extended period over which occupiers can amortise this cost. until recently, leases were granted over whole buildings and provided tenants with renewal rights on expiry. 1% o f restau ran t, ca f és & lei s u re e r v) 19 new

significantly reduced financing costs. furthermore, the importance of our ownership clusters in long-term value creation means that opportunities to recycle capital are limited. important factors contributing to the relatively low risk of our business include: • the group invests only in london’ s west end, where there is a long history of resilience, stability and sustained occupier demand for restaurant, leisure and retail space, which are the principal sources of our rental income and portfolio value • with a diverse tenant base, there is limited exposure to any single tenant • the nature of our portfolio does not expose us to risks inherent in material speculative development schemes • we have an established and experienced management team, based in one location, close to all our holdings • we manage our balance sheet on a conservative basis with moderate leverage, long-term finance, a spread of loan maturities, good interest cover and with the majority of interest costs fixed. 61 strategic report annual review risk management shaftesbury annual report 2017 geographic concentration risk risk potential impact mitigation commentary how risk has evolved events which

reduced rental income and/or capital values • potential increased vacancy and declining profitability • damage to property • inherent risk given the geographic concentration of our investments in a

uncertainty will remain until the uk's future arrangements with the eu are negotiated decline in the uk real estate market due to macro- economic factors e.g. global political landscape, currency expectations, bond yields, interest rate expectations, availability and cost of finance, relative attractiveness of property compared with other asset classes • reduced capital values • decrease in nav, amplified by gearing • loan covenant defaults • focus on assets, locations and uses where: - there is a structural imbalance between availability of space and demand - which have historically proved to be economically resilient and have demonstrated much lower valuation volatility than the wider market • regular review of investment market conditions including bi-annual external valuations • conservative levels of leverage, with the majority at fixed rates • spread of sources of finance and loan maturities • quarterly forecasts including covenant headroom review • pool of uncharged assets available to top up security held by lenders interest rates have continued at historically low levels present market sentiment is that increases will be moderate and gradual, although the

operating profit before investment property valuation movements and net finance costs. there is also a risk that management may unduly influence the significant judgements and estimates in respect of

should be based on operating profit before investment property valuation movements and net finance costs. • based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. group statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 30 september 2017 group statement of com- prehensive income 115 financial statements shaftesbury annual report
