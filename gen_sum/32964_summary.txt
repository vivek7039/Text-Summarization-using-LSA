I am now more confident than ever that, while challenges remain, there is material upside in the Genel portfolio and significant opportunities ahead. Genel takes pride in its operations and strives for positive community impact, and it was pleasing to see a repeat of 2016’s performance in achieving no lost-time incidents, while reducing incidents of primary containment loss to a single minor event. I would like to thank all employees across our operations for their ongoing vigilance and hard work. Going through 2018 we look forward to clearly setting out the growth potential that this provides, and as such plan for active capital market engagement. We went into the year with a clear focus, and took proactive steps to deliver our key goals. CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT  ANNUALREPORT2017 7 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION Prudent capital allocation is at the core of everything that we do, and we spend each dollar in a way that creates the greatest value for our shareholders. Delivering on our focus I was pleased to welcome Esa Ikaheimonen as Chief Financial Officer and Bill Higgs as Chief Operating Officer, both of whom bring the qualities and experience to help us deliver on these goals. Entering 2018 we are now in a stronger position to move the project forward, with upstream materially de-risked. It is worth noting ENI’s recent acquisition of the licence block adjacent to Sidi Moussa. READ MORE P15 MAINTAIN A STRONG BALANCE SHEET Disciplined capital allocation, maximising financial flexibility to execute our strategy. READ MORE P22 Genel’s strategic ambition is to become a world-class independent E&P creator of shareholder value. We re-invest our cash smartly and allocate capital towards those areas with the highest returns, making sure that we are suitably financed through a mix of diverse funding options and portfolio management, providing a base from which to accelerate the growth of our portfolio. Exports by the KRG were consistent in 2017, and almost all Tawke PSC production was exported via Ceyhan. Consistent and predictable payments throughout the year allowed for a proactive drilling programme to be carried out across Genel assets.  ANNUALREPORT2017 17 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION Somaliland Kurdistan Region of Iraq Left: Seismic acquisition, Somaliland Below: Operations in the KRI Later in the year, Genel expects to undertake an extended well test of Bina Bawi-4, which will provide valuable data on well deliverability and gas composition. Genel’s prior commitment to drill one well on the Sidi Moussa licence (Genel 60% working interest, operator), offshore Morocco, has been replaced by an obligation to carry out a 3D seismic campaign across the acreage, significantly reducing anticipated expenditure. Working with the Sulaimaniyah Educational Department, a team from Genel led 100 students to Hawari Shar Public Park. Education is a key priority, and Genel works to maximise opportunities for people of all ages. As part of our commitment to ensure that all children have every necessity required for school, the 108 boys and 114 girls were provided with brand new clothes. Genel then rolled out this support for local children to those in the proximity of Miran and Bina Bawi. The Company holds surplus cash in treasury bills or on time deposits with a number of major financial institutions. OPPORTUNITIES: — Ongoing payments under the RSA lead to increased cash receipts and increased liquidity THREATS: — Failure of KRG to make payments for export sales (as above) — A deterioration in the oil price MITIGATING ACTIONS: — Refinancing in 2017 provided a solid basis for Genel’s capital structure — Ongoing focus on reducing our G&A costs — Prudent capital expenditure HSSE Committee RISK: LOCAL COMMUNITIES Pars Kutay, Head of Government Affairs READ MORE P18 APPROACH: Supporting and sustaining the communities in which we operate is fundamental to Genel’s success. OPPORTUNITIES: — Continued strong performance enhances Company reputation THREATS: — Failure of safety procedures leads to injuries and/or fatalities, adverse environmental impact, and material reputational damage MITIGATING ACTIONS: — Contractor assurance management plans developed — Regular HSE site visits PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED Key Increased Unchanged Decreased  ANNUALREPORT2017 31 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION Viability statement In accordance with provision C.2.2.

ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED  ANNUALREPORT2017 59 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION The absolute TSR targets will be measured on compound annual growth rates (CAGR) as follows: Absolute TSR of the Company Proportion of element vesting Below 12.5% p.a. The threshold target is set in line with Genel’s cost of capital to ensure that this element vests only when shareholders make a return. However, the Committee recognises that, as an independent oil and gas company, it is competing with global firms for its talent. Minor Changes The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy set out above for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment. No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. Corporate responsibility The Group is fully committed to high standards of environmental, health and safety management. Employment policies We are an equal opportunities employer and base all decisions on individual ability regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age or disability. Applications for employment by disabled persons will always be considered, having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities. Our group scoping was based on total assets, consistent with our approach to materiality, and identified two financially significant components comprising a high proportion of total group assets, which required an audit of their complete financial information. Change in level of risk: Decreased this year due to positive developments on Miran and Bina Bawi assets. Discount rate is assessed by the Company using various inputs from market data, external advisers and internal calculations. Key inputs to the assessment of amortised cost were: oil price, production forecast and mechanism for payment. In determining fair value for acquisitions, the Company utilises valuation methodologies including discounted cash flow analysis. Profit oil revenue is always reported net of any capacity building payments that will become due. Capacity building payments due on Tawke profit oil receipts were waived from August 2017 onwards as part of the RSA. Summary of significant accounting policies continued Development expenditure is accounted for in accordance with IAS 16–Property, plant and equipment. Contingent consideration includes a balance of $60.5 million (2016: $82.7 million) recognised at its discounted fair value, which has been re-estimated in the year resulting in a reduction that has been deducted from the book value of Miran/Bina Bawi intangible assets. Cash is deposited in US treasury bills or term deposits with banks that are assessed as appropriate based on, among other things, sovereign risk, CDS pricing and credit rating. Between the 22 September 2015 and 13 February 2016 27,339,017 voting ordinary shares were transferred from affiliated shareholders to third parties. Drill rigs are leased on a day-rate basis for the purpose of drilling exploration or development wells. Materiality threshold Total payments below £86,000 made to a government are excluded from this report as permitted under the Regulations.
