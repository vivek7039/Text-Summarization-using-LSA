Our vaccines trade under various brand names depending on the market, e.g. Pollinex Quattro, Polligoid and TA Gräser Top. Whereas healthy people develop tolerance to allergens, allergy sufferers have a Th2-dominated immune response with increased IgE and corresponding clinical symptoms. Vaccines containing MPL have been evaluated in various indications such as cervical cancer and malaria at GlaxoSmithKline (‘GSK’). Wasp and bee treatment is provided by our freeze dried Venomil product, which can be used via a ‘Rush’ dosing regimen. In 2013, the Group launched a further new synbiotic product, Syngut, specifically designed for food and lactose intolerance. In 2016, the Group began its first NIS study for lactose intolerance with 50 patients at S. Martino Hospital, Genova, Italy. Synbiotics Last year, the Group launched two new synbiotic products, Kallergen-Th D and SynGut Baby. The results of a retrospective controlled Italian multi-centre study investigating whether Pollagen prescribed as complementary therapy demonstrated that it was able to reduce symptoms severity, endoscopic features and nasal cytology in 93 patients with inflammatory non allergic rhinitis (INAR).

Further details of the Group’s research and development strategy can be found on pages 32 to 35. The Board is committed to retaining staff and implementing well balanced, challenging incentives makes this possible. Family friendly employment policies conform to statutory requirements and flexible working practices are adopted where viable. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The measurement of pension liabilities in accordance with IAS 19 “Employee Benefits” involves significant judgement and their valuation is subject to complex actuarial assumptions. Variations in those actuarial assumptions could lead to a materially different defined benefit pension scheme liability being recognised within the Group financial statements. We determined a lower level of specific materiality for certain areas such as directors’ remuneration and related party transactions.

Accounting policies continued Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are identified and recognised separately from goodwill where they satisfy the definition of an asset and be identifiable. These operating segments are managed separately as each requires different local expertise, regulatory knowledge and a specialised marketing approach. Accounting policies continued Revenue recognition Revenue is measured by reference to the fair value of consideration received or receivable by the Group for goods supplied and services provided, net of statutory rebates paid in Germany and excluding value added tax. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. Financial derivatives are designated at FVTPL (fair value through profit and loss) upon initial recognition. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. All provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. All employee services received in exchange for the grant of any share based compensation are measured at their fair values. The Italian freehold property was revalued to fair value at that reporting date based on this valuation. b) Estimates of future profitability are required for the decision whether or not to carry forward a deferred tax asset. f) The Group operates equity-settled share based compensation plans for remuneration of its employees comprising Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) schemes. There are no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions that could lead to an impairment being recorded. Management’s key assumptions include sales growth (at an average of 4% for the three-year period), which has been determined based on past experience in this market. Management’s key assumptions include sales growth (at an average of 4% for the ten-year period), which has been determined based on past experience in this market. Capital management objectives are met through regular reviews of cash flows, debtor/creditor balances, budgets and forecasts. 2017 £’000 2016 £’000 Amounts charged to operating profit 366 251 Current service costs Amounts included in other finance expenses Interest income on plan assets (19) (26) Interest on pension scheme liabilities 170 197 Net charge 151 171 Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 31 11 Experience (losses)/gains arising on scheme liabilities (86) 110 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of scheme liabilities 1,555 (1,809) Total amount relating to year 1,500 (1,688) Opening cumulative losses (5,401) (3,713) Remeasurement of net defined liability (3,901) (5,401) Cumulative net movement recognised (3,901) (5,401) Movement in assets during the year 2017 £’000 2016 £’000 Balance as at 1 July 1,248 1,045 Foreign currency differences 75 185 Interest income on plan assets 18 26 Remeasurement of net defined liability 31 11 Contributions from employer 20 17 Assets transferred to finance benefits paid (46) (36) Balance as at 30 June 1,346 1,248 Notes to the Financial Statements continued allergytherapeutics.com 103 Financial Statements 26.
