aluminium- free allergy vaccines and diagnostics. our vaccines trade under various brand names depending on the market, e.g. pollinex quattro, polligoid and ta gräser top. whereas healthy people develop tolerance to allergens, allergy sufferers have a th2-dominated immune response with increased ige and corresponding clinical symptoms. vaccines containing mpl have been evaluated in various indications such as cervical cancer and malaria at glaxosmithkline (‘gsk’). wasp and bee treatment is provided by our freeze dried venomil product, which can be used via a ‘rush’ dosing regimen. in 2013, the group launched a further new synbiotic product, syngut, specifically designed for food and lactose intolerance. in 2016, the group began its first nis study for lactose intolerance with 50 patients at s. martino hospital, genova, italy. the product has been standardised to meet a dose regime consistent with “one vial” convenience. synbiotics last year, the group launched two new synbiotic products, kallergen-th d and syngut baby. a double blind, parallel group, randomised study to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of kallergen-th d ® oral synbiotic compared with placebo in children with atopic dermatitis is planned to commence in q4 2017. additionally, enrolment is complete for the observational study evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of syngut ™ oral synbiotic in patients with lactose intolerance. the study is expected to finish in january 2018 with final results by h2 2018. the results of a retrospective controlled italian multi-centre study

external factors could materially affect the business. in order to minimise these risks, regular maintenance and upgrade of the facility is undertaken. it has a pharmacovigilance team in place to monitor and address any safety issues arising. the overdraft facility was unused at 30 june 2017 but has been renewed for a further 12 months to cover seasonal funding requirements. during his career at abbott, jeff has held a variety of financial management positions, including in diagnostics, nutrition and pharmaceuticals. new business opportunities and any other key investment decisions are

flexible working practices are adopted where viable. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. the measurement of pension liabilities in accordance with ias 19 “employee benefits” involves significant judgement and their valuation is subject to complex actuarial assumptions. variations in those actuarial assumptions could lead to a materially different defined benefit pension scheme liability being recognised within the group financial statements. we determined a lower level of specific materiality for certain areas such as directors’ remuneration and related party transactions. jonathan maile bsc (hons) fca senior statutory auditor

allergy therapeutics is a specialty pharmaceutical group focused on allergy vaccination. notes to the financial statements continued allergytherapeutics.com 73 financial statements 2. accounting policies continued intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination intangible assets acquired in a business combination are identified and recognised separately from goodwill where they satisfy the definition of an asset and be identifiable. these operating segments are managed separately as each requires different local expertise, regulatory knowledge and a specialised marketing approach. with the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. financial derivatives are designated at fvtpl (fair value through profit and loss) upon initial recognition. after initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. all provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. all employee services received in exchange for the grant of any share based compensation are measured at their fair values. no adjustment to expense recognised in prior periods is made if fewer shares ultimately vest than estimated, however the expensed value of these lapsed shares is transferred from the share based payment reserve to retained earnings. the italian freehold property was revalued to fair value at that reporting date based on this valuation. b) estimates of future profitability are required for the decision whether or not to carry forward a deferred tax asset. f) the group operates equity-settled share based compensation plans for remuneration of its employees comprising long term incentive plan (ltip) schemes. g) where the group is in negotiation with third party contractors around final account payments in relation to contracts, there is always an element of uncertainty as to the exact amount that will become payable. there are no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions that could lead to an impairment being recorded. management’s key assumptions include sales growth (at an average of 4% for the three-year period), which has been determined based on past experience in this market. management’s key assumptions include sales growth (at an average of 4% for the ten-year period), which has been determined based on past experience in this market. 2017 £’000 2016 £’000
