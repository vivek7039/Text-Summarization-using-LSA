we do not anticipate any major impact on profitability in 2018 from currency fluctuations or hedging adjustments. however, it is worth noting the overall healthy organic growth and impressive contract wins that contributed to our strong operating cash flows. any impact is likely to be felt by our space division, albeit that the division has continued to win contracts in this current period of pre- brexit uncertainty which extend beyond the proposed brexit date, which is encouraging.  dr. mike love chairman corporate governance financial statements strategic report chief executive’s review 17

strategic objectives in last year’s report i expressed my confidence based on the progress achieved in 2016 that we would be able to continue our sustainable, resilient and balanced growth in 2017. i am delighted to confirm that we have ended the period with record revenues of £57.2m (up 25%), an adjusted operating profit of £4.6m (up 44%) and adjusted operating margin of 8%. this led to an initial win for a radio pilot project with the malaysian public broadcaster rtm. the german broadcaster mdr, which chose openmedia in august 2017 and has been a m&b customer since 1995, bought additional dira! this project win was particularly important because it positions newsboard as a bellwether system for other public broadcasters. beside the technical requirements, scisys’ experience with large systems was of great importance to us in choosing them.” - - dennis herold, sabc general manager radio broadcast facilities “ openmedia clearly is leading in this space and we’re delighted to be their first major north american partner.” - - gerry belec, dir. our editorial teams are enthusiastic adopters of dira!, which has significantly improved their workflows and is allowing them to concentrate fully on listeners. this accomplishment is particularly impressive because it was made in the climate of brexit uncertainty surrounding eu- funded space programmes. while we could plan our galileo activities to be carried out by our german subsidiary, which clearly satisfies the requirement of being an eu based company, scisys plc, which is the ultimate holding company, will not automatically satisfy this test upon brexit taking effect. it has every confidence that all necessary approvals will be forthcoming and thereby eliminate any risk to its continued participation in eu-funded programmes. this mission will operate approximately 200 autonomous communication nanosatellites in carefully selected orbits by 2020, giving equatorial coverage of the earth to create an
