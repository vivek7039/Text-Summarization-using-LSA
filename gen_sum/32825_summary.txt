annual report 2017 we are a leading integrated producer and marketer of commodities operating around the world. glencore’s balance sheet has never been stronger and our investment case, underpinned by our leading marketing and industrial asset businesses, has never been better capitalising on a strong operating environment after an encouraging end to 2016, which saw commodities recover from cycle lows, positive momentum continued through 2017, resulting in prolonged outperformance of glencore’s key commodities versus the broader markets. strong economic performance in both major developing and developed markets has underpinned supportive commodity demand conditions. early signals of inflation and higher interest rates also bode well for commodities as an asset class. delivering

drivers we are dependent upon the supply of and demand for our commodities key market drivers impact on our industry future commodity supply • the pro-cyclical nature of mining investment means that new mines are usually approved when commodity prices are higher • given the long development time frames required to bring new mine supply on line, the timing as to when this appears in the economic cycle is difficult to predict and could appear at low points in the economic cycle, creating excess supply in the market • over-investment creates oversupply and with it a prolonged period of low commodity prices • although commodity prices have increased significantly from the lows seen in early 2016, the experience of the last economic cycle has provided investor pressure on companies to be more cautious about investing in new supply • balancing a finite, declining resource base with the need to grow to meet expected future demand is an inherent challenge for companies in the resource sector demand for the commodities we produce • the industrialisation and urbanisation of developing economies over the last decade has driven significant growth in commodity demand • china’s rapid growth over this period now means that it accounts for up to half of global demand for most commodities • as developing economies mature, the commodities that drive their growth change • increased levels of industrialisation and urbanisation suggest demand growth rates for commodities may be lower in the future • negative demand could generate excess supply along with lower commodity prices • early-cycle commodities such as iron ore, coking coal and cement may become less important as demand patterns shift in favour of mid and late cycle commodities such as copper, zinc, cobalt, nickel, thermal coal and agricultural products energy and emissions transformation • momentum to decarbonise the global economy is gathering pace as nations increasingly coordinate efforts aimed at minimising emissions of carbon dioxide to achieve climate change goals and transition the world to a low-carbon economy • this transition is likely to increase the cost for fossil fuels, impose levies for emissions and increase costs for monitoring and reporting and to reduce demand for fossil fuels • third parties, including potential or actual investors, may also introduce policies adverse to glencore due to our interest in fossil fuels, particularly coal • technological advances are making renewable energy sources more competitive with fossil fuels and are likely to displace them over the longer run. traditional miner marketer glencore logistics/ marketing blending/ optimisation processing/ refining extraction/ production exploration 18 glencore annual report 2017 our marketing

annual report 2017 we have been a member of the international council on mining & metals since 2014. we endorse its sustainable development framework principles and are an active member of its working groups. senior subject matter experts participate in the assurance programme; our board receives reports on its findings, which are actively followed up and verified. an important tool in improving safety at our operations has been the recording of high potential risk incidents (hpris). the board receives regular updates on this area and actively encourages an approach of ongoing improvement. our lost time injury frequency rate (ltifr) reflects the total number of ltis per million hours worked and does not include restricted work injuries or fatalities. this slight increase reflects energy use relating to pre-stripping activity and construction work for future production improvements. in australia, we use coal seam gas from our mines to supplement power generation at a number of our assets and have flares installed at those underground coal mines with the necessary supply and concentration of methane. we are investing in a number of low carbon energy projects that address direct and indirect emissions from our operations. in 2017, the transition pathway initiative (tpi), which aims to define what the transition to a low carbon economy looks like for companies in high-impact sectors such as oil and gas, mining and electricity generation, awarded glencore a ‘level four – strategic assessment’. furthermore we completed our high-risk site assessments related to water and set up a process for the internal sharing of best water-related practices. we work with communities to deliver socio-economic development through investment in infrastructure, procurement, health and education projects. we contribute to society throughout our value chain, via employment, procurement, enterprise development, infrastructure and social investment programmes. we monitor all material

society, governments and our customers, to promote responsible commodity sourcing. 35 glencore annual report 2017 strategic report governance financial statements additional information not only do we have a diversified portfolio of commodities and services, our presence in 90 marketing offices and 150 assets in more than 50 countries means our people are varied, too. in our baar corporate office, we employ people from 54 different nationalities, with the gender balance approaching 40% female. during 2017, in australia, we negotiated new enterprise agreements (eas) with local construction, forestry, mining and energy union (cfmeu) lodges at 13 of our coal operations. at our oaky north mine we have been negotiating with the cfmeu on a new agreement for nearly three years. in early 2018, following an extended labour dispute, we reached an in-principle agreement with national, state and local cfmeu leaders; regrettably oaky north’s union members voted against the proposed agreement that would have resulted in a return to work. wellbeing our entire workforce shares responsibility for creating, fostering and maintaining a culture of safe work. they support our employees in day-to-day business considerations, particularly those seeking advice on ethical, lawful behaviour or policy implementation. in 2017, 31,737 employees and contractors (2016: 29,569) completed our code of conduct e-learning, which includes guidance on raising concerns. it contains our clear position on bribery and corruption: the offering, paying, authorising, soliciting or accepting of bribes is unacceptable. if a concern remains unresolved through local channels, it can be referred to the group’s raising concerns programme. in countries with low levels of internet access we have telephone numbers, made known to our people via notice boards. all loss of life is unacceptable and we are determined to eliminate fatalities across our group. in particular: • our liquidity risk management policy requires us to maintain (via a $3 billion minimum prescribed level) sufficient cash and cash equivalents and other sources of committed funding available to meet anticipated and unanticipated funding needs • making use of credit enhancement products, such as letters of credit, insurance policies and bank guarantees and imposing limits on open accounts extended • our management of marketing risk, including daily analysis of group value at risk (var) 2017 developments the following remain the leading risks (i.e. those posing the greatest potential threat) which the group faces: 1. reduction in commodity prices: there has been a general rise in commodity prices over the past 18 months. although strong producer currencies are generally detrimental over the short term to our locally denominated operating costs, this can be outweighed by stronger 42 glencore annual report 2017 world economic conditions and the associated increases in commodity prices that may derive from this. in particular, catastrophic hazards such as tailings leakages and collapses of pit walls or underground tunnels represent significant unquantifiable risks for resources companies. government policy decisions can be very important, e.g. in reducing the demand for coal or increasing its pricing (via carbon taxes) – see emissions and climate change below. if this occurs then it is detrimental to us through higher equivalent u.s. dollar operating costs at the relevant operations. our marketing operations are large in scale, which may make fraudulent or accidental transactions difficult to detect. in december 2017 the united states government designated dan gertler and affiliated companies as specially designated nationals (sdns), thereby imposing blocking sanctions on them and companies owned 50% or more by them, under executive order 13818, titled “blocking the property of persons involved in serious human rights abuses or corruption”. we seek to manage the risk of breaching applicable laws and external requirements through our policy framework which is described on page 91. however, there can be no assurance that such policies, procedures and controls will adequately protect the group against fraud, corruption, sanctions breaches or other unlawful activities. these include unanticipated variations in grade and other geological problems (so that anticipated or stated reserves, may not conform to expectations). other examples include natural hazards, processing problems, technical malfunctions, unavailability of materials and equipment, unreliability and/or constraints of infrastructure, industrial accidents, labour force challenges, disasters, protests, force majeure factors, cost overruns, delays in permitting or other regulatory matters, vandalism and crime. although the group has various structures in place which seek to protect its position where it does not exercise control, these other shareholders may have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours. our business involves mining and consuming fossil fuels along with processing minerals which inevitably entails emitting harmful emissions. inevitably, every mine will reach a point of depletion where it is no longer economic to operate and must be closed in an orderly fashion. various union strike action has occurred at several of our operations during the year e.g. coal australia. • energy products adjusted marketing ebit was up 9% compared to 2016, with healthy contributions from both oil and coal. • like-for-like, agricultural products adjusted marketing ebit was down 26% compared to 2016, but up 7% at the adjusted ebitda level, due to a higher depreciation charge in 2017. this was an overall satisfactory result, given the general industry margin pressures, following a succession of global bumper crops. these impairments were partially offset by a reversal of $243 million related to the equatorial guinea oil operations. distributions the directors have recommended a 2017 financial year cash distribution of $0.20 per share amounting to $2.9 billion, excluding any distribution on own shares and ignoring any attribution of shares which may take place prior to the record dates. as at 31 december 2017, glencore plc had chf 37 billion of such capital contribution reserves in its statutory accounts. these strong results were fuelled by solid underlying global economic growth, which combined with overall industry capital discipline and generally muted production growth, resulted in commodity markets tightening over the year, with a corresponding increase in prices and premiums. such market conditions, together with continued industrial cost and productivity focus, contributed to the increase in adjusted ebitda mining margin from 33% to 38%, while increased marketing base metals’ volumes aided the segment’s overall strong performance improvement compared to 2016. adjusted ebitda (us$ million) ◊ 2017 2016

governance financial statements additional information metals and minerals continued marketing highlights base metals’ prices continued their positive momentum from the second half of 2016, into and through 2017. indeed, year-end prices for most of the selected commodities in the table above were considerably higher than the annual averages, with copper around $7,200/t, zinc at $3,300/t, nickel at $12,700/t and equivalent cobalt at $34/lb. the environmental drive in china continued to put pressure on extractive industries, limiting domestic zinc mine output. looking ahead, global supply is expected to be impacted by ageing assets, limited sector reinvestment, a diminished project pipeline and elevated risk of mine disruptions. such positive fundamentals, backed by strong physical activity and significant draws in global inventory, drove nickel premiums to record highs. consequently, the nickel market remained in material supply deficit for a second year running, enabling global stocks to draw down quickly despite headline lme inventory suggesting otherwise. with local stocks already at low levels, chinese consumers resorted to higher metal imports, up 59.3% year-on-year. the year started with a series of environmental and price-driven chinese stainless steel mill closures, which temporarily impacted chrome demand. for 2018, while overall supply of iron ore may increase, we could see a decrease in low grade cargoes exported to china. shutdown of illegal capacities and winter production cuts in china demonstrated the government’s willingness to enforce its environmental policies. looking forward, train one of katanga’s whole ore leach project commissioned in q4 2017 and is planned to ramp up through 2018, while lady loretta (mount isa zinc)

109,100 tonnes was 6,000 tonnes (5%) down on 2016, owing to changes in the use of third party versus own sourced feeds in the ino circuit, partly offset by a strengthening operational performance at koniambo. glencore’s share of production at 72,000 ounces was therefore down ~30% on 2016. normal operations have since resumed. marketing also contributed to the increase, aided by higher oil volumes and supportive coal market conditions. by mid-year the benchmark slipped to $45 per barrel as market sentiment weakened, amidst events that increased concerns about oversupply and global inventories remaining stubbornly high. underlying performance was within expectations in a difficult trading environment, characterised by relatively low prices and volatility, which limited arbitrage opportunities. despite a brief u.s. weather concern in late june, impacting primarily spring wheat, which proved to be less significant than initially thought, global crops were problem free with

board has approved a formal schedule which sets out those matters which are reserved for its decision-making alone such as strategy, the annual budget and material acquisitions and disposals. the board calendar is planned to ensure that directors are briefed on a wide range of topics. while attending company meetings, the directors also usually engage with heads of commodities and other senior group functions. a similar induction is being undertaken for gill marcus in 2018. board effectiveness since an external evaluation was carried out during 2015 and no material governance issues arose during 2016, the board resolved to carry out an internal evaluation for the year. even today we find it challenging to fill positions in remote mining locations and for the marketing of commodities by women. management monitors the publication of new reporting standards and works closely with our external auditor in evaluating their impact, if any. your board has been committed to ensure that the weaknesses identified are addressed and do not recur. industrial risk management we believe that every employee should be accountable for the risks related to their role. glencore has a disciplined and conservative approach to marketing risk (mr) management supported by its flat organisational structure. initial responsibility for risk management is provided by the businesses in accordance with and complementing their commercial decision-making. this is then subject to challenge from the ceo based on his overall group knowledge and experience. business risk summaries showing positional exposure and other relevant metrics, together with potential margin call requirements, are also circulated daily. in addition, var does not purport to represent actual gains or losses in fair value on earnings to be incurred by the group, nor are these var results considered indicative of future market movements or representative of any actual impact on its future results. internal audit reviews areas of potential risk within the business and suggests control solutions to mitigate exposures identified. as part of this work, it considered the function’s management framework and its improvement programme. the full- and half-year reporting is followed by investor meetings in a variety of locations where we have institutional shareholders. 4. taxation due to its global reach, including operating in high risk jurisdictions, the group is subject to enhanced complexity and uncertainty in accounting for income taxes, particularly the evaluation of tax exposures and recoverability of deferred tax. martin gilbert was appointed in may 2017. in recommending his appointment to the board, mr gilbert’s in-depth financial knowledge and long track record both as a listed company ceo and

rather than physical quantities produced or as a percentage of revenues – after adjustment for temporary differences. obligations arising from royalty arrangements that do not satisfy these criteria are recognised as current provisions and included in cost of goods sold. glencore assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years open to audit based upon the latest information available. for those matters where it is probable that an adjustment will be made, the group records its best estimate of these tax liabilities, including related interest charges. other than goodwill which is not depreciated, glencore has no identifiable intangible assets with an indefinite life. provisions provisions are recognised when glencore has a present obligation (legal or constructive), as a result of past events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits that can be reliably estimated will be required to settle the liability. any proceeds received on disposal of the shares or transfers to employees are recognised in equity. gains and losses on derivative instruments for which hedge accounting is not applied, other than the revenue adjustment mechanism embedded within provisionally priced sales, are recognised in cost of goods sold. associates and joint ventures are required to be accounted for in glencore’s financial statements under the equity method. together with foreign exchange movements and mark-to-market movements on investments held for trading, other expense includes other items of income and expense which due to their non-operational nature or expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them are reported separately from operating segment results. net changes in mark-to-market valuations on investments held for trading primarily relates to movements on interests in investments classified as held for trading (see note 9) and the arm coal non- discretionary dividend obligation (see note 27) carried at fair value. as a result, the full carrying value of these assets/projects was impaired, with $186 million recognised in our metals and minerals segment. katanga mining has recently resumed operations and is expected to generate sufficient taxable profits in the future. should these expectations fully materialise, up to $633 million of available unrecognised tax effected losses could be recognised. however, in january 2018, the drc parliament passed a revised mining code which raises taxes and ceases existing tax stability agreements. in december 2017, this royalty was disposed of, see note 3. goodwill impairment testing given the nature of each cgu’s activities, information on its fair value is usually difficult to obtain unless negotiations with potential purchasers or similar transactions are taking place. although glencore holds a 25% interest in russneft, it does not exercise significant influence over its financial and operating policy decisions. other non-current receivables and loans other non-current receivables and loans comprise the following: us$ million 2017 2016 counterparty secured marketing related financing arrangements 1 992 1,043 société nationale d’electricité (snel) power advances 307 295 chad state national oil company 339 389 société nationale des pétroles du congo 123 292 iron ore prepayment 38 89 other 676 656 total 2,475 2,764 1 various marketing related financing facilities, generally secured against certain assets and/or payable from the future sale of production of the counterparty. snel power advances in early 2012, a joint agreement with société nationale d’électricité (snel), the democratic republic of the congo’s (drc) national electricity utility, was signed whereby glencore’s operations will contribute $389 million to a major electricity infrastructure refurbishment programme, including transmission and distribution systems. such receivables, although contractually past their due dates, are not considered impaired as there has not been a significant change in credit quality of the relevant counterparty, and the amounts are still considered recoverable taking into account customary payment patterns and in many cases, offsetting accounts payable balances. glencore currently intends to settle these awards, when exercised, by the transfer of ordinary shares held in treasury. the associated expenditure will occur in a pattern consistent with when employees choose to exercise their entitlements. notes to the financial statements continued 168 glencore annual report 2017 onerous contracts onerous contracts represent liabilities related to contractual take or pay commitments for securing coal logistics capacity at fixed prices and quantities higher than the acquisition date forecasted usage and prevailing market price. for those matters where it is probable that an adjustment will be made, the group records its best estimate of these tax liabilities, including related interest charges. accordingly, management does not anticipate a significant risk of material change in estimates within the next financial year. it is expected that adjustments could be made to the allocation of value between fixed asset classes, deferred taxes, rehabilitation and other provisions. glencore’s objectives in managing its “capital attributable to equity holders” include preserving its overall financial health and strength for the benefit of all stakeholders, maintaining an optimal capital structure in order to provide a high degree of financial flexibility at an attractive cost of capital and safeguarding its ability to continue as a going concern, while generating sustainable long-term profitability. commodity price risk glencore is exposed to price movements for the inventory it holds and the products it produces which are not held to meet priced forward contract obligations and forward priced purchase or sale contracts. residual basis risk exposures represent a key focus point for glencore’s commodity department teams who actively engage in the management of such. 179 glencore annual report 2017 strategic report governance financial statements additional information 25. financial and capital risk management continued market risk var (one-day 95% confidence level) ranges and year-end positions were as follows: us$ million 2017 2016 year-end position 18 31 average during the year 25 42 high during the year 41 101 low during the year 13 16 var does not purport to represent actual gains or losses in fair value on earnings to be incurred by glencore, nor does glencore claim that these var results are indicative of future market movements or representative of any actual impact on its future results. consequently, foreign exchange movements against the u.s. dollar on recognised transactions would have an immaterial financial impact. glencore’s debt related payments (both principal and interest) are primarily denominated in or swapped using hedging instruments into u.s. dollars. glencore’s credit management process includes the assessment, monitoring and reporting of counterparty exposure on a regular basis. additionally, it is glencore’s policy that transactions and activities in trade related financial instruments be concluded under master netting agreements or long form confirmations to enable offsetting of balances due to/from a common counterparty in the event of default by the counterparty. glencore has a diverse customer base, with no customer representing more than 3.3% (2016: 2.9%) of its trade receivables (on a gross basis taking into account credit enhancements) or accounting for more than 3.5% of its revenues over the year ended 31 december 2017 (2016: 3.9%). the maximum exposure to credit risk (including performance risk – see below), without considering netting agreements or without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements, is equal to the carrying amount of glencore’s financial assets (see note 26). glencore undertakes the assessment, monitoring and reporting of performance risk within its overall credit management process. the commodity industry has trended towards shorter term fixed price contract periods, in part to mitigate against such potential performance risk, but also due to the continuous development of transparent and liquid spot commodity markets, with their associated derivative products and indexes. glencore has set itself an internal minimum liquidity target to maintain at all times, including via available committed undrawn credit facilities of $3 billion (2016: $3 billion), which has purposely been substantially exceeded in recent years, accounting for the more volatile market backdrop. 183 glencore annual report 2017 strategic report

inputs where available and are presented to reflect the expected gross future cash in/outflows. it is glencore’s policy that transactions and activities in trade related financial instruments be concluded under master netting agreements or long form confirmations to enable balances due to/from a common counterparty to be offset in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy by the counterparty. the liability arises from arm coal’s rights as an investor to a share of agreed free cash flows from certain coal operations in south africa and is valued based on those cash flows using
