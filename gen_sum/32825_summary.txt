glencore’s balance sheet has never been stronger and our investment case, underpinned by our leading marketing and industrial asset businesses, has never been better capitalising on a strong operating environment after an encouraging end to 2016, which saw commodities recover from cycle lows, positive momentum continued through 2017, resulting in prolonged outperformance of glencore’s key commodities versus the broader markets. traditional miner marketer glencore logistics/ marketing blending/ optimisation processing/ refining extraction/ production exploration 18 glencore annual

of ltis per million hours worked and does not include restricted work injuries or fatalities. we are investing in a number of low carbon energy projects that address direct and indirect emissions from our operations. furthermore we completed our high-risk site assessments related to water and set up a process for the internal sharing of best water-related practices. we engage with a broad range of stakeholders, including civil society, governments and our customers, to promote responsible commodity sourcing. during 2017, in australia, we negotiated new enterprise agreements (eas) with local construction, forestry, mining and energy union (cfmeu) lodges at 13 of our coal operations. at our oaky north mine we have been negotiating with the cfmeu on a new agreement for nearly three years. it contains our clear position on bribery and corruption: the offering, paying, authorising, soliciting or accepting of bribes is unacceptable. in countries with low levels of internet access we have telephone numbers, made known to our people via notice boards. in particular, catastrophic hazards such as tailings leakages and collapses of pit walls or underground tunnels represent significant unquantifiable risks for resources companies. government policy decisions can be very important, e.g. in reducing the demand for coal or increasing its pricing (via carbon taxes) – see emissions and climate change below. in december 2017 the united states government designated dan gertler and affiliated companies as specially designated nationals (sdns), thereby imposing blocking sanctions on them and companies owned 50% or more by them, under executive order 13818, titled “blocking the property of persons involved in serious human rights abuses or corruption”. these include unanticipated variations in grade and other geological problems (so that anticipated or stated reserves, may not conform to expectations). although the group has various structures in place which seek to protect its position where it does not exercise control, these other shareholders may have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours. inevitably, every mine will reach a point of depletion where it is no longer economic to operate and must be closed in an orderly fashion. such market conditions, together with continued industrial cost and productivity focus, contributed to the increase in

report governance financial statements additional information metals and minerals continued marketing highlights base metals’ prices continued their positive momentum from the second half of 2016, into and through 2017. indeed, year-end prices for most of the selected commodities in the table above were considerably higher than the annual averages, with copper around $7,200/t, zinc at $3,300/t, nickel at $12,700/t and equivalent cobalt at $34/lb. looking ahead, global supply is expected to be impacted by ageing assets, limited sector reinvestment, a diminished project pipeline and elevated risk of mine disruptions. consequently, the nickel market remained in material supply deficit for a second year running, enabling global stocks to draw down quickly despite headline lme inventory suggesting otherwise. the year started with a series of environmental and price-driven chinese stainless steel mill closures, which temporarily impacted chrome demand. for 2018, while overall supply of iron ore may increase, we could see a decrease in low grade cargoes exported to china. shutdown of illegal capacities and winter production cuts in china demonstrated the government’s willingness to enforce its environmental policies. looking forward, train one of katanga’s whole ore leach project commissioned in q4 2017 and is planned to ramp up through 2018, while lady loretta (mount isa

inventories remaining stubbornly high. underlying performance was within expectations in a difficult trading environment, characterised by relatively low prices and volatility, which limited arbitrage opportunities. even today we find it challenging to fill positions in remote mining locations and for the marketing of commodities by women. management monitors the publication of new reporting standards and works closely with our external auditor in evaluating their impact, if any. business risk summaries showing positional exposure and other relevant metrics, together with potential margin

for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. obligations arising from royalty arrangements that do not satisfy these criteria are recognised as current provisions and included in cost of goods sold. for those matters where it is probable that an adjustment will be made, the group records its best estimate of these tax liabilities, including related interest charges. gains and losses on derivative instruments for which hedge accounting is not applied, other than the revenue adjustment mechanism embedded within provisionally priced sales, are recognised in cost of goods sold. as a result, the full carrying value of these assets/projects was impaired, with $186 million recognised in our metals and minerals segment. although glencore holds a 25% interest in russneft, it does not exercise significant influence over its financial and operating policy decisions. such receivables, although contractually past their due dates, are not considered impaired as there has not been a significant change in credit quality of the relevant counterparty, and the amounts are still considered recoverable taking into account customary payment patterns and in many cases, offsetting accounts payable balances. for those matters where it is probable that an adjustment will be made, the group records its best estimate of these tax liabilities, including related interest charges. it is expected that adjustments could be made to the allocation of value between fixed asset classes, deferred taxes, rehabilitation and other provisions. residual
