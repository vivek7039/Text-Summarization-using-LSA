on behalf of the board, i want to thank them sincerely for their ongoing efforts. our excellence in technology and our people’s unswerving commitment to fair client outcomes will serve us well as the uncertainty clears, and i believe that ig will come out of this period as an even stronger player. chairman’s statement in my third year as chairman of ig, i am pleased to report that the company delivered another year of strong growth, leading to record revenue and profits, in a relatively quiet period for financial markets. (2) a history of creating solutions innovation has been at the heart of our business since we began life in 1974. as the uk’s original financial spread betting provider, we introduced a completely new, accessible way for people to trade on gold – by defining it as an index. an intuitive, customisable interface offers straightforward functionality for the less-experienced trader, while those with more demanding requirements have access to a range of advanced functions. our business has continuously adapted to a changing economic backdrop, and we remain agile and innovative in the face of an uncertain regulatory landscape, as we look to the next phase of our growth. by offering low costs and full transparency on total cost of ownership, we are industry-leading. attracting clients who seek longer-term investments, this broader product range is now fully live in the uk, and we‘ve introduced share trading to australia. our main product is the binary option, which provides a flexible way for clients to trade with limited risk. timeframes can vary from five minutes to daily, weekly or monthly, and we offer a wide range of markets. all market share data presented in this report is provided by investment trends pty limited. we assess this to determine whether or not such an account is right for them. this proactive stance sets us apart from other providers and is a key part of our client-focused approach to business. earlier this year we raised our required wealth bands, and first-time clients must now place an increased opening balance on their account before they begin trading. constant access to expertise once clients have become acquainted with ig, we offer them ongoing support and assistance via our trading services teams. and with native speakers from every territory in which we are present – all available via phone, email or live chat – we make it as easy as possible for clients to get the information they need, quickly and in the way they want it. this enabled us to have our service standards independently appraised and verified by the uk-based organisation. we’re proud that our clients can now access a platform at the very cutting edge of trading technology. in our customer research, clients repeatedly tell us how much they value good trading technology, and that they seek solutions to help them trade in a smarter, faster way that’s tailored to suit them. for this reason we continue to invest heavily in our technological capabilities, and will keep doing so going forwards. through our free ig academy app, for example, clients can learn via interactive, step-by-step trading courses aimed at all experience levels. likewise, our extensive collection of online how-to videos is accessible at any time to help clients enhance their knowledge. earlier this year we also acquired dailyfx – the world’s leading portal for forex research, trading news, charts, indicators and analysis. over more than four decades, ig has built its name on innovation, fairness and outstanding client service. we recognise that a strong team is pivotal in forging mutually rewarding, long-term relationships with our clients. • we’re a global employer with people in 17 countries • we employ 1,546 staff • 90% of employees feel that there’s a strong sense of teamwork and cooperation in ig • we’ve been certified as one of britain’s top employers for ten consecutive years there are three key themes within our people strategy: 1. global employer of choice 2. performance and reward 3. talent and growth 1. global employer of choice in essence, our guiding principle is that we‘re one ig – a unified business where energised, engaged people are aligned in their commitment to a shared purpose – providing the best possible client experience. expanding these operational hubs has enabled us to access additional high-quality talent, particularly in technology and support functions. in 2016, our employees led the creation of ig open, a network to support those who identify themselves as lgbt+. appropriate training and/or graduated back-to-work programmes, in conjunction with the occupational health professionals, help achieve this aim. talented people, supported by a strong organisational culture, are vital to the service we provide for our clients. it centres on providing our people with a clearly defined purpose, specific deliverables and expected behaviours. with this in mind, during the year we introduced a high-performance model that gives our people greater clarity on what’s expected of them. bonus levels are intrinsically linked to the financial and operational performance of ig, including client satisfaction. alongside our formal reward structure, recognition also takes the form of peer- and manager-nominated awards delivered in local teams. these celebrate achievements in areas such as innovation, mentoring and being a team player or client champion. going forward, we’ll implement similar principles of identification, assessment and development for other core roles across the group. we encourage all of our employees to take responsibility for their own development while they’re with us. as an international company, we’re also able to offer overseas secondments and project-based development opportunities for selected individuals. detailed below, i believe these statements articulate why ig exists and what makes us tick. share your enthusiasm, take pride in each other’s achievements and work as a team. the rollout of our new web trading platform began late in 2016 with a trial for uk spread betting clients and has since progressed well. this is now the default platform for uk spread bettors, with more than half of all client desktop trades being placed here. together with the share dealing service, this is expected to be an effective means of engaging and retaining valuable leveraged trading clients. against this backdrop, i am delighted that the company again delivered record revenue and profits. ig has also created and rolled out globally a new appropriateness test, which means that prospective clients who were previously allowed to proceed at their own risk can no longer have a leveraged account with ig unless they can demonstrate that they understand the potential risks and rewards of such an account. these companies have often provided a single product, the up/down binary option, using high-pressure sales practices. this combination of poorly regulated and illegal providers has often left the impression that the entire industry is at fault and made it very difficult for compliant providers, such as ig, to make their voices heard. ig sees five main areas where regulators are expressing concern and suggesting the need for remedies: • marketing. ig has commenced work on developing a multi-lateral trading facility (mtf) to serve the european market. ig believes in doing the right thing, rather than simply complying with minimum regulatory requirements. with content that is suitable for novice traders through to those with advanced knowledge, it helps people identify trading opportunities and offers education and insight, with direct links to ig’s product set • continue development of our investments product, including allowing clients to individually configure their portfolios, and consider the launch of the product in additional countries • support this with an extension of the share dealing platform, improving functionality around dividend reinvestment and a regular savings mechanism • take an increasingly analytical approach to client content, providing clients with tailored materials that are delivered at the right time, on the right platform, in the right format for them • provide clients with complete transparency in their trading and investing, through improved analytics achieve, maintain or extend market leadership our market leadership in cfds and spread betting reflects the unrivalled service, products and platform technology we provide. • achieved significant client growth over the year – 7% in leveraged and 203% in non-leveraged trading • maintained our revenue per trade • delivered strong revenue growth at nadex – 26% increase year-on-year • introduced a brand new, market-leading trading platform that includes built-in training, analysis and insight functionality. • achieved significant growth in our new switzerland and dubai offices, both of which are performing ahead of our expectations • continued roll-out of localised websites to improve client acquisition across diverse territories • over £35 million of revenue generated from clients based in countries where we do not have an office • increase opportunities in non-office locations by providing dedicated ownership of target countries • develop best-in-class websites that boast easy navigation, leading-edge web technology and effective search engine optimisation • maximise the impact of

business model, the group also faces liquidity and capital adequacy risk. the business faces operational risks, including those arising through technology, people, process and external events. our sophisticated online marketing uses an algorithmic approach, which enables us to reach larger numbers of the right prospects more efficiently. clients can access expert tutorials, which cover everything from fundamental trading concepts to risk management. we have a number of services designed to help clients limit any losses they may make. the group accepts this market risk in order to allow instant execution of client orders. this pivotal event gave the group the framework to consolidate its global web traffic through a single route in order to focus on online leadership – something that is increasingly important for acquiring, educating and providing a high level of service for clients. the business invests in developing new tools and features for its client-facing platforms – a continuous process that is directed by detailed research into clients’ evolving needs. clients can also access extensive educational resources, in an engaging, interactive format, via our ig academy app. the business closely monitors its service standards through key performance and risk indicators tracked in real time. the level of volatility in financial markets ig’s business

its financial strength and resilience. risk reporting is undertaken daily, with several reports covering key market, credit, liquidity and capital adequacy metrics. the group operates in a highly competitive environment, including from some unregulated and illegal operators. the group normally undertakes no hedging for these markets, but can hedge specific positions if considered necessary. in addition, a small number of clients are granted credit limits to cover running losses on open trades and margin requirements. financial institution counterparties are subject to a credit review when a new relationship is entered into, and this is updated semi-annually (or more frequently as required, eg upon changes to the financial institution’s corporate structure). the group’s general policy is that all financial institution counterparties holding client money accounts must have minimum short and long-term ratings of a-2 and a- respectively, although in some operating jurisdictions where accounts are maintained to provide local banking facilities for clients, it can be problematic to find a banking counterparty satisfying these minimum ratings requirements. these criteria also apply for the group’s own bank accounts held with financial institutions. the threat of attacks from outside the group, such as ddos and hacking, are managed through several layers of control to provide in-depth defence, including volumetric scrubbing, multiple firewalls, an intrusion detection system and anti-virus scanners to block incoming emails containing malware. the group undertakes regular penetration tests to detect vulnerabilities, and receives intelligence on emerging threats from an external organisation. if policies are breached, or employees behave inappropriately, the group has a disciplinary framework to address and resolve issues. these forecasts are also considered when setting targets for the executive and senior management share plans. four-year forecasts have therefore been prepared on different scenarios, including one that assumes all of the proposals from each of the consultation papers published by our regulators are enacted, and that there are no cost-reduction actions from management. we maintain this policy even when it may have a negative impact on our own revenue or costs. over the last year we have reviewed this assessment process and implemented some fundamental changes. last year we introduced an innovative new charging system that facilitates the use of guaranteed stops. we take pride in being an open, non-hierarchical organisation, where all of our people have access to senior management. to understand our employees’ perceptions of the business and address their concerns, we carry out an annual engagement survey. appropriate training and/or graduated back-to-work programmes, in conjunction with the occupational health professionals, help achieve this aim. the new system ensures that each of our people has a clearly defined purpose, with specific deliverables and expected behaviours. regular meetings with the line manager then provide opportunities for feedback, goal realignment and recognition of success. bonus levels are intrinsically linked to the financial and operational performance of ig, including client satisfaction. not only do we support charities with gifts of money, but also by providing time and resources. our absence-management policy offers the opportunity for our people to take up voluntary work, for which we grant additional leave on a like-for-like basis up to a maximum of five matched days per annual leave year. we carried out the refurbishment with sustainability in mind, taking a number of steps to minimise our impact on the environment: • 95% of existing glazing was reused to create new partitions • 80% of existing ceiling tiles were recycled • existing light fittings were reused where possible, with new led lamps installed to save energy • dimmable led lighting was installed in open-plan areas • all desk lamps were fitted with time clocks • all existing carpet tiles were removed and recycled • existing raised-access flooring was modified, avoiding the need to install new floor tiles • 50% of existing desks were reused • existing mechanical plant was reused, with modifications to support new layouts • unwanted furniture was donated for reuse, where possible • all waste was removed by the contractor’s registered recycling provider we have rolled out laptops and the hot-desk working model to our global offices wherever practical, as well as installing environment-friendly, state-of-the-art video conferencing and collaboration technology – provided by skype for business. for the most significant sources of energy consumption discussed above, we purchase electricity via our landlords. previous year (2015/16) current year (2016/17) year-on-year variance net trading revenue (£) 456.3m 491.1m +7% intensity ratio, location-based method

company overview strategic report corporate governance report financial statements chairman’s introduction to corporate governance in this year’s chief executive officer’s review, we reported on another strong set of results achieved during a period of significant global political events and an uncertain regulatory landscape which has led to a significant fall in the company’s share price. we believe that good-quality governance underpins ig’s ability to deliver sustainable future growth and long-term value-creation for shareholders. our results are underpinned by an enduring governance culture, which continues to put high ethical standards and fair client outcomes at the heart of all we do. in addition the board has a standing committee which deals with board-reserved matters required to be considered at short notice and where there are administrative matters requiring approval and evidencing that do not warrant a full board. june was also global general manager for banking & financial markets and strategy consultant at booz, allen & hamilton. a qualified chartered accountant, jim was finance director for resolution plc, having joined the company as group financial controller. from 1993-2000, he held various financial roles at caradon plc including three years as finance director of mk electric. prior to this, he held various executive roles at morgan grenfell plc, drexel burnham lambert, barclays de zoete wedd holdings, ubs ag, ing barings ltd, morley fund managers (now aviva investors), jer partners ltd, where he was european president, and matrix securities limited. any searches for board candidates, and appointments made, are based on merit against objective criteria. each committee has agreed terms of reference approved by the board, which are available on our corporate website, iggroup.com. this year the programme was enhanced by including one-to-one interviews between board members and lintstock. paul mainwaring’s induction programme on joining the board in 2016 covered those aspects set out below. the board also receives an investor perception study to identify shareholders’ concerns and actions undertaken for its resolution. as reported last year the committee concluded its search for a new chief financial officer. the committee has also begun a detailed review of succession planning requirements at board and senior executive management levels. on invitation, the chief executive officer also attends, but is not involved in decisions relating to his own succession. this ensures that executives have a strong ongoing alignment with shareholders through the company’s share price performance. the aim is to provide a flexible, market-competitive pension and benefits allowance, with value for directors capped 17% of base salary. if other hmrc-approved all-employee plans are introduced, they will operate in accordance with hmrc guidance and limits. hmrc or non-uk plan equivalent limits will apply to any all-employee schemes that may be introduced. as is consistent with market practice, the committee retains discretion over a number of areas relating to operating and administrating these plans. customer satisfaction is also measured using the net promoter score (nps) data supplied by investment trends. in many cases, where we make an external appointment, the individual will forfeit incentive awards connected with their previous employment on resignation. these awards can be made either under the company’s existing incentive plans or via other arrangements. we may pay relocation expenses or allowances, legal fees and other costs relating to the recruitment as appropriate. we will set fees for a new non-executive director or chairman in accordance with the approved policy. all service contracts are continuous, and contractual termination payments relate to the unexpired notice period. during this time, the executive will be entitled to receive base salary and all contractual benefits (including pension). non-executive directors may receive reimbursement for business expenses incurred in the course of their duties, including tax thereon if applicable.

dividend waivers remain in place on shares held by them that have not been allocated to employees. any such director holds office only until the next agm, and is then eligible to offer himself or herself for election. directors’ report continued directors’ statement as to disclosure of information to auditors so far as each person who was a director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information, being information needed by the auditors in connection with preparing their report, of which the auditors are unaware. finally, to address the risk that improper adjustments or transactions had been entered into the trading systems, we reviewed client activity reports and read a sample of customer complaints, as well as testing a sample of accounts for authenticity to identify any instances where revenue might have been improperly recognised. darren meek (senior statutory auditor) for and on behalf of pricewaterhousecoopers llp chartered
