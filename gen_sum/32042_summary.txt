Going forward, we’ll implement similar principles of identification, assessment and development for other core roles across the Group. As an international company, we’re also able to offer overseas secondments and project-based development opportunities for selected individuals. The rollout of our new web trading platform began late in 2016 with a trial for UK spread betting clients and has since progressed well. This is now the default platform for UK spread bettors, with more than half of all client desktop trades being placed here. Together with the share dealing service, this is expected to be an effective means of engaging and retaining valuable leveraged trading clients. IG has also created and rolled out globally a new appropriateness test, which means that prospective clients who were previously allowed to proceed at their own risk can no longer have a leveraged account with IG unless they can demonstrate that they understand the potential risks and rewards of such an account. • Achieved significant growth in our new Switzerland and Dubai offices, both of which are performing ahead of our expectations • Continued roll-out of localised websites to improve client acquisition across diverse territories • Over £35 million of revenue generated from clients based in countries where we do not have an office • Increase opportunities in non-office locations by providing dedicated ownership of target countries • Develop best-in-class websites that boast easy navigation, leading-edge web technology and effective search engine optimisation • Maximise the impact of DailyFX to expand IG’s brand awareness in retail FX • Assess opportunities to expand into additional countries as regulatory developments allow STRATEGY AND OBJECTIVES 23 | IG Group Holdings plc • Annual Report 2017 22 IG Group Holdings plc • Annual Report 2017 | Company overview Strategic report Corporate Governance report Financial statements Objective Progress in 2017 Priorities for 2018 Deliver quality service to our clients By maintaining absolute integrity, delivering excellent customer service and fast, reliable execution with transparent pricing, we strive to make our clients feel secure and confident in trading with us.

The Group’s general policy is that all financial institution counterparties holding client money accounts must have minimum short and long-term ratings of A-2 and A- respectively, although in some operating jurisdictions where accounts are maintained to provide local banking facilities for clients, it can be problematic to find a banking counterparty satisfying these minimum ratings requirements.

If policies are breached, or employees behave inappropriately, the Group has a disciplinary framework to address and resolve issues. We take pride in being an open, non-hierarchical organisation, where all of our people have access to senior management. To understand our employees’ perceptions of the business and address their concerns, we carry out an annual engagement survey. The new system ensures that each of our people has a clearly defined purpose, with specific deliverables and expected behaviours. We believe that good-quality governance underpins IG’s ability to deliver sustainable future growth and long-term value-creation for shareholders. Our results are underpinned by an enduring governance culture, which continues to put high ethical standards and fair client outcomes at the heart of all we do.
