challenges. sainsbury’s market share dropped by 23 basis points to 16.3 per cent and, while like-for-like sales are down 0.6 per cent, this is an improvement on last year, demonstrating the resilience

their weekly shop 2 . we also became the only supermarket to offer gluten-free bread freshly baked in our store bakeries. these innovative new lines have helped drive double-digit year-on-year growth for the prepared vegetables category. we also removed more than three tonnes of salt from our canned corned beef products without impacting taste or flavour. we expect that demand for our online grocery service in london will double over the next eight years and to help meet that growing demand we opened our first purpose-built online fulfilment centre in bromley-by-bow, east london. in

general merchandise & clothing and deliver synergies general merchandise sainsbury’s general merchandise sales grew by over two per cent. clothing shopping for clothing in supermarkets has become firmly established and our strategy of offering customers high street style at supermarket prices has helped to increase our sales by over four per cent in the year and to outperform a challenging market. this made us one of the uk’s largest food, general merchandise, clothing and financial services retailers, with over 90,000 products across 2,200 stores. with 10 million webpage visits on the day, 65 per cent of black friday sales were initiated online. we also have 207 digital collection points where customers can collect their tu clothing, ebay and dpd orders conveniently. we now expect this roll-out, together with our £160 million synergy target, to be achieved by march 2019, six months ahead of schedule. we successfully migrated savings customers and atms to our new banking platforms during the year. we continue to make good progress and will introduce our new loans platform by the end of 2017 . we take our responsibilities as a lender of consumer credit very seriously and saw strong growth in personal lending, with ten per cent year-on- year growth in the number of advances to new personal loan customers. in addition, we are rewarding nectar card customers with a guaranteed discount on their insurance premium. we have also successfully launched our new pre-paid travel money card which offers contactless functionality and no atm fees. the integration of sainsbury’s bank with argos financial services will be phased, initially integrating certain reporting and governance capabilities. argos financial services manages an existing store card estate which

customer feedback, we improved and doubled our allergen-free range, re-branding it as deliciously freefrom. we offer prepared vegetable products that not only make it easier for customers to eat more vegetables, but also help them save on cooking time. we also published research into the barriers faced by 11-14 year olds that prevent them from leading healthier lifestyles. since 2009, we have donated more than £11 million for good causes through our local charity of the year programme. our stores are at the centre of local communities, helping customers live well for less. every sainsbury’s local charity partnership offers a different mix of money, volunteering time, food donations and support as needed. this resulted in nearly £76,500 being donated across a broad spectrum of charities and community groups throughout 2016/17. our colleagues also donated over half a million pounds through the payroll giving scheme to support causes they care about. our colleagues were also recognised for their continued support of community alcohol partnerships to encourage responsible drinking. we’re thrilled with the high level of support from sainsbury’s and are extremely grateful

their cashew crop. it follows a successful pilot with our egg farmers to identify and address criminal or exploitative activities. our own research has shown that supporting local, british producers is important to uk consumers. our annual farming conference focused on how farmers could use data to improve productivity and support animal welfare. the model was introduced in 2012 and ensures that our sddg farmers receive a fair price for their milk. the apprentices will gain practical experience at reaseheath college before they seek opportunities within our grower and farmer base. we were the first major supermarket to only sell cage-free fresh eggs in 2009. this winter, some of our free- range poultry, which includes chicken and turkey, were temporarily housed in barns to protect them from avian flu following guidance from government and industry bodies. we were a founder signatory to the courtauld commitment in 2004 and have remained involved ever since. 12 new apprentices joined sainsbury’s agriculture and horticulture apprenticeship scheme this year 33 strategic report respect for our environment we are committed to operating a sustainable business, working closely with colleagues and suppliers to reduce our impact on the environment. through our investment in sustainable operations and technologies, we have reduced emissions by 8.2 per cent this year, compared to 2015/16. we are one of just three retailers worldwide to achieve an a rating in the 2016/17 ftse 350 climate disclosure leadership index. this year marked a significant milestone as we moved to transparent reporting of our operational food waste. our reporting also acts as a shared goal for colleagues across the business to ensure that we are all working together to make a difference, while helping build trust and engage customers through projects such as waste less, save more. we are currently working to verify figures for 2016/17, which will be released later this year. this year, we completed our 12 month trial in swadlincote, derbyshire, where we initiated over 20 trials, ranging from apps that weigh and report on food waste to pioneering school programmes designed to engage young people on the issue. our aim was to identify which tactics had the biggest impact on reducing food waste, and learn how they could be rolled out in more households. we will also publish our findings so that customers, communities and competitors can join the fight against food waste. many people still think that their unwanted clothes won’t make a difference to charities, but at oxfam we can reuse or recycle almost anything. engaging colleagues in this collaborative way, and making the most of their expertise, will help to achieve even better results. in 2016/17, we increased the number of stores that use co 2 e in their refrigeration to 246. this transition helps reduce our use of ozone- depleting refrigerant gases, such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons (hcfc) or hydrofluorocarbons (hfc), which can have a global warming potential that is 3,000 times higher than co 2 e. the new fridges are also more energy efficient. we are also working with our farmers, suppliers and growers to improve their water efficiency (see page 33). going forward we’ll continue to set stretching targets and will test some significant innovations to further reduce consumption.” paul crewe, head of sustainability – energy, engineering & environment 676 we now have led lights in 676 stores, depots and store support centres. 36 strategic report i’ve learned that little things, like shopping with specific meals in mind and thinking about what you’ve already got in the fridge and cupboards, can all add up to make a big difference. we use several tools to help us understand how our colleagues feel about working here. diverse role models were leveraged to great effect at these events and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. in december, tim fallowfield was announced

vesting in full and future builder awards would normally vest subject to achievement of the relevant performance conditions on the same time pro-rated basis as above. the initial appointments and any subsequent reappointments are subject to annual election or re-election by shareholders. the committee proactively consults extensively with our major shareholders to ensure that their views are represented in discussions on remuneration matters. travel and other reasonable expenses (including any associated taxes) incurred in the course of performing their duties are reimbursed to non-executive directors. in addition to maintaining our existing activities, we have taken a number of steps over this financial year to solidify our governance structure, processes and awareness-raising activities on the topic that will help us better identify and address worker exploitation. greenhouse gas emissions in line with the ghg protocol corporate accounting and reporting standard (revised edition), we have recalculated our group base year due to the acquisition, within this reporting year, of hrg which includes argos and habitat. essential contracts sainsbury’s has contractual and other arrangements with numerous third parties in support of its business activities. we have therefore included the risks relating to legacy home retail group components argos and argos financial services together where appropriate in the risks below and we have adopted a similar audit strategy where possible. — we used our computer-aided analytics tools to identify those revenue journals for which the corresponding entry was not cash. they have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, except for derivative financial instruments, defined benefit scheme assets, investment properties and available-for-sale financial assets that have been measured at fair value. significant accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the financial statements. it is no longer necessary for an impairment event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised. stage 1 as soon as a financial instrument is originated or purchased, 12-month expected credit losses must be recognised in profit and loss and an impairment allowance will be established stage 2 if the credit risk increases significantly (and the resulting credit quality is not considered to be low credit risk) full lifetime expected credit losses will be provided for stage 3 financial assets will move into stage 3 when they are considered to be credit impaired, i.e. when one or more events have occurred that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset implementation approach the group’s implementation

financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories (fair value through profit or loss and loans and receivables). for the financial services portfolios of loans, such as credit card lending and personal loans, impairment provisions are calculated for groups of assets, otherwise impairment is identified at a counterparty specific level following objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired. the present value of estimated cash flows recoverable is determined after taking into account any security held. write-offs are charged against previously established provisions for impairment or directly to the income statement. 133 financial statements 15 receivables continued an allowance for impairment losses is also maintained in respect of assets which are impaired at the balance sheet date but which have not been identified as such, based on historical loss experience and other relevant factors.
