Designed for modern manufacturing, our software helps manufacturers improve processes, manage the supply chain and provide excellent customer service. Whilst some manufacturing sectors are more volatile and susceptible to economic uncertainty, the UK food sector has remained relatively recession proof. The Sanderson team is all of these things.” JW Filshill Wholesale Digital solutions providing growth for wholesalers The wholesale distribution sector is a vital sector, linking manufacturers with all types of food and non-food retailers and foodservice businesses. It’s paying off; with double digit growth being reported for wholesalers adopting technology according to IGD, the global food and grocery experts. We combine extensive knowledge of the industry with innovative IT solutions to increase sales, profitability and control for our wholesale customers. Technology is driving competitive advantage as retail activity shifts from shop to warehouse, with growth in fulfilment centres rather than stores. Sanderson is a proven supplier of fulfilment, logistics and warehouse management systems which cover the entire supply chain. We nurture long-term partnerships with businesses that seek to continually improve their performance through the intelligent use of technology, people and processes. Consequently, these trading flows have successfully acted as a natural hedge against adverse exchange movements during the year ended 30 September 2017. Whilst the figures presented above show annual order intake, management monitors this measure on a monthly basis. Forward-looking indicators such as order intake are regularly reviewed to identify potential deterioration in market conditions. Providing existing staff with relevant training and career progression opportunities is a key priority for the business. Acquisition risk The Group will consider complementary and earnings- enhancing acquisitions as part of its overall growth strategy. Sanderson strives to maintain its reputation as a supplier of highly functional, value for money solutions.

Key observations Based on our audit work, we found that the assumptions made and estimates used in management’s assessment of goodwill impairment were balanced. Small variations in those actuarial assumptions can lead to a materially different defined benefit pension scheme asset or liability being recognised within the Group financial statements. Materiality was determined as follows: Materiality Measure Group Parent Financial statements as a whole £186,000, which is 4.75% of Group profit before tax excluding net interest on defined benefit pension scheme deficit, share-based payment charge, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and one-off non-recurring costs. Adjusted profit before tax is also a consistent basis for determining materiality compared with the previous years. We determined a lower level of materiality for certain areas such as directors’ remuneration and related party transactions. The Group’s medium-term strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet with positive cash balances. Management therefore believes the existing business will continue to generate revenues, profits and positive cash flows for many years. 33 Stock code: SND www.sanderson.com Our Financials Sanderson Annual Report 2017.indd 33 13/12/2017 09:46:46 25862 12 December 2017 4:07 PM Proof 8 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3.

Internally generated intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic life, typically between three and five years. Intangible assets acquired through a business combination are measured at fair value and amortised over their useful economic lives. The following periods are used when assessing useful economic lives for purposes of calculating amortisation charges: Intellectual property rights 3-10 years Customer relationships 3-10 years Impairment The carrying amount of the Group’s assets, other than inventories, deferred tax assets and available for sale financial assets (see accounting policies above), is reviewed at each year-end date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
