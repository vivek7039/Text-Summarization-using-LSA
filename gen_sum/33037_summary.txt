of uitf17 and uitf38 (see note 1 on page 81) the ﬁnancial information above is discussed in the financial review on pages 25 to 43, together with the reasons for focusing on the results from continuing activities before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items. new wave revenues grew by 32% to £4.5 billion, and now represent nearly a quarter of our business. while continuing to invest for the future, we generated free cash ﬂow of £2.3 billion, up 10%. this is being funded from cash generated over and above that required for servicing our debt. these acquisitions offered value for money, had a compelling strategic ﬁt and brought capabilities to strengthen bt globally. sir christopher bland chairman 18 may 2005 today, bt is a very different company from the one that i joined three years ago. these used to be separate offerings, often supplied by different companies, but we’re bringing them together in one place. ultimately, our customers shouldn’t have to worry about ﬁxed or mobile when what they really want is freedom and ﬂexibility. a few years ago, our position in this market was aspirational; today, we are competing with the best – and winning. ben verwaayen chief executive 18 may 2005 the business review is divided into the following sections: 7 introduction 8 group structure 9 group strategy 9 build on our networked it services capability 10 deliver on broadband 11 create convergent mobility solutions 12 defend our traditional business vigorously 13 drive for cost leadership 13 keep a relentless focus on improving customer satisfaction 13 transform our network for the twenty-ﬁrst century 13 motivate our people and live the bt values 14 research and development and it support 15 property 15 regulation, competition and prices 22 relationship with hm government 22 legal proceedings please see cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements on page 128. all customer numbers are given as at 31 march 2005, unless stated otherwise. ofcom is currently involved in discussions with bt and others aimed at assessing whether a settlement based on equality of access would be feasible. by november 2004, we had disposed of our entire holding, through the ipo, for £78 million in cash. build on our networked it services capability our strategy in the networked it services market is to reinforce bt’s position as a global player capable of competing with the world’s best in selected growth markets. major contracts included: & our highest proﬁle success in the global market came in march 2005 when it was announced that bt will be reuters’ supplier of network services under a contract expected to be worth up to £1.5 billion over eight and a half years. & a number of contract wins during the 2005 ﬁnancial year helped to conﬁrm bt’s european credentials and capability. & we signed a multi-year managed services agreement with bristol-myers squibb to manage its lan and wan infrastructure globally. as part of the agreement, bt will migrate these services to a state-of-the-art, high- speed, ip-based global mpls (multi-protocol label switching) infrastructure. & we were awarded a global network outsourcing contract with south korea-based cyberlogitec, the it subsidiary of hanjin shipping. networked it services for wholesale customers we believe that the convergence of it and communications technologies creates commercial opportunities for communications providers, and our strategy is to enable these providers to take full advantage of such opportunities. we have a number of agreements with service providers and mobile operators to upgrade their ip capability. in addition, we have used our expertise and geographic reach to provide ubiquitous, bespoke data housing solutions. by april 2006, we aim to sdsl- enable 1,300 exchanges, covering more than two thirds of uk businesses. & during the 2005 ﬁnancial year, we redesigned and reduced the price for our llu (local loop unbundling) product (see regulation, competition and prices – local loop unbundling)byupto 70% in a phased series of price cuts which will, we believe, make it easier for llu operators to invest in broadband infrastructure with conﬁdence. this integrated software package, downloadable from the internet, gives customers a truly convergent, multi-media communications experience, enabling them to manage all their home communications – phone calls, emails, texts, instant messaging and webcam – together in one place on their pc. on average, bt broadband voice offers customers savings of more than 60% compared with second line rental. this was driven by customers making use of alternatives such as mobile calls, email, instant messaging, corporate ipvpns and voip. & in september 2004, we introduced callmobile, a discount package offering customers up to 40% savings on all ﬁxed-to-mobile calls. & during the 2005 ﬁnancial year, we developed two new products to help customers protect themselves against internet dialler problems. we can then put in place an immediate premium rate bar on the line and/or suggest other barring options. for example, we are providing maintenance support to the physical ﬁeld and core switching elements of o2’s 3g network. as at 31 march 2005, our ﬂagship mpls product provided coverage and support to 72 countries from over 1,000 points of presence. transforming our networks, systems and services for the twenty-ﬁrst century our 21cn programme will lead to the simpliﬁcation of bt’s complex multiple networks, making it easier for us, and other operators who interconnect with bt’s network, to deliver compelling converged services. this presents the 102,100 people employed by bt at 31 march 2005 with opportunities to develop innovative solutions, generate new business, drive efﬁciencies, and experience personal growth. in continental europe, we work closely with the works councils, both on an operational basis and as strategic stakeholders. rewarding and recognising achievement in the 2005 ﬁnancial year, we introduced a new reward framework for our managers. salary ranges are now aligned with the going rate for equivalent jobs across a range of comparable organisations, geographies and skill sets. in addition, employees can buy shares at a discount under our savings-related share option plans. we continue to create a working environment that actively supports all our employees – regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation, disability or age. we are also developing new high- quality online ways for customers to deal with us, in an intuitive and comprehensive manner. bt is a limited partner in the independent corporate venturing partnership, nvp brightstar, which generates value by launching key innovations as new high- technology businesses. ofcom has a wide range of general and speciﬁc duties laid down in the communications act. regulatory conditions under the new framework, based on 2003 eu directives, providers may no longer be required to obtain licences before offering telecommunications services. instead, there is a general authorisation for the provision of electronic communications networks and services. in some cases, additional obligations relating to, for example, price control and regulatory accounting have also been imposed. the market reviews relevant to ﬁxed telecommunications that oftel and ofcom have conducted are listed below. for each review, the markets in which bt has been determined to have smp are shown. all references to uk markets, except wholesale trunk segments and broadband conveyance, exclude the hull area. the communications act allows ofcom to review markets for end-user apparatus and impose conditions on any provider designated with smp. the act obliges ofcom to carry out further analyses of markets which have been reviewed at such intervals as it considers appropriate. ofcom is currently carrying out a review of the number translation services (nts) call termination market. bt has responded, arguing that its pricing does not amount to an abuse of dominance. market investigations are intended to address competition issues in markets as a whole and not merely the behaviour of individual players. our charges for a range of interconnect services are controlled by ofcom, under the network charge control (ncc) regime. depending on the degree of competition for these services, charges are cap-controlled each year by rpi minus x (where x ranges from 7.5% to 13%) for services ofcom considers unlikely to become competitive in the near future and safeguard cap-controlled (ie no increases above rpi during any relevant year of the overall control period) for services likely to become competitive. partial private circuit charge control ppcs are leased lines that bt sells to other network operators. on 1 october 2004, ofcom introduced a ppc charge control to replace the annual determinations previously carried out by oftel. bt will not have universal service obligations outside the uk, although in certain member states we may be required to contribute towards an industry fund to pay for the cost of meeting universal service obligations in those countries. bt’s rates were set by the valuation ofﬁce after lengthy discussions based on well established principles in a transparent process. option 3, which was supported by most of the respondents to ofcom’s phase 2 consultation, would entail introducing more effective regulation focused on enduring economic bottlenecks. such an outcome would result in lower wholesale charges for the use of local access network assets. neither product is currently part of a price control but ofcom has imposed various regulatory conditions on the products, including notiﬁcation and cost orientation obligations. if the proceedings are successful, bt could be held liable, with others, for any damages. the company has concluded that it would not be appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such potential claim. business includes the external turnover of bt retail from sme (smaller and medium sized enterprise) customers. traditional consumer turnover declined by 9% reﬂecting the impact of cps (carrier pre selection) and broadband substitution. we reached 5 million broadband dsl connections in early april 2005 which is a year ahead of our target and represents an increase of 126% from 31 march 2004. group operating costs before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items increased by 1% to £15,930 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. other operating costs before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items in the 2005 ﬁnancial year increased by 9% to £5,636 million. this reﬂects not only the cost of supporting new ict contracts, but also investment in new wave activities, including strengthening our networked it services delivery capabilities outside the uk, higher marketing costs and higher subscriber acquisition costs. ebitda before exceptional items is considered to be a good measure of the operating performance because it reﬂects the underlying operating cash costs, by eliminating depreciation and amortisation, and excludes non-recurring exceptional items that are predominantly related to corporate transactions. bt mobile had over 372,000 contract mobile connections at 31 march 2005, an increase of 158% from 31 march 2004. bt openzone has grown signiﬁcantly this year with paid minutes across the network almost four times higher and the number of access sites is now over 20,000 worldwide. the majority of these initiatives were targeted at people related costs, with signiﬁcant savings in billing, it operations and other support functions. in the 2004 ﬁnancial year savings of £228 million before leaver costs were also driven by cost reduction programmes. external turnover is derived from providing wholesale products and solutions to other operators interconnecting with bt’s uk ﬁxed network. this reﬂects the continuing trend of customers migrating from lower bandwidth products to less expensive alternatives such as partial private circuits and short haul data services. operating proﬁt before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items at £1,940 million increased by 3% in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. as a percentage of group turnover, operating costs, excluding goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, were 86% in the 2005 ﬁnancial year (2004 – 85%, 2003 – 86%). this reﬂects not only the cost of supporting new ict contracts, but also investment in new wave activities, including strengthening our networked it services delivery capabilities outside the uk, higher marketing costs and higher subscriber acquisition costs. in the 2004 ﬁnancial year, bt charged its share of an exceptional goodwill impairment made by albacom, amounting to £26 million. this effect was offset by lower interest payments due to certain bonds maturing during the 2005 ﬁnancial year. we have set out further details on this topic and on our capital resources and foreign currency exposure in note 33 to the ﬁnancial statements in compliance with frs 13. operating and ﬁnancial review bt group plc annual report and form 20-f 2005 37 off-balance sheet arrangements as disclosed in the ﬁnancial statements there are no off- balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on the group’s ﬁnancial condition, changes in ﬁnancial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditure or capital resources, with the exception of the following: operating leases (note 27) capital commitments and guarantees (note 27) derivative contracts (note 33) capital resources during the period under review the group has reduced its level of borrowings so that its net debt was £7.8 billion at 31 march 2005 compared with £8.4 billion at 31 march 2004 and £9.6 billion at 31 march 2003. this is at a level with which we are comfortable and we are no longer targeting net debt of around £7 billion in the 2007 ﬁnancial year. the group’s foreign currency borrowings, which totalled £8.8 billion at 31 march 2005, are used to ﬁnance its operations. 21cn is being developed using stringent capital return criteria and a rigorous approach to any investment in the narrowband network. in certain instances we rely on other operators to measure the trafﬁc ﬂows interconnecting with our networks. we enter into long term customer contracts which can extend over a number of ﬁnancial years. it is important to note that the ifrs position as stated is bt’s current view based on the ﬁnancial reporting standards currently in issue and changes may arise as new accounting pronouncements are developed and issued. however, due to the inherent volatilities introduced by ifrs, no such statement can be made in respect of future years. under ifrs, the group will measure pension commitments and other related post-retirement beneﬁts in accordance with ias 19 ‘employee beneﬁts’, which takes a similar approach to frs 17. on adoption of ias 19 the deﬁcit/surplus of deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes will be recognised on balance sheet. under ifrs 3 ‘business combinations’, goodwill is no longer amortised but held at carrying value on the balance sheet and tested annually for impairment. under uk gaap, the group’s policy was to categorise all capitalised software as tangible ﬁxed assets. sfas 123r also establishes fair value as the measurement method in accounting for share-based payments to employees. we also hold the queen’s award for enterprise in recognition of our contribution to sustainable development. we have important relationships with a wide range of stakeholders, including employees, customers and suppliers. the focus of our community programmes is on big issues where better communication can make a real difference to society. for example, more than 10,500 schools and over two million young people have taken part in the bt education programme – a drama-based campaign helping children to improve their communication skills. this activity is supported by our volunteering programme which has several thousand registered volunteers working with schools. we are working with childline on a campaign to ensure that every child’s call for help is answered. during the 2005 ﬁnancial year, we also launched relate 3000, an inclusively designed phone and our new bt text service, which includes a speaking sms facility. prior to his retirement in may 2001, clayton brendish was executive deputy chairman of cmg having joined the board when it acquired admiral. these activities are carried out on an even-handed basis related broadly to the major uk political parties’ electoral strength. at 18 may 2005, 11 million treasury shares had been transferred to meet the company’s obligations under its employee share plans. it is bt’s policy that the board will comprise a majority of independent non-executive directors. guidelines are in place concerning the content, presentation and delivery of papers for each board meeting, so that the directors have enough information to be properly briefed sufﬁciently far ahead of each board meeting and at other appropriate times. each committee has written terms of reference, which are available on the company’s website. the other members are maarten van den bergh, clay brendish, lou hughes, john nelson and carl symon. corporate governance bt group plc annual report and form 20-f 2005 51 as a result of regulatory or similar requirements, it may be necessary to employ the company’s external auditors for certain non-audit work. it reviews the arrangements for dealing, in conﬁdence, with complaints from employees about accounting or ﬁnancial management impropriety, fraud, poor business practices and other matters. in practice, these documents are being sent to shareholders more than 20 working days before the agm. a conﬁdential helpline and e-mail facility are also available to employees who have questions about the application of these principles. the pension funds’ assets can only be used in accordance with their respective rules and for no other purpose. there were no changes in bt’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting that occurred during the year ended 31 march 2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, bt’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting. bt has a nominating committee.it does not develop corporate governance principles for the board’s approval. no base pay changes were proposed or made, save that the committee agreed an increase in base salary effective on 1 january 2005 for andy green and ian livingston to align their packages with their revised responsibilities in a highly competitive market. a combination of share options and incentive shares was used for equity participation in the ﬁnancial year 2004/05. under his service agreement, the chairman is not entitled to receive annual grants of long-term incentive awards or options. normally, awards vest and options become exercisable only if a predetermined performance target has been achieved. the performance measure for outstanding awards and options is tsr (total shareholder return) compared with a relevant basket of companies. the proportion of options that are exercisable reduces on a straight-line basis between those points. incentive shares with a maximum value of two-thirds base salary were granted in the ﬁnancial year 2004/05. tsr will continue to be measured against a comparator group of companies from the european telecom sector. the committee determined, with advice from towers perrin, that the overall value of long-term incentive 58 bt group plc annual report and form 20-f 2005 report on directors’ remuneration awards will not change materially as a result of these proposals. awards will be linked to a sliding scale of bt global services’ performance, weighted equally around revenue growth, ebit and cash generation. performance will again be against earnings per share, free cash ﬂow and customer satisfaction measures. (iv) other matters executive share ownership a mandatory shareholding programme has been introduced for the ﬁnancial year 2005/06 onwards. should the executive die in service, a lump sum equal to four times annual salary is payable together with a spouse’s pension of two-thirds of the executive’s anticipated pension at normal retirement age. additionally, a lump sum equal to four times annual salary is payable on death in service. pension provision for all executives is based on salary alone – bonuses, other elements of pay and long-term incentives are excluded. the clause described above dealing with termination following bt entering into a scheme of arrangement or becoming a subsidiary of another company will be excluded from contracts for new appointments, as was the case for hanif lalani. further details of appointment arrangements for non-executive directors are set out on page 50 in the section dealing with corporate governance issues. c at 31 march 2005, sir christopher bland and each of the executive directors, as potential beneficiaries, had a non-beneficial interest in 27,733,138 shares (2004 – 30,463,435) held in trust by ilford trustees (jersey) limited for allocation to employees under the employee share schemes. directors’ emoluments directors’ emoluments for the ﬁnancial year 2004/05 were as follows: basic salary and fees pension allowance net of pension contributions a total salary and fees annual cash bonus expenses allowance other beneﬁts excluding pension total 2005 total 2004 £000 £000 £000 £000 £000 £000 £000 £000 sir christopher bland d 500 – 500 – – 32 532 532 b verwaayen cdf 700 127 827 448 196 41 1,512 1,968 a green df 444 – 444 204 – 36 684 791 h lalani def 64 – 64 136 – 7 207 – i livingston bdf 469 120 589 198 19 10 816 913 dr p reynolds bdf 400 – 400 213 19 21 653 737 sir anthony greener 115 – 115 – – – 115 96 m van den bergh 55 – 55 – – – 55 44 c brendish 50 – 50 – – – 50 39 lr hughes 21 – 21 – – – 21 40 baroness jay 50 – 50 – – – 50 39 j nelson 50 – 50 – – – 50 39 cg symon 50 – 50 – – – 50 40 p danon bdfh 413 – 413 250 17 21 701 750 3,381 247 3,628 1,449 251 168 5,496 6,028 a balance or part of the pension allowance for the financial year 2004/05 – see ‘pensions’ below. following this year’s salary review, the committee decided that there should be no general increase from 1 june 2005 in basic salaries. bt also provides him with a lump sum death in service beneﬁt of four times his salary. bt also provides him with a lump sum death in service beneﬁt of four times his salary. g directors’ contributions in the financial year 2004/05 were as follows: pierre danon, £14,025 (2004 – £14,580); andy green, £26,625 (2004 – £25,500); hanif lalani £16,300 (2004 – £13,350) and paul reynolds, £24,000 (2004 – £24,000). j options granted under the gsop (special incentive award) on 24 june 2003, prior to mr lalani’s appointment as a director. turnover from classiﬁed directories, mainly comprising advertising revenue, is recognised in the group proﬁt and loss account upon completion of delivery. all other exchange gains or losses are dealt with through the proﬁt and loss account. goodwill is amortised on a straight line basis from the time of acquisition over its useful economic life. (b) depreciation depreciation is provided on tangible ﬁxed assets on a straight line basis from the time they are available for use, so as to write off their costs over their estimated useful lives taking into account any expected residual values. provisions are made speciﬁcally against debtors where there is evidence of a dispute or an inability to pay. the items in the calculation of earnings

capabilities to strengthen bt globally. new wave revenues grew by 32% to £4.5 billion, and now represent nearly a quarter of our business. these used to be separate offerings, often supplied by different companies, but we’re bringing them together in one place. ultimately, our customers shouldn’t have to worry about fixed or mobile when what they really want is freedom and flexibility. a few years ago, our position in this market was aspirational; today, we are competing with the best – and winning. but now that we’ve delivered those five million connections more than a year ahead of schedule, no one seems very surprised. a few years ago, only the experts had any clear idea what broadband was all about. for many people, broadband initially meant fast, always-on internet access and email – an end to the worldwide wait. but as the demand for increasingly sophisticated broadband services grows, so must technology’s ability to cope with it. broadband which gives users access to exciting content as well as a range of other benefits, including multiple email addresses, protection against junk email, parental controls to prevent children accessing unsuitable content and protection against computer viruses. in recent years, our networking skills have enabled us to establish bt as one of the world’s foremost global networked it services companies. and if anyone wanted proof that bt really is transforming itself for growth, they would only have to look at some of the recent contracts we’ve won. major contracts our most high-profile success of the year came in march 2005 when it was announced that bt will become reuters’ supplier of network services around the world, under a contract expected to be worth up to £1.5 billion over its eight and a half-year life. building global presence our customers for networked it services are increasingly operating globally and it’s vital that we should be able to meet their requirements around the world – not just in europe where we own operations in many countries, but elsewhere as well. strategic partners can help us reach parts of the world where we don’t operate and it’s certainly possible to deliver a truly global service from any one location to any other, without owning everything in between. bt was the official communications sponsor for dame ellen macarthur’s epic non-stop round the world victory 10

helpful, inspiring, straightforward, heart – continue to define the way we do business around here. in early april 2005, we provided our five millionth broadband connection, more than one year ahead of target. this mainly reflects the cost of supporting networked it services contracts and investment in new wave activities. the main areas of change relate to pensions, share-based payments, intangible assets, leases and financial instruments. however, due to the inherent volatilities introduced by ifrs, no such statement can be made in respect of future years. current assets principally,
