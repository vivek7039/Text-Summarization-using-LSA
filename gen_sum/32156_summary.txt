Our assets under management now stand at £1.3 billion, £1.1 billion at NewRiver’s share, with our EPRA net asset value per share down marginally by 3 pence to 292 pence reflecting the absorption of acquisition costs and Main Market move costs as well as a small 0.6% reduction in portfolio valuation. Importantly, this reduction came in the first half of our financial year, when real estate values were David Lockhart Chief Executive Officer Mark Davies Chief Financial Officer Nick Sewell Executive Committee member Allan Lockhart Property Director 14 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 impacted by Brexit fears, and our valuations showed improvement in the second half. We are on site for the construction of a further three c‑stores totalling 11,000 sq ft and we have consent to construct a further 15 totalling 53,400 sq ft. Our L TV was 37% at 31 March 2017, up from 27% at March 2016 predominantly due to the acquisition of our assets in Bexleyheath which completed in April 2016. NewRiver is highly capable of enhancing shareholder value through its very active asset management programme and our strict adherence to risk‑controlled development practices. 19 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT Strategic priority 1 Disciplined stock selection 2 Active asset management 3 Risk-controlled development 4 Profitable capital recycling 5 Maximise benefits of scale/ Conservative balance sheet Strategic objective T o grow the business through selective acquisitions where we can add value and grow income streams T o implement active asset management initiatives across our portfolio to enhance and protect our income streams T o create income and capital value from within our existing portfolio (e.g. airspace above our assets) through new developments and redevelopments T o generate cash profits for our shareholders and prove our valuations through recycling mature assets and opportunistic disposals T o focus on driving efficiencies in our financing and operating costs to maximise cash returns to shareholders, while maintaining a conservative balance sheet Progress in FY17 • £158 million of strategic acquisitions at an average equivalent yield of 7.2% • Largest single acquisition to date of £120 million of Broadway Shopping Centre and Broadway Square Retail Park in Bexleyheath • Acquisition of retail warehouse in Sheffield for £18 million from open‑ended property fund • Retail occupancy increased to 97% from 96% in March 2016 • 355 leasing events completed, increased from 235 in FY16 • Long term leasing events completed 3.9% ahead of ERV • Like‑for‑like net rental income increased by 1.2% through active asset management • 77,100 sq ft of development projects completed, including eight convenience stores for the Co‑op • Planning secured on 62,000 Canvey Island development, and over 50% pre‑let in the year • Planning submitted on 236,000 sq ft mixed‑use development in Cowley, Oxford • Pre‑lets secured on Burgess Hill, meaning now 49% pre‑let • Sold £10.7 million of assets on terms 7% ahead of valuation and almost 30% ahead of total cost • Includes £4.1 million of pub disposals at 10% ahead of valuation • Includes first convenience store disposal for £1.0 million, at an initial yield of 4.85% • Cost of debt reduced to 3.5% from 3.7% in March 2016 • Interest cover improved to 4.5x from 4.3x in FY16 • Rothschild & Co appointed as independent debt advisor in February 2017 to assist Management in completing a balance sheet refinancing exercise • Admin cost ratio reduced to 15.1% from 18.5% Priorities in FY18 • Remain active in the investment market and continue to target high yielding assets with low risk characteristics • Progress asset management and risk‑controlled development initiatives at Bexleyheath • Progress repositioning of retail warehouse in Sheffield • Complete ongoing active asset management initiatives at the Abbey Centre, Newtownabbey and Coalville Retail Park • Achieve business rates savings identified in FY17 • Sustain high level of retail occupancy • Maintain affordable rents for occupiers to ensure sustainability of cash income • Deliver our 15 th c‑store to the Co‑operative to trigger £750k incentive payment • Commence on‑site at our 62,000 sq ft Canvey Island retail park development • Commence on‑site at our 465,000 sq ft mixed use development in Burgess Hill • Secure planning consent at our 236,000 sq ft mixed‑use regeneration in Cowley, Oxford • Continue to recycle assets that no longer meet our return criteria • Continue to make opportunistic disposals to special purchasers • Complete refinancing exercise, including moving from secured to unsecured debt with an improved maturity and potentially a cost benefit • Maintain admin cost ratio below 16% over medium term KPIs • T otal property return • FFO • Annualised rent roll • T otal accounting return • T otal property return • Annualised rent roll • Leasing events • Retail occupancy • T otal accounting return • T otal property return • Annualised rent roll • Leasing events • T otal accounting return • FFO • T otal accounting return • FFO • LTV • Interest cover • Admin cost ratio OUR STRATEGY Our aim is to create secure, sustainable and growing cash returns At the core of our strategy and ethos is delivering superior returns to our shareholders.

This affordability will be further supported by the 2017 business rates revaluation, with draft rateable values showing that across our retail portfolio in England, Scotland and Wales rateable values will fall by over 19% on average, with over 90% of our occupiers benefitting from this saving. Footfall was particularly strong at assets where we have recently completed active asset management or risk‑controlled development initiatives. That email achieved a 28% open‑rate, being opened by over 5,000 customers who are now aware they can click and collect at our centres. Further to these transfers, in December 2016 we secured contracted income on 22 pubs by surrendering the leaseback arrangement 13 months early and agreeing new 15 year RPI linked leases with Marston’s

In December 2016 we secured contracted income on 22 pubs by surrendering the leaseback arrangement early and agreeing new 15 year RPI linked leases with Marston’s PLC. The measures used in this review are all APMs presented on a proportionally consolidated basis unless otherwise stated. This included our largest acquisition to date in Bexleyheath where we purchased a retail park and shopping centre for £120.3 million. This acquisition was part funded by a new £49 million facility with DekaBank, at an all in cost of 2.2%. In July 2016 we signed an improved £85.3 million debt facility with AIG on our pub and convenience store portfolio. Retailer diversification is high, with no one retailer making up more than 2.6% of total rental income 2 4 Failure in performance by individual assets against their business plans This is an amber risk, with high impact but low likelihood Business plans for each asset are regularly reviewed by their asset manager and updated twice yearly. Customer satisfaction We have made excellent progress on these targets in Y ear 1, with almost all criteria met. Solar PV opportunities In order to deliver economies of scale, additional value measures will be procured and/or implemented across multiple assets where appropriate. Legislation & Risk Mitigation Cushman & Wakefield have been working with NewRiver on a number of legislative risks including the Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards which comes into force in 2018 and requires Energy Performance Certificates to be carried out for a number of NewRiver’s portfolio units. Co‑operative Power and Cushman’s have collated data for Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting, which is reported on the next page. Age Concern: The Ridings Shopping Centre, Wakefield Why it matters: Most people will feel lonely at some point in their lives. The impact it made: Over 120 people aged 55+ attended, one of whom had not been out socially for three years. Paul joined Merrill Lynch in 1995 when it acquired Smith New Court Plc a leading market making and brokerage firm on the London Stock Exchange where he was Chief Executive Officer. Areas for improvement, as shown on page 70, have been noted and will be addressed in the coming year. Each of the Directors has committed to attend all scheduled Board and Committee meetings an d would not do so only in exceptional circumstances. Similarly, they would make every effort to attend ad hoc meetings either in person or by telephone when convened. They selected Prism Boardroom wh ich had not undertaken any work for the Company before and was therefore deemed independent. Actions taken by the Board as a result of this review will be reported in next year’s report. 50% is subject to a Total Accounting Return performance condition measured against UK REITs that report their NAV on an EPRA basis. This necessitated new service contracts having to be drafted for the Executive Directors which complied with UK laws and listing regulations. I would like to thank my fellow Committee members for their hard work and support during this busy year. Shareholder consultation The Committee’s policy is to consult with major Shareholders in respect of significant decisions on executive remuneration and has done so regularly. However, it is the Company’s current intention not to make any further awards under this type of plan. Three scenarios have been illustrated for each Executive Director: The illustrations do not take into account share price appreciation or dividends.

Certain awards granted to FEDs have different terms, and these are set out in the table opposite. Each award is subject to two performance conditions which will be tested over a three year period. Long-term Incentives – Performance Share Plan Performance Share Plan awards granted to Executive Directors in the financial year ende d 31 March 2018 will be over shares wort h 100% of salary and will be consistent with the long-term incentives policy detailed on page 85. The Commi ttee has therefore satisfied itself that all advice provided by h2glenfern was objec tive and independent. We benchmarked these assumptions to relevant external industry data and comparable property transactions, in particular the yield. This was determined to represent an asset acquisition and therefore accounted for in accordance with the requirements of IAS 40 Investment property. In particular, we challenged management to demonstrate that the two corporate vehicl es acquired did not constitute a business. Our audit work was executed at levels of Group or EPRA earnings materiality applicable to each account balance. Other joint ventures of the Group ar e audited by PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP and also have 31 December 2016 year ends. Share capital Shares are classified as equity when there is no obligation to transfer cash or other assets. Sources of estimation uncertainty As noted above, the Group’s investment properties are stated at fair value. Certain estimates require an assessment of factors not within management’s control, such as overall market conditions. These financial instruments are classified as Level 2 fair value measur ements, being those derived from inputs other than quoted prices. These do not prevent access to or use of this funding within the borrowing entities, however they do place certain restrictions on moving th ose funds around the wider group, typically requiring debt servicing costs to be paid before restrictions are lifted.
