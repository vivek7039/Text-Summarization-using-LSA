delivering growing cash profits our executive committee chief executive’s strategic review “ our convenience‑led, community‑focused retail & leisure portfolio has proved well‑positioned in what has been an uncertain twelve months at the macro economic and political levels.” this has been another outstanding year for newriver, which is reflected in a strong set of full year results. our assets under management now stand at £1.3 billion, £1.1 billion at newriver’s share, with our epra net asset value per share down marginally by 3 pence to 292 pence reflecting the absorption of acquisition costs and main market move costs as well as a small 0.6% reduction in portfolio valuation. importantly, this reduction came in the first half of our financial year, when real estate values were david lockhart chief executive officer mark davies chief financial officer nick sewell executive committee member allan lockhart property director 14 newriver reit plc annual report and accounts 2017 impacted by brexit fears, and our valuations showed improvement in the second half. we have made good progress on our 1.9 million sq ft risk‑controlled development pipeline during the year. we are on site for the construction of a further three c‑stores totalling 11,000 sq ft and we have consent to construct a further 15 totalling 53,400 sq ft. our l tv was 37% at 31 march 2017, up from 27% at march 2016 predominantly due to the acquisition of our assets in bexleyheath which completed in april 2016. our interest cover remained robust at 4.5x and our weighted average cost of debt was 3.5%, down from 3.7% in march 2016. we completed our move from aim to a premium listing on the main market in august 2016 marking a significant milestone for newriver and we continued this impressive momentum into december, when we qualified for admission into the ftse 250, ftse all‑share and epra indices at the first attempt. newriver is highly capable of enhancing shareholder value through its very active asset management programme and our strict adherence to risk‑controlled development practices. 19 newriver reit plc annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report strategic priority 1

lease renewals with peacocks/edinburgh woollen mill across 54,400 sq ft, securing a 13.4% increase in passing rent to £634,000. this affordability will be further supported by the 2017 business rates revaluation, with draft rateable values showing that across our retail portfolio in england, scotland and wales rateable values will fall by over 19% on average, with over 90% of our occupiers benefitting from this saving. footfall was particularly strong at assets where we have recently completed active asset management or risk‑controlled development initiatives. in summary, from 2015 we
