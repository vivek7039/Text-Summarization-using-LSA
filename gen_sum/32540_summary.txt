htg is focused on delivering performance-critical solutions for the most demanding requirements to meet current and future global energy needs. markets we serve power generation: oil & gas: water & industrial: defence: fossil upstream water submarine fleet nuclear downstream industrial renewables (including solar/ hydro/ tidal/ wind) chemical hayward tyler with a pedigree stretching back over 200 years hayward tyler is a market leader in the design, manufacture and servicing of performance-critical motors and pumps for the harshest of environments. supporting critical infrastructure from conceptual design to end of operation with highly engineered solutions and full through life support. it is estimated that over one billion people currently do not have access to electricity, mainly in africa, india and other parts of developing asia. source: bp energy outlook 2017 edition, january 2017 power generation – centralised – fossil fuels gas is expected to be the fastest growing fuel (1.6% p.a. power generation – centralised – nuclear eia's international energy outlook projects that total global nuclear generation will increase by 73% through 2040, from 2.6 trillion kilowatt-hours in 2015 to 4.5 trillion kilowatt-hours in 2040. countries that are not a part of the organisation for economic co-operation and development source: us energy information association, international energy outlook 2016, may 2016 hayward tyler group plc financial statements for the year ended 31 march 2017 11 (non-oecd countries) account for 86% of this increase, with china alone making up more than 54% of total growth. hayward tyler’s canned motor technology provides nuclear plants with a robust product for increased life cycle and reduced maintenance costs. the 22.6mw extraction back-pressure steam turbine generator was designed, manufactured and tested in accordance with american petroleum institute (api) 612 standards. since then the submarine programme has provided both original equipment opportunities and secure aftermarket business, which is critical to maintaining casd. this external driven growth is dependent inter alia on positive market conditions which we anticipate will improve during the current year. as an example, in the floating vessels market peter brotherhood has more steam turbine gensets on fpsos than all of its competition combined. the key performance indicators (kpis) set out below help determine how successful we have been in strengthening our business, increasing profitability and generating a positive return to shareholders. it has an excellent market profile (quality, reliability and customer relationships), which results in inclusion on sector bid/quote opportunities. csr is managed by our business units and it forms an integral part of their day- to-day operations. kyle blackwell, june 2017 shak choudhury first came across hayward tyler in 2015 at brunel university’s engineering showcase where he was presenting his third year thesis. shak enrolled onto the imeche mpds programme, which is a mentor-based plan aimed at helping engineers attain chartered status. set out below is a summary of how, at 31 march 2017, the group was dealing with corporate governance issues. there have been no changes from prior periods in the measurement methods used to determine reported segment profit or loss. with the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. gains and losses resulting from remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability are included in other comprehensive income. all goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. (a) original equipment manufacture the group provides pumps, motors, turbo gen-sets, compressors and steam turbines specifically customised to each customer. after initial recognition these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. the new standard establishes a control-based revenue recognition model and provides additional guidance in many areas not covered in detail under existing ifrss, including how to account for arrangements with multiple performance obligations, variable pricing, customer refund rights, supplier repurchase options and other common complexities. estimation uncertainties exist particularly with regard to medical cost trends, which may vary significantly in future appraisals of the group's defined benefit pension obligations. nicholas flanagan and ewan lloyd-baker have subscribed to the hayward tyler group plc £10 million secured loan note programme.
