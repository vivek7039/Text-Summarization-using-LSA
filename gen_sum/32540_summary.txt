HTG is focused on delivering performance-critical solutions for the most demanding requirements to meet current and future global energy needs. Each of these businesses has an enviable reputation and strong brand within their chosen market niches. Markets we serve Power Generation: Oil & Gas: Water & Industrial: Defence: Fossil Upstream Water Submarine Fleet Nuclear Downstream Industrial Renewables (including Solar/ Hydro/ Tidal/ Wind) Chemical Hayward Tyler With a pedigree stretching back over 200 years Hayward Tyler is a market leader in the design, manufacture and servicing of performance-critical motors and pumps for the harshest of environments. Supporting critical infrastructure from conceptual design to end of operation with highly engineered solutions and full through life support. It also reflects a strong catch-up process, with energy consumption per head in developing economies expected to increase rapidly towards OECD levels as prosperity rises. It is estimated that over one billion people currently do not have access to electricity, mainly in Africa, India and other parts of developing Asia. Source: BP Energy Outlook 2017 Edition, January 2017 Power Generation – Centralised – Fossil Fuels Gas is expected to be the fastest growing fuel (1.6% p.a. ), with its share in primary energy increasing as it overtakes coal to be the second-largest fuel source by 2035. Power Generation – Centralised – Renewables (Hydro) Hydropower generates the largest share of electricity from renewable energy sources. Hayward Tyler is currently working in partnership with several universities and private developers to position itself as an industry leader in this growing technology space and its recent announcement on the C-Gen Neptune generator project is testament to this. China's growing nuclear fleet is expected to produce more than 1.2 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually by 2040. Hayward Tyler continues to enjoy a stable position in the nuclear supply chain servicing its existing installed base as well as taking orders for new units, both of which result from the key accreditations of our US and UK businesses. Hayward Tyler’s canned motor technology provides nuclear plants with a robust product for increased life cycle and reduced maintenance costs. CHP is an efficient means of producing electric power and useful thermal energy from a single fuel source. It uses less fuel than the alternative methods of separately generating heat by conventional boilers and power stations. Whilst short-term demand for this product group remains fairly flat, ten units were secured in conjunction with our strategic partner, Eureka Pumps AS, and with an installed base of more than 250 high-power motors offshore there are additional aftermarket opportunities across key markets. Hayward Tyler is well placed to capitalise on this trend as it is one of only a handful of motor suppliers worldwide that have the required wet wound motor expertise, global standards capability, existing approvals and operational reference list. The 22.6MW extraction back-pressure steam turbine generator was designed, manufactured and tested in accordance with American Petroleum Institute (API) 612 standards.

Hayward Tyler’s reputation and experience has positioned the business as a key supplier for these applications. Since then the submarine programme has provided both original equipment opportunities and secure aftermarket business, which is critical to maintaining CASD. This external driven growth is dependent inter alia on positive market conditions which we anticipate will improve during the current year. Introduction When I wrote in last year’s review that “provided recent economic and political uncertainty does not affect general industrial activity, the outlook for HTG is positive” I perhaps did not appreciate how prescient that comment might be. As an example, in the floating vessels market Peter Brotherhood has more steam turbine gensets on FPSOs than all of its competition combined. These shared values go to the heart of what unites us as an ever expanding Group. The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) set out below help determine how successful we have been in strengthening our business, increasing profitability and generating a positive return to shareholders. Revenue from other markets that include chemical, defence, industrial and renewables was more or less level at 16% (FY2016: 17%). It has an excellent market profile (quality, reliability and customer relationships), which results in inclusion on sector bid/quote opportunities. Recruitment and retention of employees remains a key focus for the Group to ensure its continued success. Where stage payments cannot be achieved by the Group it may be possible to augment borrowing and bonding lines through use of the short-term funding schemes provided by UK Export Finance with whom the Group has a close relationship;  a Group-wide initiative to reduce stock;  increased manufacturing velocity through workflow re-engineering to reduce working capital requirements per unit of revenue;  through active management of accounts receivable and accounts payable; and  linking employee remuneration to the control of cash and working capital.

CSR is managed by our business units and it forms an integral part of their day- to-day operations. We continue to work in partnership with local Schools, Colleges and Universities developing constructive working relationships. That step has resulted in 60% less crane-usage and the elimination of forklift trucks thereby reducing risks significantly. From 2015 no waste has been sent to landfill, rather it is being recycled, reused or sent for energy regeneration;  Combining the values of responsibility for the environment and society, employees of Hayward Tyler Colchester volunteered to organise a local ‘green-up’ day. As part of this day, over 20 employees have cleaned-up four miles of local roads as an annual spring event;  Hayward Tyler East Kilbride holds both ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certification, which have contributed to a significant reduction in the business unit’s impact on the environment from projects such as reducing landfill waste, improving energy efficiency on site and manufacturing without using hazardous, toxic or scarce materials. Ross’s further celebrated as he was promoted to General Manager Operations of Hayward Tyler Luton. Kyle Blackwell, June 2017 Shak Choudhury first came across Hayward Tyler in 2015 at Brunel University’s Engineering Showcase where he was presenting his third year thesis. Shak enrolled onto the IMECHE MPDS programme, which is a mentor-based plan aimed at helping engineers attain chartered status. In addition, Shak has recently started his Masters at Cranfield University, which Hayward Tyler are sponsoring. Set out below is a summary of how, at 31 March 2017, the Group was dealing with corporate governance issues. Grant Thornton were first appointed as external auditor to the original Group headed by Southbank UK PLC in 2006. These options vest three years from the date of grant and are subject to continued service. The Company’s registered office is Peregrine Corporate Services Limited, Burleigh Manor, Peel Road, Douglas, Isle of Man, IM1 5EP. These consolidated financial statements have been approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 19 July 2017. Given the announced proposed transaction with Avingtrans plc we do not intend to propose a year-end dividend. Trading represents the underlying performance of Hayward Tyler and Peter Brotherhood together with head office costs. There have been no changes from prior periods in the measurement methods used to determine reported segment profit or loss. 2.8 Property, plant and equipment Land held for use in production or administration is stated at historical cost. As land is considered to have an unlimited useful life, related carrying amounts are not depreciated. Hayward Tyler Group PLC Financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 74 Depreciation methods and useful lives for assets held under finance lease agreements correspond to those applied to comparable assets which are legally owned by the Group. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. 2.16 Equity, reserves and dividend payments Share capital represents the nominal value of shares that have been issued. Gains and losses resulting from remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability are included in other comprehensive income. All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. Any adjustment to cumulative share-based compensation resulting from a revision is recognised in the current period. 2.19 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets Provisions are recognised when present obligations as a result of a past event will probably lead to an outflow of economic resources from the Group and amounts can be estimated reliably. (a) Original equipment manufacture The Group provides pumps, motors, turbo gen-sets, compressors and steam turbines specifically customised to each customer. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable in relation to that activity. After initial recognition these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. The impairment loss is then based on recent historical counterparty default rates for each identified group. This grant income is included in operating charges as a deduction from related research, development and training expenses. The new standard establishes a control-based revenue recognition model and provides additional guidance in many areas not covered in detail under existing IFRSs, including how to account for arrangements with multiple performance obligations, variable pricing, customer refund rights, supplier repurchase options and other common complexities. Estimation uncertainties exist particularly with regard to medical cost trends, which may vary significantly in future appraisals of the Group's defined benefit pension obligations.

These changes are considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of recent volatility in the currency markets.
