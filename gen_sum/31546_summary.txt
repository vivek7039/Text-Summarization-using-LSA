retailing requires specialist logistics knowledge and skills. the uk’s fast moving consumer goods market (fmcg), is relatively mature with forecast growth at less than 1% per annum to 2020 9 . we also operate in joint venture arrangements at three sites relating to inspection and preparation of finished vehicles. we are seeing significant growth with customers in the used and ex-hire/ lease car sectors, where additional value- added services generate further revenue. general cargo we provide long-distance full truck load (ftl) transport for a number of major international customers across europe, including the united kingdom, benelux, germany, czech republic, italy, spain and switzerland. we maximise fleet utilisation by carrying loads for multiple customers in one vehicle and manage movements using state-of-the-art technology to minimise empty miles. this allows for greater flexibility and profitability, which can be passed on to customers in the form of lower charges. our transport model is typically pay-as-you-go, with jobs priced on agreed times for loading, travelling, unloading and travel to the next pick up point, with fuel costs being a simple flow through as prices increase and decrease. under this model, vehicles typically return empty to depots and wait for their next load. this capacity is delivered through a range of transactions, new leases, pre-lets with developers and re-gearing existing sites. the group’s leasehold properties are held on institutional lease terms at or below market rents. even with these sites coming online the group is currently operating at close to full capacity. we invested in mib specialist equipment and skilled employees to deliver a number of new contract wins. 09 eddie stobart logistics plc annual report and

customers across the supply chain. furthermore, we have integrated our under- performing ports business into the wider transport network in order to improve utilisation and profitability. this has resulted in our customers looking for more than the traditional support from their logistics providers. our training academy has been recognised as a leading facility by customers, suppliers and industry advocates. 2 underlying ebit is defined as profit from operating activities before exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangibles, group’s share of profit from equity accounted

operations facilities and enhanced rail connectivity. our training ranges from one day to 11 weeks with no more than nine trainees per group. employee engagement we openly encourage alignment with our business goals through open communication and appraisals. in addition to this, we also hold a national annual meeting where all eddie stobart driver and warehouse representatives come together. it’s

their full commitment. we were extremely proud to be awarded our silver status in 2017 for: • demonstrating support for service personnel issues and employing members of the armed forces community • actively communicating a positive stance to our employees through our hr policies and procedures • showing flexibility towards annual training and mobilisation commitments of reservist employees employer recognition scheme silver award 2017 proudly supporting those who serve. as one of the country’s most high profile brands playing a key supporting role for uk plc, we’re extremely proud of our northern roots and honoured to be supporting diverse business growth right across the north. we have worked hard to redefine standards in logistics and lay foundations for tomorrow’s supply chain needs through our training programme. operating environment risk customer demand for outsourced logistics and warehousing services may change, reflecting the changing behaviours of consumers. there may be changes in the availability of high quality warehouse capacity and other property opportunities to support business growth. people risk loss of one or more key members of the senior management team or failure to retain and attract experienced and skilled people at all levels across the business could also have an adverse impact. we take pride in creating a positive workplace environment, through training, engagement, rewards and values. this risk is also mitigated by our strategy of building a balanced portfolio across the sectors we operate in. lack of available cash could result in the company being unable to meet its financial obligations. we also have a comprehensive suite of health and safety procedures that all new joiners must confirm they will adhere to. there are well-established accident reporting procedures and reviews are undertaken after all significant incidents to ensure our policies have been followed and that we enhance our standards where we can to reduce the risk of future accidents occurring. in addition, alex also managed t esco’s uk logistics, with over 50,000 store deliveries per week and a £1.6 billion annual cost base. the audit committee also has responsibility for oversight of our internal controls and risk management framework. internal audits will be undertaken on a co-sourced basis with the hsqe team where appropriate. internal controls the group’s risk management systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. executive directors have been granted awards under the management incentive plan (“mip”) with a target linked to shareholder value and other members of senior management have been granted awards under the long term incentive plan (“ltip”) with targets linked to total shareholder return and achievements of an ebitda target. t otal interest in shares

using input from a third party valuation expert, based on discounted cash flow forecasts, which require judgment by the directors around key assumptions such as revenue growth, discount rates and long term growth rates. • substantive testing: we substantively tested the expenses allocated to consolidated income statement and to the share premium reserve, obtaining supporting evidence for each item selected and determining whether their treatment as share issue or transaction cost was appropriate. based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the other information.

accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all years in these consolidated financial statements, and have been applied consistently by group entities unless otherwise stated. subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. the group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire. such financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. subsequent to initial recognition, these financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. the fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. assets-under-construction amounts related to development projects are presented as a separate asset within property, plant and equipment. subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against ‘administration expenses’ in the income statement. variable consideration can arise as a result of incentives, performance bonuses, penalties or other similar items. however, once these judgements have been made, no change to the lease classification is expected. provisions for impairment of receivables are established when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due. analysis of operating segments road transport £’000 contract logistics and warehousing £’000 eu transport £’000 other divisions
