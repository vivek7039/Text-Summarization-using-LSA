statements other information chairman’s review focusing innovation on patients and customers in 2017, shire started its first full financial year as a transformed company: the undisputed global leader in treating rare diseases. in many countries we had to consolidate two offices into one, moving and reassigning experienced staff, while maintaining commercial momentum. and we set aggressive targets for our teams, pushing ourselves to meet the highest possible financial goals, some of which were clearly aspirational. in 2017, shire developed our new responsibility strategy with commitments and long-term goals to be achieved by 2025. we also held our third annual global day of service, during which more than 7,300 shire employees from around the world dedicated more than 29,000 hours of their time to volunteering in their communities. a detailed description of shire’s commitment to responsibility can be found on page 35. the accomplishments — focused squarely on delivering benefits to patients in need and the communities in which we live — came during a year of substantial external regulatory and macroeconomic challenge. these challenges will continue in 2018, making it essential that shire maintains its efficient and nimble business strategy. this will enable sharper management focus, greater strategic clarity, and distinct investment opportunities for both parts of the business. but it was also a year in which they all showed their grit, resolve, and unwavering dedication to the patients we serve. it is our privilege to continue working on behalf of the patients who inspire us every day. with approximately 70 percent of revenues coming from rare disease products, and the most robust pipeline in shire’s history — 60 percent of which are biologic therapies — we continue to make significant progress in the company’s evolution. 6 shire annual report 2017 symptoms of dry eye disease (ded), reached more than one million prescriptions written since launch in late 2016. i am greatly appreciative of what our talented and focused team has delivered, in many cases, exceeding our performance expectations in 2017. two distinct market-leading businesses since i arrived at shire five years ago, we have grown from an adhd-focused company to a global biotech with two distinct market-leading businesses — rare disease and neuroscience. shire has an excellent record of accessing external innovation and delivering late-stage products to market. at the same time, we continue to complement our r&d innovation with new advances in health information technologies and precision medicine. among the benefits of these changes, we anticipate savings of $100 million annually beginning in 2019 and $300 million annually by 2023. additionally, we are modernizing the manufacturing network with new facilities in georgia (u.s.) and dublin (ireland). additional details about our pipeline can be found on page 24. new product launches fueled growth as we advanced programs through the pipeline, we also developed a team that excels at product launches and ensures patients have access to these important therapies. we expect to deliver mid-single digit product sales growth in 2018 after absorbing the anticipated impact of generics. based on current assumptions, we also expect margins to be impacted by the start-up of our new u.s. plasma manufacturing site, intensifying genericization, and lower royalties. for example, advanced analytical techniques are being applied to extract new insights from genetic and clinical data. please see pages 30 and 31 for information on shire’s efforts as they relate to advances in health technologies. evolving customer landscape globally, health systems continue to evolve toward increasingly sophisticated and frequently more centralized models for providing high-quality, coordinated care. this potentially impacts a range of business factors including talent acquisition, regulatory frameworks, and supply chain considerations. products can have a particularly high impact on the lives of patients when they not only demonstrate improvements in safety and efficacy, but also in measures such as quality of life, including the ability to maintain independence. through strategic investments in our portfolio and global capabilities, including the acquisition of baxalta, we have established an unmatched platform to accelerate the development and commercialization of rare disease therapeutics, maximizing our ability to reach patients in need. we have established deep internal expertise in key research areas, including recent investments focusing on immunology and antibody technologies. this has resulted in a robust portfolio anchored by products that are largely either first-in-class or best-in-class. 70% of clinical programs focused on rare diseases 100+ relationships with patient advocacy organizations 7 franchises with market-leading products 50%+ of pipeline

can provide absolute assurance against loss or unfavorable results. in addition, risks not presently known to the company may also adversely affect its business. we operate in numerous countries across the globe, with emergent markets having differing levels of infrastructure and legislative/regulatory frameworks. pharmaceutical industry reform failure to proactively identify and comply with industry laws and pharmaceutical regulatory changes across our value chain (including government mandated pricing), could result in fines, penalties, business disruption, reduced revenue, and/or potential exclusion from government programs. the company has a large portfolio of products in multiple countries across various therapeutic areas. our combined portfolio is subject to review by shire’s quality assurance and control function for inspection readiness. we face intense competition from manufacturers of branded and generic therapies who may challenge our patent protections in certain markets. shire has implemented a safety reporting policy, registration programs, personnel training, and detailed procedures for psps. we have also incorporated our therapies for hae, a rare genetic condition characterized by episodic, potentially life-threatening swelling attacks, into the immunology franchise in order to benefit from the significant overlap in treating physicians and researchers. • immunoglobulin sales growth in 2017 was driven by strong performance of gammagard liquid (our flagship ig brand) and also by our recently launched subcutaneous ig products — hyqvia and

have occurred this year and accordingly they are not key audit matters in 2017. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. we identified a risk that forecasted cash flows associated with the asset may result in an unrecorded impairment. these changes in 2017 follow previous years of significant change including major acquisitions and the one shire program. * these items represent non gaap financial measures a reconciliation of which to the most directly comparable measure under u.s. gaap is provided on pages 179 to 183. we agreed that we would report to the acr committee all audit differences in excess of $12.5 million (2016: $7.5 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. we also considered qualitative factors that would impact the level of risk in certain components. the company’s principal revenue streams and their respective accounting treatments are discussed below: product sales revenues from product sales are recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, which is typically upon delivery. if actual results vary, management adjusts these estimates, which have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment. most of these costs are reflected as a reduction of gross sales; however, to the extent benefit from services can be separately identified and the fair value determined, costs are classified in selling, general and administrative expense. • managed care rebates are payments to third parties, primarily pharmacy benefit managers and other health insurance providers. the reserve for these rebates is based on an estimate of customer buying patterns and applicable contractual rebate rates to be earned over each period. reserve estimates are based on customer buying patterns and applicable contractual rebate rates to be earned over each period. acquired ipr&d represents the fair value assigned to research and development assets that have not reached technological feasibility. if and when development is complete, which generally occurs when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the associated assets would be deemed finite-lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives at that point in time. the company provides reserves against accounts receivable for estimated losses, if any, that may result from a customer’s inability to pay. the company monitors these investments to evaluate whether any decline in their value has occurred that would be other-than-temporary, based on the implied value of recent company financings, public market prices of comparable companies, and general market conditions. capitalization of inventory costs the company capitalizes inventory costs associated with its products prior to regulatory approval, when, based on management’s judgment, future commercialization is considered highly probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. 131 shire annual report 2017

the company initially measures a long-lived asset or disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. deferred tax assets are

recorded intangible assets primarily related to commercially marketed products and ipr&d projects. if such circumstances occur, the company’s future operating results could be materially adversely impacted. any outcome upon settlement that differs from the recorded provision for uncertain tax positions may result in a materially higher or lower tax expense in future periods, which could significantly impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition. contingent consideration payable represents future milestones and royalties the company may be required to pay in conjunction with various business combinations. under the terms of the merger agreement, former dyax shareholders may receive additional value through a non-tradable contingent value right worth $4.00 per share, payable upon u.s. food and drug administration (fda) approval of shp643 (formerly dx-2930) in hereditary angioedema (hae). multiple product candidates with other pharmaceutical companies are in various stages of clinical development for which the company is eligible to receive future royalties and/or milestone payments. shp659 is a phase 2 investigational epithelial sodium channel inhibitor for the potential treatment of dry eye disease in adults. parion will be entitled to receive additional potential milestone payments based on clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones and parion has the option to co-fund through additional stages of development in exchange for enhanced tiered low double-digit royalties. together, shire and precision will develop chimeric antigen receptor (car) t cell therapies for up to six unique targets. other restructuring charges recorded, which were not significant, during the year ended december 31, 2017 relate to professional and consulting fees. during 2017, the company determined it would divest certain facilities as part of its integration efforts. the estimated future amortization of acquired intangible assets for the next five years is expected to be as follows: anticipated future amortization $’m 2018 1,891.6 2019 1,668.4 2020 1,570.3 2021 1,536.7 2022 1,511.0 15. fair value measurement assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, the following financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (level 1); significant other observable inputs (level 2); and significant unobservable inputs (level 3). the carrying amounts of other financial assets and liabilities approximate their estimated fair value due to their short-term nature, such as liquidity and maturity of these amounts, or because there have been no significant changes since the asset or liability was last re-measured to fair value on a non-recurring basis. to the extent ineffective, hedge transaction gains and losses were reported in other income/ (expense), net. interest on

acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements that speak only as of the date hereof. additional risks not presently known to the company or that it currently deems immaterial may also adversely affect its business. any future changes in such laws, regulations, practices or policies may adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations. the company may encounter difficulty in obtaining or maintaining satisfactory pricing and reimbursement for such products. for many of those components and materials for which a sole supplier is used, the company seeks to address potential supply disruption by, among other things, regularly evaluating such risk and, if appropriate, holding strategic inventory in the case of such potential supply disruptions. if such efforts prove unsuccessful, it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s revenues, financial condition or results of operations. regulatory approvals or interventions associated with changes to manufacturing sites, ingredients or manufacturing processes could lead to significant delays, an increase in operating costs, lost product sales, an interruption of research activities or the delay of new product launches pharmaceutical and device manufacturing sites must be inspected and approved by regulatory agencies such as the fda and similar agencies in other countries. active ingredients, excipients and packaging materials used in the manufacturing process must be obtained from sources approved by regulatory agencies. u.s.-based manufacturers must be registered with the dea and similar regulatory authorities in other countries if they handle controlled substances. as a result, the company’s procurement and production quotas may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand. clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approvals. healthcare companies may also be subject to enforcement actions or prosecution for such improper conduct. the company’s products and product candidates face substantial competition in the product markets in which it operates shire faces substantial competition throughout its business from international and domestic biopharmaceutical companies of all sizes. the company’s sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with customers (including with hospitals, treatment centers and other healthcare providers, distributors, group purchasing organizations and integrated delivery networks) are terminated due to increased competition or otherwise. the introduction of lower-priced generics by the company’s competitors or their successful efforts in aggressively commercializing and marketing their alternative drug products pose significant challenges to maintaining shire’s market share, revenues and sales growth. any such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the company’s revenue, financial condition or results of operations. where possible, the company’s strategy is to register intellectual property rights, such as patents and trademarks. proposed and completed acquisitions, as well as any future acquisitions, each entail various risks, which include but are not limited to: • a proposed acquisition may not be consummated due to the occurrence of an event, change or other circumstances that gives rise to the termination of the applicable agreement; • a governmental, regulatory, board, shareholder or other approval required for a proposed acquisition may not be obtained, or may be obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated, or another condition to the closing of a proposed acquisition may not be satisfied, resulting in delays or ultimate failure of consummating a proposed acquisition; • shareholders may initiate legal action to prevent or delay consummation of a proposed acquisition or to seek judicial reevaluation of a proposed acquisition’s consideration; • a lengthy, uncertain process when pursuing a potential combination could disrupt relationships between shire and a target company’s customers, suppliers and employees, distract shire’s or a target company’s management from operating its business, and could lead to additional and unanticipated costs; • a target company may be unable to retain and hire key personnel and/or maintain its relationships with customers, suppliers and other business partners pending the consummation of the proposed acquisition by shire; • after the consummation of an acquisition, the company may be unable to retain the acquired company’s key personnel, existing customers, suppliers and other business partners or attract new customers; • the businesses of an acquired company may be otherwise disrupted by the acquisition, including increased costs and diversion of its management’s time and resources; • failure to achieve the targeted growth and expected benefits of the acquisition if sales of an acquired company’s products are lower than anticipated, or these products cannot be successfully commercialized or cannot obtain necessary regulatory approvals; • any integration of an acquired company into shire could be complex and time-consuming, and difficulties in effectuating these integrations may lead to the combined companies not being able to realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies or other benefits in the timeframe anticipated, or at all; • failure to successfully obtain regulatory approval of an acquired company’s late stage pipeline assets in a timely manner or at all, or to successfully commercialize such products after regulatory approval has been obtained; • undiscovered or unanticipated risks and liabilities, including legal and compliance related liabilities, may emerge in connection with an acquisition, or may be higher than anticipated; and • even after successfully completing an acquisition and integrating the acquired company’s businesses into shire, the anticipated benefits of the combinations, including expected synergies, may ultimately prove less than anticipated. shire cannot predict whether these types of transfers and arrangements will become more common in the future. as a result, shire’s financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. shire may experience additional volatility as a result
