in many countries we had to consolidate two offices into one, moving and reassigning experienced staff, while maintaining commercial momentum. and we set aggressive targets for our teams, pushing ourselves to meet the highest possible financial goals, some of which were clearly aspirational. in 2017, shire developed our new responsibility strategy with commitments and long-term goals to be achieved by 2025. we also held our third annual global day of service, during which more than 7,300 shire employees from around the world dedicated more than 29,000 hours of their time to volunteering in their communities. but it was also a year in which they all showed their grit, resolve, and unwavering dedication to the patients we serve. at the same time, we continue to complement our r&d innovation with new advances in health information technologies and precision medicine. based on current assumptions, we also expect margins to be impacted by the start-up of our new u.s. plasma manufacturing site, intensifying genericization, and lower royalties. evolving customer landscape globally, health systems continue to evolve toward increasingly sophisticated and frequently more centralized models for providing high-quality, coordinated care. we face intense competition from manufacturers of branded and generic therapies who may challenge our patent protections in certain markets. • immunoglobulin sales growth in 2017 was driven by strong performance of gammagard liquid (our flagship ig brand) and also by our recently launched subcutaneous ig products — hyqvia and cuvitru • hae sales also continued to grow, driven by increased patients on therapy for both cinryze and firazyr, despite a temporary supply chain disruption for cinryze in q3 hematology shire’s in-line hematology portfolio is primarily focused on hemophilia, a rare bleeding disorder that results from reduced activity or lack of clotting factor viii (fviii; hemophilia a) or ix (fix; hemophilia b). • growth in hemophilia and inhibitor therapy products, primarily driven by increased demand for our rfviii products, in particular our recently launched extended half-life product, adynovate neuroscience shire’s in-line neuroscience portfolio is focused on adhd, a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests as a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development. • shp611 metachromatic leukodystrophy • shp607 1 complications of prematurity • shp609 4 hunter it ph 2/3 ◊ shp489 (vyvanse*) — japan n attention

multiple therapeutic areas in a variety of programs developed for patients, caregivers, healthcare providers and the general public. in some extreme circumstances when this is not possible, patients with life-threatening diseases or conditions may seek special access to investigational medicines outside of a clinical trial setting. we have implemented a goal as part of our responsibility strategy to drive safety excellence by eliminating serious injury, impact, or fatality events at all shire facilities. scope 2 emissions from commercial offices are included and approximated based on occupied square footage when primary consumption data was not available. they meet as a group at least three times per year to monitor progress and more frequently in smaller working groups. the company may pay up to approximately 2.7 billion, which excludes royalty related payments, upon achieving clinical, regulatory and commercialization milestones. as a matter of policy, the company does not undertake speculative transactions that would increase its credit, currency or interest rate exposure. as the company maintains all of its cash, liquid investments and foreign exchange contracts on a short-term basis for liquidity purposes, this risk is not actively managed. the board, however, has agreed that david will remain in service while we continue our search for a new non-executive director, specifically with scientific and/or medical experience. with the exception of dominic blakemore, william burns, and anne minto, all directors are seeking election or re- election at the annual general meeting to be held on april 24, 2018. at this meeting, non-executive director terms of appointment and executive director service contracts will be made available for inspection by

reserves against accounts receivable for estimated losses, if any, that may result from a customer’s inability to pay. the company has identified two primary revenue streams from contracts with customers as part of its assessment: 1) product sales and 2) licensing arrangements. contingent consideration payable represents future milestones and royalties the company may be required to pay in conjunction with various business combinations. multiple product candidates with other pharmaceutical companies are in various stages of clinical development for which the company is eligible to receive future royalties and/or milestone payments. the carrying amounts of other financial assets and liabilities approximate their estimated fair value due to their short-term nature, such as liquidity and maturity of these amounts, or because there have been no significant changes since the asset or liability was last re-measured to fair value on a non-recurring basis. in march 2012,
