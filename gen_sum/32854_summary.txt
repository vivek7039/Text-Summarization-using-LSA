At the same time, we continue to complement our R&D innovation with new advances in health information technologies and precision medicine. Based on current assumptions, we also expect margins to be impacted by the start-up of our new U.S. plasma manufacturing site, intensifying genericization, and lower royalties. Evolving customer landscape Globally, health systems continue to evolve toward increasingly sophisticated and frequently more centralized models for providing high-quality, coordinated care. We have established deep internal expertise in key research areas, including recent investments focusing on immunology and antibody technologies. Progress in 2017 • Executed on our pipeline of 40 clinical development programs, completing nine Phase 3 studies and securing 126 global product approvals • Received two U.S. FDA Fast Track Designations for SHP607 (U.S.; chronic lung disease in extremely Key performance indicators • Number of programs in clinical development pipeline Read more on page 17 15 Shire Annual Report 2017 Governance Financial statements Other information Strategic report Growth We aim to continuously improve the commercial performance of our marketed products to maximize revenue growth and cash flow.

Based on this data, and pending FDA approval, we are hopeful about the possibility of approaching attack-free efficacy with lanadelumab. Over time MYDAYIS has the potential to become a very meaningful therapeutic option for patients 13 years and older with ADHD. The condition may significantly affect vision-related quality of life, often impacting activities such as reading, using computers, driving and watching television. To deliver on our promise as a rare champion, Shire’s goal is to provide: • Personalized solutions Intelligent, adaptable treatments that help manage and prevent serious conditions, supported by services that support these individuals in using the best therapy for them, and adjusting their approach as needs change. This happens across multiple therapeutic areas in a variety of programs developed for patients, caregivers, healthcare providers and the general public. In some extreme circumstances when this is not possible, patients with life-threatening diseases or conditions may seek special access to investigational medicines outside of a clinical trial setting. We have implemented a goal as part of our Responsibility strategy to drive safety excellence by eliminating serious injury, impact, or fatality events at all Shire facilities. Scope 2 emissions from commercial offices are included and approximated based on occupied square footage when primary consumption data was not available. They meet as a group at least three times per year to monitor progress and more frequently in smaller working groups. The acquisition of NPS Pharma added global rights to an innovative product portfolio with multiple growth catalysts, including GATTEX/REVESTIVE and NATPARA/NATPAR. Genetic Diseases Genetic Diseases product sales, which now excludes HAE product sales, for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to $1,437.7 million, or 4%, from $1,387.1 million in 2016, primarily due to ELAPRASE and REPLAGAL, as both products benefited from an increase in the number of patients on therapy. The Company may pay up to approximately $2.7 billion, which excludes royalty related payments, upon achieving clinical, regulatory and commercialization milestones. As a matter of policy, the Company does not undertake speculative transactions that would increase its credit, currency or interest rate exposure. As the Company maintains all of its cash, liquid investments and foreign exchange contracts on a short-term basis for liquidity purposes, this risk is not actively managed.
