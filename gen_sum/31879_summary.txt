instruments recognition – financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. the fair value of available for sale assets is determined as described in note 3.5. the fair values of other non-derivative financial assets and liabilities are determined based on discounted cash flow analysis using current market rates for similar instruments. other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the ‘effective interest rate’ method. all of the group’s interest rate and cross currency swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. 5.3.3 financial assets and liabilities measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value the following tables provide an analysis of financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: > level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical liabilities; > level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and > level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). the group has concluded that future floating rate borrowing is no longer expected to be highly probable. on realisation, such gains and losses are recognised within finance charges in the income statement. annual report and
