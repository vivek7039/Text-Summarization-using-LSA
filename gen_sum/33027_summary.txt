important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements, certain of which are beyond our control, include, among other things, those factors identified in the principal risks and uncertainties section from page 130 of this annual report. we operate in over 100 countries and our innovative medicines are used by millions of patients worldwide. finally, advances in science and technology promise the continued delivery of new medicines that can make a real difference to patient health. patents on some of the world’s most successful innovative medicines are starting to expire and we face increasing competition from generic alternatives. we were pleased by the fda’s approval in july of brilinta, our treatment for acute coronary syndromes. during 2011, two of the phase iii trials for tc-5214, our neuroscience collaboration with targacept, did not meet their primary endpoint. in december, we also announced that our investigational compound olaparib (azd2281) for the treatment of ovarian cancer will not progress into phase iii. our plans for r&d will see us build further on this collaborative way of working. those who work in them are working more intensively and with less time to research medicines. i look forward to working with them to build on those efforts in 2012. david r brennan chief executive officer overview astrazeneca annual report and form 20-f information 2011 chief executive officer’s review 9 overview life-cycle of a medicine phase i studies studies designed to understand how the potential medicine is absorbed in the body, distributed around it and excreted; also determine an appropriate dosage and identify side effects. regulatory authorities decide whether to grant marketing authorisation based on the medicine’s safety profile, effectiveness and quality. overview astrazeneca annual report and form 20-f information 2011 health innovation 13 > the manchester collaborative centre for inflammation research is being created by the university of manchester, gsk and astrazeneca to establish a world-leading centre for inflammatory diseases. industry returns are under pressure from declining r&d productivity and intensifying pricing pressures, particularly in established markets facing rising healthcare costs. we also face increased competition from generic medicines as some of the world’s most successful drugs come off patent. in addition, greater regulatory constraints are being placed on the pharmaceutical industry by governments and those who pay for our medicines. globally, it is estimated that the number of people over 65 will be almost one billion by 2030, double what it was in 2005. faster-developing economies, such as china, india and brazil, offer new opportunities for the pharmaceutical industry to help an expanding number of patients who can benefit from innovative medicines. this reflects public interest in ensuring access to safe, effective and high quality medicines that are responsibly promoted. in some instances, policies have been implemented without guidelines that define personal, private and proprietary information. for some audiences, there is a perception that pharmaceutical companies place their commercial goals above the interests of patients, physicians and payers. as a consequence, the pricing and reimbursement environments in many markets continue to be highly dynamic. the industry is working with policymakers and regulators during the implementation of healthcare reform with a view to ensuring that they strike a balance between containing costs, while also promoting an environment that fosters medical innovation. a key goal for our planning process is to ensure that we sustain the cycle of successful innovation and, as a result, continue to refresh our portfolio of patented products and so generate value for shareholders. while we are confident that long-term growth in demand for innovative biopharmaceuticals will remain strong, it is clear that substantial improvement in r&d productivity is needed if we are to sustain acceptable returns to shareholders. in r&d, our new payer evidence group is ensuring that, as we develop our medicines, we gather not only the clinical data required for regulatory approval, but also the health economics, cost/benefit information and ‘value-in-use’ data required by payers. this capability helps us to gain global reimbursement, broad market access and optimal pricing for our medicines. financial met or exceeded targets as a result of solid

see page 40 these resources need to be underpinned by: > a well-functioning system of ip rights. in 2011, we continued our core research focus on six therapy areas: cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neuroscience, infection, oncology and respiratory & inflammation. our r&d efforts are supported by nine innovative medicine units (imeds) across small molecule and biologics projects. going forward, our focus will be on identifying key candidate medicines that have the highest potential to deliver technical and commercial success. > a collaboration with manchester university and gsk to establish

focus on research are in sweden (södertälje), canada (montreal, quebec) and france (reims). patent term extensions (pte) are available in certain major markets including the eu and us to compensate for these delays. see the principal risks and uncertainties section from page 130. many of our products are subject to challenges by third parties. details of material challenges by third parties can be found in note 25 to the financial statements from page 184. if a product takes an unusually long time to secure marketing approval or if patent protection has not been secured, expired or lost, then rdp may be the sole ip right protecting a product from copying as generics should not be approved and marketed until rdp has expired. we believe that this should apply only when all other ways of meeting the emergency needs have been considered and where healthcare frameworks and safeguards are in place to ensure that the medicines reach those who need them. for example, we support the concept of differential pricing, provided that appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure that differentially priced products are not diverted from patients who need them to be sold and used in more affluent markets. they also contribute to increased productivity by reducing or preventing the incidence of diseases that keep people away from work. in some cases, where it is appropriate, we are looking at ways of making our medicines more affordable. the programme also provides additional incentives for those patients who adhere to their treatment regimens which helps improve health outcomes and benefit our business. these approaches are part of our overall access to healthcare strategy which can be found in the responsible business section from page 47 . in 2011, we continued to establish more efficient processes, with experts from our global supply chain organisation providing cross-functional support throughout the business. alongside this we ran an internal leadership programme to reinforce the cultural aspects of more efficient supply chain processes. we are actively involved in providing input into new product manufacturing regulations, both at national and international levels, through our membership of industry associations. we also have a programme in place to provide appropriate supply capabilities for our new products. we factor in a wide range of potential risks to global supply, such as disasters that remove supply capability or the unavailability of key raw materials, and work to ensure that these risks are effectively mitigated. in 2011, we terminated our existing outsource relationship for is infrastructure services and transitioned to a new multi-sourced operating model. engaged employees, who are true to our core values, supported by accountable and empowered leaders driving performance, underpin the continued success of our business” lynn tetrault executive vice-president, human resources & corporate affairs 84% employee

astrazeneca annual report and form 20-f information 2011 40 delivering our strategy people we have a global approach, supported by the creation of our global talent and development organisation, to ensure that high standards of l&d practice are applied across the organisation. these capabilities are defined for each level in the organisation and apply to all our employees. under the leadership of a global steering group chaired by our ceo and made up of senior leaders from across the business, we are driving change in three key areas: ‘leadership & management capability’; ‘transparency in talent management & career progression’; and ‘work life challenges’. improving employee engagement we use a variety of global leadership communications channels to engage employees in our business strategy. work-life balance category scores improved by two percentage points this year, and we intend to maintain momentum in this area during 2012. a key element of our people strategy is the continued development of a performance culture across the organisation. this increase has been accompanied by headcount reductions as a result of our continuing strategic drive to improve efficiency and effectiveness. in order to mitigate further job losses, over 750 employees were redeployed where appropriate skills and capabilities allowed. however, each change programme has its unique challenges and a standard solution may not always be appropriate. we always seek to operate at the highest of these various standards, whether this is our code, national legislation or other applicable codes. astrazeneca annual report and form 20-f information 2011 business review delivering our strategy compliance 43 earning trust through integrity we want astrazeneca to be valued as a source of great medicines and trusted as a company that delivers business success responsibly. introduction at astrazeneca, we are dedicated to the research, development, manufacture and marketing of medicines that make a difference in healthcare. individually, everyone has a responsibility to integrate sustainability considerations into their day-to-day decision making, actions and behaviours. the sris also highlighted that they wanted more information on our access to healthcare strategy. while these scores are encouraging, we lost ground in some areas including marketing practices and health outcomes contribution. before a trial begins, we work to make sure that those taking part understand the nature and purpose of the research and that proper procedures for gaining informed consent are followed (including managing any special circumstances, such as different levels of literacy). launched in april 2011, the new policy provides a single common, principle-based approach to all our interactions worldwide. the key principles are that our partnerships: > lead to positive, measurable outcomes in underserved communities > can be scaled up and potentially replicated to improve outcomes for a greater number of people > deliver a sustainable framework that can ultimately be owned and managed locally, without the need for our support. scientists at our dedicated research facility in bangalore, india are focused on finding a new treatment for tb. this means that we have committed to uphold 10 internationally recognised principles in the areas of human rights, labour standards, environmental sustainability and anti-corruption. the first pharmaceutical industry version of the tool was launched in november 2010 and we used it to conduct a labour review in 11 of our marketing companies, including some countries where national labour standards are inconsistent with global best practice. our responsible procurement process is based on an escalating set of risk-based due diligence activities, applied in a pragmatic way. forty five percent of supplier sites audited demonstrated standards that met our expectations with a further 51% implementing improvements to address non-compliances. we will not use suppliers who are unable or unwilling to meet our expectations in a timely way. our long-standing ‘road scholars’ scheme in the us continues to be a valuable channel for building awareness and improving driver skills. we regret that during 2011 one of our employees was killed in a road traffic accident while driving on astrazeneca business. this puts us well on track to achieve our 2015 target of a 25% reduction in the lost time injury/illness rate. work-related stress remains our greatest single category of occupational illness with high workloads, interpersonal issues and organisational change identified as significant factors. as part of our ongoing efforts in this area, we are adopting an increasingly proactive, risk-based approach, using wellbeing risk assessment tools to identify high-risk areas and target interventions more effectively. in 2011, we spent a total of $1.27 billion (2010: $1.41 billion) on community sponsorships, partnerships and charitable donations worldwide, including our product donation and patient assistance programmes which make our medicines available free of charge or at reduced prices. through our three patient assistance programmes in the us we donated products valued at an average wholesale price of over $938 million (2010: $1.38 billion). we also donated products worth $8.2 million, valued at average wholesale price, to the charitable organisations: americares and direct relief international. > in february 2011, we donated £10,000 (approximately $16,000) from our caf account to the british red cross new zealand earthquake appeal. many more go undiagnosed and a lot of women are unable to afford or access treatment. astrazeneca annual report and form 20-f

used. sales in western europe decreased by 39% largely due to generic competition, with france accounting for almost half the decline. > cubicin™ 2 (daptomycin) is a cyclic lipopeptide anti-bacterial used for the treatment of serious infections in hospitalised patients. many bacterial infections currently have few satisfactory treatment options prompting demand for new and better therapies. patients with infections which are resistant to commonly used antibiotics will also be included in the phase iii programme. flumist is now approved for eligible individuals in seven countries

rheumatology rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is currently treated with generic disease- modifying anti-rheumatic agents and, where the relevant criteria are met, biologic disease-modifiers. novel oral drugs targeting intra-cellular signalling pathways that provide anti-tnf-like levels of efficacy and potentially more convenient dosing will likely be used both after and ahead of the tnf blockers, especially in patients who currently choose not to take, are anxious about taking or are ineligible to take, injectable biologic agents. current treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) focuses on controlling disease flares, preventing renal failure and suppressing symptoms to an acceptable level while minimising toxicity. the ongoing phase iii programme, called oskira, commenced in september 2010. a further phase iib monotherapy study (oskira 4) was initiated in january 2011. this study will provide important information on the profile of fostamatinib, unconfounded by background disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, such as methotrexate. medi-546, which targets the type i ifn receptor, is initiating a phase iib study in patients with sle. 1 decision resources 2011.

of its healthcare system yet still has high mortality rates for coronary heart disease. combating this requires better education, encouraging people to make healthier lifestyle choices such as improving diet, taking more exercise and quitting smoking – this can help not only prevent the first heart attack but also safeguard patients’ lives after the event. this was partially offset by volume growth attributable to crestor, seroquel xr, symbicort, iressa and faslodex. sales in brazil were down as a result of generic competition for crestor and seroquel ir. in 2011, the overall reduction in our profit before tax for the year due to higher minimum medicaid rebates on prescription drugs, discounts on branded pharmaceutical sales to medicare part d beneficiaries and an industry-wide excise fee was $750 million. while it is unlikely that there will be widespread adoption of a broad national price-control scheme in the near future, there will continue to be increased attention to pharmaceutical prices and their impact on healthcare costs for the foreseeable future. this development was partially offset by volume growth attributable to crestor, seroquel xr, symbicort, iressa and faslodex. these and other measures all contribute to an increasingly difficult environment for branded pharmaceuticals in europe. however, seroquel, faslodex and iressa all showed a strong performance on an underlying volume basis. we achieved double digit year-on-year sales growth for most of our key products, nexium, seroquel xr, symbicort, zoladex, atacand and seloken. in latin america the pharmaceutical market continues to grow strongly, underpinned by a relatively stable political and economic climate. strong competition from local, non-multinational, companies with branded generic products is increasingly becoming a feature of the region. brazilian sales for the year were impacted by loss of exclusivity not only on crestor but also atacand monotherapy and seroquel ir. mexican year-on-year sales were flat, mirroring a market that is currently showing low single digit growth. our largest markets were south africa, saudi arabia, the uae and algeria where we achieved steady growth. it also provides additional incentives for those who adhere to treatment regimes and so helps improve health outcomes. > macro factors such as greater demand from an ageing population and increasing requirements of servicing emerging markets. the most significant features of our financial results in 2011 are: > revenue was down 2% at $33,591 million (reported: up 1%). > core operating margin of 39.2% of revenue was down 1.2 percentage points (reported: 1.6 percentage points), as benefits arising from higher gross margin and lower sg&a spend at cer were more than offset by increased expenditures in r&d and lower core other income. as a result, core financial measures merely allow investors to differentiate between different kinds of costs and they should not be used in isolation. the set retains strategic management of the costs excluded from reported financial information in arriving at core financial measures, tracking their impact on reported operating profit and eps, with operational management being delegated on a case-by- case basis to ensure clear accountability and consistency for each cost category. within core adjustments, restructuring costs and amortisation were broadly in line with last year’s level. closing net funds include $3,765 million of us treasury bills with a maturity date greater than 90 days. if the option is exercised in 2012, this will effectively end astrazeneca’s relationships with, and obligations to, merck (other than some residual manufacturing arrangements). in light of current market conditions, debts within these euro countries have been subject to enhanced monitoring and scrutiny by the group. the assumptions going forward for revenue, margins and cash flow assume no material mergers, acquisitions or disposals. pensionable pay was frozen at its 30 june 2010 level but the defined benefit fund remains open to existing members. we negotiate best available premium rates with insurance providers on the basis of our extensive risk management procedures. recently, insurance for product liability has not been available on commercially acceptable terms and the group has not held product liability insurance since february 2006. taxation tax risk management forms an integrated part of the group risk management processes. the group has a centralised treasury function to manage these risks in accordance with board-approved policies. accrual assumptions are built up on a product-by-product and customer-by-customer basis, taking into account specific contract provisions coupled with expected performance, and are then aggregated into a weighted average rebate accrual rate for each of our products. inevitably, however, such estimates involve judgements on aggregate future sales levels, segment mix and the customer’s contractual performance. returned product is not exchanged for product from inventory and once a return claim has been determined to be valid and a credit note has been issued to the customer, the returned goods are destroyed. purchases of ip and product rights to supplement our r&d portfolio are capitalised as intangible assets. although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of legal proceedings, we do not currently expect them to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, but they could significantly affect our financial results in any particular period. in keeping with local terms and conditions, most of these plans are ‘defined contribution’ in nature, where the resulting income statement charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees’ pay. this methodology results in a less volatile income statement charge than under the alternative approach of recognising actuarial gains and losses over time. investment decisions in respect of defined benefit schemes are based on underlying actuarial and economic circumstances with the intention of ensuring that the schemes have sufficient assets to meet liabilities as they fall due, rather than meeting accounting requirements. it analysed the current management of cholesterol treatment among more than 5,000 adult patients being treated with statins. from 2001 until january 2006, he was president and chief executive officer of the company’s north american subsidiary. his career at pfizer spanned 15

annual performance evaluation of the board and its committees with an open mind. the senior independent non-executive director is also available to shareholders if they have concerns that contact through the normal channels of chairman or executive directors has failed to resolve, or for which such contact is inappropriate. directors have regular contact with, and access to, succession candidates for senior executive management positions. the biographies of board members set out from pages 100 to 101 give more information about current directors in this respect. they also typically attend tailored induction programmes that take account of their individual skills and experience. it has established procedures for the receipt and handling of complaints concerning accounting or

to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. the full assurance statement which contains detailed scope, methodology, overall opinion and recommendations can be found on our website, astrazeneca.com. so its main focus is on developing policy and remuneration decisions that support the group’s strategy as a focused, integrated, innovation- driven, global, prescription-based biopharmaceutical business. as your elected representatives, our primary task is to invest shareholders’ money, in the form of compensation resource, wisely. we then set out extensive information of the sort that our shareholders are familiar with. we would find it useful to receive feedback from shareholders on this new approach in due course. > the cfo must defer one third of any pre-tax bonus into ordinary shares or adss. balanced against this were a number of pipeline disappointments, including olaparib and tc-5214, which both resulted in impairment charges. a summary of the main components of remuneration is set out on page 119. base pay and total compensation positioning against the relevant market is intended to be sufficient (but no more than necessary) to attract, retain and develop high-calibre talent. variable pay forms a significant part of the overall remuneration opportunity for executive directors, set members and other senior executives.

(variable) long-term equity incentive awards to provide individual executives and employees with total compensation opportunities that are competitive against local market practice, for the achievement of operational excellence, strong financial performance and actions that are closely aligned with the interests of shareholders. generally, psp share awards can be granted at any time (although in practice they are awarded annually), but not during a close or prohibited period of the company. in 2011, the main grant of psp share awards was made on 28 march, with a smaller grant of share awards approved by the committee in relation to, for example, new appointments, promotions and assignments being made on 26 august. this allows performance to be assessed against targets that have been set on a consistent basis. in accordance with the company’s articles, following their appointment, directors must retire at each agm and may present themselves for election or re-election.

ceased to be a director on 28 april 2011. unitised stock plans david brennan, in common with other participating executives in the us, has interests in the following plans which were awarded to him prior to him becoming ceo: the astrazeneca executive deferral plan, the astrazeneca executive deferred compensation plan and the astrazeneca savings and security plan. following certain mandatory tax deductions, david brennan became beneficially interested in a net number of 98,219 ordinary shares. following certain mandatory tax deductions, simon lowth became beneficially interested in a net number of 35,799 ordinary shares. astrazeneca annual report and form 20-f information 2011 126 directors’ remuneration report deferred bonus plan as described on page 117, there is a requirement for executive directors and set members to defer a certain proportion of any short-term bonus payments into ordinary shares or adss. 2 following certain mandatory tax deductions, david brennan became beneficially interested in a net number of 8,213 ordinary shares. 3 following certain mandatory tax deductions, simon lowth became beneficially interested in a net number of 656 ordinary shares. specific risks and uncertainties are also discussed in the business review from page 29, where relevant. these plans are supported by the provision of training and crisis simulation activities for business managers. we believe that the forward-looking statements about astrazeneca in this annual report, identified by words such as ‘anticipates’, ‘believes’, ‘expects’ and ‘intends’, are based on reasonable assumptions. production and release schedules for biologics may be more significantly impacted by regulatory processes than other products. in recent years, companies sponsoring new drug applications and regulatory authorities have been under increased public pressure to apply more conservative benefit/risk criteria. delays in regulatory reviews and approvals could impact the timing of a new product launch. as a result, certain countries may seek to limit or deny effective ip protection for pharmaceuticals. delays to anticipated launch dates can result from a number of factors including adverse findings in preclinical or clinical studies, regulatory demands, competitor activity and technology transfer. as a result, we cannot be certain that compounds currently under development will achieve success, and our ability to accurately assess, prior to launch, the eventual efficacy or safety of a new product once in broader clinical use can only be based on data available at that time, which is inherently limited due to relatively short periods of product testing and small clinical study patient samples. if a new product does not succeed as anticipated or its rate of sales growth is slower than anticipated, there is a risk that we are unable to fully recoup the costs incurred in launching it, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. the failure to exploit potential opportunities appropriately in emerging markets may materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations. see the intellectual property section from page 34 which contains a table of certain patent expiry dates for our key marketed products. this is a particular risk in some emerging markets where appropriate patent protection may be difficult to obtain or enforce. infringement accusations may implicate, for example, our manufacturing processes, product intermediates or use of research tools. details of significant infringement claims against us by third parties enforcing ip rights can be found in note 25 to the financial statements from page 181. if we are not successful in maintaining exclusive rights to market one or more of our major products, particularly in the us where we achieve our highest revenue, our revenue and margins could be materially adversely affected. while we seek to manage such risks by, for example, acquiring licences, foregoing certain activities or uses, or modifying processes to avoid infringement claims and permit commercialisation of our products, such steps entail significant cost and there is no guarantee that they will be successful. for example, in the us, realised prices are being depressed through cost-control tools such as restricted lists and formularies, which employ ‘generic first’ strategies and require physicians to obtain prior approval for the use of a branded medicine where a generic version exists. the importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where prices are low due to government price controls or other market dynamics, to countries where prices for those products are higher, is already prevalent and may increase. in particular, as discussed in the pricing pressure section on page 18, germany, spain, portugal and greece have all introduced a number of short-term measures to lower healthcare spending, including price cuts or increased mandatory rebates, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. in europe, the ema published a draft guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing mabs. this draft guideline will likely be finalised in 2012 and is expected to include more clarification around the definition of biosimilars. there is also an increase in the maximum applicable penalties for bribery, including up to 10 years imprisonment and unlimited fines. in 2011, we terminated our existing outsource relationship for it infrastructure services and transitioned to a new multi-sourced operating model. in addition, we may have limited supply of biological materials, such as cells, animal products or by-products. this may lead to significant delays and/ or difficulties in obtaining goods and services on commercially acceptable terms. litigation, particularly in the us, is inherently unpredictable and unexpectedly high awards for damages can result from an adverse verdict. in some circumstances, such liability could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. in addition, our financial provisions for any obligations that we may have relating to environmental or occupational health and safety liabilities may be insufficient if the assumptions underlying the provisions, including our assumptions regarding the portion of waste at a site for which we are responsible, prove incorrect or if we are held responsible for additional contamination or occupational health and safety related claims. while we have adopted cash management and treasury policies to manage this risk (see financial risk management policies section on page 93), we cannot be certain that these will be completely effective in particular in the event of a global liquidity crisis. additionally, if we need access to external sources of financing to sustain and/or grow our business, such as the debt or equity capital financial markets, this may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, in the event of a severe and/or sustained economic downturn. movements in the exchange rates used to translate foreign currencies into us dollars may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. if such denial of coverage is ultimately upheld, this could result in material additional charges to our earnings. due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

17,894 23,246 226 23,472 1 amounts charged or credited to other reserves relate to exchange adjustments arising on goodwill. revenues are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party. in preparing their individual financial statements, the accounting policies of some overseas subsidiaries do not conform with adopted ifrss. therefore, where appropriate, adjustments are made in order to present the consolidated financial statements on a consistent basis. in addition, the group has a wide diversity of customers and suppliers across different geographic areas. internal development expenditure is capitalised only if it meets the recognition criteria of ias 38 ‘intangible assets’. such payments are expensed if they represent compensation for subcontracted research and development services not resulting in a transfer of intellectual property. assets capitalised are amortised, generally on a straight-line basis, over their useful economic lives from product launch. under this policy, it is not possible to determine precise economic lives for individual classes of intangible assets. fixed deposits fixed deposits, comprising principally funds held with banks and other financial institutions, are initially measured at fair value, plus direct transaction costs, and are subsequently remeasured to amortised cost using the effective interest rate method at each reporting date. such a designation has been made where this significantly reduces an accounting mismatch which would result from recognising gains and losses on different bases. subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment losses. subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. astrazeneca annual report and form 20-f information 2011 financial statements 149 financial statements impairment the carrying values of non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at least annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. for goodwill, intangible assets under development and for any other assets where such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated based on the greater of its value in use and its fair value less cost to sell. exchange differences on all other foreign currency transactions are taken to operating profit in the individual group entity’s accounting records. non-monetary items arising from foreign currency transactions are not retranslated in the individual group entity’s accounting records. in the consolidated financial statements, income and expense items for group entities with a functional currency other than us dollars are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates, which approximate to actual rates, for the relevant accounting periods. unremitted earnings may be liable to overseas taxes and/ or uk taxation (after allowing for double tax relief) if distributed as dividends. the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised totalled approximately $9,155m at 31 december 2011 (2010: $16,768m; 2009: $14,846m). 6 segment information astrazeneca is engaged in a single business activity of pharmaceuticals and the group does not have multiple operating segments. all of these functional activities take place (and are managed) globally on a highly integrated basis. we consider that the set is astrazeneca’s chief operating decision-making body (as defined by ifrs 8). where necessary these are implemented through cross-functional sub-committees that consider the group-wide impact of a new decision. no terminal value is included as these cash flows are more than sufficient to establish that an impairment does not exist. for each group of cash flows we use an appropriate discount rate reflecting those risks and tax effects. a gain of $44m has been made on these bonds since designation due to increased credit risk. – interest rate swaps – the fair value is estimated using appropriate zero coupon curve valuation techniques to discount future contractual cash flows based on rates current at year end. these include equity securities held on the consolidated statement of financial position as other investments (note 10). the different levels have been defined as follows: > level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. in the absence of specific market data, these unlisted investments are held at cost, adjusted as necessary for impairments, which approximates to fair value. further details are included in note 24. other provisions comprise amounts relating to specific legal or constructive obligations and disputes. these principles are appropriate to astrazeneca’s business at the present date; should circumstances change they may require review. in consideration for these rights, forest paid novexel, then an astrazeneca group company, a sum of $210m on 3 march 2010 and will also pay additional sums equivalent to half of any future specified development milestone payments that become payable by astrazeneca. the board considers short-term requirements against available sources of funding taking into account forecast cash flows. surplus cash generated by business units is substantially converted to, and held centrally in, us dollars. this currency exposure is managed centrally based on forecast cash flows including the principal currencies of swedish krona (sek), pounds sterling (gbp), euro (eur), australian dollar (aud), canadian dollar (cad), japanese yen (jpy), romanian leu (ron) and russian ruble (rub). exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings not designated in a hedge relationship are taken to profit. transactional one hundred percent of the group’s major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three months, are hedged, where practicable, using forward foreign exchange contracts against individual group companies’ reporting currency. foreign exchange gains and losses on forward contracts transacted for transactional hedging are taken to profit. given the profile of our customers, including large wholesalers and government-backed agencies, no further credit risk has been identified with the trade receivables not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made. the group’s current uk, swedish and us schemes are described below; other arrangements apply elsewhere. there is also one senior staff long-term incentive scheme, under which approximately 70 participants may be eligible for awards granted as astrazeneca adss. generally, awards can be granted at any time, but not during a close period of the company. this plan provides for the grant of restricted stock unit (rsu) awards to selected below set-level employees and is used in conjunction with the astrazeneca performance share plan to provide a mix of rsus and performance shares. this method incorporated expected dividends but no other features into the measurements of fair value. individual participation monthly savings by an employee under all savings contracts linked to options granted under any save as you earn scheme may not exceed £250 or such lower amounts as may be determined by the directors. exercise of options an option will normally be exercisable between three and 10 years following its grant provided any relevant performance condition has been satisfied. these elements are discussed in further detail below, together with a summary of their accounting treatments. as a result of this payment, merck relinquished any claims it may have had to zeneca products. (contingent payments on the authorised generic version of felodipine will continue until astrazeneca’s third party distribution arrangement ends, which is currently expected to occur in june 2012.) in particular, astrazeneca has environmental liabilities at some currently or formerly owned, leased and third party sites. similarly, stauffer management company llc (smc), which was established in 1987 to own and manage certain assets of stauffer chemical company acquired that year, and/or its indemnitees, have been named as prps or defendants at 29 sites where smc is likely to incur us environmental consequences. astrazeneca has also given indemnities to third parties for a number of sites outside the us. it is possible that astrazeneca could incur future environmental costs beyond the extent of our current provisions. financial statements astrazeneca annual report and form 20-f information 2011 184 financial statements legal proceedings astrazeneca is involved in various legal proceedings considered typical to its business, including actual or threatened litigation and/or actual or potential government investigations relating to employment matters, product liability, commercial disputes, pricing, sales and marketing practices, infringement of ip rights, the validity of certain patents and competition laws. we also do not believe that disclosure of the amount sought by plaintiffs, if known, would be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings. astrazeneca has applied for interlocutory relief against both watson and actavis, pending resolution of the infringement actions. the hearing of the damages action is scheduled to begin in march 2012. nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) us patent litigation in may 2011 and january 2012, astrazeneca entered into agreements, respectively, with each of sandoz inc. (sandoz) and lupin limited (lupin) settling astrazeneca’s patent infringement actions against those entities. as previously disclosed, in 2008, astrazeneca resolved patent litigation with teva respecting its generic copies of pulmicort respules, thereby allowing teva to begin marketing its generic product in december 2009. in may 2011, astrazeneca received a paragraph iv certification notice letter from watson laboratories, inc. (watson) indicating that it was seeking approval to market a generic version of the 1.0mg/2.0ml dosage form of pulmicort respules before patent expiration. seroquel xr (quetiapine fumarate) us patent litigation/regulatory proceedings astrazeneca’s several patent infringement actions proceeded in the us district court for the district of new jersey against various generic drug manufacturers who have filed andas seeking approval to market generic copies of seroquel xr tablets prior to the expiration of astrazeneca’s product patent covering seroquel xr. in 2010, after having established apotex’s liability, astrazeneca and the merck group initiated proceedings to recover damages. seroquel (quetiapine fumarate) with regard to seroquel product liability litigation in the us, which primarily relates to diabetes and/or other related injuries, as of 31 january 2012, astrazeneca was aware of approximately 25 claims that have not been settled in principle. a provision has been established in respect of the seroquel product liability claims regarding both current and anticipated future settlement costs as well as anticipated future defence costs associated with resolving all or substantially all remaining claims. in march 2011, the eleventh circuit court of appeals affirmed the november 2008 dismissal of a putative nationwide third party payer class action lawsuit which alleged that astrazeneca promoted seroquel for off-label uses and as superior to lower-cost alternative medicines. in november 2006, astrazeneca was notified of an inquiry by the us attorney’s office for the eastern district of pennsylvania regarding whether a payment made by astrazeneca to advance pcs was taken into account when calculating best price. other matter we have reported separately on the group financial statements of astrazeneca plc for the year ended 31 december 2011. jimmy daboo senior statutory auditor for and on behalf of kpmg audit plc, statutory auditor chartered accountants 15 canada square, london, e14 5gl 2 february 2012 independent auditor’s report to the members of astrazeneca plc astrazeneca annual report and form 20-f information 2011 financial statements 193 financial statements astrazeneca plc notes 2011 $m 2010 $m fixed assets fixed asset investments 1 23,421 25,232 current assets debtors – other 1 1 debtors – amounts owed by group undertakings 1,937 3,558 1,938 3,559 creditors: amounts falling due within one year non-trade creditors 2 (3,217) (194) interest-bearing loans and borrowings 3 (1,749) – (4,966) (194) net current (liabilities)/assets (3,028) 3,365 total assets less current liabilities 20,393 28,597 creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year amounts owed to group undertakings 3 (283) (283) interest-bearing loans and borrowings 3 (6,714) (8,486) (6,997) (8,769) net assets 13,396 19,828 capital and reserves called-up share capital 6 323 352 share premium account 4 3,078 2,672 capital redemption reserve 4 139 107 other reserves 4 2,983 3,020 profit and loss account 4 6,873 13,677 shareholders’ funds 5 13,396 19,828 $m means millions of us dollars. exchange differences on all other transactions, except relevant foreign currency loans, are taken to operating profit.
