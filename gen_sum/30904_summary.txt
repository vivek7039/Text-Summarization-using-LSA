The Group has delivered another  strong year of growth in 2017, providing  an encouraging platform for future  progress across all divisions. Fit Out has continued  to win work in its targeted sectors and  secured places on two large public sector  frameworks. ■ Developing people ■ Working together  with our supply chain ■ Failure to innovate ■ Failure to invest in  information technology Fit Out’s new health and safety app (see page 35)  and Partnership Housing’s research into public land  (see page 40) are examples of innovative projects  undertaken by the divisions. ■ Developing people ■ Working together  with our supply chain ■ Failure to innovate ■ Failure to invest in  information technology Fit Out’s new health and safety app (see page 35)  and Partnership Housing’s research into public land  (see page 40) are examples of innovative projects  undertaken by the divisions. This excludes prospects where confirmation has been received as  preferred bidder only, with no formal contract or letter of intent in place. The Group has no  pension funding requirements for its  small defined benefits scheme that was  closed to future accrual in May 1995. Each of our divisions  actively engages with its customers and  aims where possible to secure work on  frameworks or from repeat business. Now in  operation, the centre will produce 30%  less carbon than a conventional building  by generating its own electricity and  using gas more efficiently. Construction was also appointed to  a number of other new and renewed  public sector frameworks during the  year that offer future projects across  its core markets. Divisional outlook Looking ahead, Construction &  Infrastructure will continue to focus on  margin improvement and securing higher  quality work with the appropriate risk  balance. Through its partnership  with Mind, Construction &  Infrastructure hosted the  launch of ‘Thriving at Work’,  a government-commissioned  report on mental health  and employers. A building certified by  WELL will score highly against their benchmarks in ‘air’,  ‘water’, ‘nourishment’, ‘light’, ‘fitness’, ‘comfort’ and ‘mind’. “We are delighted that  Overbury is continuing to  work with us in bringing  forward state-of-the-art  education and research  facilities which will further  enhance our standing  as a leading global  university.” Frank Rogers  King’s College London  project director. Market overview There are currently over five  million social housing homes  in the UK, incurring an annual  repairs and maintenance  expenditure of £7bn 1 . We are  well placed to meet these  demands through our MSi  property management  software that drives down  the need for responsive  repairs. In mixed tenure, 887 units were  completed across open market sales  and social housing, lower than the prior  year number of 1,060. The new urban village will have a neighbourhood  centre, community hall, tree-lined boulevard,  river walk, cycle paths and parks. The division is continuing to develop  partnerships with housing associations  and local authorities, supported by its  extensive research completed into  underutilised government land. 40 ———  MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Strategic report Operating review Partnership Housing — continued Trinity Walk, Woolwich  Trinity Walk is part of the One  Woolwich programme in partnership  with the Royal Borough of Greenwich  and PA Housing to regenerate three  council estates for mixed tenure. The council also approved investment  in a second residential development at  St Stephen’s Road, which will provide  46 high quality homes for market rent. Local  authorities and NHS trusts without  large, in-house estate teams are  therefore seeking development  skills from the private sector. Progress against 2017 strategic priorities Create long-term capital  platforms with investors In early 2017, we secured £100m  of funding from the Universities  Superannuation Scheme for our  HB Villages joint venture. Based on current trading patterns,  a strong balance sheet, high-quality  secured order book and visible pipeline  of opportunities, our outlook for 2018  looks positive. Fit Out, while more susceptible to GDP  fluctuations, has a strong secured order  book for 2018 and beyond, providing  higher visibility of future workload  than in previous years. Voluntary staff turnover  continues to fall and new people are  being recruited who will help us  achieve our strategic objectives. ■ This commitment complements our  business model which is designed to  provide a mix of earnings across  different market cycles. ■ A constrained land bank, targeting option type  agreements with owners that limit long-term  exposure and boost return on capital employed. ■ We have an enhanced understanding  of medium-term pipeline quality,  enabling us to predict trends more  accurately and adjust our strategy  in response. ■ A deliberately large proportion of projects  conducted via framework or joint venture  arrangements with repeat clients who share  our philosophy and values, making predictable  outcomes more likely. ■ This commitment complements our  business model which is designed to  provide a mix of earnings across  different market cycles. ■ A constrained land bank, targeting option type  agreements with owners that limit long-term  exposure and boost return on capital employed. ■ We have an enhanced understanding  of medium-term pipeline quality,  enabling us to predict trends more  accurately and adjust our strategy  in response. ■ A deliberately large proportion of projects  conducted via framework or joint venture  arrangements with repeat clients who share  our philosophy and values, making predictable  outcomes more likely. ■ Our investment in graduate, trainee  and apprenticeship schemes is now  well established, with a continuing  number of participants progressing to  more senior positions. ■ Construction & Infrastructure has  embedded its cultural development  programme and adopted an innovative  approach to fatigue management,  known as Readiband (see page 31). ■ Our investment in graduate, trainee  and apprenticeship schemes is now  well established, with a continuing  number of participants progressing to  more senior positions. ■ Construction & Infrastructure has  embedded its cultural development  programme and adopted an innovative  approach to fatigue management,  known as Readiband (see page 31). ■ Our current JV project portfolio has  not suffered any material impact as  a result of recent industry  insolvency issues. ■ Our current JV project portfolio has  not suffered any material impact as  a result of recent industry  insolvency issues. ■ Construction’s order book contains a  greater proportion of repeat client  work, meaning we are more likely to  achieve sustainable and predictable  outcomes via negotiated settlement. ■ Construction’s order book contains a  greater proportion of repeat client  work, meaning we are more likely to  achieve sustainable and predictable  outcomes via negotiated settlement. ■ Our employees enjoy working on high profile,  innovative projects that provide them with the  ability to enhance their knowledge and experience. ■ Our IT team has seen a significant  increase in demand for new  technology from operational teams  and we foresee this trend continuing. ■ Ongoing strategic projects to improve  security include updating our Active  Directory of authenticated users,  preparing for compliance with the EU  General Data Protection Regulation  and ISO 27001 accreditation. ■ A centralised IT service that improves efficiency,  oversight, reporting, security and performance,  with localised divisional resource providing  business-specific product support. ■ Our employees enjoy working on high profile,  innovative projects that provide them with the  ability to enhance their knowledge and experience. ■ Our IT team has seen a significant  increase in demand for new  technology from operational teams  and we foresee this trend continuing. ■ Ongoing strategic projects to improve  security include updating our Active  Directory of authenticated users,  preparing for compliance with the EU  General Data Protection Regulation  and ISO 27001 accreditation. ■ A centralised IT service that improves efficiency,  oversight, reporting, security and performance,  with localised divisional resource providing  business-specific product support.

Our measures for ensuring good corporate governance  practice across the Group include regular internal audit reviews,  encouraging employees to speak up and taking appropriate  action where behaviour does not meet expectations. Following Tracey Killen’s appointment to the Board in May 2017,  her induction programme contained each of these elements,  detailed further overleaf. Michael Findlay chairs the committee but is not permitted to  chair meetings where his own succession and performance  are discussed. All employees have access to  an employee assistance programme that provides confidential  counselling and support on a variety of issues. Emissions reported  correspond with our financial year and include all areas for  which we have operational control in the UK, excluding joint  ventures. Any use of committee discretion with respect to  waiving or modifying performance conditions  will be disclosed in the relevant annual report. The committee may additionally make  awards or payments in respect of deferred remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer. Disclosures required under UK Listing Rule 9.8.4 Apart from the dividend waiver which has been issued in  respect of shares held by Butterfield Trust (Guernsey) Limited  (see page 114 of the consolidated financial statements), there  are no disclosures required to be made under UK Listing  Rule 9.8.4. Key observations There have been no significant changes in the valuation model and we consider management’s  underlying assumptions to be within a reasonable range. Key observations We concur with management that there are no significant matters identified as a result of these  procedures. It is estimated that costs of c£3m which were capitalised and not yet fully amortised at  31 December 2017 would have been expensed in earlier years. Fair value movements are recognised in  operating profit and the resulting financial asset is presented as a non-current receivable. Prepaid contributions  are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or reduction on future payments is available. 2 Business segments For management purposes, the Group is organised into six operating divisions: Construction & Infrastructure, Fit Out, Property  Services, Partnership Housing, Urban Regeneration and Investments. In testing goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, the recoverable amount of each CGU has been estimated from  value-in-use calculations.
