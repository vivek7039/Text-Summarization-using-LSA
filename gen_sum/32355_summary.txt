service every day > the volume of flights we handled increased by 7.6% to 2.45 million (2016: 2.28 million). after taking into account a reduced charge for goodwill impairment of £11m (2016: £93m), profit before tax at £126m (2016: £44m) was £82m better. dr paul golby, cbe freng chairman chairman’s statement nats holdings limited annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report | 09 progress chief executive’s review martin rolfe overall we made good progress in implementing our strategic objectives this year and achieved all but one of the priorities we set ourselves. we faced similar operational challenges when particularly high demand coincided with the introduction of new systems (e.g. itec) into our operation. our primary objective is to ensure that, irrespective of the prevailing conditions, all flights are handled safely. modernising airspace will significantly increase its capacity but, like runway capacity enhancement, there are significant social and political hurdles (such as public opposition to changing aircraft noise patterns) to be overcome, even when the noise impact is an overall improvement for a community. chief executive’s review nats holdings limited annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report | 11 progress chief executive’s review win and retain commercial business we are working hard to strengthen that part of our business which is not economically regulated. we are supporting our aquila joint venture with its delivery of the mod’s project marshall. together with our joint venture partner, thales, we are committing more resources in 2017/18 to re-plan and execute on a delivery schedule for asset provision that will ensure our military customer has the capability required to perform its mission. we continue to develop our international activities, focusing on the middle east and asia pacific. this infrastructure has served us well but is coming to the end of its useful life. as described below, the caa applies an economic regulatory building block model which is mainly cash-based. the group also pays other taxes such as employer’s national insurance contributions and business rates, which are significant costs. this includes annual meetings with hmrc to review the group’s performance and its business strategy. this reflected challenging financial market conditions and the resulting impact on uk defined benefit pension scheme liabilities. more information on our pension arrangements and their governance is provided in note 30 to the consolidated financial statements. this mainly reflected a deterioration in financial market conditions, principally from lower gilt yields, which was only partially offset by investment returns. 2017 £m 2016 £m sesar deployment 107.2 81.1 airspace 5.9 8.6

| 18 progress following the 2015 valuation, trustees agreed to continue with the recovery plan for the 2012 deficit and to a new 11-year recovery plan for the increase in deficit at 31 december 2015. as a result, deficit contributions of £39.9m will be paid for the 2017 calendar year in addition to normal contributions at 31.8% of pensionable pay. outlook for 2018 we expect our revenue next year to be broadly in line with 2017 as further price reductions for airspace customers are offset by additional revenue from the growth in flights and from defence services provided under our contract with aquila. the uk en route business also benefits from some protections against traffic volume risk afforded by its price control conditions. for nerl, kpis are largely aligned with the single european sky (ses) key performance areas ensuring management focus on meeting safety, service quality, environmental and cost efficiency targets. a number of the metrics are also used to set targets for remuneration purposes and so align incentives with business objectives. for the 2017 financial year, there were no category a or b airprox 3 events attributable to nats (2016: nil). the increase in airprox overall was driven by events involving remotely piloted aircraft systems (rpas or drones), none of which are attributable to nats (see graph). we also seek to optimise operational staff performance through annual training, competency assessments and the development of new systems. this last year we safely introduced itec into the prestwick operation which provides additional monitoring capabilities for controllers. this approach will help to ensure that each change can be successfully delivered without impacting other airspace changes. it will also modernise prestwick lower airspace including manchester and scottish tma as part of a joint programme with airports. continued low oil prices have reduced the cost of air travel and are contributing to passenger demand. en route, london approach and north sea helicopter advisory services are regulated by this licence. a price per service unit is set to recover this based on forecast traffic for the reference period. if regulatory and other assumptions are borne out in practice, then nerl would earn a return of 5.9% p.a. nats services operates in a contestable market and faces competition from other air navigation service providers (ansps). engineering support services for uk airport customers deliver complex turnkey projects, mainly integrating new infrastructure at airports. these services are mainly provided through the project marshall contract which is being delivered in partnership with thales by our aquila joint venture. the group has maintained a focus on mitigating these risks, although many remain outside of our control – for example changes in regulation, security threats, environmental factors and the impact of longevity and financial markets on pension funding. if this does not proceed in a timely manner, supported by clear government policy, then uk airspace will reach capacity limits causing increasing delay and constraining aviation growth. also, the group’s air traffic services operate under a european regulatory regime which requires key performance targets to be met. industry consensus was that this is not possible during rp2 due to factors beyond nerl’s control. the trustees will perform their next formal valuation at 31 december 2017, to inform nerl’s performance plan for rp3. financial market conditions since the 2015 valuation, characterised by historic low real gilt yields in particular, have continued to be a challenge for most uk defined benefit pension schemes. as explained above, nerl has traffic volume risk- sharing arrangements that mitigate revenue reductions to a large extent. every effort is made to maintain good employee relations at all times, including through our working together programme and through joint working groups as part of an employee relations improvement project, to ensure the delivery of an efficient operational service and associated support. this was more than offset by additional revenue earned from the increase in uk en route flights. this delay performance for 2016 was just outside of the regulator’s target, resulting in a small penalty. together with our joint venture partner, thales, we are committing more resources in 2017/18 to re-plan and execute the delivery schedule for asset provision. other service lines uk business revenue was £4.0m lower this year at £14.8m (2016: £18.8m) mainly reflecting fewer windfarm mitigation contracts. ferronats secured atc contracts at andorra - la seu d’urgell, lleida and córdoba airports, which are yet to transfer from the incumbent service provider. after prolonged discussions, last summer the company agreed a two- year pay deal with staff. this year we have built on a culture survey to leverage the beneficial aspects of nats culture and enhance aspects of our people practice; whether it is inducting new colleagues to the organisation more effectively; identifying how we can promote greater health and wellbeing in work; or looking at how we can improve the people aspects of new technology delivery. in the 2017 financial year nats enabled further savings of 55.9kt atm related co 2 emissions and has achieved 5.0% towards its 10% target for 2020. these savings derive both from large projects and minor changes to airspace made in consultation with customers. certain environmental performance metrics in the table above as at 31 march 2017 have been subject to external assurance by pricewaterhousecoopers llp (pwc). airline customers value 3di improvements as they support tactical fuel savings and are a proxy for good service delivery. for calendar year 2016 we achieved a 3di score of 30.3, which was within the economic regulator’s service performance range. this process started in the previous financial year but further stages have been paused pending consultation. our swanwick control centre is also part of the eu energy trading system and subject to separate verification. an engineer by training, martin holds a master’s degree in aerospace systems engineering from the university of southampton. he has 20 years of experience in the defence and aerospace industry, and prior to joining nats was the managing director of lockheed martin’s civil division with responsibility for worldwide air traffic management programmes as well as uk government business. his final role at ubs was as the bank’s head of

conducted each year. all non-executive directors are invited to relay the views of their respective shareholders into board discussions. the committee also reviews whistleblowing arrangements under which staff may confidentially report suspected wrongdoing in financial reporting or other matters. as we explain in our accounting policies, goodwill, intangible and tangible assets are tested annually for impairment. however, as with all such systems, internal controls can provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against misstatement or loss. the company also takes external advice on various aspects of remuneration policy and competitive pay levels from independent consultants. full details of directors’ remuneration paid in relation to 2016/17 are set out on page 57. reports from

stakeholders around the impact of these challenges and subsequently consulted customers around revisions to the planned delivery of major airspace changes. over many years nats has been successful in implementing highly resilient systems, necessary to the fulfilment of its mission. staff are frequently involved through direct discussions with their managers, cross company working groups and local committees. regular staff consultations cover a range of topics affecting the workforce, including such matters as corporate performance and business plans. we carried out full scope audits on all significant components which covered 99% of the group’s revenue. this included selecting a sample of investments held at the balance sheet date and comparing their value to supporting documentation. our audit testing of operating cash flows included comparing forecasts to recent financial performance and budgets approved by the board. in addition we have tested a sample of externally generated assets to test existence and that costs are materially accurate. we also agreed to report differences below this threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. independent
