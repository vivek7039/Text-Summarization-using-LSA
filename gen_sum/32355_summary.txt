dr paul golby, cbe freng chairman chairman’s statement nats holdings limited annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report | 09 progress chief executive’s review martin rolfe overall we made good progress in implementing our strategic objectives this year and achieved all but one of the priorities we set ourselves. we faced similar operational challenges when particularly high demand coincided with the introduction of new systems (e.g. itec) into our operation. the group also pays other taxes such as employer’s national insurance contributions and business rates, which are significant costs. this mainly reflected a deterioration in financial market conditions, principally from lower gilt yields, which was only partially offset by investment returns. the uk en route business also benefits from some protections against traffic volume risk afforded by its price control conditions. for nerl, kpis are largely aligned with the single european sky (ses) key performance areas ensuring management focus on meeting safety, service quality, environmental and cost efficiency targets. a number of the metrics are also used to set targets for remuneration purposes and so align incentives with business objectives. the increase in airprox overall was driven by events involving remotely piloted aircraft systems (rpas or drones), none of which are attributable to nats (see graph). we also seek to optimise operational staff performance through annual training, competency assessments and the development of new systems. it will also modernise prestwick lower airspace including manchester and scottish tma as part of a joint programme with airports. these services are mainly provided through the project marshall contract which is being delivered in partnership with thales by our aquila joint venture. if this does not proceed in a timely manner, supported by clear government policy, then uk airspace will reach capacity limits causing increasing delay and constraining aviation growth. also, the group’s air traffic services operate under a european regulatory regime which requires key performance targets to be met. financial market conditions since the 2015 valuation, characterised by historic low real gilt yields in particular, have continued to be a challenge for most uk defined benefit pension schemes. together with our joint venture partner, thales, we are committing more resources in 2017/18 to re-plan and execute the delivery schedule for asset provision. ferronats secured atc contracts at andorra - la seu d’urgell, lleida and córdoba airports, which are yet to transfer from the incumbent service provider. certain environmental performance metrics in the table above as at 31 march 2017 have been subject to external assurance by pricewaterhousecoopers llp (pwc). an engineer by training, martin holds a master’s degree in aerospace systems engineering from the university of southampton. in his last appointment he was responsible for generating and delivering all of the raf’s front line operational capability. the committee also reviews whistleblowing arrangements under which staff may confidentially report suspected wrongdoing in financial reporting or other matters. the company also takes external advice on various aspects of remuneration policy and competitive pay levels from independent consultants. understanding safety performance to ensure the committee remains fully informed of new developments it receives regular briefings on emerging topics. regular staff consultations cover a range of topics affecting the workforce, including such matters as corporate performance and business plans. this included selecting a sample of investments held at the balance sheet date and comparing their value to supporting documentation. our audit testing of operating cash flows included comparing forecasts to recent financial performance and budgets approved by the board. in addition we have tested a sample of externally generated assets to test existence and that costs are materially accurate. inter-segment transfers or transactions are entered into under the normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available to unrelated third parties. all qualifying capital expenditure is then inflated by this percentage which has the effect of capitalising related interest costs. if the actual outcome should differ or changes in expectations arise, impairment charges may be required which would materially impact on operating results. 17. borrowings 2017 £m 2016 £m secured loans at amortised cost £600m 5.25% guaranteed secured amortising bond due 2026 428.4 467.4 bank loans (variable rate revolving term loan and revolving credit facility expiring 2021) -
