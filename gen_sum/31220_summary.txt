The mining licence for Sekisovskoye is valid until 18 July 2020 with an automatic pre-emptive contractual right to extend after this period. ▲ The processing plant was overhauled involving a number of replacement parts/equipment, to ensure efficient working at higher volume levels.  Ore bodies have continued to be prepared for production however the lack of equipment has been a hindrance in this regard.  In addition, the costs of exploration at Karasuyskoye were capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy this amounted approximately US$1.4m, (475mKzt), which was principally invoiced by third party consultants to conduct detailed geological testing, and project documentation. The Company is also in discussions with another party to provide direct equipment financing. methodology has led to this improvement, and the recovery rates are being maintained at current levels. Geologically, we see potential for this area to contain multiple mineralised zones that could potentially host future mines. We frequently evaluate investment opportunities which are presented to us both in Kazakhstan and in the wider Central Asia area and, as part of our long-term business development plan, we will continue to evaluate other potential opportunities going forwards. Development Exploration Growth and Evaluation Mining Altyn plc Annual Report 2017 OUR STRATEGY AND BUSINESS MODEL Develop Continue to develop our high grade underground mine at Sekisovskoye Grow Production and asset base growth via the highly prospective Karasuyskoye Ore Fields Progress Continue to grow 6 7 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Altyn plc Annual Report 2017 Key performance indicators (KPIs) The gold poured increased to 16,717oz this is a significant increase from last year. However, without further external funding to complete the underground mine, production would proceed at a much slower pace than that currently planned. While the Company has no control over commodity prices, it is in a fortunate position to have a very robust mine and development project in Sekisovskoye that can withstand prolonged weak precious metals prices. Given that Company revenues are dependent on producing gold and silver from the Sekisovskoye mine, failure to achieve production targets would adversely affect the Company’s profitability and ability to generate cash. All employees, no matter whether they are part-time, full-time, or temporary, will be treated fairly and with respect. When selecting candidates for employment, promotion, training, or any other benefit, it will be on the basis of their aptitude and ability.
