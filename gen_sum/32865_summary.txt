businesses, all focused primarily on two client segments namely corporates and private clients around the world. services include governance, fiduciary, company secretarial support, financial reporting, regulatory reporting (fatca and crs), acting as listing sponsor for the channel islands securities exchange (rebranded in march 2017 to the international stock exchange) and aifmd depositary services. the teams’ expertise includes transaction management capabilities across a variety of asset classes including (but not limited to) private equity and real estate. the private client business also establishes investment vehicles for private clients either investing individually or on a collective basis (with other family members, family offices or business associates) through the use of companies, limited partnerships and unit trusts. the c&i division showed revenue and gross profit growth resulting from a good level of new business wins and execution of cross selling opportunities (including crs/fatca regulatory reporting services across most divisions), along with disciplined cost management. global trends around increased corporate outsourcing, particularly in the regulatory and compliance space, position c&i well for continued longer term growth. the potentially global and scalable nature of this division positions it well for further strong growth. stock code: snn www.sannegroup.com strategic report sanne-ar2017 front-proof13.indd 21 23/03/2018 16:24:10 25754 – 23 march 2018 4:19 pm – proof 13 22 strategic report risk management

and loss of office payments will only be made if they are consistent with the approved policy. during 2017 the committee had advice from new bridge street (nbs) (a trading name of aon plc). for example, where: • an executive director’s starting salary has been set at lower than typical market salary to allow for growth in the role and further experience to be gained, then larger increases may be awarded to move salary positioning closer to an appropriate benchmark for the role; • the committee considers it appropriate and necessary (such as when an individual assumes more responsibility or his or her performance warrants such an increase); • there has been a change in market practice or as a result of new regulations; or • the size, value or complexity of the group warrants a higher salary positioning. a range of benefits are provided by the company to executive directors that may include group income protection insurance, life assurance and family private medical cover. secondment fees may be offered where an executive director is asked to work temporarily in a different location. other reasonable benefits may be introduced to reflect typical practice

necessary. similarly, if an executive director is appointed following a merger or acquisition of another company, any legacy pay arrangements may be honoured. fees for newly appointed non-executive

below market levels and that this would need to be addressed over time. last year the committee consulted with leading shareholders and shareholder bodies on how it intends to transition remuneration over a period of time so that remuneration packages become appropriate for a ftse-listed company whilst also recognising the company’s jersey origins. as set out in last year's report, it is proposed that the executive directors' base salaries will be increased by 8% p.a. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. we compared management’s forecast with the latest approved budgets and found them to be materially consistent. key observations we

assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. this class of intangibles are amortised over their useful lives using the straight-line method, which is estimated at six to eight years, based on management’s expectations and client experience. when a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. share-based payments employees of the group receive bonus
