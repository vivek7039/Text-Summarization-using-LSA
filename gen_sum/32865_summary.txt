Further, the business continues to invest significantly in staff training and group services functions, strengthening its procedures. His background will be a great asset in helping the business to deliver its future development and global growth plans. The increase in workloads of asset managers creates additional administration that SANNE can manage as an outsourced solution with our international footprint. We have been driving to achieve this through building a sustainable global business based on best practice, professionalism, ambition, integrity and engagement. Strategic recruitment of talent and increased jurisdictional presence have helped us to deliver high quality professional services.

The teams’ expertise includes transaction management capabilities across a variety of asset classes including (but not limited to) private equity and real estate. Global trends around increased corporate outsourcing, particularly in the regulatory and compliance space, position C&I well for continued longer term growth. It recognises that uncertain events (risks) can occur which may have an adverse effect upon the achievement of these strategic objectives. • Robust due diligence process including 3rd party assessments by Top 4 accountancy firms, prior to acquisitions being completed • Regular impairment testing as per accounting rules • Ongoing management and monitoring against performance assumptions Foreign Exchange Risk The risk that the Group’s earnings are volatile as a result of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. • New LED lighting will save energy and give better brightness to the space the lighting control system • There will be over 500 LED light fittings • Lights will automatically switch off in areas when not occupied • Full height glazing on all of our floors • More natural light to all areas • Efficient drinking water taps, saving on use of bottled water • Bicycle parking spaces are located in the basement along with facilities • Break-out space for staff Pictured: Right: rt ro o or r o rtr Protecting our environment We have implemented the following initiatives to protect and respect our environment: • Phasing out bottled water in our Jersey offices and elsewhere; • PIR lighting and use of LED lights in our Jersey office; • Recycling, for example plastics and paper etc. SANNE North America Our New York office supported a charity event, Music Matters, to raise funds for the Caron Treatment Centres. Following 13 months of planning, negotiations and construction, SANNE's charity, IFS Community Care Foundation, successfully opened its latest CSR initiative, San’ Angels - Centre d’Eveil. As we advised last year, a search was commenced for an additional independent Channel Islands based Director to Chair our new Risk Committee. I am delighted that we were able to announce the appointment of Mel Carvill in December 2017. With continued global expansion, diversity amongst our colleagues has and will continue to increase as we foster international talent. In addition, it was agreed to have separate Audit and Risk committees following our Board evaluation last year. He was previously Finance Director for State Street’s AIS EMEA Private Equity and Real Estate alternative asset administration business. 25754 – 23 March 2018 4:19 PM – Proof 13 45 Stock code: SNN www.sannegroup.com Corporate Governance Sanne-AR2017 Front-proof13.indd 45 23/03/2018 16:24:20 Board Effectiveness Review Matters Considered Observations Actions taken Meeting T opics and discussions Additional time could be dedicated to the discussion of strategy. A plan has been created for all Committees to ensure that any feedback/topics are considered in the year. Succession planning was considered by the Committee and it has put in place a talent programme for senior management development. On 1 January 2018 Mel Carvill was appointed as an additional Non-executive Director and he will chair the new Risk Committee. These will vest after 3 years subject to achieving challenging underlying diluted EPS targets for the 2019 financial year. “The Company's remuneration report was well received and obtained 98.55% support at the 2017 AGM.“ Nicola Palios C h airm an of th e ro o Stock code: SNN www.sannegroup.com Corporate Governance Sanne-AR2017 Front-proof13.indd 57 23/03/2018 16:24:22 25754 – 23 March 2018 4:19 PM – Proof 13 58 Corporate Governance Application of policy in 2018 Base salaries As set out in last year’s remuneration report the Committee consulted with Shareholders and agreed to adopt a phased approach to salary increases. The awards will vest after three years subject to achievement against a sliding scale of underlying diluted EPS targets. If you would like to get in touch, then please do so through the Group Company Secretary. All remuneration and loss of office payments will only be made if they are consistent with the approved policy. A range of benefits are provided by the Company to Executive Directors that may include Group income protection insurance, life assurance and family private medical cover. Secondment fees may be offered where an Executive Director is asked to work temporarily in a different location. Other reasonable benefits may be introduced to reflect typical practice and the individual’s country of residence. Awards are normally granted annually in the form of either nominal or nil-cost options and vest after three years. Stretching performance conditions normally measured over a period of three years determine the extent to which awards vest. They do not receive any benefits but they may be reimbursed for the cost of travel or overnight accommodation and related expenses incurred in carrying out their duties which are deemed taxable by the relevant tax authority (including any personal tax due on such expenses). Any outstanding share awards held by a departing Executive Director will be treated in accordance with the relevant plan rules. Similarly, if an Executive Director is appointed following a merger or acquisition of another company, any legacy pay arrangements may be honoured. The PSP awards will vest subject to achievement against a sliding scale of underlying diluted EPS targets and continued employment. Phil Godley stepped down from the Board but remained in employment with SANNE and accordingly no payment has been made. Rupert Robson is no longer a member of the Remuneration Committee but will be invited to attend meetings, as appropriate. Last year the Committee consulted with leading Shareholders and Shareholder bodies on how it intends to transition remuneration over a period of time so that remuneration packages become appropriate for a FTSE-listed company whilst also recognising the Company’s Jersey origins. As set out in last year's report, it is proposed that the Executive Directors' base salaries will be increased by 8% p.a. We compared management’s forecast with the latest approved budgets and found them to be materially consistent. Key observations We considered management’s overall estimate in respect of the purchase price allocation to be reasonable. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. Subsequent to initial recognition, separately intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. This class of intangibles are amortised over their useful lives using the straight-line method, which is estimated at six to eight years, based on management’s expectations and client experience. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. The valuation was performed using six years which is based on management's best judgement and historical evidence. The normalised effective tax rate of 16.0% (2016: 16.5%) is in line with prior year due to adjustments being £184k where it was £624k for 2016. Earnings per share (continued) Diluted EPS takes into consideration the Company's dilutive contingently issuable shares as disclosed above. The market value on grant date was charged in full to operating expenses and further identified as non-underlying. The Group makes use of a leavers assumption for specific jurisdictions where these awards were granted to all staff and not only senior management. Significant actuarial assumptions for determination of the retirement benefit obligation are discount rate and expected salary increase.
