The Group also increased its investment in Zanbato, a Silicon Valley tech company whose mission is to create greater liquidity in private markets by developing a pioneering electronic Alternative Trading System, ZX, focused on providing exchange- like functionality to institutional trading of blocks of private securities. The Group also increased its investment in Zanbato, a Silicon Valley tech company whose mission is to create greater liquidity in private markets by developing a pioneering electronic Alternative Trading System, ZX, focused on providing exchange- like functionality to institutional trading of blocks of private securities. Good progress has been made in recruiting new independent Non-Executive Directors, reconstituting Committee memberships, appointing a Senior Independent Director, making sure that our Board is more diverse in its make-up and appointing the Company’s first General Counsel, who also acts as Secretary to the Board. Events are experiencing heightened security concerns and more disruption from extreme weather HOW WE ARE RESPONDING • We have launched new events and are focusing on areas of growth, for example launching Mining Cumbre, a Latin American mining investment event • In order to mitigate and manage risks, the Company’s event operations managers are required to complete a new rigorous online risk assessment COMMODITY PRICE INCREASE Dow Jones Commodity Index 4 350 450 550 650 750 2017 2016 2015 Sources: 1 NDR Multi-Cap Institutional (Universe), S&P Capital IQ and MSCI, Inc.

I believe our performance in 2017 shows that the strategy is working and we are slightly ahead of schedule. We have delivered a return to growth with both year-on-year revenue and profit ahead of 2016 though this included significant help from exchange rates. In May 2017 we announced a new, progressive dividend policy which aims to pay out approximately 40% of adjusted earnings each year. Our plans are built around these factors and we will continue investing for future growth while managing risk. This year we changed our approach to hiring people for senior roles, introducing a more formal, evidence-based process. ADVERTISING REVENUES are fees paid by customers to place an advertisement in one or more of our publications. We have reduced drag impact of underperforming businesses by £4m through the above sales and grown revenue in our Price Reporting & Analytics division to £57m with a 29% operating margin. Ensure we take advantage of Euromoney’s scale, share best practice, operate strategically and create career paths for staff across the Group. Consistent operating margin improvement is a business imperative, driven by investment choices, our focus on driving out costs and improving mix. We combined a range of online marketing tools to build customer awareness, share our expertise as thought-leaders and create an advisory service. To compliment this we launched a MiFID II microsite containing information for customers using webcasts, video, podcasts and online articles. Euromoney has developed the process of peer influence between banks as a powerful marketing tool through its Rival Advocacy™ system which improves customers’ net promoter scores. As an equal opportunity employer we seek to employ a workforce which reflects the diverse community at large. The Group endeavours to provide a working environment free from discrimination, victimisation or harassment and we will not accept behaviours which contradict this. This includes understanding why women make up a smaller proportion of senior staff compared to their representation at more junior levels. We have also started working with a recruitment firm that specialises in helping firms hire talented black, Asian and minority ethnic staff, particularly those near the start of their career. Our main offices are all located in central city locations which generally means staff travel to work by public transport. They did so with the support of local government and agencies who wanted to show that Miami remained open for business. Our colleagues in New York support a range of local charities through initiatives such as helping with meal preparations at the Bowery Mission, clothing drives for charities which provide disadvantaged men and women with professional office attire, hurricane relief fundraisers and volunteer work as part of Habitat for Humanity to rehabilitate a home in Battle Hill, New York. We will continue to focus on making the Group a place where people want to join and stay in part because we are an organisation where they can make a difference both inside and outside of the office by leading or participating in CSR activities that they care about. During 2017, the Directors have focused on maintaining headcount at a similar level to that in 2016, hiring new heads only where it was considered essential or for investment purposes. This differs to organically developed businesses where assets such as employee talent and customer relationships are not recognised on the balance sheet. To give a fair like-for-like comparison when calculating underlying growth, significant timing event differences are excluded from the year in which they were held. The register is put together following a Group-wide assessment of risks reported in its business risk registers (bottom-up approach). There are limited options to mitigate impact in the short and medium term from a significant cyclical downturn. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSAL FAILS TO GENERATE EXPECTED RETURNS • Active portfolio management means the Group continues to make strategic acquisitions and disposals • Significant growth has been M&A related, through both acquired profit and growth in acquired businesses • Failure to integrate may mean an acquired business does not generate the expected returns • Risk of impairment loss if an acquired business does not generate the expected returns • Disposal risks arise from failing to identify the time at which businesses should be sold or failing to achieve optimal price • Group strategy relies on successful recycling of capital and therefore M&A execution impacts core strategy Board’s view This risk will increase given the Group's strategy of increased M&A and portfolio management. The Strategic Report was approved by the Board of Directors on 22 November 2017 and signed on its behalf by Andrew Rashbass Chief Executive Officer Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC 39 Strategic report Euromoney AR2017 Strategic-Proof 6.indd 39 12/11/2017 12:13:57 PM PRICE REPORTING: COMPLIANCE AS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE Our price-reporting division uses compliance and standards to create competitive advantage. TAX AND TREASURY COMMITTEE MEETS TWICE A YEAR CHAIRED BY COLIN JONES Responsible for recommending policy to the Board. Its members are the CEO, Finance Director, Chief Information Officer, MD Corporate Development, General Counsel & Company Secretary and Head of Risk. However, their relationship with DMGT as a significant shareholder in the Company means they are not considered to be independent. This was conducted during the year and externally facilitated by Independent Audit Limited using their online assessment service.

We evaluated indicative offers from third parties where CGUs are held for sale and have therefore been valued on a fair value less cost of disposal basis. We identified four components in the UK, US and Canada that required a full scope audit due to their size. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £200,000 for the Group and Company audits (2016: £200,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. In order to comply with this presentation, the 2016 Income Statement disclosures have been re-presented separating continuing and discontinued operations (note 11).

The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements. In order to comply with this presentation, the 2016 Income Statement disclosures have been re-presented separating continuing and discontinued operations. Advertising revenues for 2016 have been restated by £1.3m to include consulting income which was previously reported as part of delegates revenue. Management determines the classification of its assets on initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date. Operating lease rentals are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis as allowed by IAS 17 ‘Leases’. Significant headroom was identified as a result of this calculation and is not sensitive to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions. The Group had been challenged on: whether certain business disposals should give rise to capital gains; a number of internal financing arrangements between different jurisdictions that give rise to asymmetrical tax outcomes; and whether tax deductions taken for costs arising within the Group’s treasury function are permissible. Management is confident that BCA will be able to overturn these reassessments through the normal litigation process, which has already begun. In order to comply with this presentation, the 2016 Income Statement disclosures have been re-presented separating continuing and discontinued operations (note 11). The Group is organised into four segments: Asset management; Pricing, data & market intelligence; Banking & finance; and Commodity events. In addition, advertising revenues for 2016 have been restated by £1.3m to include consulting income which was previously reported as part of delegates revenue.
