directors, reconstituting committee memberships, appointing a senior independent director, making sure that our board is more diverse in its make-up and appointing the company’s first general counsel, who also acts as secretary to the board. i look forward to watching the company go from strength-to-strength and becoming a 3.0 information business. key market drivers 1. recovery in the banking

across the group helping achieve a return to growth the strategy is working an ar ity aa o u andrew rashbass chief executive officer overview at the investor day in march 2016 we said that 2017 would be a year of transition. i believe our performance in 2017 shows that the strategy is working and we are slightly ahead of schedule. we have delivered a return to growth with both year-on-year revenue and profit ahead of 2016 though this included significant help from exchange rates. we have also made good progress fixing structurally challenged businesses and returning them to growth. in may 2017 we announced a new, progressive dividend policy which aims to pay out approximately 40% of adjusted earnings each year. this quadrant-based assessment leads to three pillars of strategic activity: 1. investing around the big themes. in response to the challenges in our asset management segment (bca, ndr and institutional investor) due to mifid ii and the shift from active to passive investing, our product development is geared to growing segments of the market: • bca is developing new products targeting passive, specialist and alternative investments • ndr is providing tools for registered investment advisors (rias) • ii is launching new products targeting defined contribution pensions, rias and the private wealth sector how information markets are evolving we characterise the business models of b2b information companies into three generations, which we call b2b information 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0. their characteristics are set out below. print stand-alone events monologue

disinvest • maximise shorter-term profit and cash • divest • prevent future build-up 2 use the time wisely • modest investment to move to top-right quadrant • maximise shorter-term profit and cash • fix any operational deficit • consider divestment cycle structure in our pricing, data & market intelligence segment, we are investing in technology, sales, product management and in developing our people across price reporting, insurance and telecoms among other areas. these are good businesses, but ones which we believe may fit another owner’s strategy better. if sold this would give us the opportunity to recycle more capital towards our big themes. these results demonstrate our ability to both invest for growth and manage the business effectively. our plans are built around these factors and we will continue investing for future growth while managing risk. andrew rashbass chief executive officer 22 november 2017 £106.5m adjusted proﬁt before tax £40.7 m statutory proﬁt before

pm group management board the group manages a portfolio of b2b businesses across four segments: asset management; pricing, data & market intelligence; banking & finance; and commodity events. this year we changed our approach to hiring people for senior roles, introducing a more formal, evidence-based process. sponsorship revenues are fees paid by customers to sponsor or be associated with an event. advertising revenues are fees paid by customers to place an advertisement in one or more of our publications. this determines our big themes which include price discovery, post-trade activities, asset management and telecoms. 3 actively manage the portfolio acquisitions have always been, and remain, an important part of euromoney’s strategy. this determines our big themes which include price discovery, post-trade activities, asset management and telecoms. we have reduced drag impact of underperforming businesses by £4m through the above sales and grown revenue in our price reporting & analytics division to £57m with a 29% operating margin. ensure we take advantage of euromoney’s scale, share best practice, operate strategically and create career paths for staff across the group. consistent operating margin improvement is a business imperative, driven by investment choices, our focus on driving out costs and improving mix. this kpi measures the percentage by which cash generated from operations covers adjusted operating profit. its main brands include bca, ned davis research (ndr) and the institutional investor family of businesses. total revenue by type (%) bca: helping our customers to navigate mifid ii bca embarked on a digital and multi-channel engagement programme to help inform its customers about the likely impact of mifid ii which comes into force in january 2018. we combined a range of online marketing tools to build customer awareness, share our expertise as thought-leaders and create an advisory service. to compliment this we launched a mifid ii microsite containing information for customers using webcasts, video, podcasts and online articles. we have also created an online assessment tool for our customers to measure their mifid ii readiness. these investments have been responsible for airfinance journal’s strong trading, ahead of our investment case. euromoney has developed the process of peer influence between banks as a powerful marketing tool through its rival advocacy™ system which improves customers’ net promoter scores. at coaltrans asia, our hallmark event, over 800 coal professionals gathered for two days of networking and deal-making. as an equal opportunity employer we seek to employ a workforce which reflects the diverse community at large. the group endeavours to provide a working environment free from discrimination, victimisation or harassment and we will not accept behaviours which contradict this. this includes understanding why women make up a smaller proportion of senior staff compared to their representation at more junior levels. we have started a pilot to focus on developing careers of high-potential women in the company. we have also started working with a recruitment firm that specialises in helping firms hire talented black, asian and minority ethnic staff, particularly those near the start of their career. our main offices are all located in central city locations which generally means staff travel to work by public transport. our staff give their time generously to support a wide range of projects across the globe. they did so with the support of local government and agencies who wanted to show that miami remained open for business. over the year we have continued our work with tsf, afghan connection, amref/orbis and haven house. our colleagues in new york support a range of local charities through initiatives such as helping with meal preparations at the bowery mission, clothing drives for charities which provide disadvantaged men and women with professional office attire, hurricane relief fundraisers and volunteer work as part of habitat for humanity to rehabilitate a home in battle hill, new york. we will continue to focus on making the group a place where people want to join and stay in part because we are an organisation where they can make a difference both inside and outside of the office by leading or participating in csr activities that they care about. however, its performance remains weak and declined by 8% year-on-year; but it now only represents 10% of total revenue. adjusted profit before tax increased by 4% to £106.5m, with increased financing costs following the share buyback partly offset by an improvement in adjusted profits from the group’s equity interest in associates and joint ventures, principally dealogic. exceptional items 2017 2016 £m £m profit on disposal 2.9 7.1 impairment charges (29.7) (28.8) release of /(provision) for overseas sales tax 3.9 (7.9) restructuring and other exceptional costs (8.4) (7.7) continuing operations (31.3) (37.3) discontinued operations (2.4) – total (33.7) (37.3) the group recognised a £29.7m impairment charge mostly in relation to one of its large asset management businesses, ndr, following its disappointing financial performance in the face of tough market conditions and management changes in the first half. acquisition costs for smaller transactions have not been treated as exceptional consistent with the group's policy. the group also translate its non-sterling denominated balance sheet items resulting in a loss of £0.4m (2016: £1.9m gain). during 2017, the directors have focused on maintaining headcount at a similar level to that in 2016, hiring new heads only where it was considered essential or for investment purposes. this differs to organically developed businesses where assets such as employee talent and customer relationships are not recognised on the balance sheet. impairment and amortisation of intangible assets and goodwill arising on acquisitions are excluded from adjusted results as they are balance sheet items that relate to historical m&a activity rather than the trading performance of the business. to give a fair like-for-like comparison when calculating underlying growth, significant timing event differences are excluded from the year in which they were held. the register is put together following a group-wide assessment of risks reported in its business risk registers (bottom-up approach). the group registers its risks based on a residual risk rating after taking account of mitigating controls. there are limited options to mitigate impact in the short and medium term from a significant cyclical downturn. • the group actively manages cyclical risk through its strategic framework • a comprehensive risk review by the group of its asset management businesses resulting in output including detailed mitigation plans for each business and continuous tracking of effective risk management • the group operates in many geographical markets • some diversification in sector mix • ability to cut some costs temporarily and quickly • events can be switched to better performing regions risk tolerant prior years (relative position) 2016: risk tolerant 2015: risk tolerant 2014: risk tolerant post-mitigation risk trend increasing description of risk change global economic and geopolitical uncertainty is increasing following the us election, limited progress of brexit negotiations and disruption in a sector with concentrated group revenues 1 3 product and market transformation/disruption (structural change) • competition from existing competitors, new disruptive players and new entrants • new technologies change how customers access and use our products • changing demographics can affect customer needs and opportunities • structural pressure on customer business models will affect demand for the group’s products and services particularly in financial services • new regulations such as mifid ii creating both challenges and opportunities in asset management sector • free content available via the internet increases the threat to paid subscription model • lower barriers to entry for new entrants • inability to acquire the types of assets that the group's strategy requires board’s view high-quality controls are in place but exposure to this risk cannot be entirely mitigated. acquisition or disposal fails to generate expected returns • active portfolio management means the group continues to make strategic acquisitions and disposals • significant growth has been m&a related, through both acquired profit and growth in acquired businesses • failure to integrate may mean an acquired business does not generate the expected returns • risk of impairment loss if an acquired business does not generate the expected returns • disposal risks arise from failing to identify the time at which businesses should be sold or failing to achieve optimal price • group strategy relies on successful recycling of capital and therefore m&a execution impacts core strategy board’s view this risk will increase given the group's strategy of increased m&a and portfolio management. the strategic report was approved by the board of directors on 22 november 2017 and signed on its behalf by andrew rashbass chief executive officer euromoney

accounting policies general information euromoney institutional investor plc (the ‘company’) is a public company limited by shares and incorporated in england and wales, united kingdom (uk). the accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these group financial statements. in order to comply with this presentation, the 2016 income statement disclosures have been re-presented separating continuing and discontinued operations. advertising revenues for 2016 have been restated by £1.3m to include consulting income which was previously reported as part of delegates revenue. any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and may not subsequently be reversed. amortisation amortisation of intangible assets is provided on a reducing balance basis or straight-line basis as appropriate over their expected useful lives as follows: trademarks and brands 5 – 30 years customer relationships 1 – 16 years databases 1 – 22 years licences and software 3 – 5 years euromoney institutional investor plc 93 financial statements euromoney ar2017 financials-proof 6.indd 93 12/11/2017 11:57:27 am 25610 – 11 december 2017 11:43 am – proof 5 notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 accounting policies continued impairment of non-financial assets assets that have an indefinite useful life – for example, goodwill or intangible assets not ready to use – are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. management determines the classification of its assets on initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date. deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis as allowed by ias 17 ‘leases’. 2 key judgemental areas adopted in preparing these ﬁnancial statements in determining and applying accounting policies, judgement is often required in respect of items where the choice of specific policy, accounting estimate or assumption to be followed could materially affect the reported results or net asset position of the group should it later be determined that a different choice would have been more appropriate. the methodology applied to dealogic’s value in use calculation was based on post-tax cash flows using dealogic’s board approved budget for 2017 to 2021, a post-tax discount rate of 9% and a long-term nominal growth rate of 2%. significant headroom was identified as a result of this calculation and is not sensitive to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions. the group proactively manages this risk and has a transfer pricing policy in place for intercompany transactions. the group had been challenged on: whether certain business disposals should give rise to capital gains; a number of internal financing arrangements between different jurisdictions that give rise to asymmetrical tax outcomes; and whether tax deductions taken for costs arising within the group’s treasury function are permissible. management is confident that bca will be able to overturn these reassessments through the normal litigation process, which has already begun. in order to comply with this presentation, the 2016 income statement disclosures have been re-presented separating continuing and discontinued operations (note 11). the group is organised into four segments: asset management; pricing, data & market intelligence; banking & finance; and commodity events. in addition, advertising revenues for 2016 have been restated by £1.3m to include consulting income which was previously reported as part of delegates revenue. euromoney institutional investor plc 101 financial statements euromoney ar2017 financials-proof 6.indd 101
