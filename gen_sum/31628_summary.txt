share: 76.4p dividend: 30.6p total revenue: £428.4m operational highlights 1 strategy on track in a year of transition we launched our revised strategy in march 2016 and highlighted that 2017 would be a year of transition. the group also increased its investment in zanbato, a silicon valley tech company whose mission is to create greater liquidity in private markets by developing a pioneering electronic alternative trading system, zx, focused on providing exchange- like functionality to institutional trading of blocks of private securities. the group also increased its investment in zanbato, a silicon valley tech company whose mission is to create greater liquidity in private markets by developing a pioneering electronic alternative trading system, zx, focused on providing exchange- like functionality to institutional trading of blocks of private securities. we have delivered a return to growth with both year-on-year revenue and profit ahead of 2016 though this included significant help from exchange rates. in may 2017 we announced a new, progressive dividend policy which aims to pay out approximately 40% of adjusted earnings each year. we have reduced drag impact of underperforming businesses by £4m through the above sales and grown revenue in our price reporting & analytics division to £57m with a 29% operating margin. ensure we take advantage of euromoney’s scale, share best practice, operate strategically and create career paths for staff across the group. consistent operating margin improvement is a business imperative, driven by investment choices, our focus on driving out costs and improving mix. to compliment this we launched a mifid ii microsite containing information for customers using webcasts, video, podcasts and online articles. euromoney has developed the process of peer influence between banks as a powerful marketing tool through its rival advocacy™ system which improves customers’ net promoter scores. the group endeavours to provide a working environment free from discrimination, victimisation or harassment and we will not accept behaviours which contradict this. this includes understanding why women make up a smaller proportion of senior staff compared to their representation at more junior levels. we have also started working with a recruitment firm that specialises in helping firms hire talented black, asian and minority ethnic staff, particularly those near the start of their career. our main offices are all located in central city locations which generally means staff travel to work by public transport. they did so with the support of local government and agencies who wanted to show that miami remained open for business. our colleagues in new york support a range of local charities through initiatives such as helping with meal preparations at the bowery mission, clothing drives for charities which provide disadvantaged men and women with professional office attire, hurricane relief fundraisers and volunteer work as part of habitat for humanity to rehabilitate a home in battle hill, new york. we will continue to focus on making the group a place where people want to join and stay in part because we are an organisation where they can make a difference both inside and outside of the office by leading or participating in csr activities that they care about. during 2017, the directors have focused on maintaining headcount at a similar level to that in 2016, hiring new heads only where it was considered essential or for investment purposes. this differs to organically developed businesses where assets such as employee talent and customer relationships are not recognised on the balance sheet. to give a fair like-for-like comparison when calculating underlying growth, significant timing event differences are excluded from the year in which they were held. the strategic report was approved by the board of directors on 22 november 2017 and signed on its behalf by andrew rashbass chief executive officer euromoney institutional investor plc 39 strategic report euromoney ar2017 strategic-proof 6.indd 39 12/11/2017 12:13:57 pm price reporting: compliance as a competitive advantage our price-reporting division uses compliance and standards to create competitive advantage. its members are the ceo, finance director, chief information officer, md corporate development, general counsel & company secretary and head of risk. however, their relationship with dmgt as a significant shareholder in the company means they are not considered to be independent. additional disclosures additional information that is relevant to this report, and which is incorporated by reference into this report, including information required in accordance with the uk companies act 2006 and listing rule 9.8.4r, can be located as follows: • financial instruments (note 19) • related party transactions (note 29) greenhouse gas (ghg) reporting the group participates in a carbon footprint analysis completed by icf international. if the remuneration committee determines so, an alternative performance period may be applied (with a minimum of at least three years). salaries will be reviewed in april 2018. pensions and benefits no change to prior year for andrew rashbass or colin jones. we evaluated indicative offers from third parties where cgus are held for sale and have therefore been valued on a fair value less cost of disposal basis. we identified four components in the uk, us and canada that required a full scope audit due to their size. in order to comply with this presentation, the 2016 income statement disclosures have been re-presented separating continuing and discontinued operations (note 11). annual report and accounts 2017 84

2016 have been restated by £1.3m to include consulting income which was previously reported as part of delegates revenue. significant headroom was identified as a result of this calculation and is not sensitive to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions. the group had been challenged on: whether certain business disposals should give rise to capital gains; a number of internal financing arrangements between different jurisdictions that give rise to asymmetrical tax outcomes; and whether tax deductions taken for costs arising within the group’s treasury function are permissible. management is confident that bca will be able to overturn these reassessments through the normal litigation process, which has already begun. in order to comply with this presentation, the 2016 income statement disclosures have been re-presented separating continuing and discontinued operations (note 11). in addition, advertising revenues for 2016 have been restated by £1.3m to include consulting income which was previously reported as part of delegates revenue. trade receivables beyond 60 days overdue are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods and services, determined by reference to past default experience. the remaining loan notes were redeemed in full on 30 december 2016. annual report and accounts 2017 126 euromoney ar2017 financials-proof
