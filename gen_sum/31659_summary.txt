Barry Gamble Chairman 13 December 2017 LightwaveRF plc Strategic report Chief executive’s report for the year ended 30 September 2017 ________________________________________________________________________________ - 6 - Introduction 2017 has seen strong progress for Lightwave, with advances in, technology, products, marketing, sales and distribution. In addition to product description and guides, the website now offers full online ordering. We are now using various digital marketing techniques to generate direct sales demand, build market awareness and develop the Lightwave brand. This is supported by media relations programmes to secure coverage in both specialist and generalist outlets. A growing proportion of our sales are being made directly to consumers. As the smart home market becomes faster moving, we are seeing shorter lead times for orders and direct consumer sales have no order component. Key Performance Indicators The Group monitors revenue, gross margin, operating cash and also uses the following key indicators to measure the performance of the business in terms of progress against key strategic objectives; 2017 2016 Global installations 46,000 40,000 Connected devices 400,000 300,000 Monthly temperature and energy data points -UK customers 63 million 52 million Investment in research and development £million £ million • Expensed 0.19 0.10 • Capitalised 0.69 0.51 0.88 0.61 LightwaveRF plc Strategic report Chief executive’s report (continued) for the year ended 30 September 2017 ________________________________________________________________________________ - 8 - Strategy We continue to believe there is an opportunity for a UK Company that offers a wide and deep range of integrated smart home solutions to achieve significant scale. The competitive environment remains broadly the same as it has done for some time, in that gadgets, single device and single market segment solutions prevail, while we offer a distinctive, stylish and affordable smart home experience.

28 - 1. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis. ii) Basis of consolidation Where the company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. Intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are therefore eliminated in full. Depreciation is provided for at 33% per annum straight line on all items of property, plant and equipment so as to write off their carrying values over their useful economic lives. The Group has not classified any of its financial assets held to maturity. The Group’s accounting policy for each category is as follows: Trade and other receivables These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. For trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Costs principally comprise of materials and bringing them to their present location. Research and development Research and development tax credits are recognised on qualifying expenditure that meets the criteria set out by HMRC guidance in period in which the associated expenditure is incurred. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. GENERAL INFORMATION (continued) b) ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) xii) Convertible debt The proceeds received on issue of the Group and Company’s convertible debt are allocated into their liability and equity components. xiii) Extinguishing financial liabilities with shares When shares are issued to extinguish all or part of a financial liability, they are recognised initially at their fair value at the date of issue. Capitalised platform software development costs are amortised on completion of specific projects. The amortisation period will be monitored and re-assessed as the platform and products evolve although it is anticipated to be a period of three years on a straight line basis. The value of intangible assets has been reviewed for impairment and no provision is required; • Research and development tax credits are calculated using HMRC guidance regarding cash recoverable for research and development expenditure surrendered; • Intercompany loans have been reviewed for impairment using future estimated cash flows. There will only be three categories of financial assets whereby financial assets are recognised at either fair value through profit and loss, fair value through other comprehensive income or measured at amortised cost. IFRS 16 – Leases The standard is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, (and can be applied before that date if the Company also applies IFRS 15 revenue from Contracts with Customers). Average number of employees The average monthly number of employees was as follows: Group Group 2017 2016 Directors 6 5 Administrative 18 11 24 16 Pensions On 1 October 2016, the Company introduced a work place pension scheme in line with government legislation. The Group has a potential deferred tax liability in respect of timing differences on costs capitalised in respect of Research and Development however given the level of unutilised trading losses carried forward, against which no deferred tax asset has been recognised, no deferred tax liability has been recognised in the financial statements.

There is no effect on profit and loss as the balance was already fully provided for. The directors consider these balances fully recoverable and no impairment is necessary. Under this scheme 360,000 of options are exercisable three years from grant and 600,000 options are exercisable three years from grant if the market price of the shares meets or exceeds 80 pence per share. The amount recognised as a charge in respect of share-based payments was £18,918 (2016: £28,817). The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales and purchases from overseas suppliers. The Group does not use currency derivatives to hedge future transactions or cash flows. It is Group policy to assess the credit risk of new customers before entering contracts. For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum “AA” rating are accepted. The Directors regularly review both short and medium term forecasts to achieve this.
