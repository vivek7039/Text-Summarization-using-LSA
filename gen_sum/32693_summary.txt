competitors where we can rapidly integrate them into our supply chain makes bolt-on acquisitions highly attractive. $90bn the facilities supply market in the usa is highly fragmented and estimated to be worth circa $90 billion 05 what makes ferguson a great business we offer our customers unrivalled scale our highly efficient national logistics and distribution network enables us to achieve volume discounts from suppliers and the highest levels of availability for our customers on a broad range of products. t rainees follow a speciﬁed curriculum which aims to accelerate their knowledge of

makes ferguson a great business we use technology to give customers choice and ﬂexibility e-commerce has grown rapidly with 22 per cent of revenue in the usa now generated online. this included an

performance measures (“apms”), which are not deﬁned or speciﬁed under international financial reporting standards (“ifrs”), to provide additional helpful information. ongoing is an apm and excludes businesses that have been closed, disposed of or held for sale. in particular, his tenure as chief executive for the last eight years has been outstanding, achieving sustained rapid growth and record trading margins. we continue to meet these disclosure requirements, monitor developments and adopt best practice in corporate governance. continued strategic development i am pleased to report a good ﬁnancial performance in 2016/17 with all of our ongoing businesses ahead of last year and a particularly pleasing result in the usa where we achieved good trading proﬁt growth. group revenue was 6.0 per cent ahead of last year on a like-for-like basis at £14,878 million group chief executive’s review * like-for-like revenue growth and growth at constant exchange rates are apms, see note 2 on pages 91 and 92 for further information. highlights this year include excellent growth in our e-commerce businesses which now generates 20 per cent of group revenue. 18 ferguson plc annual report and accounts 2017 group chief executive’s review continued 20% e-commerce now accounts for 20 per cent of group revenue at £3 billion we operate in large fragmented markets with strong growth characteristics the usa continues to be our largest market with the greatest opportunities for growth. housing transactions existing single family home sales continue to grow while remaining signiﬁcantly below the previous peak. there is a strong correlation between consumer conﬁdence and levels of activities in our markets. there is high demand for repairs, maintenance and improvement in the large installed base of existing homes. professional contractors typically operate within about 20 miles of a local branch and may visit it several times per week. in addition to visiting branches, they are now using digital channels which complement their working patterns. they deliver excellent customer service, develop strong relationships, maximise operational efficiencies and accelerate the adoption of new operating models. additionally, we have seen a number of internal succession appointments within the usa to leadership positions. pages 13 and 18 talent development this year we will welcome 400 college graduates to our business in the usa. over the past year new incentive programmes have been re-developed in each business for branch and sales associates to ensure that high performance is well rewarded. over the past ﬁve years our scores have consistently exceeded 75 per cent which is well above industry averages. our levels of associate engagement in the usa remain strong although lower than last year. in our uk business, where signiﬁcant change is underway, associate engagement survey scores have remained constant whilst participation has risen to over 70 per cent. diversity and inclusion we want access to the best talent irrespective of gender, race, orientation or background. the group collision rate improved in 2016/17 following an in-depth driver risk assessment and control improvements. kate was recently recognised by supply house times as one of the top women in industry for her achievements. customers of build.com in the usa can ﬁlter their product search to view products with recognised national environmental labels. all of our businesses provide training for relevant associates on anti-corruption, anti-trust and modern slavery matters. our insurers also support these efforts, undertaking their own safety assessments at selected key sites each year. our customers rely upon us for prompt and ﬂexible delivery options to meet their own needs. the system allows for monitoring of driver behaviours to mitigate speeding, excessive idling and harsh acceleration or braking. besides supporting more efficient driving behaviours and optimising fuel consumption this also serves to increase the safety of our driver population. this is in line with our investment case and long-term objective of generating attractive returns on capital. 84.5% 77.4% 2016 1 2017 1. a new methodology using an annual associate wide survey rather than more frequent pulse surveys, was launched in 2016. it provides new functionality and solutions that will help customers run their businesses more effectively. there are improved product lists and a quotation centre where customers can store their quotes, with improvements in quote-to-order functionality. we aim to have the best transactional e-commerce capability in our industry which is increasingly becoming a competitive advantage over smaller regional competitors. key strategic report governance financials other information 31 ferguson plc annual report and accounts 2017 operating performance our business in the usa grew revenue 7.1 per cent on a like-for-like basis which included price deﬂation of 0.5 per cent principally due to falling commodity prices in the ﬁrst half. online ordering is a valuable sales order channel for our customers, giving them greater ﬂexibility. since the year end we have acquired two more b2c businesses, ac wholesalers and supply.com which generate £86 million of annualised revenue. these branches are served by six distribution centres providing same and next day product availability, a key service offering to our customers. it operates under the wolseley brand with a number of smaller brands including william wilson and soak.com. it is referenced when further information on these topics can be found elsewhere in this report. an uncompetitive remuneration programme could impact our ability to attract and retain the best people. low associate engagement can lead to sub-optimal business results and poor retention of our people. our principal risks relate to manual handling, working at height, the use of motorised equipment and vehicle collisions. a commitment to high ethical standards strengthens our reputation with customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. the business is exposed to risks of bribery and fraud, which can damage our reputation. for more detail on how we are managing the risk, see page 47. working with reputable suppliers gives our stakeholders conﬁdence in the integrity of our supply chain, including standards around ethical labour, modern slavery, conﬂict minerals and anti-bribery and corruption. there is increasing focus on supply chain transparency due to the risk of business interruption or reputational harm. growth opportunities can be missed if we do not adapt to our customers’ changing product needs. robust systems and processes together with an informed workforce allow us to protect our sensitive or commercial data. a small percentage of the group’s own label products are sourced from other regions, principally in asia. the businesses continue to screen their highest risk entities (based on spend value, geographical location and business type). for example, customers of our online business build.com can ﬁlter their product search to view products with recognised national environmental labels. other exceptional items include an £11 million curtailment gain relating to the uk deﬁned beneﬁt pension plan. strategic report governance financials other information 39 ferguson plc annual report and accounts 2017 the ongoing effective tax rate is expected to remain at approximately 28 per cent next year although this could increase or decrease signiﬁcantly depending on the ﬁnal outcome of us tax reform changes. the group does not hedge this exposure as any earnings hedges have only a temporary effect. the uk pension plan was subject to a triennial valuation in april 2016 which has now been ﬁnalised. liquidity the group maintains sufficient borrowing facilities to ﬁnance all investment and capital expenditure included in its strategic plan with an additional margin for contingencies. throughout the year, information is provided directly from front line operations, via corporate functions and independent audits. furthermore, the group’s principal risks are ongoing in nature and could materialise at any time. a new non executive director, nadia shouraboura, joined the board, bringing experience of large international e-commerce businesses. the development of new business models in our market place is closely evaluated – both for investment potential and threats. there is a risk that the group may not identify or respond effectively to changes in these factors. this was achieved by driving the beneﬁts of scale in sourcing, growing own label sales and through good pricing discipline. the performance of each business unit is closely monitored and corrective action taken when appropriate. these digital assets are threatened by sophisticated security threats, including hacking, viruses, “phishing” or inadvertent errors. these technology systems, on which our branches, distribution centres and e-commerce businesses rely, may be disrupted for several hours or days. as a result, ferguson could forego revenue or proﬁt margins if we are unable to trade. external specialists are also employed as appropriate to test the security of our technology systems, e.g. penetration tests. particular focus is being placed on quality control and assurance procedures to support the successful growth of own label sales. contracting procedures are continuously reviewed and improved against a “good practice” framework used by all ferguson businesses. these changes are underway in all of our key markets, especially the uk, and will continue for several years. mitigation all of the group’s businesses have established performance management and succession planning procedures. organisational and talent reviews are conducted quarterly by the group hr director with each business. i also note with interest the uk government’s proposals for corporate governance reform published in august 2017 . i also chair two other listed companies and this is speciﬁcally taken into account in the evaluation. mr powell, a chartered management accountant, joined the company on 1 june 2017 as group chief financial officer. prior to that he spent 15 years at pilkington plc in a variety of operational and ﬁnance roles. ms bamford has broad business experience having held senior advisory roles in both the uk and usa across a range of sectors. other principal appointments consultant at spencer stuart and a non executive director of barratt developments plc. john daly independent non executive director a n r year of appointment 2014 key strengths and experience considerable

has served for six years or less with the exception of tessa bamford. during the year, active dialogue was maintained with our shareholders through planned communications and annual investor relations programmes. in addition to me, alan murray and pilar lópez have served as chief financial officers of large businesses during their career. following his appointment as group chief financial officer on 1 june 2017, mike powell also attended and received papers for the july committee meeting. deloitte’s 2016/17 external audit plan has been successfully completed at the date of this report. these systems can only provide reasonable, but no absolute, assurance that risks are managed to an acceptable level. the committee received reports at each committee meeting providing details of matters reported through the group’s international conﬁdential telephone reporting lines and secure website reporting facility, which are operated on its behalf by an independent third party. risks relating to material joint ventures and associates are considered as part of this process. the group’s internal control systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate business risk. he has given outstanding service to the group over 23 years and i wish him well in his retirement. her considerable expertise in running complex logistics and supply chain activities will be invaluable to us. all those directors who have been in office for three years or more since their last appointment shall retire at that agm. a european works council (“ewc”) has been operating since 1996 to provide a forum for informing and consulting employees in europe on such matters as signiﬁcant developments in the group’s operations, management’s plans and organisational changes within the group. this directors’ remuneration report complies with the regulations as they would apply if we were a uk incorporated company. the committee agreed to exercise its discretion to treat frank roach as a “good leaver” for his unvested esop and ltip awards, in view of his leaving ferguson through retirement, and he will receive no severance payments. canadian performance also improved in 2016/17 , whilst the uk continues to progress with its transformation programme. it is intended that awards under the 2015 l tip will be made to executive directors during 2017/18. shares or awards must be retained for two

information is available for some of the judgemental areas. some of the group’s operating lease arrangements have renewal options and rental escalation clauses. provision is made if, on the basis of current information and professional advice, liabilities are considered likely to arise. group companies have also made contractual commitments for certain property and other obligations which could be called upon in an event of default. as at the date of this report, there are no signiﬁcant outstanding claims in relation to business disposals. rebates relating to the purchase of goods for resale are accrued as earned and are recorded initially as a deduction in inventory with a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold. trade receivables are written off against the provision when recoverability is assessed as being remote. deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt or loss. the group recognises liabilities for anticipated or actual tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. the fair value of ﬁnancial instruments that are not traded in an active market (such as over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. liquidity risk the group maintains a policy of ensuring sufficient borrowing headroom to ﬁnance all investment and capital expenditure included in its strategic plan, with an additional contingent safety margin. within each country it operates, the group does not have signiﬁcant transactional foreign currency cash ﬂow exposures. however, those that do arise may be hedged with either forward contracts or currency options. the group does not normally hedge proﬁt translation exposure since such hedges have only a temporary effect. with effect from 1 december 2011, interest rate swap contracts comprising ﬁxed interest receivable on an original notional principal of us$729 million and as at 31 july 2017, residual contracts of us$438 million have been classiﬁed as held at fair value through proﬁt and loss. there is an associated risk that customers may not be able to pay outstanding balances. each of the group’s businesses have established procedures in place to review and collect outstanding receivables. this risk is managed by setting credit and settlement limits for a panel of approved counterparties. currently, the plan has a relatively balanced investment in equity securities, debt instruments and property. the vesting period is typically three years and there are no performance measures other than retained employment. summary of our audit approach key audit matters the key risks that we identiﬁed in the current year were: – appropriateness of supplier rebates; – inventory provision for slow-moving and obsolete inventory; and – accounting for restructuring costs. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the ﬁnancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. key observations we consider the group’s provisioning methodology to be prudent when compared with historical levels of inventory write-offs. federal tax is levied on proﬁts in the year subject to any participation exemption for qualifying dividends from subsidiaries. 11 – contingent liabilities provision is made for the directors’ best estimate of known claims and legal actions in progress. unless otherwise noted, the share capital comprises ordinary shares which are indirectly held by ferguson plc. for further information please contact the adr depositary: deutsche bank trust
