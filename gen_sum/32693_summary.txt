Acquiring regional or local competitors where we can rapidly integrate them into our supply chain makes bolt-on acquisitions highly attractive. T rainees follow a speciﬁed curriculum which aims to accelerate their knowledge of products, business systems, sales processes, industry standards and safety regulations while learning about our culture. This included an increase in system-to-system integration that creates many efficiencies for our customers including placing orders and managing their accounts online. £15,22 4m Revenue +21.3% 29.0% Gross margin* +0.4% £1,180m Proﬁt before tax +7 4.8% 353.4p Continuing basic earnings per share +92.8% 288.9p Headline earnings per share* +23.1% 110p Ordinary dividend +10.0% £14,878m Revenue* +22.5% 28.9% Gross margin* +0.4% £1,032m Trading proﬁt* +24.8% * The Group uses Alternative Performance Measures (“APMs”), which are not deﬁned or speciﬁed under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), to provide additional helpful information. In particular, his tenure as Chief Executive for the last eight years has been outstanding, achieving sustained rapid growth and record trading margins. Highlights this year include excellent growth in our e-commerce businesses which now generates 20 per cent of Group revenue. 18 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Group Chief Executive’s review continued 20% E-commerce now accounts for 20 per cent of Group revenue at £3 billion We operate in large fragmented markets with strong growth characteristics The USA continues to be our largest market with the greatest opportunities for growth. Professional contractors typically operate within about 20 miles of a local branch and may visit it several times per week. They deliver excellent customer service, develop strong relationships, maximise operational efficiencies and accelerate the adoption of new operating models. Over the past year new incentive programmes have been re-developed in each business for branch and sales associates to ensure that high performance is well rewarded. Over the past ﬁve years our scores have consistently exceeded 75 per cent which is well above industry averages. In our UK business, where signiﬁcant change is underway, associate engagement survey scores have remained constant whilst participation has risen to over 70 per cent. Kate was recently recognised by Supply House Times as one of the top women in Industry for her achievements. Customers of Build.com in the USA can ﬁlter their product search to view products with recognised national environmental labels. E-commerce accounts for £3 billion (20 per cent) of the Group’s revenue and our customer facing channels to market are mentioned on page 24. The system allows for monitoring of driver behaviours to mitigate speeding, excessive idling and harsh acceleration or braking. Besides supporting more efficient driving behaviours and optimising fuel consumption this also serves to increase the safety of our driver population. There are improved product lists and a quotation centre where customers can store their quotes, with improvements in quote-to-order functionality. We aim to have the best transactional e-commerce capability in our industry which is increasingly becoming a competitive advantage over smaller regional competitors. Key Strategic report Governance Financials Other information 31 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Operating performance Our business in the USA grew revenue 7.1 per cent on a like-for-like basis which included price deﬂation of 0.5 per cent principally due to falling commodity prices in the ﬁrst half. Since the year end we have acquired two more B2C businesses, AC Wholesalers and Supply.com which generate £86 million of annualised revenue. These branches are served by six distribution centres providing same and next day product availability, a key service offering to our customers. Our principal risks relate to manual handling, working at height, the use of motorised equipment and vehicle collisions. Robust systems and processes together with an informed workforce allow us to protect our sensitive or commercial data. The businesses continue to screen their highest risk entities (based on spend value, geographical location and business type). For example, customers of our online business Build.com can ﬁlter their product search to view products with recognised national environmental labels. Liquidity The Group maintains sufficient borrowing facilities to ﬁnance all investment and capital expenditure included in its strategic plan with an additional margin for contingencies. The development of new business models in our market place is closely evaluated – both for investment potential and threats. There is a risk that the Group may not identify or respond effectively to changes in these factors. This was achieved by driving the beneﬁts of scale in sourcing, growing own label sales and through good pricing discipline. These technology systems, on which our branches, distribution centres and e-commerce businesses rely, may be disrupted for several hours or days. Particular focus is being placed on quality control and assurance procedures to support the successful growth of own label sales. These changes are underway in all of our key markets, especially the UK, and will continue for several years. Mr Keltner was not a Director but attended all Board meetings in his capacity as Interim Chief Financial Officer. Ms Bamford has broad business experience having held senior advisory roles in both the UK and USA across a range of sectors. Mr Daly undertook various executive leadership positions during a 20-year career at British American Tobacco Plc (“BAT”), running large international businesses. Prior to his time with BAT, Mr Daly was Managing Director of Rothmans International’s Japan and South Korea businesses. In addition to me, Alan Murray and Pilar López have served as Chief Financial Officers of large businesses during their career. Following his appointment as Group Chief Financial Officer on 1 June 2017, Mike Powell also attended and received papers for the July Committee meeting. These systems can only provide reasonable, but no absolute, assurance that risks are managed to an acceptable level. All those Directors who have been in office for three years or more since their last appointment shall retire at that AGM. This Directors’ Remuneration Report complies with the Regulations as they would apply if we were a UK incorporated company. For the Group CFO and CEO, USA, as detailed above, their salaries will not be reviewed until 1 August 2018. Shares or awards must be retained for two years post vesting if shareholding target has not been met. Those who attend by invitation do not participate in discussions that relate to the details of their own remuneration. During the year ended 31 July 2017, John Martin, Mike Powell and Ian Meakins received salary supplements in lieu of Group pension scheme membership. Mike Powell was appointed Group Chief Financial Officer on 1 June 2017 and received two months’ annual bonus for the year ended 31 July 2017. Following a review, the Committee considers that Executive Directors’ personal objectives for 2015/16 are no longer commercially sensitive and has approved their disclosure. Once met, the target is only increased annually in line with base salary or fee increases, if any. Details of performance conditions for awards which were granted during the year are set out on pages 78 and 79. Ian Meakins served as Group Chief Executive Officer for one month during the year until his retirement on 31 August 2016. Details of the share buyback programme to be commenced in 2017/18 are not included as no shares were purchased during 2016/17. 86 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Group income statement Year ended 31 July 2017 Notes 2017 £m Restated 2016 £m Proﬁt for the year 783 650 Other comprehensive income: Items that may be reclassiﬁed subsequently to proﬁt or loss: Exchange gain on translation of overseas operations (a) 26 495 Exchange loss on translation of borrowings and derivatives designated as hedges of overseas operations (a) (6) (107) Cumulative currency translation differences on disposals (a) (49) (125) Tax credit/(charge) on items that may be reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss (b) 7 1 (7) Items that will not be reclassiﬁed subsequently to proﬁt or loss: Actuarial loss on retirement beneﬁt plans (b) 26 (1) (120) Tax (charge)/credit on items that will not be reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss (b) 7, 26 (1) 25 Other comprehensive (expense)/income for the year (30) 161 Total comprehensive income for the year 753 811 Total comprehensive income/(expense) attributable to: Continuing operations 850 744 Discontinued operations (97) 67 Total comprehensive income for the year 753 811 (a) Impacting the translation reserve. Sources of estimation uncertainty In applying the Group’s accounting policies, various transactions and balances are valued using estimates or assumptions. Should these estimates or assumptions prove incorrect there may be an impact on the following year’s ﬁnancial statements. The Group believes that these APMs, which are not considered to be a substitute for IFRS measures, provide additional helpful information. All reportable segments derive their revenue from a single business activity, the distribution of plumbing and heating products. (f) This relates to certain expenditure for which no tax relief is available such as disallowable business entertaining costs. This generated a trigger event for management to reassess the recoverability of its associated goodwill and acquired intangible assets. At 31 July 2017, the plan assets were invested in a diversiﬁed portfolio comprised of: 2017 2016 Value at 31 July UK £m Non-UK £m Total £m UK £m Non-UK £m Total £m Equity type assets quoted 406 53 459 663 85 748 Government bonds quoted 255 36 291 356 22 378 Corporate bonds quoted 31 56 87 147 75 222 Real estate 40 – 40 424 28 Cash 35 8 43 12 10 22 Insurance policies 505 – 505 –1717 Other 65 11 76 126 17 143 Total market value of assets 1,337 164 1,501 1,308 250 1,558 2017 2016 Present value of deﬁned beneﬁt obligation UK £m Non-UK £m Total £m UK £m Non-UK £m Total £m At 1 August 1,336 369 1,705 1,206 286 1,492 Current service cost (including administrative costs) 268 27 9 Past service gain (11) (2) (13) (2) (2) (4) Interest cost 31 8 39 41 10 51 Beneﬁt payments (46) (14) (60) (45) (15) (60) Settlement and curtailment payments –(5) (5) ––– Participants’ contributions –22 –3 3 Remeasurement (gain)/loss: Actuarial gain arising from changes in demographic assumptions (31) (1) (32) (14) (3) (17) Actuarial loss/(gain) arising from changes in ﬁnancial assumptions 91 (13) 78 174 26 200 Actuarial (gain)/loss arising from experience adjustments (38) (2) (40) (26) 3 (23) Disposal of businesses –(120) (120) ––– Reclassiﬁed as held for sale – (49) (49) ––– Currency translation –99 –5454 At 31 July 1,334 188 1,522 1,336 369 1,705 Strategic report Governance Financials Other information 111 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 26 – Retirement beneﬁt obligations continued (ii) Financial impact of plans continued Analysis of present value of deﬁned beneﬁt obligation 2017 £m 2016 £m Amounts arising from wholly unfunded plans 3 44 Amounts arising from plans that are wholly or partly funded 1,519 1,661 1,522 1,705 (iii) Valuation assumptions The ﬁnancial assumptions used to estimate deﬁned beneﬁt obligations are: 2017 2016 UK Non-UK UK Non-UK Discount rate 2.6% 3.6% 2.4% 2.2% Inﬂation rate 3.2% 2.5% 2.8% 1.4% Increase to deferred beneﬁts during deferment 2.1% n/a 1.7% 1.8% Increases to pensions in payment 2.9% 2.0% 2.5% 1.8% Salary increases 2.1% 2.5% 1.7% 1.8% The life expectancy assumptions used to estimate deﬁned beneﬁt obligations are: 2017 2016 UK Years Non-UK Years UK Years Non-UK Years Current pensioners (at age 65) – male 22 21 22 22 Current pensioners (at age 65) – female 24 24 24 24 Future pensioners (at age 65) – male 24 23 25 24 Future pensioners (at age 65) – female 26 25 27 26 The weighted average duration of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is 20.4 years (2016: 21.2 years). The Group also acquired a share of Walter Meier AG (see note 15), which has been accounted for as an associate. Provision is made if, on the basis of current information and professional advice, liabilities are considered likely to arise. Group companies have also made contractual commitments for certain property and other obligations which could be called upon in an event of default. As at the date of this report, there are no signiﬁcant outstanding claims in relation to business disposals. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated or actual tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. The fair value of ﬁnancial instruments that are not traded in an active market (such as over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. Liquidity risk The Group maintains a policy of ensuring sufficient borrowing headroom to ﬁnance all investment and capital expenditure included in its strategic plan, with an additional contingent safety margin. Key observations We consider the Group’s provisioning methodology to be prudent when compared with historical levels of inventory write-offs. Federal tax is levied on proﬁts in the year subject to any participation exemption for qualifying dividends from subsidiaries.
