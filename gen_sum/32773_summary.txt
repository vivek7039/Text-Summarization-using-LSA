By listening to tenants and taking advice from agents, the Company remains totally aware of emerging occupier trends, such as the increasing preference towards characterful or individualistic offices, and is able to increase value by providing supply for this demand. Circle is well positioned in this uncertain political and economic environment with a closely managed business, a positive strategy and an entrepreneurial management team ready to exploit emerging opportunities.. Ian Henderson Chairman 3 Circle Property Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financials Governance Strategic Report Strategic Report Throughout the year we have continued with our asset management programme and have now assembled a core portfolio of high quality regional offices in prime locations which are primarily well let to high quality tenants on medium or long-term leases. As a result, and because of the resilient demand for the type of space we offer, we believe our portfolio will prove less susceptible to any downward valuation shifts arising from any prolonged political and economic uncertainty. However, with a strong cash flow and cash at bank we believe that our business is well placed to capitalise upon a regional office market that has, to-date, remained fairly robust due to sustained demand for offices in the sub 5,000 sq ft range and the continuing loss of much of the lower quality office stock due to obsolescence and residential conversion. Whether we are buying short let income to drive the rents forward or offices requiring refurbishment, we use our proven expertise to provide tenants with the occupational space they desire, in locations where there is proven occupier demand. Companies relocating to the regions to save costs, being attracted by lower employment costs, business rates and rent, coupled with existing demand from local professional occupiers and SMEs, have further enhanced tenant demand for good quality well located offices. Furthermore, major provincial cities have experienced the Permitted Development Rights effect, whereby offices can be converted to residential without planning permission. • Complete active management of non-core assets adding value above existing valuation and then sell. Recycle Capital 34% Above Valuation Development Programme We reposition and add value to well located provincial offices by undertaking both minor or extensive refurbishments. • Complete active management of non-core assets adding value above existing valuation and then sell.

Adoption of new and revised IFRSs New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations which came in to effect for accounting periods starting on or after 1 April 2016 have not had a material impact on the preparation of these financial statements. Service charges receivable from tenants and related costs are not recognised by the Group. Service charge costs in relation to void areas are recognised within property expenses on an accruals basis. After initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Such assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Circle Property Management Limited (“CPML”) was registered in the UK and subject to corporation tax at a rate of 20%. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. A deferred tax asset of £1,270,126 (2016: £1,019,453) has been recognised as it is expected to be utilised in the foreseeable future. In the opinion of the Board, treasury shares held to satisfy share awards to management, as disclosed in note 21, currently do not have any material value and hence do not have any dilutive effect.

Fair values Accounting standards recognise a hierarchy of fair value measurements for financial instruments which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). Value is the Directors’ best estimate, based on advice from relevant knowledgeable experts, use of recognised valuation techniques and on assumptions as to what inputs other market participants would apply in pricing the same or similar instruments. 24 Commitments under construction contracts As at 31 March 2017 the Group had contracted capital expenditure on existing properties of £2,156,704 (2016: £533,318).
