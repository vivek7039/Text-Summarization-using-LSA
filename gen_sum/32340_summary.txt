Together with his team, he has made significant progress on our commitments and towards evolving the direction for National Grid. Nicola Shaw joined the Board on 1 July 2016 as Executive Director, UK, and I am pleased that she has also made a very good start. Through this support, we are playing our part in building a stronger community by helping people access more affordable housing. Corporate governance After nearly six years’ tenure as a Non- executive Director, Ruth Kelly has decided that due to personal circumstances and time commitments she will not be seeking re-election by shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting. These developments come at a time when there have been considerable changes in our operating environment, as described on page 9. Globally, investment in coal-powered generation is falling and renewables have now overtaken coal as the world’s largest source of installed power capacity. And by making decisions that consider our customers’ interests, we will be able to deliver sustainable performance over the long term. While we have no specific target, our overall aim is to achieve between 5% and 7% of regulated asset base growth each year. Our entry level talent development schemes (graduate training and apprenticeships) are a potential source of competitive advantage in the market place. Scenarios developed to represent reasonable worst-case examples of principal risk clusters were assessed for cumulative impact upon our reputation and stakeholder trust. Depreciation and amortisation costs were £24 million higher this year at constant currency as a result of ongoing investment in our networks. These are reflected in the Value Added metric that underpins our approach to sustainable decision-making and long-term incentive arrangements. Such adjustments will form an important part of the continuing difference between reported IFRS results and underlying economic performance based on our regulatory obligations. Within Gas Transmission, we initiated a project to upgrade some air compressor units, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 1,228 tonnes, and yielding long-term financial savings of £2.42 million. The majority of projects will not be contested, and National Grid Ventures is preparing to compete for any that are. Earlier in 2017 , BEIS confirmed, through the ‘Building our Industrial Strategy’ green paper, its intention to focus on developing technical education and skills. So, I was particularly delighted when we received an Outstanding grade from Ofsted, for the third time In focus Evolving energy landscape 11 . Looking ahead It’s been a busy year, living first-hand how we bring energy to life for our customers, stakeholders, and communities. Through a new gas enablement initiative, we are upgrading systems, improving processes and developing ways of working to serve our customers better. US work experience opportunities include summer internships – with some interns starting their journey into the energy industry through our Engineering Pipeline programme. This helps us determine where we could have future shortfalls in our workforce requirements across a range of possible scenarios over the next 10 years. Andrew also has prior experience in the energy sector as he was Finance Director of BG Group plc from 2001 to 2002. Therese Esperdy (56) Non-executive Director A, F (ch), N Independent Appointed: 18 March 2014, and appointed to the Board of National Grid USA from 1 May 2015 Tenure: 3 years Career and skills: Having started her banking career at Lehman Brothers, Therese joined Chase Securities in 1997 going on to hold a variety of senior roles at JP Morgan Chase & Co. Details of our internal control systems, including those relating to the financial reporting process, can be found on pages 18 and 180. With effect from this date, all non-audit services are subject to the same protocols and policies as those applied in respect of PwC. We received updates on the measures being taken to address levels of risk for major hazard assets, including key US LNG plants. The Parker Review, published in November 2016, recommended every FTSE 100 board should have at least one director from a non-white ethnic minority by 2021. We will only engage executive search firms who have signed up to the Voluntary Code of Conduct on Gender Diversity. Details of the APP payouts are presented on page 64, including that for Steve Holliday, who was an Executive Director from 1 April until 22 July. Operation Maximum levels Performance metrics, weighting and time period applicable Benefits provided include: • company car or a cash alternative (UK only); • use of a car and driver when required; • private medical insurance; • life assurance; • personal accident insurance; • opportunity to purchase additional benefits under flexible benefits schemes available to all employees; and • opportunity to participate in the following HMRC (UK) or Internal Revenue Service (US) tax-advantaged all-employee share plans: Sharesave: UK employees may make monthly contributions from net salary for a period of three or five years. Operation Maximum levels Performance metrics, weighting and time period applicable Pension for an Executive Director will reflect whether they were internally promoted or externally appointed. UK DB: a maximum pension on retirement, at age 60, of two thirds final capped pensionable pay or up to one sixtieth accrual. In general, these differences arise from the development of remuneration arrangements that are market competitive for our various employee categories. For an internally appointed Executive Director, any outstanding variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role will continue on its original terms. Long-term share plan awards held by ‘good leavers’ may vest subject to performance measured at the normal vesting date and are prorated. Our core audit team, excluding specialists who support us in treasury, accounting technical, IT, tax, pensions, and valuations comprises approximately 74 people. We tested the models and key assumptions used by management to value complex derivatives which were agreed as appropriate. This is particularly significant in the US partly as a result of National Grid’s exposure to certain ‘Superfund’ sites. We also tested manual journal entries based on a risk assessment of value and nature, with no matters requiring reporting to the Audit Committee arising. These amounts are included in the overall calculation of revenue as stipulated by regulatory agreements and explained further on pages 174 to 179. Depreciation and amortisation was £24 million higher this year at constant currency as a result of ongoing investment in our networks. Diluted EPS shows what the impact would be if all outstanding share options were exercised and treated as ordinary shares at year end. Property, plant and equipment includes assets in which the Company’s interest comprises legally protected statutory or contractual rights of use. On 10 January 2017 the Group announced it had entered into an arrangement with San Francisco-based Sunrun Neptune Investor 2016 LLC, a leading US provider of residential solar energy systems to provide investment capital. For DC pension plans, National Grid pays contributions into separate funds on behalf of the employee and has no further obligations to employees. Commodity contracts that have not been offset on the balance sheet may be settled net in certain circumstances under ISDA or NAESB (North American Energy Standards Board) agreements. It is compared with the level of RAV gearing indicated by Ofgem as being appropriate for these businesses, at around 60 to 65%.

Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. At present, environmental issues are not preventing our UK and US businesses from utilising any material operating assets in the course of their operations. These outputs have been determined through an extensive consultation process, which has given stakeholders a greater opportunity to influence the decisions. Ofgem, using information we have submitted, along with independent assessments, determines the efficient level of expected costs necessary to deliver them. Where we under- or over-spend the allowed totex for reasons that are not covered by uncertainty mechanisms, there is a sharing factor. This means the under- or over-spend is shared between us and customers through an adjustment to allowed revenues in future years. The mid-period review focused on three specific areas, all of which relate to National Grid’s transmission outputs (both gas and electricity). However, this measure cannot be used in isolation, as there are a number of factors that may prevent us from achieving the allowed RoE. These factors include financial market conditions, regulatory lag and decisions by the regulator preventing cost recovery in rates from customers. We work to increase achieved RoE through: productivity improvements; positive performance against incentives or earned savings mechanisms such as energy efficiency programmes, where available; and filing a new rate case when achieved returns are lower than the Company could reasonably expect to attain through a new rate case. Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) In April 2014, NYPSC instituted the REV proceeding, which envisions a new role for utilities as distributed system platform (DSP) providers who create markets for distributed energy resources (DER) and more fully integrate DER in distribution system operations and planning. One of the principal limits requires National Grid plc to hold an investment grade long-term senior unsecured debt credit rating. In total, these fees must not exceed £2,000,000 per year or any higher sum decided by an ordinary resolution at a general meeting of shareholders. Under the Articles, any other general meeting may be convened provided at least 14 clear days’ written notice is given, subject to annual approval of shareholders. We are also working in partnership with Scottish Power Electricity Networks on their £16 million Phoenix NIC project which aims to demonstrate how hybrid synchronous compensation could overcome technical limitations that currently limit the proportion of power generation from renewable sources and interconnectors that the Great Britain electricity system can handle. In February 2017 , National Grid received two EPRI Technology Transfer awards for the RD&D work on Smart Inverters and distributed energy resources hosting capacity. Depreciation and amortisation costs were £51 million higher this year at constant currency as a result of ongoing investment in our networks. In the US, adjusted operating profit was £143 million higher, reflecting lower spend on upgrades to our finance systems which completed last year. Items previously reported for 2013–2016 have been represented to reflect UK Gas Distribution being presented as a discontinued operation in the current year.
