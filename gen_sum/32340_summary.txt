approximately 74 people. we tested the models and key assumptions used by management to value complex derivatives which were agreed as appropriate. this is particularly significant in the us partly as a result of national grid’s exposure to certain ‘superfund’ sites. where possible we confirmed other inputs into the calculations by reference to publicly available information and noted no exceptions. we also tested manual journal entries based on a risk assessment of value and nature, with no matters requiring reporting to the audit committee arising. further information on our pension

provisions we make provisions when an obligation exists, resulting from a past event and it is probable that cash will be paid to settle it, but the exact amount of cash required can only be estimated. sales to retail customers are usually settled in cash, cheques, electronic bank payments or by using major credit cards. commodity contracts that have not been offset on the balance sheet may be settled net in certain circumstances under isda or naesb (north american energy standards board) agreements. in addition, state regulators require national grid to manage commodity risk and cost volatility prudently through diversified pricing strategies. it is compared with the level of rav gearing indicated by ofgem as being appropriate for these businesses, at around 60 to 65%. level

not be recoverable. at present, environmental issues are not preventing our uk and us businesses from utilising any material operating assets in the course of their operations. while each of the eight price controls may have differing terms, they are based on a consistent regulatory framework. these outputs have been determined through an extensive consultation process, which has given stakeholders a greater opportunity to influence the decisions. ofgem, using information we have submitted, along with independent assessments, determines the efficient level of expected costs necessary to deliver them. where we under- or over-spend the allowed totex for reasons that are not covered by uncertainty mechanisms, there is a sharing factor. this means the under- or over-spend is shared between us and customers through an adjustment to allowed revenues in future years. the mid-period review focused on three specific areas, all of which relate to national grid’s transmission outputs (both gas and electricity). however, this measure cannot be used in isolation, as there are a number of factors that may prevent us from achieving the allowed roe. these factors include financial market conditions, regulatory lag and decisions by the regulator preventing cost recovery in rates from customers. we work to increase achieved roe through: productivity improvements; positive performance against incentives or earned savings mechanisms such as energy efficiency programmes, where available; and filing a new rate case when achieved returns are lower than the company could reasonably expect to attain through a new rate case. reforming the energy vision (rev) in april 2014, nypsc instituted the rev proceeding, which envisions a new role for utilities as distributed system platform
