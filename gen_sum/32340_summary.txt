overview of our strategy and business model, the principal risks we face and information about our performance. for brevity, we do not define terms or provide explanations every time they are used; please refer to the glossary on pages 202–206 for this information as well as an important notice in relation to forward-looking statements with our cautionary statement. we play a vital role in connecting millions of people to the energy they use, safely, reliably and efficiently. with effect from april 2017 , we have brought together key assets outside our core regulated businesses into

2016/17 strategic report chairman’s statement national grid is responding positively to wide-reaching developments in our operating environment and taking steps to build a stronger foundation for the future. you can read more about these on page 8. i am pleased that john has delivered a very strong performance in his first year as chief executive. together with his team, he has made significant progress on our commitments and towards evolving the direction for national grid. nicola shaw joined the board on 1 july 2016 as executive director, uk, and i am pleased that she has also made a very good start. this and other related resolutions will also be considered at a general meeting on 19 may 2017 . standing back from the detail of these accounts, i would like to highlight two aspects. in the us, we are supporting united way of rhode island’s housing for all fund. the fund helps people who are making tough choices around which basic needs they can afford. through this support, we are playing our part in building a stronger community by helping people access more affordable housing. how we manage our operational sites can have a major impact on the environmental well-being of communities. corporate governance after nearly six years’ tenure as a non- executive director, ruth kelly has decided that due to personal circumstances and time commitments she will not be seeking re-election by shareholders at the next annual general meeting. we remain committed to ensuring a sustainable and clean energy future for all our customers. i am excited by the evolution of our strategy, which we are setting out in this report. both our uk and us businesses remain committed to achieving the highest possible standards for safe working. the sale of a majority interest in our uk gas distribution business marks an important milestone for national grid. “our purpose, which sets out why national grid exists, is simple – we bring energy to life.” 6 national grid annual report and accounts 2016/17 strategic report chief executive’s review for the potential future sale and purchase of an additional 14% interest. a recent example of this is our partnership with us solar supplier sunrun, which we announced in january. you can read more about the developments in our uk, us and other businesses on pages 24–29. however, as sir peter has described, there is much change taking place in our operating environment. globally, investment in coal-powered generation is falling and renewables have now overtaken coal as the world’s largest source of installed power capacity. and by making decisions that consider our customers’ interests, we will be able to deliver sustainable performance over the long term. and thirdly, we are making further changes to make sure national grid is better equipped for the future. we are already seeing changes in our energy system as more renewable and decentralised generation is introduced. our world is changing as a result of human activity and its impact on the environment. in december 2015, the paris agreement entered into force, and as at 17 may 2017 has been ratified by 146 national governments. we are expecting around £200 million of cost savings for consumers resulting from awarding enhanced frequency response contracts for more than 200 mw of battery storage in july 2016. we continue to support beis and ofgem on capacity market policy development and applicant readiness. our strategic objectives deliver operational excellence achieve world-class levels of safety, reliability, security and customer service. our ambition is to achieve a world-class safety performance of below 0.1. employee lost time injury frequency rate per 100,000 hours worked 12/13 13/14 14/15 15/16 16/17 0.10 0.10 0.13 0.14 0.17 our overall lost time injury frequency rate for the company has remained at 0.10 which is an historic low level for the company. one of these affected around 6,000 customers and was caused by third-party damage to our assets. you can find out more about how we promote an inclusive and diverse workforce on page 30. the above data includes uk gas distribution employees. you can read more about how we have innovated during 2016/17 in our principal operations sections on pages 24–29. we continue to maximise value from our existing portfolio, while exploring and evaluating opportunities for growth.

specific target, our overall aim is to achieve between 5% and 7% of regulated asset base growth each year. in the uk, we have one regulator, ofgem, which regulates our electricity and gas businesses. our relationships with stakeholders and regulators we engage widely in debate that helps guide future energy policy direction. each business function owns and is responsible for managing its own particular risks (the first line of defence). this provides some financial protection in respect of property damage, business interruption and liability risks. the businesses will continue to develop their own implementation plans against these new standards and capabilities. • we use industry best practices as part of our cyber security policies, processes and technologies. our entry level talent development schemes (graduate training and apprenticeships) are a potential source of competitive advantage in the market place. we are involved in a number of initiatives to help secure the future engineering talent required. we monitor and address business conduct issues through several means, including a biannual review by the audit committee. monitoring internal control is conducted through established boards and committees at different levels of the organisation. they are also the basis of our compliance with obligations set by sox and other internal assurance activities. the board has had two sessions on strategic workforce planning and building our human resources capability. scenario 3 – a serious fire in our liquefied natural gas terminal at the isle of grain. scenarios developed to represent reasonable worst-case examples of principal risk clusters were assessed for cumulative impact upon our reputation and stakeholder trust. scenario 6 – a cyber security attack and catastrophic us asset failure occurring together within the assessment period. depreciation and amortisation costs were £24 million higher this year at constant currency as a result of ongoing investment in our networks. of this, £1.9 billion was due to foreign exchange movements increasing the rate base reported in sterling. excluding foreign exchange, rate base increased by £0.8 billion, reflecting a significant year of us investment. these are reflected in the value added metric that underpins our approach to sustainable decision-making and long-term incentive arrangements. our us regulated business continues to increase levels of investment in network reinforcement and resilience. during the year we generated £1.2 billion of business net cash flow after our capital expenditure programmes. we have actively managed scrip uptake through buying back shares when supported by sufficient headroom in the rcf/net debt metric. 22 national grid annual report and accounts 2016/17 strategic report financial review regulatory financial performance timing and regulated revenue adjustments as described on pages 174 to 179, our allowed revenues are set in accordance with our regulatory price controls or rate plans. such adjustments will form an important part of the continuing difference between reported ifrs results and underlying economic performance based on our regulatory obligations. within gas transmission, we initiated a project to upgrade some air compressor units, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 1,228 tonnes, and yielding long-term financial savings of £2.42 million. through project this year, sadly, safety has been brought into the sharpest focus for all of us. we are continuing to co-operate with the health and safety executive (hse) as it carries out its independent investigation. the majority of projects will not be contested, and national grid ventures is preparing to compete for any that are. earlier in 2017 , beis confirmed, through the ‘building our industrial strategy’ green paper, its intention to focus on developing technical education and skills. so, i was particularly delighted when we received an outstanding grade from ofsted, for the third time in focus evolving energy landscape 11 . cost savings for consumers £ 200 m is the approximate expected cost saving resulting from awarding enhanced frequency response contracts for more than 200mw of battery storage in july 2016. transmission 2 8 4tw h of electricity flowed across the transmission network in 2016/17 , enough to boil 2.3 trillion kettles. also, national grid will work with sp energy networks on a £19.9 million project that will help address some of the current and future challenges associated with the stability of britain’s electricity transmission system as we transition to low-carbon energy. although we exceeded our customer satisfaction targets, the figure for electricity transmission decreased slightly compared to last year. we have collaborated with organisations that provide demand side flexibility to develop new electricity balancing services. the replacements needed to be done in a specific order and involved an enormous amount of planning. although i created a technical issues log it was national grid who picked this up and reviewed it each week on the conference call – a good example of national grid’s responsiveness during this project.” “the positive team ethic, which we developed together over a period of time, led to an extremely productive 2016.” geraint hancock project manager at uk power networks 25 national grid annual report and accounts 2016/17 strategic report i believe that our focus on providing affordable, safe, reliable energy for all customers will make us a great operating company. the decision outlines a three-year rate plan for our 1.2 million gas customers in downstate new york, effective from 1 january 2017 . it involves adopting new technologies and sustainable energy solutions – creating a blueprint for other large campus developments. we received good news in july that new hampshire regulators had approved construction of the merrimack valley reliability project (mvrp) – a 24.4 mile, 345 kv overhead transmission line that will run in existing utility rights-of-way between londonderry, new hampshire, and tewksbury, massachusetts. looking ahead it’s been a busy year, living first-hand how we bring energy to life for our customers, stakeholders, and communities. through a new gas enablement initiative, we are upgrading systems, improving processes and developing ways of working to serve our customers better. and, we are strengthening the energy supply chain that will take us to a decarbonised future. traditional solar installations generate electricity only for one resident or business who can afford it. britned is a joint venture between national grid and tennet, the dutch transmission system operator. these include interests in lng road transportation, some gas transmission pipelines (our minority equity interests in these are not regulated) and certain commercial services relating to solar installations, fuel cells and other new technologies that are an important part of our future. north sea link 29 national grid annual report and accounts 2016/17 strategic report in the us, we completed the seventh year of our national grid engineering pipeline programme, designed to inspire high school students to pursue an engineering education and career. us work experience opportunities include summer internships – with some interns starting their journey into the energy industry through our engineering pipeline programme. we recognise the value that a diverse workforce and an inclusive culture bring to our business. where possible, we make reasonable adjustments in job design and provide appropriate training for existing employees who become disabled. we are committed to equal opportunity in recruitment, promotion and career development for all employees, including those with disabilities, and our policy recognises the right of all people to work in an environment that is free from discrimination. this helps us determine where we could have future shortfalls in our workforce requirements across a range of possible scenarios over the next 10 years. our academy offers residential work experience programmes for 100 young people annually, balanced 50/50 between boys and girls. in november 2016, our apprentice programme was ranked ‘outstanding’ by ofsted for the third time consecutively. i woke up at 3:30am and noticed we still didn’t have electricity, so i went downstairs to check the national grid website, which showed a crew was assigned and the estimated time electricity would be back on was 8:00am. we have included information relating to subsidiary directors, as this is required by the companies act 2006 (strategic report and directors’ reports) regulations 2013. we define ‘senior management’ as those managers who are at the same level, or one level below, our executive committee. our activities in the us included a programme aimed at reducing soft tissue injuries through early intervention and prevention. other activities included a focus on chronic disease prevention through educational programmes and wellbeing initiatives. last year, our community engagement and investment in education was valued at £12,364,891, with our uk employees giving over 18,400 hours of volunteering support and the us providing more than 22,900 hours of interactions with young people on stem subjects. in february, we responded to the department of business, energy and industrial strategy’s consultation on corporate governance reform. skills and experience: g, r and u. andrew bonfield (54) finance director f appointed: 1 november 2010 tenure: 6 years career and skills: andrew is a chartered accountant with significant financial experience having previously held the position of chief financial officer at cadbury plc; he also spent five years as executive vice president & chief financial officer at bristol- myers squibb, an american pharmaceutical company. andrew also has prior experience in the energy sector as he was finance director of bg group plc from 2001 to 2002. he currently has an external appointment on the kingfisher plc board as a non-executive director. alison is an experienced commercial lawyer bringing a wealth of practical advice and guidance to her current role. actions were identified as appropriate and agreement reached that the committees continued to operate effectively. uk resident shareholders can apply to take part in this programme via the investors section of our website. it is intended that a company risk framework will be finalised and implemented during the 2017/18 financial year. additionally, an externally facilitated review of risk appetite is to be undertaken during 2017/18 to identify how risk appetite can better inform decision-making in the future and how it is integrated into board and committee reporting. we thank pwc for all their hard work as our auditors since the inception of national grid plc. the controls testing did not find any significant items that would impact auditor objectivity and independence. business separation compliance reports are submitted to the committee twice a year, in may and november. with effect from this date, all non-audit services are subject to the same protocols and policies as those applied in respect of pwc. we received updates on the measures being taken to address levels of risk for major hazard assets, including key us lng plants. last month andrew bonfield stepped down from the committee, having been a member for three years. we were pleased to note the appointment of chief engineers for both gas and electricity, with group-wide remits. we will only engage executive search firms who have signed up to the voluntary code of conduct on gender diversity. company representatives and our registrar are also on hand to answer any questions shareholders might have. what we did was to appraise the way national grid creates value for its shareholders over time, and fulfils its national and societal obligations, recognising also that we are in a competitive market for senior executive talent. page 70 provides more detail on the implementation of our policy related to incentive plans for 2017/18. this year we are seeking your approval of our remuneration policy for a further three years. details of the app payouts are presented on page 64, including that for steve holliday, who was an executive director from 1 april until 22 july. these peer groups are considered appropriate for a large, complex, international and predominantly regulated business. operation maximum levels performance metrics, weighting and time period applicable salaries are targeted broadly at mid-market level. operation maximum levels performance metrics, weighting and time period applicable benefits provided include: • company car or a cash alternative (uk only); • use of a car and driver when required; • private medical insurance; • life assurance; • personal accident insurance; • opportunity to purchase additional benefits under flexible benefits schemes available to all employees; and • opportunity to participate in the following hmrc (uk) or internal revenue service (us) tax-advantaged all-employee share plans: sharesave: uk employees may make monthly contributions from net salary for a period of three or five years. they are dc pension plans in which employees can invest their own and company contributions. operation maximum levels performance metrics, weighting and time period applicable pension for an executive director will reflect whether they were internally promoted or externally appointed. uk db: a maximum pension on retirement, at age 60, of two thirds final capped pensionable pay or up to one sixtieth accrual. fees are reviewed every year taking into account those in companies of similar scale and complexity. in general, these differences arise from the development of remuneration arrangements that are market competitive for our various employee categories. for an externally appointed executive director, the company may offer additional cash or share-based payments that it considers necessary to buy out current entitlements from the former employer that will be lost on recruitment to national grid. in order to facilitate buy-out arrangements as described above, existing incentive arrangements will be used to the extent possible, although awards may also be granted outside of these shareholder-approved schemes if necessary and as permitted under the listing rules. for an internally appointed executive director, any outstanding variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role will continue on its original terms. long-term share plan awards held by ‘good leavers’ may vest subject to performance measured at the normal vesting date and are prorated. 2. salary is that to be paid in 2017/18, taking account of the increases that will be effective from 1

policy in 2017/18 the remuneration policy for approval at the 2017 agm will be implemented during 2017/18 as described below. nbs was selected as our advisor by the committee from 1 august 2013 following a competitive tendering process. our core audit team, excluding specialists who support us in treasury, accounting technical, it, tax, pensions, and valuations comprises approximately 74 people. based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: area commentary overall group materiality £175m (2016: £157m) £175 million (2016: £157 million) is 5% of profit before tax, exceptional items and remeasurements (‘adjusted profit before tax’). in making this decision the directors have to consider whether the expenditure will generate future economic benefits which necessarily involves judgement, for example in determining whether activities or items are adding value or maintaining existing assets. we tested the models and key assumptions used by management to value complex derivatives which were agreed as appropriate. this is particularly significant in the us partly as a result of national grid’s exposure to certain ‘superfund’ sites. where possible we confirmed other inputs into the calculations by reference to publicly available information and noted no exceptions. we also tested manual journal entries based on a risk assessment of value and nature, with no matters requiring reporting to the audit committee arising. we inspected proof of cash payment or confirmed amounts with customers where it was possible to do so. in so doing, we did not note any significant issues which would impact the group financial statements. those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 2. comparative amounts have been restated to reflect the impact of additional shares issued as scrip dividends. this increase was driven by higher revenues in both our uk and us regulated businesses. excluding exceptional items and remeasurements, operating costs were £1,264 million higher, principally due to the impact of foreign exchange rates alongside increased balancing services costs in the uk and higher depreciation as a result of newly commissioned assets. in the previous year, operating costs included a net £11 million gain on remeasurements of commodity contracts. for the previous year ended 31 march 2016, we incurred a loss of £99 million on financial remeasurements. as a capital- intensive business, we have significant amounts of physical assets and corresponding borrowings. other non-current liabilities reduced, principally due to £910 million of deferred income within uk gas distribution. further information on our pension and other post-retirement obligations can be found in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements. 3. included within net cash flows used in financing activities – discontinued operations are cash flows relating to the liability management programme, comprising £4.8 billion of debt issued and term debt raised, offset by £3.2 billion in respect of bond buybacks. our electricity and gas transmission operations in the uk are subject to multi-year rate agreements with regulators. • financial instruments: we normally opt to apply hedge accounting in most circumstances where this is permitted. under ifrs 16, our operating leases will be accounted for on the balance sheet as ‘right-of-use’ assets. our strategy in action we own a portfolio of businesses that range from businesses with high levels of investment and growth (such as uk electricity transmission) to cash generative developed assets with lower investment requirements (such as national grid metering, included within other activities). no liability is recognised, as such an adjustment relates to the provision of future services. national grid ventures formed on 1 april 2017 and the impact of this change will be reflected in 2017/18. notes to the consolidated financial statements – analysis of items in the primary statements continued 96 national grid annual report and accounts 2016/17 financial statements unaudited commentary on the results of our principal operations by segment – continuing operations as a business, we have three measures of operating profit (from continuing operations) that are used on a regular basis and disclosed in this annual report. after deducting pass-through costs, net revenue was £31 million higher than prior year, including increased regulated revenue allowances in the year and higher volumes than expected, partly offset by lower lng storage revenues following a site closure. depreciation and amortisation was £24 million higher this year at constant currency as a result of ongoing investment in our networks. 3% rav indexation: future uk revenue allowances are expected to be set using an asset base adjusted for inflation. 6. vendor due diligence and other transaction services in relation to the sale of uk gas distribution. as pwc has no contract with or duty of care to xoserve limited, these amounts are not included above. management utilises an exceptional items framework that has been discussed and approved by the group audit committee. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised on all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. continuing focus on tax reform during 2016/17, specifically the organisation for economic co-operation and development’s (oecd’s) base erosion and profit shifting (beps) project to address mismatches in international rules resulted in draft legislation on areas such as interest deductibility being issued during the year. this helps to ensure that we are engaged at the earliest opportunity on tax issues which affect our business. diluted eps shows what the impact would be if all outstanding share options were exercised and treated as ordinary shares at year end. 2. comparative amounts have been restated to reflect the impact

reflects an increase in achieved operational return on equity year-on-year, driven by improved totex performance. the future economic growth rate used to extrapolate projections beyond five years has been maintained at 2% (2016: 2%). identifiable intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment. other intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives. our strategy in action we operate an energy networks business and therefore have a significant physical asset base. property, plant and equipment includes assets in which the company’s interest comprises legally protected statutory or contractual rights of use. on 10 january 2017 the group announced it had entered into an arrangement with san francisco-based sunrun neptune investor 2016 llc, a leading us provider of residential solar energy systems to provide investment capital. in general, the key strategic, operational and financial decisions can be effected by a simple majority of votes. the group is required to complete a purchase price allocation exercise for its interest in quadgas holdco limited. analysis of these derivatives and the various methods used to calculate their respective fair values is detailed below and in note 30. for each class of derivative instrument type the total fair value amounts are as

reporting date. other receivables also include prepayments made by us, for example, property lease rentals paid in advance. as indicated in note 16, we use derivatives to manage risks associated with interest rates and foreign exchange. for dc pension plans, national grid pays contributions into separate funds on behalf of the employee and has no further obligations to employees. plan funds are invested in a variety of asset classes, principally: equities, government securities, corporate bonds and property. the arrangements are managed by trustee companies with boards consisting of company and member appointed directors. the national grid uk pension scheme was split into three sections, each of which are legally and actuarially separate. this amount may change over time or following changes to national grid plc’s credit rating. section b national grid and the trustees have agreed on a schedule of contributions, under which payments of £30 million plus an adjustment for rpi will be made in 2017/18 and will thereafter rise in line with rpi. this amount may change over time or following changes to national grid gas plc’s credit rating. the db plans provide retirement benefits to vested union employees, as well as vested non-union employees hired before 1 january 2011. benefits under these plans generally reflect age, years of service and compensation and are paid in the form of an annuity or lump sum. national grid also has multiple dc pension plans, primarily comprised of employee savings and company matching contributions. in the us, there is no governmental requirement to pre-fund post-retirement healthcare and life insurance plans. the geographical split of pensions and other post-retirement benefits is as shown below: uk pensions us pensions us other

probable that cash will be paid to settle it, but the exact amount of cash required can only be estimated. current operations will seldom result in new sites with significant expected costs being added to the provision. provision is made for decommissioning and environmental costs, based on future estimated expenditures, discounted to present values. through the ordinary course of our operations, we are party to various litigation, claims and investigations. 4. amounts payable to joint ventures include deposits received for national grid property sites from st william homes llp. sales to retail customers are usually settled in cash, cheques, electronic bank payments or by using major credit cards. we are committed to measuring, monitoring, minimising and recording counterparty credit risk in our wholesale business. amounts which cannot be offset under ifrs, but which could be settled net under terms of master netting agreements if certain conditions arise, and with collateral received or pledged, are shown to present national grid’s net exposure. commodity contracts that have not been offset on the balance sheet may be settled net in certain circumstances under isda or naesb (north american energy standards board) agreements. offsets relate to margin payments for nymex gas futures which are traded on a recognised exchange. during 2017 and 2016,

commodity risk and cost volatility prudently through diversified pricing strategies. we regularly review and manage the capital structure as appropriate in order to achieve these objectives. our long-term target range for interest cover is greater than 3.0, which we believe is consistent with single a range long-term senior unsecured debt credit ratings within our main uk operating companies, nget and ngg, based on guidance from the rating agencies. it is compared with the level of rav gearing indicated by ofgem as being appropriate for these businesses, at around 60 to 65%. all the above requirements are monitored on a regular basis in order to ensure compliance. the company has complied with all externally imposed capital requirements to which it is subject. level 3: financial instruments valued using valuation techniques where one or more significant inputs are based on unobservable market data. in valuing these instruments an external valuation is obtained to support each reported fair value. we have reclassified sterling rpi swaps from level 2 into level 3 due to the long-dated and increased illiquid nature of these instruments, which has been driven by the lack of market participants for trades with this particular risk profile. the level 3 investments were acquired in a recent period on market terms and sensitivity is considered insignificant at 31 march 2017.

issues are not preventing our uk and us businesses from utilising any material operating assets in the course of their operations. while each of the eight price controls may have differing terms, they are based on a consistent regulatory framework. these outputs have been determined through an extensive consultation process, which has given stakeholders a greater opportunity to influence the decisions. ofgem, using information we have submitted, along with independent assessments, determines the efficient level of expected costs necessary to deliver them. where we under- or over-spend the allowed totex for reasons that are not covered by uncertainty mechanisms, there is a sharing factor. this means the under- or over-spend is shared between us and customers through an adjustment to allowed revenues in future years. 174 national grid annual report and accounts 2016/17 additional information † this was a national grid business until 31 march 2017. the business in detail continued this sharing factor is one of the ways that riio has given innovation more prominence. the mid-period review focused on three specific areas, all of which relate to national grid’s transmission outputs (both gas and electricity). 4. this was a national grid business until 31 march 2017. the business in detail 175 national grid annual report and accounts 2016/17 additional information us

each operating company has a set of rates for service. however, this measure cannot be used in isolation, as there are a number of factors that may prevent us from achieving the allowed roe. these factors include financial market conditions, regulatory lag and decisions by the regulator preventing cost recovery in rates from customers. we work to increase achieved roe through: productivity improvements; positive performance against incentives or earned savings mechanisms such as energy efficiency programmes, where available; and filing a new rate case when achieved returns are lower than the company could reasonably expect to attain through a new rate case. madpu initiated its review of the company’s plan in april 2016 and hearings are scheduled for may 2017 . reforming the energy vision (rev) in april 2014, nypsc instituted the rev proceeding, which envisions a new role for utilities as distributed system platform (dsp) providers who create markets for distributed energy resources (der) and more fully integrate der in distribution system operations and planning. nypsc issued an order on 19 may 2016 addressing ratemaking and utility revenue model policy framework issues under rev, including ratemaking reform, earnings opportunities (platform service revenues and earning adjustment mechanisms or eams), competitive market- based earnings, customer data access, non-wires alternative solutions to displace traditional capital investment, standby service tariff enhancements, opt-in rate design (time-of-use rates, smart home rate pilots), enhancements to large customer demand charges, scorecard metrics, and mass market rate design. our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as at 31 march 2017 . unauthorised access to private customer information may make us liable for a violation of data privacy regulations. most of our businesses are utilities or networks subject to regulation by governments and other authorities. we participate in a number of pension schemes that together cover substantially all our employees. actual performance of scheme assets may be affected by volatility in debt and equity markets. if we were unable to access the capital markets or other sources of finance at competitive rates for a prolonged period, our cost of financing may increase, the discretionary and uncommitted elements of our proposed capital investment programme may need to be reconsidered and the manner in which we implement our strategy may need to be reassessed. such events could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and prospects. one of the principal limits requires national grid plc to hold an investment grade long-term senior unsecured debt credit rating. in addition, some of our regulatory arrangements impose restrictions on the way we can operate. banks who provide us with credit facilities may also fail to perform under those contracts. the directors (other than a director acting in an executive capacity) are paid fees for their services. in total, these fees must not exceed £2,000,000 per year or any higher sum decided by an ordinary resolution at a general meeting of shareholders. each director must retire at least every three years, although they will be eligible for re-election. under the articles, any other general meeting may be convened provided at least 14 clear days’ written notice is given, subject to annual approval of shareholders. under the uk disclosure guidance and transparency rules sourcebook, there is also an obligation on a person who acquires or ceases to have a notifiable interest in shares in national grid to notify the company of that fact. this discussion deals only with us holders who hold adss or ordinary shares as capital assets. for non-corporate us holders, long-term capital gain is generally taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. if a claim is made within the specified period, any sdrt which has been paid will be refunded. us holders should consult their tax advisors about these rules and any other reporting obligations that may apply to the ownership or disposition of adss or ordinary shares, including reporting requirements related to the holding of certain foreign financial assets. the board continues to monitor and note possible conflicts of interest that each director may have. • the nyse rules require a separate audit committee composed of at least three independent members. alongside these indemnities, the company places directors’ and officers’ liability insurance cover for each director. national grid believes that it can conduct its relationships with trade unions and employees in a satisfactory manner. this authority is therefore being sought to ensure that none of the company’s activities inadvertently infringe these rules. we only disclose directly incurred expenditure, and not those amounts our partners contribute to joint or collaborative projects. our control room and forecasting team have already been able to use the initial output from our solar pv monitoring and forecasting work, to help with balancing the system at times of high levels of solar generation. nget’s transmission & distribution interface 2.0 project is an £8 million ofgem network innovation competition award announced on wednesday 30 november 2016. this is a new regional power market trial that will improve interaction between national grid’s system operator (so), uk power networks’ role as regional electricity distributor and renewable energy generators connected to the distribution system. if successful, the regional power market model could be introduced to 59 other sites and potentially save up to £412 million for uk consumers by 2050. we are also working in partnership with scottish power electricity networks on their £16 million phoenix nic project which aims to demonstrate how hybrid synchronous compensation could overcome technical limitations that currently limit the proportion of power generation from renewable sources and interconnectors that the great britain electricity system can handle. our innovation portfolio has continued to develop throughout 2016/17 , with a continued focus on new techniques for safety and risk reduction through projects such as 3d laser scanning for more accurate pipeline condition assessment and removable composite transition pieces to access pipelines more easily. innovation in uk gd continued to focus on six value areas which reflect both the riio outputs. in addition, we have made a new tool available for our engineers to help find underground pipes more quickly. in february 2017 , national grid received two epri technology transfer awards for the rd&d work on smart inverters and distributed energy resources hosting capacity. note 4 on page 101 explains in detail the items which are excluded from our adjusted profit measures. however, we believe that by presenting our financial performance in two components it is easier to read and interpret financial performance between periods, as adjusted profit measures are more comparable having removed the distorting effect of the excluded items. we separately monitor and disclose the excluded items as a component of our overall financial performance. st william property limited is excluded based on the nature of this joint venture arrangement. depreciation and amortisation costs were £51 million higher this year at constant currency as a result of ongoing investment in our networks. in the us, adjusted operating profit was £143 million higher, reflecting lower spend on upgrades to our finance systems which completed last year. as a capital- intensive business, we have significant amounts of physical assets and corresponding borrowings. further information on our pension and other post-retirement obligations can be found in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements. 2017 2016 1 2015 1 2014 1 2013 1,2 summary income statement (£m) continuing operations revenue 15,035 13,212 13,357 12,941 12,673 operating profit
