proof five 10 centaur media plc annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2017 performance: ceo review overview of 2017 it has been an important year for centaur media as we continued our transformation to becoming one of the uk’s leading b2b business information groups. this materially strengthened several aspects of the group’s financial management whilst improving working capital and cash flow. positive outlook although advertising market conditions remain challenging, they represent a decreasing share of group revenue. organic growth is forecast to come from improving customer lifetime value, cross-selling and international scalability of digital intelligence products. customer satisfaction scores (nps) have increased year-on-year, firmly establishing the festival as a leading global event. we’re delighted to see it continue to grow as the only global event in the sector where brand marketers comprise over 60% of its customer base compared with competitors such as festival of media and advertising week with 10-15%. marketing week’s successful mini mba in marketing underpinned the development of a centaur-wide online classroom platform which successfully launched a series of modern-day micro learning modules and online classrooms for econsultancy, celebrity intelligence and the lawyer. the team had success in broadening their remit with clients such as ey and samsung. however, given market demand for elearning and growth potential, oystercatchers’ training team has been consolidated within econsultancy creating a combined force to deliver digital excellence. the acquisition has enabled centaur to deploy best practice telemarketing capabilities at scale and better leverage data insight. it has also created a base from which to exploit growing market demand for integrated, automated marketing and intelligence services. we anticipate a good year’s performance as remaining product upgrades are completed and the enhanced commercial capability of marketmakers begins to connect. outlook: this segment is expected to exhibit steady growth into 2018 driven by recurring digital premium content revenues and integration with marketmakers. premium content now represents 38% (including clean energy pipeline) of total revenue with over 160 large law firms taking up enterprise subscription licences. commercial packages are sold across the brands to enable cross-media solutions for sponsors and clients. our male to female ratio is well balanced and we retain strong representation of women at a senior level. cash conversion 4 the percentage by which adjusted operating cash flow 3 covers adjusted operating profit 2 , excluding depreciation and amortisation, as set out in the cfo’s review non-financials two non-financial kpis have been chosen: delighted customers/nps and customer life-time value. however, when considering group performance, we believe it more appropriate to consider total revenue and adjusted operating profit 2 generated over the year. therefore, we have chosen to focus on revenue including the home interest segment until disposal and marketmakers from acquisition. we are delighted to be in a positive net cash position.” swag mukerji chief financial officer centaur-ar2017.indd 18 26/03/2018 17:25:50 25895 26 march 2018 5:23 pm proof five 25895 26 march 2018 5:23 pm proof five 19 www.centaurmedia.com strategic report summary commentary on revenues and operating results is set out within the ceo’s review. centaur defines adjusted operating cashflow 3 as cash flow from operations excluding the impact of adjusting items, which are defined above. initial net consideration was £16.5m with a further balance due upon successful achievement of earn-out targets. conclusion 2017 has been a transformative period in the group as it moves towards its goal of advising, informing and connecting. • centaur has a business continuity plan which includes its it systems and there is daily, overnight back-up of data, stored off-site. stricter requirements regarding how centaur handles personal data, including that of customers and the risk of a fine from the ico, third party claims (e.g. from customers) as well as reputational damage if we do not comply. centaur may also suffer reputational damage and loss of investor confidence resulting from any operational disruption. the non-print media sector has high levels of competition from a wider group and low barriers to entry. • our business plans take into account the market shrinkage and where appropriate print products are being replaced. in 2017 we reduced print volumes by over 60% across the financial, legal, marketing and hr portfolios. • we support our product innovation, by hiring people with experiences and skills in new areas of the market where appropriate. where appropriate, this analysis is carried out to evaluate the potential impact of the group’s principal risks actually occurring, such as print and advertising revenues continuing to shrink, staff attrition, uk economic conditions and replication of products by competitors. we proudly support flexible working opportunities, and 6% of staff are employed on a part-time basis. she began her career in media at reed elsevier launching telecom-based information services across europe. chairman of the remuneration committee and

non-executive director of hoppa limited. market conditions remain challenging and performance has varied compared to expectations in certain parts of the business. we checked and confirmed that the allocation of cgus to segments was consistent with internal management reporting. for example, certain trade receivables may be being pursued through legal avenues and these are mainly provided against. customers on direct debit payment plans or where deferred income exists are also factors taken into account in determining if a provision for impairment is required. this included checking that amounts excluded from this computation were appropriate, such as amounts invoiced in advance of exhibitions (where there is an associated liability held within deferred income); and • considered the levels of post year end cash received and allocated against aged trade receivables at the year end. a detailed scoping exercise to determine which entities should be included for testing was therefore not performed. rationale for benchmark applied we believe that adjusted profit before tax provides us with a consistent period on period basis for determining materiality and eliminates the disproportionate effect of a small number of items on the profit before tax. other there are no other standards that are not yet effective and that would be expected to have a material impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions. as such, statement of comprehensive income items relating to business combinations are removed from adjusted results. as such, statement of comprehensive income items relating to business combinations are removed from adjusted results. it is defined as adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation of intangible assets other than those acquired through a business combination. net debt is calculated as cash less overdrafts and bank borrowings under the group’s financing arrangements. acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. revenue from project work and consultancy contracts is recognised when the group has obtained the right to consideration in exchange for its performance, which is when a separately identifiable phase (milestone) of a contract has been completed. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. goodwill and acquired intangible assets are assessed for impairment in accordance with ias 36. in assessing whether a write-down of goodwill and acquired intangible assets is required, the carrying value of the segment is compared with its recoverable amount. they are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the statement of financial position date. items relating to earn-out consideration are treated as an adjusting item under the group’s accounting policy. (vii) valuation of intangibles intangible assets acquired in a business combination are required to be recognised separately from goodwill and amortised over their useful life. 2017 marketing £m
