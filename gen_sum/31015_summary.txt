This materially strengthened several aspects of the Group’s financial management whilst improving working capital and cash flow. In short, Centaur Media is now converting audiences to customers and consolidating around its strongest brands. Organic growth is forecast to come from improving customer lifetime value, cross-selling and international scalability of digital intelligence products. We’re delighted to see it continue to grow as the only global event in the sector where brand marketers comprise over 60% of its customer base compared with competitors such as Festival of Media and Advertising Week with 10-15%. However, given market demand for Elearning and growth potential, Oystercatchers’ training team has been consolidated within Econsultancy creating a combined force to deliver digital excellence. Along with Celebrity Intelligence and Fashion & Beauty Monitor, Econsultancy’s digital product offering will be upgraded to provide a more competitive ‘essential marketing learning tool’. The acquisition has enabled Centaur to deploy best practice telemarketing capabilities at scale and better leverage data insight. It has also created a base from which to exploit growing market demand for integrated, automated marketing and intelligence services. We anticipate a good year’s performance as remaining product upgrades are completed and the enhanced commercial capability of MarketMakers begins to connect. Outlook: this segment is expected to exhibit steady growth into 2018 driven by recurring digital premium content revenues and integration with MarketMakers. Premium content now represents 38% (including Clean Energy Pipeline) of total revenue with over 160 large law firms taking up enterprise subscription licences. Our male to female ratio is well balanced and we retain strong representation of women at a senior level. However, when considering Group performance, we believe it more appropriate to consider total revenue and adjusted operating profit 2 generated over the year. Therefore, we have chosen to focus on revenue including the Home Interest segment until disposal and MarketMakers from acquisition. We are delighted to be in a positive net cash position.” SWAG MUKERJI Chief Financial Officer Centaur-AR2017.indd 18 26/03/2018 17:25:50 25895 26 March 2018 5:23 PM Proof Five 25895 26 March 2018 5:23 PM Proof Five 19 www.centaurmedia.com STRATEGIC REPORT Summary Commentary on revenues and operating results is set out within the CEO’s Review. Centaur defines adjusted operating cashflow 3 as cash flow from operations excluding the impact of adjusting items, which are defined above. Conclusion 2017 has been a transformative period in the Group as it moves towards its goal of advising, informing and connecting. • Centaur has a business continuity plan which includes its IT systems and there is daily, overnight back-up of data, stored off-site. Centaur may also suffer reputational damage and loss of investor confidence resulting from any operational disruption. The non-print media sector has high levels of competition from a wider group and low barriers to entry. • Our Business Plans take into account the market shrinkage and where appropriate print products are being replaced. • We support our product innovation, by hiring people with experiences and skills in new areas of the market where appropriate. Where appropriate, this analysis is carried out to evaluate the potential impact of the Group’s principal risks actually occurring, such as print and advertising revenues continuing to shrink, staff attrition, UK economic conditions and replication of products by competitors. From August 2009 to July 2013, Andria was Chief Executive Officer of EMI Music UK & Ireland during which time she successfully transformed the business into a high margin global rights management enterprise by driving consumer focus and digital innovation. Prior to joining Centaur Media in 2015 Steve held Managing Director roles at WGSN, i2i Events, Emap plc (now Ascential), Hachette and Hearst. Shareholder communication centres primarily on the publication of annual reports, periodic press releases, investor presentations and trading updates. Training has been mandatory for those groups of employees identified and is available as required to new joiners. The Audit Committee will be notified of any issues raised through this process and appropriate action taken. The Committee has assessed management’s identification of risk and concluded that appropriate mitigating actions are being taken. Any annual bonus greater than 75% of basic salary will continue to be awarded in Centaur Media Plc shares and deferred for three years; and • LTIP awards are expected to be granted on a basis consistent with awards granted in prior years in terms of grant levels (100% of salary) and performance targets (50% based on EPS, 50% based on relative Total Shareholder Return). Note that payments may be made under arrangements in place prior to this policy becoming effective (including pension, other benefits and incentives). Cash supplements may also be paid Up to 15% of base salary Not applicable Other benefits • Aids retention and recruitment • Executive Directors are provided with private medical insurance • Other benefits including company car allowance may be provided if considered appropriate by the Committee There is no maximum.

Market conditions remain challenging and performance has varied compared to expectations in certain parts of the business. We checked and confirmed that the allocation of CGUs to segments was consistent with internal management reporting. For example, certain trade receivables may be being pursued through legal avenues and these are mainly provided against. Customers on direct debit payment plans or where deferred income exists are also factors taken into account in determining if a provision for impairment is required. This included checking that amounts excluded from this computation were appropriate, such as amounts invoiced in advance of exhibitions (where there is an associated liability held within deferred income); and • Considered the levels of post year end cash received and allocated against aged trade receivables at the year end. A detailed scoping exercise to determine which entities should be included for testing was therefore not performed. Rationale for benchmark applied We believe that Adjusted profit before tax provides us with a consistent period on period basis for determining materiality and eliminates the disproportionate effect of a small number of items on the profit before tax. Date of adoption by the Group Must be applied for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2018. Consequently, a change to revenue recognised in any given operating segment is almost wholly the effect of timing differences under IFRS 15. It is defined as adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation of intangible assets other than those acquired through a business combination. Net debt is calculated as cash less overdrafts and bank borrowings under the Group’s financing arrangements. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the statement of financial position date. Items relating to earn-out consideration are treated as an adjusting item under the Group’s accounting policy. (vii) Valuation of intangibles Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are required to be recognised separately from goodwill and amortised over their useful life. No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of the remaining £0.4m (2016: £0.3m) as it is not currently considered probable that there will be future sufficient taxable profits available. The amount payable is dependent on achieving pre-determined EBITDA levels and has been treated as contingent consideration. Awards vested over a period of two or three years, with the only condition being continued employment. This plan is open to all employees who have been employed by the Group for more than 12 months. The shares can be withdrawn with tax paid at any time, or tax-free after five years. The Group does not consider that it is subject to any significant concentrations of credit risk. Specific provision is made against customer balances with known credit issues or where debt has been referred to a collection agency. At 31 December 2017, there are debtors greater than 90 days past due with a carrying value of £0.1m (2016: £1.6m) which have not been provided against. The credit quality of trade receivables not yet due nor impaired has been assessed as acceptable. All credit and recovery risk associated with trade receivables has been provided for in the statement of financial position. If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s net profit after tax would increase / decrease by an insignificant amount.
