proof five 10 centaur media plc annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2017 performance: ceo review overview of 2017 it has been an important year for centaur media as we continued our transformation to becoming one of the uk’s leading b2b business information groups. however, given market demand for elearning and growth potential, oystercatchers’ training team has been consolidated within econsultancy creating a combined force to deliver digital excellence. it has also created a base from which to exploit growing market demand for integrated, automated marketing and intelligence services. we anticipate a good year’s performance as remaining product upgrades are completed and the enhanced commercial capability of marketmakers begins to connect. outlook: this segment is expected to exhibit steady growth into 2018 driven by recurring digital premium content revenues and integration with marketmakers. premium content now represents 38% (including clean energy pipeline) of total revenue with over 160 large law firms taking up enterprise subscription licences. however, when considering group performance, we believe it more appropriate to consider total revenue and adjusted operating profit 2 generated over the year. centaur defines adjusted operating cashflow 3 as cash flow from operations excluding the impact of adjusting items, which are defined above. conclusion 2017 has been a transformative period in the group as it moves towards its goal of advising, informing and connecting. • centaur has a business continuity plan which includes its it systems and there is daily, overnight back-up of data, stored off-site. • we support our product innovation, by hiring people with experiences and skills in new areas of the market where appropriate. prior to joining centaur media in 2015 steve held managing director roles at wgsn, i2i events, emap plc (now ascential), hachette and hearst. note that payments may be made under arrangements in place prior to this policy becoming effective (including pension, other benefits and incentives). cash supplements may also be paid up to 15% of base salary not applicable other benefits • aids retention and recruitment • executive directors are provided with private medical insurance • other benefits including company car allowance may be provided if considered appropriate by the committee there is no maximum. any annual bonus greater than 75% of basic salary will be awarded in centaur media plc shares and deferred for three years. board changes and payments for loss of office (audited) there were no board changes during 2017 although following the year end, neil johnson replaced ron sandler as chairman from 3 january 2018. no payments for loss of office were paid or are payable to ron sandler. payments to past directors (audited) consistent with a long-standing arrangement, graham sherren, former chief executive and chairman, was paid £3,000 during the year for advisory services performed. the tables below set out details of executive directors’ outstanding share awards under ltip schemes (which will vest in future years, subject to performance and continued service). interests in share schemes total 31 december 2016 31 december 2017 ltip executive andria vidler 153,930 159,438 not yet 1,970,305 2,129,743 swagatam mukerji 30,000 35,505 not yet 1,121,940

or where deferred income exists are also factors taken into account in determining if a provision for impairment is required. this included checking that amounts excluded from this computation were appropriate, such as amounts invoiced in advance of exhibitions (where there is an associated liability held within deferred income); and • considered the levels of post year end cash received and allocated against aged trade receivables at the year end. it is defined as adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation of intangible assets other than those acquired through a business combination. (vii) valuation of intangibles intangible assets acquired in a business combination are required to be recognised separately from goodwill and amortised over their useful life. no deferred tax has been recognised in respect of the remaining £0.4m (2016: £0.3m) as it is not currently considered probable that there will be future sufficient taxable profits available. specific provision is made against customer balances with known credit issues or where debt has been referred to a collection agency. at 31 december 2017, there are debtors greater than 90 days past due with a carrying value of £0.1m (2016: £1.6m) which have not been provided against. if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the group’s net profit after tax would increase / decrease by an insignificant amount.
