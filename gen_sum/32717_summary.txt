The funds raised have improved an already robust capital position, with our solvency coverage ratio standing at 150.4 percent at 30 June 2017 and A.M. Best, the ratings agency, upgrading its outlook on GBGI’s Financial Strength rating in July 2017. We expanded our business into the Georgia region, via an investment with a local operator, whilst strengthening origination relationships worldwide. In July 2017 the Board welcomed Doug Trussler as a new Non-Executive Director and representative of our long term shareholder, Bison Capital. We have a proven business model, strong financial profile and a drive to deliver sustainable growth that is underpinned by prudent underwriting – which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver enhanced shareholder returns for the future. Bill Ward Non-Executive Chairman 21 November 2017 Building on proven, sustainable growth, the Group achieved a milestone this year of over $183.5 million gross written premiums. Strong financial performance Gross written premiums (“GWP”) grew 19.4 percent to $183.5 million, driven by moderate rate increases and growth in policy count. An increase in the business we retain on balance sheet, underpinned by our consistent loss ratio track record, drove higher net earned premiums, up 29.3 percent to $91.4 million. A more detailed commentary can be found in the Chief Financial Officer’s review on pages 07 to 09. Whilst GBGI is already active in over 120 jurisdictions, we continually assess and conduct due diligence in territories where we are not currently active to determine if it’s appropriate for shareholders to allocate resources and capital. I’m pleased with the progress made in Georgia and it is a market demonstrating real potential. Building upon our established brand and track record, GBGI has expanded its product footprint, targeting the corporate market in particular. We can clearly see the opportunities for further product and territory penetration in Latin America and we will seek to deliver on these opportunities whilst delivering a consistently high level of service to customers. The latter was launched in July 2016, providing worldwide customer support with access to assistance on a wide range of medical services, from basic enquiries to emergency medical situations, 24 hours a day and in over 180 different languages. The business has performed very well in its first year of operation and offers tangible growth opportunities, with low capital input. I would like to thank all our colleagues for their efforts during the year and subsequently. We continue our expansion plans in the student, travel and short-term medical markets which demonstrate strong demand characteristics. Summary We will continue to enhance our position as a leading provider of global benefits insurance, globally. These results once again demonstrate the excellent progress we have made in developing our business over the years from an agency model through to a full service, integrated insurer writing profitable insurance business across 120 jurisdictions. This further strengthening was recognized by A.M. Best as it upgraded its outlook on our Financial Strength rating to B++ (Good) in July 2017. We also write both long-term and short-term disability products with benefits typically set as a proportion of the insured’s salary. Looking forward we expect retention levels to stabilise broadly around 60 percent for the next two policy years. Commission and Fees income grew 14.4 percent to $42.9 million, marginally lower than GWP growth, but in line with expectations. Balance sheet Net assets and working capital Net assets at 30 June 2017 were $58.4 million (30 June 2016: $28.2 million), with growth driven by the combined effect of growth in GWP, cash generation, IPO related restructuring and equity raise.

Accounting policies continued New standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective The following new standards, interpretations and amendments, which are not yet effective and have not been adopted early in this financial statements, will or may have an effect on the Group’s future financial statements: > IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, effective annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, endorsed by the EU. This preliminary assessment is based on currently available information and may be subject to changes arising from further detailed analyses or additional reasonable and supportable information being made available to the Group in the future. An entity may apply the temporary exemption from IFRS 9 if: (i) it has not previously applied any version of IFRS 9 before and (ii) its activities are predominantly connected with insurance on its annual reporting date that immediately precedes 1 April 2016. An entity can apply the temporary exemption from IFRS 9 for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. For general insurance contracts, IFRS 17 will introduce mandatory discounting of loss reserves expected to be paid in more than one year as well as risk adjustment, for which confidence level equivalent disclosure will be required. Other long-term employee benefits The Group and its subsidiaries make payments to defined contribution benefit arrangements on behalf of employees. After initial measurement, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost less allowance for impairment. They represent balances where the Group is not able to avoid settlement in cash or another financial asset. Commission income is recognised as one unit of account on a pro-rata basis over the policy period. Any dividends paid for the redeemable preferred stocks and class D shares are classified as finance costs. t) Deferred acquisition cost Those direct and indirect costs incurred during the financial period arising from acquiring or renewing of insurance contracts and/or investment contracts are deferred to the extent that these costs are recoverable out of future premiums from insurance contract. The Group takes all reasonable steps to ensure that it has appropriate information regarding its claims exposures. Ineffective strategy/failure of product: When an inappropriate strategy or product is introduced for a specific business line or the Group as whole, there is an increased risk that material financial and reputational losses will occur. Failure to manage risk aggregation/accumulation: The Group may be exposed to an increased likelihood of disproportionate losses for specific perils if insured risks are overly focused on a specific geographical area or type of policy cover. The key assumptions selected are average claim costs or number of claims for each incident year as these factors can be quantified whereas other assumptions like legislative changes or change in patterns of claim incidence are not easily quantifiable. At each period end, foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate. The Group faces a risk of material losses and cash flow issues if third party obligors are unable to pay amounts due. Non-IT systems failure: The Group also potentially faces a risk of business interruptions and inefficiencies from a wide range of potential issues, such as insufficient or inadequately skilled staff, accounting errors, errors in processing such as mis-matching reinsurance contracts, poor customer service, badly executed projects and extreme events such as fires or natural disasters that affect the Group’s offices and staff. The Group seeks to manage this risk through a number of policies and procedures in place covering regulatory requirements. These policies are reviewed periodically by key senior management and the Group’s legal department to ensure that they provide a basic framework within which the Group is compliant with local and regional regulatory requirements. Basic and diluted earnings per share 2017 2016 Profit attributable to the equity holders ($000s) 13,459 10,370 Weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue (in numbers) 73,643,652 66,418,950 Basic and diluted earnings per share ($) 0.18 0.16 As at 30 June 2017, the total number of potentially dilutive shares related to outstanding stock options was 2,328,900 (30 June 2016: zero). Unremitted insurance premiums are held in a fiduciary capacity until the Group disburses them and is classified as restricted cash. Reserving is a complex process dealing with uncertainty, requiring the use of informed estimates and judgments. In accordance with the Insurance Business (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law 2002, the minimum capital requirement of GIL, being a licensed insurer writing general insurance business, is £100,000 (equivalent to $130,000) as at 30 June 2017 and (equivalent to $134,000) as at 30 June 2016. The goodwill is attributable mainly to QHM’s extensive provider network and cost containment strategies. All other term notes remained unchanged, including the payment of interest compounded quarterly at 2.5%. These advances are included within prepaid expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Some of these employment contracts do not have a term and expire upon retirement or termination.
