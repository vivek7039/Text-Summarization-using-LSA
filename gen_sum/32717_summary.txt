we expanded our business into the georgia region, via an investment with a local operator, whilst strengthening origination relationships worldwide. bill ward non-executive chairman 21 november 2017 building on proven, sustainable growth, the group achieved a milestone this year of over 183.5 million gross written premiums. strong financial performance gross written premiums (“gwp”) grew 19.4 percent to 183.5 million, driven by moderate rate increases and growth in policy count. an increase in the business we retain on balance sheet, underpinned by our consistent loss ratio track record, drove higher net earned premiums, up 29.3 percent to 91.4 million. whilst gbgi is already active in over 120 jurisdictions, we continually assess and conduct due diligence in territories where we are not currently active to determine if it’s appropriate for shareholders to allocate resources and capital. i’m pleased with the progress made in georgia and it is a market demonstrating real potential. building upon our established brand and track record, gbgi has expanded its product footprint, targeting the corporate market in particular. the latter was launched in july 2016, providing worldwide customer support with access to assistance on a wide range of medical services, from basic enquiries to emergency medical situations, 24 hours a day and in over 180 different languages. the business has performed very well in its first year of operation and offers tangible growth opportunities, with low capital input. tiecare works primarily with u.s.-centric international schools, and is planning to redeploy marketing resources to move into additional educational segments and offer a broader product portfolio in 2018. benefitting from underwriting excellence over recent periods the business has sought to leverage its underwriting approach, agility and proven track record by retaining more of the risk it writes on balance sheet. i would like to thank all our colleagues for their efforts during the year and subsequently. we continue our expansion plans in the student, travel and short-term medical markets which demonstrate strong demand characteristics. summary we will continue to enhance our position as a leading provider of global benefits insurance, globally. we also write both long-term and short-term disability products with benefits typically set as a proportion of the insured’s salary. looking forward we expect retention levels to stabilise broadly around 60 percent for the next two policy years. commission and fees income grew 14.4 percent to 42.9 million, marginally lower than gwp growth, but in line with expectations. his independent non-executive experience includes al noor hospitals group plc, which was a ftse 250 company. 11 strategic
