Velocys with its commercial scale technology and new business model is now entering renewable fuels markets to grow a material supply position. www.velocys.com Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 “I believe we will look back at 201 7 as the year V elocys transformed into a renewable fuels company . Leverage capabilities We work seamlessly with our partners to deliver modular, fully integrated, financeable, cost-effective and operations-ready biorefineries. There is a plentiful supply of woody biomass in the US from entirely sustainable sources that do not compete with food crops for land. As evidenced by, for example, the US Department of Energy’s 2016 Billion Ton report, by 2030 it is estimated that there will be available over 200m dry tonnes/ year of economically-accessible, non- federal timberland forestry biomass in the US – enough to support several dozen Velocys plants. Delivering an ongoing domestic source of Cellulosic Biofuel will be a significant milestone for the US renewable fuels industry. Susan Robertson stepped down as Chief Financial Officer in August 2017 , a role she held for nine years. Working through these obstacles at the Oklahoma plant has afforded a number of learning opportunities that Velocys will apply to future biorefineries, reducing technology risk and further optimising operations. Other significant risks identified and associated mitigation actions with the project development programme are outlined on pages 20 to 22. Outlook I believe we will look back at 2017 as the year Velocys transformed into a renewable fuels company. The same core Velocys technology will be deployed in future biorefineries that we and our partners are developing. These operational challenges required additional funding of ENVIA from Velocys, and that is discussed in the Financial review on pages 16 to 17 . (VPI LF-GTL, who is a part owner of ENVIA Energy LLC, was not subject to the bankruptcy proceedings).

TRI is an innovative leader in its field and has committed significant resources to a joint work programme. Velocys has been offered economic development incentives from Adams County estimated to be worth the equivalent of $42m. Feedstock agreements have been prepared, and supply logistics are being tested as part of the IDU process in order to reduce operational risk. There remain a number of key milestones still to be delivered, and in particular , project equity funding has not yet been secured. Project benefits CO 2 The jet fuel produced is expected to deliver over 70% greenhouse gas reduction and 90% reduction in particulate matter emissions compared with conventional jet fuel, thereby contributing to both carbon emissions reductions and local air quality improvements around major airports.

There is considerable legislative support for these renewable fuels at both the US federal and state level. Renewable fuels produced by the FT process are highly paraffinic and do not contain aromatics or sulphur. Failure to have reliable, long-term offtakers or active spot sales of products could affect revenue forecasts and ongoing operations. A financial advisor, appointed by Velocys, will manage the process of due diligence, deal construction and closure. Regular meetings with the partners have driven alignment on project requirements and timeline to making investment decisions. It has modelled steady state and upset operations under conditions that will be experienced at future commercial plants. Indications are that Velocys’ technology will be able to meet both quantity and quality expectations for finished products. Velocys’ strategy is to de-risk its future projects by selecting commercially-proven technologies and piloting significant components of the flowsheet. For its projects, Velocys is focused on engaging operators who are fully qualified and well-trained in the operation of such plants. Renewable fuels credits (such as those issued under the Low Carbon Fuel Standard in California) could be withdrawn. Such advances take time to develop and provide Velocys with a significant competitive advantage beyond its core Fischer-Tropsch technology capability. Based on regularly updated cash flow forecasts the required currency mix is identified and foreign exchange contracts taken out accordingly. For example, the Company does not comply with:   FCA Listing Rule 9.8.6R (which includes the ‘comply or explain’ requirement);   FCA Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTR) Section 7 .2 (which set out certain mandatory disclosures);   Competition and Markets Authority’s Final Order 1 (for UK incorporated FTSE 350 companies only). Under its terms of reference, no director is permitted to participate in decisions concerning his or her own remuneration. He is currently CEO of Envirofusion, a company with nascent technology in the waste-to-energy and biomass-to-power sector . Re-election The Company’s Articles of Association provide that directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first opportunity after their appointment, and that one third of directors are subject to retirement by rotation at each Annual General Meeting. An agreed procedure exists for directors in the furtherance of their duties to take independent professional advice. Assets that could be sold were targeted at potential end users, dealers, clearance agents and scrap merchants. The Non-Executive Directors are paid a fixed fee and do not receive any pension payments, bonus or other benefits. Under the Company’s Articles of Association, all directors are required to stand for re-election by shareholders on appointment and thereafter at least once every three years.

The Company has not chosen to early adopt these standards, but they are considered relevant for future accounting periods. Accounting policies (continued) Transactions and balances (continued) On this basis the loans to subsidiaries, being monetary items that are receivable from a foreign subsidiary undertaking, are regarded as an extension of the Company’s net investment in that foreign subsidiary undertaking. Although these estimates and judgements are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount and/or timing, actual results ultimately may differ. This includes facilitating project development by putting together partnerships with technology licensors, engineers, feedstock suppliers, offtakers and financing entities. Based on management’s judgement, all products and services offered within the operating segment have similar economic characteristics. When uncertainty subsequently arises, any resulting provision is recognised as an expense and not a reduction in revenue. Other income derived from sales of fixed assets and non-commercial activities is recognised on an accruals basis. Goodwill created from a stock purchase such as that of Velocys Inc.is not deductible for US tax purposes. Share-based payments Velocys plc issues share options to employees of its subsidiaries that are accounted for as equity settled. This has been adjusted, using management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. Movements in the number of options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise prices are as follows. Movements in the number of options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise prices are as follows. Movements in the number of consultants’ share options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise prices are as follows. Based on management’s judgement, all products and services offered within the operating segment have similar economic characteristics. Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, which for plant and machinery is three to ten years. Assets are reviewed for impairment annually and also whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. This value distribution is considered a more appropriate measure of the Company’s economic interest in ENVIA. As at 31 December 2017 , draw downs on this facility had been made by ENVIA in the amount of $13.0m (£9.6m) (2016: $0.4m (£0.3m)). Items purchased for use in externally funded research and development projects are expensed to that contract immediately. Financial instruments (continued) Exchange rates A significant proportion of commercial activity and development costs are US-dollar denominated. Where possible, revenue is receipted in US dollars to act as a natural hedge against this exposure. This risk is managed by carrying out relevant financial checks on customers, and where necessary, requiring letters of credit or advance payments. Judgement In May 2017 18,000,000 loan notes were issued to the Company’s two largest shareholders at a price of £0.50 per share. As at 31 December 2017 , draw downs on this facility had been made by ENVIA in the amount of £13,010,000 (2016: $400,000 – see note 19).
