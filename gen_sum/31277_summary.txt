velocys with its commercial scale technology and new business model is now entering renewable fuels markets to grow a material supply position. www.velocys.com velocys plc annual report and accounts 2017 “i believe we will look back at 201 7 as the year v elocys transformed into a renewable fuels company . red rock biofuels may 2018 (post-period end) biorefinery being developed by third party project developer commences construction. 1. business model we initiate and drive the development of biorefineries from concept to full operations. we will derive a stream of dividends from those equity stakes in the operating biorefineries. 2. leverage capabilities we work seamlessly with our partners to deliver modular, fully integrated, financeable, cost-effective and operations-ready biorefineries. in the us, diesel consumption is around 40bn gallons/year with 25% growth predicted by the eia to 2040. there is an urgent and increasing demand for drop-in renewable fuels in this market that are fully compatible with existing infrastructure and engines. there is a plentiful supply of woody biomass in the us from entirely sustainable sources that do not compete with food crops for land. as evidenced by, for example, the us department of energy’s 2016 billion ton report, by 2030 it is estimated that there will be available over 200m dry tonnes/ year of economically-accessible, non- federal timberland forestry biomass in the us – enough to support several dozen velocys plants. renewable diesel sold in california also qualifies for state low carbon fuel standard (lcfs) credits, traded in terms of carbon emissions prevented, and are currently worth around $0.8 - $1.2 per gallon for fuels that have a 60% ghg reduction. states in the north eastern us, such as massachusetts, are also considering an lcfs-type regulation. delivering an ongoing domestic source of cellulosic biofuel will be a significant milestone for the us renewable fuels industry. it did so in mid- 201 7 after taking decisive action to capitalise on its achievements at envia. susan robertson stepped down as chief financial officer in august 2017 , a role she held for nine years. david pummell chief executive officer introduction 2017 was a challenging year for velocys, but despite this, the company has made significant progress towards developing what we expect will be the first of a number of repeatable biorefineries. as outlined in the financial review (see page 17) further funding is required to reach this milestone. envia has achieved significant milestones in the last 12 months, notwithstanding a number of other challenges. working through these obstacles at the oklahoma plant has afforded a number of learning opportunities that velocys will apply to future biorefineries, reducing technology risk and further optimising operations. outlook i believe we will look back at 2017 as the year velocys transformed into a renewable fuels company. the same core velocys technology will be deployed in future biorefineries that we and our partners are developing. financial modelling shows that rin revenues are required for the plant to be cash flow positive. these operational challenges required additional funding of envia from velocys, and that is discussed in the financial review on pages 16 to 17 .

gas biomass gas-to-liquids (as at envia) biomass-to-liquids (as at the mississippi biorefinery) the velocys fischer-tropsch process or or raw ft product our process our proven fischer- t ropsch technology is one of a very small number of economic, sustainable routes to produce renewable fuels that can be blended at high percentages with petroleum- based products, and that are compatible with existing infrastructure and engines. with a variation to the upgrading unit operations, other products can be generated, such as waxes. there is considerable legislative support for these renewable fuels at both the us federal and state level. renewable fuels produced by the ft process are highly paraffinic and do not contain aromatics or sulphur. cash outflow in 2017 was £16.6m (2016: £19.4m) comprising £16.3m consumed by operations, less an r&d tax credit received of £1.0m, and a £9.8m increase in the loan to envia, offset by cash received through the may 2017 fundraise of £9.7m (after expenses). at each date, all other terms of the loan, which has a 10% coupon, remained unchanged. as an example, in october 2016 the columbus, ohio site successfully renewed for an additional three years its safety and health achievement recognition program (sharp) certification with the us department of labor’s occupational safety and health administration. failure to have reliable, long-term offtakers or active spot sales of products could affect revenue forecasts and ongoing operations. a financial advisor, appointed by velocys, will manage the process of due diligence, deal construction and closure. velocys will monitor the levee construction progress and take appropriate action for mitigation if required. regular meetings with the partners have driven alignment on project requirements and timeline to making investment decisions. it has modelled steady state and upset operations under conditions that will be experienced at future commercial plants. indications are that velocys’ technology will be able to meet both quantity and quality expectations for finished products. velocys’ strategy is to de-risk its future projects by selecting commercially-proven technologies and piloting significant components of the flowsheet. for its projects, velocys is focused on engaging operators who are fully qualified and well-trained in the operation of such plants. a robust quality assurance programme is followed for the supply of commercial catalyst and reactors. velocys engages actively with california regulators, through industry groups, to ensure its voice is heard. such advances take time to develop and provide velocys with a significant competitive advantage beyond its core fischer-tropsch technology capability. based on regularly updated cash flow forecasts the required currency mix is identified and foreign exchange contracts taken out accordingly. for example, the company does not comply with:   fca listing rule 9.8.6r (which includes the ‘comply or

results ultimately may differ. this transaction was judged to be exceptional by its nature as a potential business combination. this includes facilitating project development by putting together partnerships with technology licensors, engineers, feedstock suppliers, offtakers and financing entities. based on management’s judgement, all products and services offered within the operating segment have similar economic characteristics. when uncertainty subsequently arises, any resulting provision is recognised as an expense and not a reduction in revenue. other income derived from sales of fixed assets and non-commercial activities is recognised on an accruals basis. goodwill created from a stock purchase such as that of velocys inc.is not deductible for us tax purposes. deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affected neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. 15. share-based payments velocys plc issues share options to employees of its subsidiaries that are accounted for as equity settled. this has been adjusted, using management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. movements in the number of options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise prices are as follows. movements in the number of options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise prices are as follows. movements in the number of consultants’ share options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise prices are as follows. in respect of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination, the company recognises these as distinct from goodwill provided they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights, and their fair value can be measured reliably. amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of three years. based on management’s judgement, all products and services offered within the operating segment have similar economic characteristics. a loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed that which would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, which for plant and machinery is three to ten years. assets are reviewed for impairment annually and also whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. this value distribution is considered a more appropriate measure of the company’s economic interest in envia. 2017 2016 £’000 £’000 investment in associate at 1 january 5,865 – movement from

method, less provision for impairment. as at 31 december 2017 , draw downs on this facility had been made by envia in the amount of $13.0m (£9.6m) (2016: $0.4m (£0.3m)). items purchased for use in externally funded research and development projects are expensed to that contract immediately. items purchased for ongoing commercial sale are held in inventory and expensed when used or sold. where possible, revenue is receipted in us dollars to act as a natural hedge against this exposure. this risk is managed by carrying out relevant financial checks on customers, and where necessary, requiring letters of credit or advance payments. the credit risk of liquid funds is limited through a company treasury policy, maintained to ensure that liquid assets are only placed with highly-rated institutions, and that the spread of such assets restricts exposure to any one counterparty. if these criteria are met, the loan notes will be recorded as an equity instrument. judgement in may 2017 18,000,000 loan notes were issued to the company’s two largest shareholders at a price of £0.50 per share. based on these criteria being met the loan notes were recorded as an equity instrument. a
