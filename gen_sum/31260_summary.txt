Once again, the feedback we have received has allowed us to drive change in our business through best practice sharing and even into individual development plans. Vegetation clearance over the course of these days has made a significant difference for both community and wildlife.

Going forwards, John Homer’s salary reviews will be aligned with those of other Executive Directors at 1 January each year.

Robert Moyle and John Homer are invited to attend meetings of the Committee, except when their own remuneration is being discussed, Daniel Taylor attends as secretary except when his own remuneration is being discussed and other Executives attend meetings as required. Performance Share Plan It is intended that awards will be made to certain Executive Directors in 2018 over shares with 100% of salary. These practices include the communication of relevant information on work-related issues to all employees via a monthly newsletter. Shares held in treasury may subsequently be cancelled, sold for cash or used to satisfy options exercised under any of the Company’s share schemes. We also agreed to report differences below this threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.

Judgement is also applied in determining when contracts should be aggregated and treated as a single construction contract. Management have significant experience in making estimates around the percentage-of-completion, based on costs to complete and final project out-turn. Construction contract assets on the Balance Sheet reflect amounts recoverable on construction contracts relating to small works frameworks, manufacture and fabrication projects with low estimation uncertainty, such that there is not considered to be a significant risk that their carrying amounts might change materially within the next financial year.
