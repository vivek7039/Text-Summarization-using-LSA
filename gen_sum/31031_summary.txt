A transformational year for Ebiquity Anticipated £26m sale of Advertising Intelligence business to Nielsen Media Research Limited Clear progress against Growth Acceleration Plan, including expansion of Effectiveness practice in Continental Europe, US, and Singapore, culminating in the addition of a significant, multi-market consumer goods client in Q4 2017 Announced restructure of our business into three core service offerings: Ebiquity Media, Ebiquity Analytics and Ebiquity Tech As previously reported, revenue performance from the US MVM and MPO practices was disappointing and impacted the Group’s revenue performance in 2017. The marketing industry has been through a period of substantial change during this time, bringing with it extraordinary complexity. We acquired additional skills to address some of the emerging opportunities, and our Marketing Performance Optimisation segment was created. There have also been some important new hires of senior executives, individuals with both operational and industry-based skills who will help us capitalise on our position in the marketplace. This means ensuring that marketers work with their partners to choose the level of transparency which is right for them. It is encouraging to hear Marc Pritchard, in his recent address at ISBA, put increased focus on data and analytics, but change will take time in an industry obsessed with shiny new objects often at the expense of employing rigour to drive real business impact. As previously announced, we have appointed a new Chairman, Rob Woodward, who joined Ebiquity on 1 March. Rob succeeds Michael Higgins who will retire after 12 years as Chairman of Ebiquity, following the AGM on 9 May. As clients focused on the issue of media transparency, this significantly benefited FirmDecisions, which recorded exceptional revenue growth in 2017. Central costs, which are not allocated to a segment, were in line with the prior year. Our work in this practice has two distinct service offerings: econometric modelling and customer experience analytics. Mike Campbell Head of International Effectiveness “ Marketers are rewarded by the C-suite for delivering real and tangible ROI. This is supported by specialist insight, market, and earned media research experts who combine automated analytics with native- language human analysis. Michael Karg, PhD Group Chief Executive Officer Christian Polman Chief Strategy Officer “ By creating a three-practice business that addresses our clients’ needs in Media, Analytics, and Tech, we’ve made our market offering both more relevant and more buyable. In this way, we empower our clients to take rightful ownership of their digital marketing strategy, technology, data, and media spend. We have established five-year goals which are grouped into 5Ps, covering: People, Product, Process, Profile, and Performance. It is through talents like these that we will achieve our objective of becoming the world’s leading marketing analytics consultancy. This programme was started in Q4 2016 by the recruitment of new team members whose purpose is to drive operational efficiency and synergies across practices. Our Media practice in Australia has developed an innovative methodology to benchmark and analyse online video advertising performance. With advertisers following audiences who are shifting their viewing habits from broadcast TV towards online video, this methodology enables us to assess performance of online video advertising per se, and compared to the cost and efficiency of traditional TV advertising. The team’s remit includes helping advertisers select, implement, and manage their digital programmatic trading technology. This platform is designed to help agencies upload our advertiser clients’ media data consistently, efficiently, and securely. Our leaders have spoken at more industry events than ever, and they are now regularly contacted for comment. Our research is now quoted in the analyst reports commentating on marketing, including Liberum and Bank of America. There is a risk of an industry-wide talent shortage for data scientists in particular as demand by clients, agencies, internet platforms and publishers increases. There is a risk of an industry-wide talent shortage for data scientists in particular as demand by clients, agencies, internet platforms and publishers increases. And in Tech, we help deploy the right technology – effectively – to create a unified, single customer view. Ebiquity approach We conducted a comprehensive assessment of Mazda’s media investment, price discounts, new car releases, competitor activity, and PR activations along the whole purchase lifecycle. Our marketing effectiveness team built bespoke econometric models to identify Mazda’s most impactful sales drivers. And as Subway is a franchised operation, the team needed to address franchisee questions about what central marketing delivered through social. Our Effectiveness team found that TV and radio drove earned media coverage, while out-of-home had minimal impact. It’s important that everyone relevant in an advertiser business – across multiple functions and levels of responsibility – is involved. Everyone now has far more confidence to ask the right questions, especially around value for money on digital. Outcomes The Britvic marketing and insight team has established a new working framework with its media agency. P&L overview Commentary on segmental revenues are set out within the Chief Executive Officer’s report. Experience Morag spent more than 20 years in ad agencies as a TV buyer, planner and account director. An economics graduate from Cambridge University, Richard subsequently qualified as a chartered accountant with Price Waterhouse (now PwC) in London. From 2007 he was Chief Executive Officer of Orange, leading its turnaround and subsequent successful merger in 2010 with T-Mobile to create Everything Everywhere. After running EE for a further year he left to pursue private equity opportunities and non-executive roles. Andrew Noble (Chief Financial Officer) is responsible for the Group’s worldwide functions in finance, treasury and taxation. Andrew also works closely with the practice principals, regional managing directors and finance leaders across Ebiquity. Richard is currently Chief Executive Officer of Instinctif Partners, who provide Ebiquity with financial PR advice. Rob Woodward (independent Non-Executive Director and Chairman Designate) brings a wealth of Board-level experience to Ebiquity. None of these service agreements entitles a director to receive more than six months’ notice terminating his/her employment. In addition, there were a small number of meetings convened on short notice to consider ad hoc matters. The Company Secretary attends all Board meetings and is available to advise on any corporate governance issues which may arise. Non-audit fees of approximately £46,000 were paid to PwC during the year in connection with Group restructuring activities. No other person has reported an interest of more than 3% in the Company’s ordinary shares. We focused on those Cash Generating Units (CGUs) we considered to carry more judgement because of current year losses or historical underperformance against budgets, or for which management’s impairment assessment model gave lower headroom relative to other CGUs. Where services are performed by an indeterminate number of acts over a specific period, revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the specific period unless there is evidence that some other method better represents the stage of completion.

Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standards and IFRS IC Interpretations (collectively ‘IFRSs’) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) as adopted by European Union (‘Adopted IFRSs’) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies preparing their financial statements under Adopted IFRSs. Where services are performed by an indeterminate number of acts over a specific period, revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the specific period unless there is evidence that some other method better represents the stage of completion. Amortisation commences when the asset is available for use and useful lives range from one to five years. Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful economic lives. Trade and other payables are initially recognised at their nominal value which is usually the original invoiced amount. Actual results may significantly differ from those estimates often as a result of the need to make assumptions about matters which are uncertain. Further details, including a sensitivity analysis, are included in notes 9 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Directors are eligible for cash bonuses as a percentage of base salary, dependent on individual and Company performance against established financial targets. As such, a composite guarantee has been given by all significant subsidiary companies in the UK, US and Germany. On 12 May 2010, 4,200,000 options with an exercise price of 35p each were awarded under the EIP to two Directors. There have been no substantive changes in the Group’s exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods unless otherwise stated in this note. Trade receivables The Group operates in an industry where most of its customers are reputable and well-established multinational or large national businesses. Customers with any overdue debts are contacted for payment and progress is tracked on a credit control report. Based on these procedures, management assessed the credit quality of those receivables that are neither past due nor impaired as low risk. The following table illustrates the contractual maturity analysis of the Group’s financial liabilities: Within One to one year five years Total £’000 £’000 £’000 At 31 December 2017 Trade and other payables 5,119 — 5,119 Accruals 5,560 — 5,560 Finance lease liabilities 4 — 4 Bank loans and overdrafts 3,286 33,774 37,060 Contingent consideration 901 1,193 2,094 Total financial liabilities 14,870 34,967 49,837 Less: finance charges allocated to future periods (1,718) (1,774) (3,492) Present value 13,152 33,193 46,345 At 31 December 2016 Trade and other payables 3,638 — 3,638 Accruals 4,827 — 4,827 Finance lease liabilities 6 6 12 Bank loans and overdrafts 5,484 33,285 38,769 Contingent consideration 1,777 238 2,015 Total financial liabilities 15,732 33,529 49,261 Less: finance charges allocated to future periods (1,014) (3,081) (4,095) Present value 14,718 30,448 45,166 90 Ebiquity plc Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 Fair value measurement The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: • Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; • Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and • Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. Trade and other payables are initially recognised at their nominal value which is usually the original invoiced amount. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle that obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. As such, a composite guarantee has been given by all significant subsidiary companies in the UK, US and Germany.
