the marketing industry has been through a period of substantial change during this time, bringing with it extraordinary complexity. we acquired additional skills to address some of the emerging opportunities, and our marketing performance optimisation segment was created. there have also been some important new hires of senior executives, individuals with both operational and industry-based skills who will help us capitalise on our position in the marketplace. driven by a change in consumer behaviour, the ongoing and incremental opportunities that digital tools, technologies, and social media platforms can offer, marketers can find it hard to keep up with this relentless pace of change. it has never been more challenging to be an effective marketer or marketing procurement professional. this means ensuring that marketers work with their partners to choose the level of transparency which is right for them. it is encouraging to hear marc pritchard, in his recent address at isba, put increased focus on data and analytics, but change will take time in an industry obsessed with shiny new objects often at the expense of employing rigour to drive real business impact. as previously announced, we have appointed a new chairman, rob woodward, who joined ebiquity on 1 march. rob succeeds michael higgins who will retire after 12 years as chairman of ebiquity, following the agm on 9 may. prior to joining stv, rob was commercial director at channel 4 television for four years and was previously a managing director with ubs corporate finance and lead partner for deloitte’s tmt industry group in europe. the mvm segment reported revenue up 9.2%, an increase of 5.2% on a like-for-like, constant currency basis. central costs, which are not allocated to a segment, were in line with the prior year. laetitia zinetti practice principal, media consulting “ good relationships between brands and their agencies need constant vigilance. with the right support and a thought-through, end-to-end process, brands can ensure their agency relationships – both well-established and new – deliver for the long-term future.” we also assess agencies’ compliance with contractual terms via our specialist contract compliance business, firmdecisions. our work in this practice has two distinct service offerings: econometric modelling and customer experience analytics. mike campbell head of international effectiveness “ marketers are rewarded by the c-suite for delivering real and tangible roi. this is supported by specialist insight, market, and earned media research experts who combine automated analytics with native- language human analysis. michael karg, phd group chief executive officer christian polman chief strategy officer “ by creating a three-practice business that addresses our clients’ needs in media, analytics, and tech, we’ve made our market offering both more relevant and more buyable. in this way, we empower our clients to take rightful ownership of their digital marketing strategy, technology, data, and media spend. we have established five-year goals which are grouped into 5ps, covering: people, product, process, profile,

recruitment of new team members whose purpose is to drive operational efficiency and synergies across practices. and it has been strengthened considerably by the appointment of jason bailis at the start of 2018 as global chief operating officer, following a 10-year stint in senior operations roles at publicis groupe, for sapient nitro, razorfish, and digitaslbi. andrew challier chief client officer “ our clients are at the heart of everything we do. our media practice in australia has developed an innovative methodology to benchmark and analyse online video advertising performance. with advertisers following audiences who are shifting their viewing habits from broadcast tv towards online video, this methodology enables us to assess performance of online video advertising per se, and compared to the cost and efficiency of traditional tv advertising. the team’s remit includes helping advertisers select, implement, and manage their digital programmatic trading technology. this platform is designed to help agencies upload our advertiser clients’ media data consistently, efficiently, and securely. 15%) agencies 6% other fees 1% $1.00 all-in $0.06 $0.12 $0.09 $0.72 $0.06 $0.12

create a unified, single customer view. ebiquity approach we conducted a comprehensive assessment of mazda’s media investment, price discounts, new car releases, competitor activity, and pr activations along the whole purchase lifecycle. our marketing effectiveness team built bespoke econometric models to identify mazda’s most impactful sales drivers. and as subway is a franchised operation, the team needed to address franchisee questions about what central marketing delivered through social. our effectiveness team found that tv and radio drove earned media coverage, while out-of-home had minimal impact. it’s important that everyone relevant in an advertiser business – across multiple functions and levels of responsibility – is involved. we ran workshops with multiple teams in different divisions to design the optimal review process. everyone now has far more confidence to ask the right questions, especially around value for money on digital. outcomes the britvic marketing and insight team has established a new working framework with its media agency. p&l overview commentary on segmental revenues are set out within the chief executive officer’s report. experience morag spent more than 20 years in ad agencies as a tv buyer, planner and account director. an economics graduate from cambridge university, richard subsequently qualified as a chartered accountant with price waterhouse (now pwc) in london. after running ee for a further year he left to pursue private equity opportunities and non-executive roles. prior to stv, rob was commercial director at channel 4 television for four years and was previously a managing director with ubs corporate finance and the lead partner for deloitte’s tmt industry group in europe. andrew noble (chief financial officer) is responsible for the group’s worldwide functions in finance, treasury and taxation. andrew also works closely with the practice principals, regional managing directors and finance

enjoyed a highly successful career in the telecoms industry. rob woodward (independent non-executive director and chairman designate) brings a wealth of board-level experience to ebiquity. none of these service agreements entitles a director to receive more than six months’ notice terminating his/her employment. in addition, there were a small number of meetings convened on short notice to consider ad hoc matters. the company secretary attends all board meetings and is available to advise on any corporate governance issues which may arise. the audit & risk committee currently comprises richard nichols, michael higgins, rob woodward and tom alexander. an important vehicle for communications with private shareholders is the company’s annual general meeting. non-audit fees of approximately £46,000 were paid to pwc during the year in connection with group restructuring activities. uses appropriate targets for growth in earnings per share (and/or total shareholder return) over vesting period. 2. andrew noble was appointed as chief financial officer and a director with effect from 9 september 2016. no other person has reported an interest of more than 3% in the company’s ordinary shares. we focused on those cash generating units (cgus) we considered to carry more judgement because of current year losses or historical underperformance against budgets, or for which management’s impairment assessment model gave lower headroom relative to other cgus. where services are performed by an indeterminate number of acts over a specific period, revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the specific period unless there is evidence that some other method better represents the stage of completion. we also considered locations visited and those out of scope

number of acts over a specific period, revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the specific period unless there is evidence that some other method better represents the stage of completion. amortisation commences when the asset is available for use and useful lives range from one to five years. depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful economic lives. trade and other payables are initially recognised at their nominal value which is usually the original invoiced amount. actual results may significantly differ from those estimates often as a result of the need to make assumptions about matters which are uncertain. 64 ebiquity plc annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2017 establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost; fair value through other comprehensive income; and fair value through profit or loss. carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets impairment testing requires management to estimate the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill and other intangible assets have been allocated. further details,

from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; • level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and • level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability
