Successful conclusion to the BioMedical Catalyst funded feasibility study for TYK2, with lead compounds showing tumour regression in a disease model of T-ALL. STRATEGIC REPORT Sareum Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2 Drug development pipeline Sareum’s pipeline is built on the drug discovery expertise of its founders, particularly in the field of cancer. All our laboratory-based research is carried out in the facilities of collaborators or third-party providers. This enables us to access drug discovery expertise throughout the world with a very flexible cost base. Sareum focuses on developing new therapies against biochemical targets where existing preclinical or early clinical data are available. Sareum’s approach is lower risk than developing therapies against entirely novel targets. The Company is investigating its TYK2 inhibitors in several solid tumours and blood cancers at leading academic centres worldwide. A lead candidate is in preclinical development funded by Sareum’s Chinese partner, Hebei Medical University Biomedical Engineering Center, and these studies suggest good tolerability at the predicted therapeutic dose.

The agreement with Sierra Oncology represents a significant validation of Sareum’s business model, which is based on its expertise in small molecule drug design and its strategy to develop programmes to late preclinical or early clinical stages. Sareum aims to take advantage of the substantial values associated with out-licensing programmes at these stages. Sareum’s business model and its expertise in the design and early development of novel drug candidates that offer attractive commercialisation opportunities has been strongly validated by the licence agreement with Sierra Oncology. More importantly, however, Sareum has gained an experienced, highly committed and well-funded development partner for SRA737 in Sierra Oncology. The Company continues to engage with potential partners with a view to securing commercial licences for its products and programmes, while exploring new research programmes from its in-house drug discovery platform, as well as external early stage opportunities that can be potentially in-licensed and progressed into the clinic. Dr Stephen Parker Chairman 18 October 2017 “ Sareum has gained an experienced, highly committed and well-funded development partner for SRA737 in Sierra Oncology.“ Stephen Parker DPhil Non-executive Chairman STRATEGIC REPORT Sareum Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 4 Important clinical progress with SRA737, a novel Chk1 kinase inhibitor SRA737 (formerly CCT245737) is a potent, highly selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Chk1, a key regulator of important cell cycle checkpoints and central mediator of the DNA Damage Response (DDR) network. In June 2017, Sierra Oncology reported that the dose escalation phase of the monotherapy trial had advanced successfully and that the cohort expansion phase, now running at eight UK hospitals, is enrolling patients with five cancer types that are predicted to be highly sensitive to Chk1 inhibition: colorectal, head and neck, non-small-cell lung, ovarian and prostate. The programme was licensed for further clinical development and commercialisation to Nasdaq-listed Sierra Oncology in September 2016 in a deal worth a potential US$328.5 million plus royalties, of which Sareum is eligible to receive 27 .5% of the economics. STRATEGIC REPORT Sareum Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 5 CEO’s Research Update Tim Mitchell PhD Founder and CEO SRA737 – Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) Targeting solid tumours, licensed to Sierra Oncology SRA737 (formerly CCT245737) is a potent, highly selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Chk1, a key regulator of important cell cycle checkpoints and central mediator of the DNA Damage Response (DDR) network. The programme was licensed for further clinical development and commercialisation to Sierra Oncology in September 2016. These innovative trial designs were also presented at the ASCO annual meeting in June 2017. The cohort expansion phase of this trial, now running at eight UK hospitals, is enrolling patients with five cancer types that are predicted to be highly sensitive to Chk1 inhibition: colorectal, head and neck, non-small-cell lung, ovarian and prostate. The second trial is designed to explore the potentiating effects of low-dose gemcitabine (a chemotherapy that causes replication stress and DNA damage) in combination with SRA737 , also in patients with genetically profiled cancers. Once an MTD and dosing schedule have been determined, the study will evaluate the preliminary efficacy of SRA737 in combination with low-dose gemcitabine in genetically defined subjects with bladder or pancreatic cancer. Sierra Oncology has announced that it will provide an update on the SRA737 development programme in late February 2018. Sierra Oncology also expects to present data from its studies at a medical conference in the second half of 2018. These data have led the Company’s partner, SRI International, to investigate advanced lead molecules in disease models of lupus, and promising initial efficacy has been observed. Disease model studies with these compounds are planned during the fourth quarter of 2017 . Several of these studies are being carried out in leading academic centres worldwide under material transfer agreements. A lead candidate is in preclinical development, funded by Sareum’s Chinese partner, HMUBEC. Sareum now has patent protection in all the major territories for this programme. Dr Tim Mitchell Chief Executive Officer 18 October 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT Sareum Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 7 Sareum operates a lean business model to deliver the most productive return for our research spend. Literature academia Larger pharmaceutical companies Milestones and potential royalties Co-development collaborations Sareum’s co-development collaborations with world-class research institutes provide access to expertise and the ability to progress several programmes simultaneously whilst reducing research costs. This reduces the high capital cost of running in-house laboratories, minimises ongoing development risks and provides access to best-in-class expertise for its programmes. Drug development expertise Sareum generates value by developing a strong pipeline of candidate drugs. To date this has been done through its drug discovery platform, SKIL ® (Sareum Kinase Inhibitor Library), where new compounds targeting cancer and autoimmune diseases are identified. Preclinical development Safety toxicology, formulation and quality control studies are performed in the laboratories of CROs. Sareum has historically raised the majority of its funds from investors via licensed brokers and this continues to be an option. We also seek collaboration partners whose own due diligence reaffirms our assessment of a candidate’s potential. To obtain patent protection, our inventions must be considered novel, inventive and useful. IP considerations form a crucial part of due diligence when we are assessing in-licensing opportunities. We work closely with our partners to anticipate and plan around any likely delays. Progress and key milestones are monitored to understand how these may affect our own programmes. The Board generally meets monthly and receives reports covering finance, compliance, business development, safety, operations and science together with any other material deemed necessary for the Board to discharge its duties. Under the Articles of Association, all Directors must offer themselves for re-election at least once every three years. One third of the Directors retire by rotation at every AGM and are eligible for re-appointment. The internal controls are designed to manage rather than eliminate risk and provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The insured values and types of cover are comprehensively reviewed on a periodic basis. Corporate social responsibility Sareum is a small, motivated team of professional people, which operates to high standards. These standards include a commitment to best practice in meeting the Company’s social responsibilities. Companies trading on AIM are not required to provide a formal remuneration report. It meets at least once a year to review salaries and share option schemes for the Directors. We examined journals posted around the year end, specifically focusing on areas which are more easily manipulated such as accruals, prepayments, bank reconciliations and tax. Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures.
