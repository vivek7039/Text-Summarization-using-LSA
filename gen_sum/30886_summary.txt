plc – annual report and accounts 2017 group chief executive officer’s review “ it has been another excellent year of growth and ﬁ nancial performance.” 2017 review 2017 has been another exciting year for the business. we have expanded our european footprint and client offering further across attractive markets where the group targets leadership positions. our investment portfolios across the group continue to be well diversified by both geography and asset class, providing us with good resilience against adverse conditions in any country or market. our specialist asset management business, focusing on the servicing of loan portfolios for our clients, continues to be an important growth area for the group, with revenues from this business growing strongly in 2017. a transforma tional year 17 strategic report www.arrowglobalir.net asset management – continued revenue growth when moving into new markets, we have a strong track record of acquiring leading servicing businesses. its specific characteristics mean that we have entered the country with diligence and discipline. importantly, all investments were originated in off-market deals from the zenith platform and are, therefore, assets on which we have excellent performance visibility. market activity is high, as regulatory pressure to deal with italian bank balance sheets has started to take effect and asset sales rose from €34.0 billion in 2016 to a projected €64.0 billion in 2017. the market potential remains considerable and we are seeing strong demand from arrow’s clients in the alternative asset space for us to deploy the same capability in italy that we have successfully offered them elsewhere, offering our cross-asset class special servicing capabilities in high level niches we understand well, and where we are prepared to invest our own money. this targeted approach is key to our success; we will not attempt to cover the entire italian market, but only the parts where we can develop an edge and generate solid returns. we believe that this strategy will serve us well in italy too given our long-term commitment to the market. our track record demonstrates that we are able to achieve the following: • identify the right management teams, which fit with arrow’s culture and bring local expertise; • buy platforms at attractive prices in off-market deals, where value accretes to our shareholders; and • grow acquired platforms swiftly after acquisition by tapping into arrow’s broad origination footprint across a wide range of financial institutions and alternative asset manager clients. in march, the group issued €400 million senior secured floating rate notes due 2025, at a coupon of e+2.875%. clodagh has significant experience driving risk strategy at large financial companies and will play a pivotal role in ensuring that arrow continues to grow prudently. most recently, we announced the appointment of dave sutherland as our new group chief operating officer. consensus regarding forecasts for uk and european gdp growth remains positive, but we remain well positioned to capitalise on any market opportunities presented by a turn in the economic cycle. as previously guided, we do not expect brexit to impact our ability to operate and purchase portfolios in europe, since we are individually licensed in all of our jurisdictions and are not reliant on the uk’s continuing membership of the eu. we believe that regulatory oversight will continue to evolve in european markets and view this as favourable for businesses such as arrow that have scale, strong funding structures and a focus on the right customer outcomes. we remain relatively well insulated against the potential for interest rate rises when viewed alongside our strengthened funding position and reduced weighted average cost of debt fixed over a long duration. moreover , over 60% of our unsecured customers do not have a mortgage, the asset most geared towards interest rate hikes, meaning we would not expect to see a material increase in payment breakage rates should interest rates rise. this can be a useful way of dealing with creditors, but the debt management company charged a monthly fee and louise realised the substantial amount she had paid in fees over many years. a further review was scheduled for six months, as louise felt her circumstances may improve again. 20

discuss with customers the option to consider higher repayments where they can, as this will often substantially reduce the time it takes to repay their outstanding debt, in this instance our agent cautioned against not overstretching herself. after further discussion, it was agreed that a lower repayment than jennifer initially suggested would be taken over five months, but with the provision to review if this caused her any problems. supporting our customers to take control of their finances is important but equally understanding our customers full background and taking time to understand their circumstances can help us assist them in achieving the best outcome for them. debt purchase for the debt purchase part of the business, we acquire portfolios and turn these into regular , predictable and long-term cash flows; this involves high volumes of low value collections from customers. this rate is used to calculate the amount of revenue we recognise each period. asset

2017, these new standards and interpretations had an insignificant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the group, apart from including changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both cash and non-cash changes, as a result of amendments to ias 7. standards issued but not yet effective a number of new standards are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 january 2018 and earlier application is permitted; however, the group has not early adopted the new or amended standards in preparing these consolidated financial statements. a financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss: • it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and • its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (sppi) on the principal amount outstanding. notes to the financial statements 95 financial statements www.arrowglobalir.net 2. accounting standards continued standards issued but not yet effective continued b. ifrs 9 financial instruments continued i. classification and measurement continued a financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss: • it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and • its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. all financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income as described above are measured at fair value through the profit or loss. the group will leverage off its existing cash flow models to inform these ecls. as a result, there is no impact arising from this standard on the accounts for the year ended 31 december 2017. ifrs 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. based on the group’s assessment and analysis carried out to date, current revenue recognition policies are consistent with this approach. asset management revenue - master servicing under ifrs 15, revenue will be recognised over time with the relevant measure of progress against performance obligations being time, due to these services being on demand for when customers require them. based on the group’s assessment, current revenue recognition policies are consistent with this approach. in relation to leases, ifrs 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. if these reversals (‘write-downs’) exceed any previously recognised cumulative write-ups (i.e. a write-down reduces the portfolio carrying amount below its initial purchase price) then impairment is recognised as a separate line in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. unallocated cash is held as liability until all reasonable steps have been taken to show that it has been extinguished, only being released to the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income at this point. where the group acquires purchased loan portfolios via forward flow agreements, being contracted multiple future purchases, there is no difference in accounting treatment from that described above. accordingly, a settlement has been processed and there is no plan liability at 31 december 2017 (note 25). net interest expense and other expenses related to the defined benefit pension plan are recognised in profit or loss. deferred tax liabilities are provided, using the liability method, on all taxable temporary differences at each reporting date. for share-based payments with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes. shares held in an employee benefit trust (ebt) transactions of the company sponsored ebt are treated as being those of the company and are therefore, reflected in these financial statements. where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, movements in their fair value are recognised immediately within the profit or loss. further detail on the valuation of acquired loan portfolios is given in section b. below. these forecasts are generated using statistical models incorporating a number of factors, including predictions of probability to pay, which is informed by customer and account level data, credit agency data and our historical experience with accounts which have similar key attributes. operational factors, that may impact future estimated cash flows, are also considered such as improved collections processes and systems. management also review the model on a portfolio basis to take into account external factors, which have impacted historical, or will impact future performance and where necessary portfolios are calibrated to take into account these known factors. 2017 £000 2016 £000 total revenue 319,015 235,930 collection activity costs (118,468) (70,261) other operating expenses
