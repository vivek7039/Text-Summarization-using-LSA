This revised structure has allowed management  at the Group level to focus on strategy, origination and capital  allocation. His strong financial services  experience and track record of driving operational change  through large companies, means he is a great addition to the  team. Our model consists of both  primary servicing (where we service the debt directly for clients) and  master servicing (where we provide oversight on behalf of our clients  to ensure their portfolio is placed with the best primary servicer  to deliver their investment targets). We work  with credit charities and other  organisations that provide free  impartial services to ensure our  customers get the best advice  available. Every collections colleague receives  specialist training in handling vulnerable customers and all  collection staff regularly undertake refresher courses. ORIGINATION EXPERTISE Our focus on customer outcomes and strong track record  means that we are a preferred purchaser from financial  institutions. How we acquire loan portfolios and servicing  assets – strong client relationships • Partner with third-party funds to acquire large portfolios  – can then service the assets • Majority of portfolio purchases made off market –  trusted buyer • Able to purchase assets from own servicing platforms  – prior knowledge enhances performance • Focus on customer service and positive outcomes  makes Arrow a preferred buyer from credit originators • Strength of asset management platform means Arrow is  the first choice portfolio manager for many institutional  investors clients ARROW  ACQUISITION  MODEL PARTNER WITH  FUNDS PURCHASE  FROM  CURRENT  SERVICING  PLATFORMS PURCHASE  FROM CREDIT  ORIGINATORS CO-INVEST ASSET MANAGE Strategic report CONTINUED  STRONG  RETURNS &  HIGH MARGIN  SERVICING INTELLIGENT  APPROACH  TO CORPORATE  ACQUISITION MAJORITY OF  PURCHASES OFF  MARKET DEEP SERVICING  CAPABILITIES IN CHOSEN  MARKETS CO-INVEST  ALONGSIDE  CLIENTS SOPHISTICATED,  SMALL SCALE  PORTFOLIO  INVESTMENTS  Corporate acquisitions Excellence of execution • Specialise at identifying high value niches and then  expanding into them • Strong track record of buying synergistic bolt-on  businesses at sensible valuations • Retain and incentivise quality management teams with  a strong cultural fit • Expertise in scaling acquired businesses into desirable  platforms for clients  • Considerable success with rapidly growing AUM of  acquired businesses ARROW FINANCIAL EXCELLENCE  The combination of our debt purchase and asset management businesses provides  good flexibility between a high-return, capital intensive operation and an asset-light  cash-generative operation. Arrow’s business model is highly differentiated  • Arrow is a sophisticated investor and asset manager,  not a bulk buyer of loans • Approach driven by strong client relationships • Co-investment structure aligns with client interests  for servicing • Majority of portfolio purchases transacted off-market,  avoiding auction pressure • Taking incremental steps towards discretionary asset  management model • Aim to be a top three player in chosen markets; do not  target geographic growth for its own sake 12 STRATEGIC REPORT Arrow Global Group PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 MARKET SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY Arrow is a well positioned credit management services provider  when considering wider market trends of deleveraging ﬁ nancial  institutions and increasing consumer debt WELL POSITIONED BUSINESS Our debt purchase and asset management  businesses are both well positioned to  capitalise on prevailing market trends Debt purchase • Set up to help banks deleverage by  purchasing their loan portfolios  • Customer-focused model and well  regulated business activities attractive  to vendor banks • Logical purchaser of asset tails from own  platform as credit fund clients look to  realise investments • Strong balance sheet able to fund  future growth Asset management • Strong institutional investor  relationships make Arrow a preferred  servicing partner • Italian market knowledge and expertise  significantly enhanced by  Zenith acquisition • Mars Capital acquisition has provided  further secured servicing capability in  the UK and new opportunities in the  attractive Irish market • Increased capabilities will facilitate  transition to discretionary  asset management Our market share 0.5% PwC estimates that European banks currently hold €2.3 trillion  of non-performing loans and non-core assets on their balance  sheets. Across Arrow Global’s six geographies, we see approximately  €60 billion of NPL sales a year, and only purchase just over  £200.0 million. €60bn T otal annual NPL sales across  our geographies 13 Strategic report www.arrowglobalir.net ADDRESSABLE MARKET ARROW INDUSTRY POSITIONING • €500 billion+ addressable NPL market for  Arrow today • These assets will continue to see secondary and  tertiary sales over many years • Achieved through leadership positions in  6 large markets • 5/6 markets at a relatively early stage of  industry development • Arrow Global is positioning itself as an essential  long-term utility for the European financial system • Unique position to deliver significant  growth given: • Relationships and service offering to industry  investor participants • Expertise in portfolio carve-outs • Excellence in data BANKING SYSTEM ASSETS • European banking market much larger than US counterpart 1 • European capital markets still underdeveloped vs. We  have expanded our European footprint and client offering  further across attractive markets where the Group targets  leadership positions. Our investment portfolios across the Group continue to be  well diversified by both geography and asset class, providing  us with good resilience against adverse conditions in any  country or market. Importantly, all  investments were originated in off-market deals from the  Zenith platform and are, therefore, assets on which we have  excellent performance visibility. We believe  that this strategy will serve us well in Italy too given our  long-term commitment to the market. Our track record demonstrates that we are able to achieve  the following: • identify the right management teams, which fit with  Arrow’s culture and bring local expertise; • buy platforms at attractive prices in off-market deals,  where value accretes to our shareholders; and • grow acquired platforms swiftly after acquisition by tapping  into Arrow’s broad origination footprint across a wide range  of financial institutions and alternative asset manager clients. Clodagh has significant experience driving risk strategy at  large financial companies and will play a pivotal role in ensuring  that Arrow continues to grow prudently. Consensus regarding forecasts for UK and European GDP  growth remains positive, but we remain well positioned to  capitalise on any market opportunities presented by a turn  in the economic cycle. As previously guided,  we do not expect Brexit to impact our ability to operate and  purchase portfolios in Europe, since we are individually  licensed in all of our jurisdictions and are not reliant on the  UK’s continuing membership of the EU. We remain relatively well insulated against the potential for  interest rate rises when viewed alongside our strengthened  funding position and reduced weighted average cost of debt  fixed over a long duration. 20 STRATEGIC REPORT Arrow Global Group PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 GROUP CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW  “The business has produced another  good set of numbers, delivering  strong returns and with a robust  capital structure.” STRONG RETURNS FOR 2017 I am pleased to present another good set of results for 2017. Capital-light asset  management revenue is now 22% of Group revenues, and  we aim to increase this further in 2018. All portfolios continue to be monitored carefully and, where  appropriate, adjusted for in the ERC forecast based upon our  detailed modelling. After further discussion, it was  agreed that a lower repayment than  Jennifer initially suggested would  be taken over five months, but with  the provision to review if this  caused her any problems. This income is recognised after taking account of new portfolios, collections,  updated ERC forecasts, disposals and any FX impacts. These items have been excluded to provide a more comparable basis for  assessing the Group’s performance between financial periods. Outlook  We expect to see a continued supply of debt sale volumes  across unsecured and secured markets, but with strong  competition for assets in 2018. However, with other industries, such as telecoms and health  services becoming interested in this opportunity, we expect an increase  of debt sale projects.

During 2017, these new standards and interpretations had an  insignificant effect on the consolidated financial statements of  the Group, apart from including changes in liabilities arising from  financing activities, including both cash and non-cash changes,  as a result of amendments to IAS 7. We  continue to refine and monitor certain aspects of our impairment  process which may change the actual impact on adoption. Based on the Group’s assessment and  analysis carried out to date, current revenue recognition policies  are consistent with this approach. Where the Group acquires purchased loan portfolios via forward  flow agreements, being contracted multiple future purchases,  there is no difference in accounting treatment from that  described above. Net interest expense and other expenses related to the defined  benefit pension plan are recognised in profit or loss. Deferred tax liabilities are  provided, using the liability method, on all taxable temporary  differences at each reporting date. Where  derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, movements in  their fair value are recognised immediately within the profit or loss. Operational factors, that may impact future estimated  cash flows, are also considered such as improved collections processes and systems. It has been assumed that sub-lease rental income of £656,000 will  be received to reduce the overall gross liability. The liability is calculated by an independent expert through an actuarial valuation, the key  assumptions used are detailed below:  2017 2016 Discount rate 1.3% 1.6% Annual inflation rate 1.5% 1.0% Wage inflation 3.5% 3.0% Probability of leaving employment for reasons other than retirement (employees aged 18-60) 10.0% per annum 15.0% per annum 20.
