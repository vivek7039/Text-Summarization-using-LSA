investment in themselves, there has been a 35-year period of growing student numbers throughout the country. most uk universities offer an accommodation guarantee for first year and international students, but even this is a challenge with current beds available. uk higher education institutions have c.300,000 beds available, with a further 280,000 provided by the private sector. 02 the unite

high medium low source: ucas there has been some speculation that changes in national demographics, combined with rising tuition fees and the uk’s decision to leave the eu, could lead to a decline in student numbers and, by implication, a reduction in demand for accommodation. higher costs lead to a growing focus on the relative value that different universities offer. against this backdrop, universities increasingly consider their accommodation guarantee as a key point of competitive differentiation. in many cases, they are increasingly looking at established accommodation providers as long-term partners with, for example, extended nominations agreements or strategic partnerships involving their own student housing estate. in parallel with these developments, changes beyond the world of higher education are also having an impact on student accommodation. since opening our first building in 1991, unite has built the uk’s largest portfolio of student accommodation. we continuously work to align this portfolio with mid- and upper-tier universities, where demand for higher education is greatest. we constantly review opportunities to enhance both the size and quality of our property portfolio. quality properties our buildings are located close to university campuses and designed around the priorities of mainstream students. read more about our properties on p36 quality people we aim to create an environment that is supportive but allows students the independence they want. we are, in addition, currently rolling out a programme of student ambassadors to provide additional peer-to-peer support for our residents. we are proud to be a living wage employer, and retain our investors in people gold accreditation. we will continue to differentiate our student proposition and brand by investing in value-added services for students. as a result, 60 per cent of our accommodation is currently allocated to students under university nominations agreements. nearly 70 per cent of our nominated beds are now covered by multi-year contracted agreements with occupancy and rental growth commitments. as universities work to underwrite their long-term accommodation requirements, we are increasingly focused on identifying opportunities for deeper partnerships involving either the transfer of existing assets or new developments built explicitly based on a university’s commitment to a long-term nominations agreement. read more about sustainability on p48 read more about relationships on p06 read more about principal risks and

increasingly recognise the importance of accommodation to their overall student experience and seek long-term trusted partners like unite. for multi-year deals we are increasingly seeing requests from universities to co-brand the nominated buildings. the key benefits of nominations agreements for unite include: - guaranteed rent through the occupancy guarantee and rent review mechanism - deepening our relationships with universities as we work closely and become a preferred partner - allowing us to identify further partnership opportunities much earlier than our competitors. financial performance has again been strong, with a total accounting return of 14% and growth in epra earnings, up 12% to £70.5 million. on behalf of the board, i would like to thank them for another excellent

occupancy of 98% and rental growth of 3.5% over the last five years. partner of choice for universities our focus on customer service is closely aligned with the priorities of our university partners, for whom student experience is now a key performance metric under the government’s new teaching excellence framework. this, combined with a long standing commitment to building relationships with key university decision–makers, is reflected in the latest results of our independently assessed university trust survey and means that 60% of our accommodation is now let to universities through nominations agreements. we aim to operate buildings in and around high quality universities, where student demand is highest. we believe that our focus on these institutions is the best strategy for driving continued high levels of occupancy and rental growth. the initial development returns on these university-backed schemes are 6–7%, around 100 basis points lower than a scheme where unite takes full letting and rental growth risk. however, participation rates continue to increase with applicants still outstripping the places offered by universities. we expect high and mid-ranked universities, where our business is focused, to continue attracting more students than those at the lower end of the league tables and therefore we believe our portfolio remains well placed to withstand any potential reductions in applications. the demand for high quality higher education among both uk and international students continues to grow. richard smith chief executive officer 21

2018. recurring management fee income from joint ventures remained at £14.1 million (2016: £14.0 million), as a result of the valuation growth of assets under management in usaf and lsav offset by disposal activity. building on this and our unique insight into student life, we introduced some significant enhancements to our service with a range of new digital services, including uchat, which provides the opportunity for students to meet their flatmates before arriving at university and logged over 80,000 messages in the first three months of operation. placer is working with 22

2017 corporate governance statement vesting of 2017 awards is dependent on three equally weighted measures over a three-year performance period: total accounting return per share, earnings per share and tsr outperformance of the ftse 350 real estate ‘super sector’ index. full vesting under each element will require continued exceptional performance over the next three years. however, we use a lower threshold of £3.5m for balances which impact european public real estate association (‘epra’) earnings. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. the accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. the group is in full compliance with its covenants at 31 december 2017 and expects to remain so. measurement convention the financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for investment property, investment property under development, investments in subsidiaries and interest rate swaps all of which are stated at their fair value. the group

that have also early adopted ifrs 15 the new revenue standard which comes into effect from 1 january 2018. a key change arising from ifrs 16 is that lessees are required to recognise a lease liability reflecting future lease payments and a right-of- use asset for lease contracts, subject to exceptions for short term leases and leases of low-value assets. the group uses epra earnings and nav movement as key comparable indicators across other real estate companies in europe. in 2016 there were 16,838 options excluded that did not affect the diluted weighted average number of shares.
