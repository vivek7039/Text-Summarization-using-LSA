We create an environment where everyone can be at home and  make the choices that are right for them. We also support the Unite Foundation, which  provides accommodation scholarships to young people who have been  in care or are estranged from their families. We believe employability is important and  work to provide our students with the tools for a successful future.

With more young people choosing to  continue their education and investment  in themselves, there has been a 35-year  period of growing student numbers  throughout the country. Most UK Universities offer an  accommodation guarantee for  first year and international students,  but even this is a challenge with current  beds available. In many cases, they are increasingly  looking at established accommodation  providers as long-term partners with,  for example, extended nominations  agreements or strategic partnerships  involving their own student housing estate. In parallel with these developments,  changes beyond the world of higher  education are also having an impact on  student accommodation. We continuously  work to align this portfolio with mid- and  upper-tier Universities, where demand for  higher education is greatest. Quality  properties Our buildings are located close to  University campuses and designed  around the priorities of mainstream  students. Read more about  Our properties on p36 Quality  people We aim to create an environment that  is supportive but allows students the  independence they want. We are, in addition,  currently rolling out a programme  of Student Ambassadors to provide  additional peer-to-peer support for  our residents. Nearly 70 per cent of our nominated beds  are now covered by multi-year contracted  agreements with occupancy and rental  growth commitments.

Our values guide us to deliver a  strong internal culture focused on high  performance, operational efficiency  and engagement. We support those who need it,  whether that be raising £272,000 for  the British Heart Foundation, or through  employee volunteering on away days. We consider  community needs in the development of  new buildings, for example by prohibiting  cars on site or adding retail facilities  to a planning proposal.

Performance Team Talk Connect  This event, held at the NEC in Birmingham  in March, brought all our city and  headquarters teams together under one  roof to discuss Unite’s strategic direction,  Home for Success, new values, plans for  the future and latest developments. Universities also increasingly recognise the  importance of accommodation to their  overall student experience and seek  long-term trusted partners like Unite. The key benefits of nominations  agreements for Unite include:  - Guaranteed rent through the  occupancy guarantee and rent  review mechanism  - Deepening our relationships with  Universities as we work closely and  become a preferred partner  - Allowing us to identify further  partnership opportunities much  earlier than our competitors. Financial performance has again  been strong, with a total accounting  return of 14% and growth in EPRA earnings,  up 12% to £70.5 million. We will continue to focus on growing  earnings, both in absolute terms and as a  proportion of our total return. As part of our  strategy, we continue to invest in recruiting,  retaining and developing the very best  people.

We believe  that our focus on these institutions is the  best strategy for driving continued high  levels of occupancy and rental growth. The initial development returns on these  University-backed schemes are 6–7%,  around 100 basis points lower than a  scheme where Unite takes full letting and  rental growth risk. We expect high and  mid-ranked Universities, where our business  is focused, to continue attracting more  students than those at the lower end of the  league tables and therefore we believe our  portfolio remains well placed to withstand  any potential reductions in applications. 4 Board searching externally for best practice engaging with senior leaders in the HE sector as well   external technical experts. 5 External experts Recruiting expert advice on key issues such as fire safety following Grenfell  Tower and Information Technology ahead of GDPR introduction.

Building on this  and our unique insight into student life, we  introduced some significant enhancements  to our service with a range of new digital  services, including uChat, which provides  the opportunity for students to meet their  flatmates before arriving at University and  logged over 80,000 messages in the first  three months of operation. Placer is working with 22 Universities and  over 200 employers, of whom half have  already signed up to the service. We will continue to manage  the development weighting of our balance  Q&A with Richard Simpson Group Property Director Richard Simpson addresses some  topical questions from our shareholders Q The yield targets for University  partnership developments are lower than  for direct-let developments. Both of these developments are  supported by University partners,  and we have already signed a 25-year  nominations agreement on Cowley. Returns on potential new  direct-let projects in London still remain  below our hurdle rate of 7 .0% due  principally to higher alternative use values  for prospective sites and planning levies.

In 2018, we expect net  debt to increase as capital expenditure  on investment and development activity  will exceed anticipated asset disposals. This training ensures that  everyone at Unite understands their role in  delivering on our ongoing commitment to  Diversity, Equality and Inclusion. Working with a single  waste-management provider will  deliver improvements in consistency  and coverage of recycling provision  across our estate. In its first year of partnership, these  donations have raised more than  £272,000, providing enough funding  for a two-year research programme  into overcoming heart disease.

As evidenced by the operational and  financial highlights earlier in this report, 2017  was another strong year for Unite. From an  operational perspective, both our  customer satisfaction and Higher  Education trust scores increased this  year, leaving the Group well placed to  achieve its stretching three-year targets  in these areas. These awards  were similarly based on EPS, TAR and  TSR outperformance of the FTSE 350  Real Estate ‘Super Sector’ Index.

However, we use a lower threshold of £3.5m for  balances which impact European Public Real Estate Association (‘EPRA’) earnings. The Group uses EPRA earnings and NAV movement as key comparable indicators across other real estate companies   in Europe. As a result, no deferred tax  provision has been recognised at the balance sheet date in respect of property assets (revaluation and capital allowances). b) Receivable  The Group accounts for its tenancy contracts offered to commercial and individual tenants as operating leases. b) Trade receivables  The Group’s customers can be split into two groups – (i) students (individuals) and (ii) commercial organisations including Universities. The Group has strong  working relationships with its joint venture partners and therefore views this as a low credit risk balance. Gross financing costs  This includes all interest paid by the  Group, including those capitalised  into developments and operating  lease rentals. Lease  Properties which are leased to Universities  for a number of years and have no Unite  management presence. The fund is an open-ended infinite life vehicle  which has unique buying access to Unite’s  development pipeline.
