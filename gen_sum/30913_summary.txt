your board discussed all aspects of our perceived risk exposure, with particular emphasis on process safety, political pressures, strategic delivery, cyber- security, capability development and leadership succession. longer- term reward remains very much aligned to the fortunes of shareholders, with deferred stock- based schemes ensuring that only sustained performance and growth is rewarded. our current remuneration policy would have resulted in significant annual bonuses, though considerably less than last year, even after adjustment for the effects of weather and commodity prices. we bade farewell to lesley knox who stepped down after six years of much appreciated service as a non-executive director, for which she has our sincere gratitude. we do not like losing any customers but most of these customer accounts generated very low gross margin and were loss-making at the operating profit level. thirdly, our efficiency programme will deliver an additional estimated saving of £20 per dual fuel customer by 2020. taking all of this together, and recognising that the formula for any potential cap is not yet known, we believe that we can deliver a sustainable energy supply business in the uk with healthy returns under most conceivable scenarios. we have converted some sites to peaking plants, are redeveloping kings lynn a, building new flexible gas fired generation, and installing one of europe’s largest rapid response batteries. we are currently trialling our next generation app, for roll-out later this year, which will include a range of enhanced functions, including tailored insights and alerts to help give customers more control over their spending. during 2017 , we continued working to deliver the hospital with end- to-end solutions that improve their energy efficiency and operational performance, while reducing carbon emissions. our report, ‘powering britain’s economic future’, set out to measure those impacts and demonstrate the benefits of distributed energy solutions. neas has signed a landmark, long-term balancing and hedging contract with europe’s biggest onshore wind farm, markbygden ett in sweden. to continue doing that and generate greater value in society over the long term, we focus on being a responsible business. building on this, a simpler, no-nonsense british gas bill will be introduced during 2018. we are making it easier for customers to control and optimise their energy. since 2010, we have reached nearly 562,000 young people with our curriculum-based lesson plans, helping to improve skills in the key areas of science, technology, engineering and maths (stem). collaborating to help communities our strategic partnerships are building a better future – whether it’s helping vulnerable households with their energy (see page 34), or tackling bad housing and homelessness. however, electricity customer account holdings increased by 7 ,000, or 2%, as we successfully converted more of our customers to a dual fuel offering. operating profit 2017 2016 year ended 31 december notes business performance £m exceptional items and certain re-measurements £m statutory result £m business performance £m

made in norway but losses were incurred in the uk, where tax relief is given at a lower effective rate than the rate applied in norway. in december, spirit energy was formed, combining the group’s remaining european e&p business with that of bayerngas norge as. increased volatility in commodity prices could provide more opportunities but also give rise to higher collateral costs and/or additional credit risk for both em&t and north america business. • the hses management system is used to manage our controls, focusing on areas of concern including process safety, driving and working at heights. • leadership teams in our front-line businesses establish accountability for specific aspects of the customer journey and assess performance against agreed metrics weekly. prior to

read more about supporting our texan colleagues and customers through hurricane harvey page 22 we support the uk government’s gender pay gap reporting requirement. we are focused on closing the gap by building a gender balanced talent pipeline through initiatives to attract, develop and retain women. we are required to present a new policy for approval at the 2018 annual general meeting (agm) and have been consulting with our major shareholders on proposed changes. we concur with management’s judgement that other than those reversals recognised, previously recorded impairments should not be reversed at this time. for certain re-measurements, we audited the principles management use to determine whether a trade should be recognised as part of ongoing business performance or presented separately. we evaluated whether those agreed principles had been applied consistently by reviewing key contracts and testing a sample of trades to confirm that the accounting treatment was appropriate. additionally, fundamental reserved matters, which require unanimous consent, are judged to represent minority protection rather than decision making rights associated with the relevant activities. accordingly, the costs of delivery are recognised as incurred, when cash was spent or unilateral commitments made, resulting in obligations that could not be avoided. if 2p reserves estimates are revised downwards, earnings could be affected by higher depreciation expense or an immediate write- down (impairment) of the asset’s book value. (viii) included within net taxation is a £21 million credit associated with the leased spalding ccgt power station, previously impaired through exceptional items. post-tax cash flows are derived from projected production profiles of each field, taking into account forward prices for gas and liquids over the relevant period. (ii) an increased deferred prt asset has been recognised, reflecting a reduction in long-term price forecasts and changes to expected decommissioning costs. (iv) a comprehensive review as part of business transformation activities in north america during 2016 enabled certain deferred tax balances to be adjusted. distributable reserves are calculated on an individual legal entity basis and the ultimate parent company, centrica plc, currently has adequate levels of realised profits within its retained earnings to support dividend payments. goodwill is attributable to enhanced geographical presence, cost savings, synergies, growth opportunities, the assembled workforce and also arises from items such as deferred tax. receivables from residential customers are generally reviewed for impairment on an individual basis once a customer discontinues their relationship with the group. (iii) the sale/purchase contract loss provision relates mainly to a number of european gas transportation contracts and direct energy wind farm power purchase agreements. payments made under these contracts are contingent upon actual production and so there is no commitment to a minimum lease payment (2016: nil). on achievement of performance targets over a three-year period, matching shares are either released immediately or delivered as nil cost options exercisable for seven years. the group continually reviews its rating thresholds for counterparty credit limits and updates these as necessary, based on a consistent set of principles. wysogotowska 23, 62-081 przezmierowo, wielkpolskie, poland az webworks, eglinton street, cork, republic of ireland ba mariagervej 58b, dk 9500 hobro, denmark bb 90 whitfield street, london, w1t 4ez, united kingdom (i) bc innovation house, dcu innovation campus, 11 old finglas road, glasnevin, dublin, 11, republic of ireland (i) lake acquisitions limited changed its registered office on 9 january 2018 from 40 grosvenor place, london, sw1x 7en, united kingdom to the address listed above. receivables from group undertakings are compared to their recoverable amount, which is also assessed using the same estimated discounted future cash flow for each undertaking as described above. revenue for domestic supply is after deducting dual fuel discounts where applicable, with the discount split evenly between electricity and gas.
