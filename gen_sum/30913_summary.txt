Your Board discussed all  aspects of our perceived risk exposure,  with particular emphasis on process safety,  political pressures, strategic delivery, cyber- security, capability development and  leadership succession. We recognise in our recommended Policy  an increasing investor discomfort with  reward for input if and when performance  outcomes are lagging. Longer- term reward remains very much aligned to the  fortunes of shareholders, with deferred stock- based schemes ensuring that only sustained  performance and growth is rewarded. Our current Remuneration Policy would  have resulted in significant annual bonuses,  though considerably less than last year, even  after adjustment for the effects of weather  and commodity prices. We bade farewell to Lesley Knox who  stepped down after six years of much  appreciated service as a Non-Executive  Director, for which she has our sincere  gratitude. We do not like  losing any customers but most of these  customer accounts generated very low  gross margin and were loss-making at the  operating profit level. In  performance terms, it is about growing  gross margin through our customer  relationships, and driving the next phase  of cost efficiency. We have organised the  Group to deliver customer-led growth through two global customer-facing  divisions and refocused our Exploration & Production business. Centrica Storage Following extensive well testing, we  concluded that the Rough facility was no  longer capable of safe injection operations. We have converted some  sites to peaking plants, are redeveloping  Kings Lynn A, building new flexible gas fired  generation, and installing one of Europe’s  largest rapid response batteries. We are investing in a portfolio  of innovative projects covering areas  such as energy storage, electric vehicles,  artificial intelligence and blockchain. We are currently trialling our next generation app,  for roll-out later this year, which will include a range  of enhanced functions, including tailored insights  and alerts to help give customers more control over  their spending. During 2017 , we continued  working to deliver the hospital with end- to-end solutions that improve their energy  efficiency and operational performance,  while reducing carbon emissions. Our report, ‘Powering Britain’s Economic  Future’, set out to measure those impacts and  demonstrate the benefits of distributed energy  solutions. Neas has signed a landmark, long-term balancing and  hedging contract with Europe’s biggest onshore wind  farm, Markbygden ETT in Sweden. To continue doing that and  generate greater value in society over the long term,  we focus on being a responsible business. Since 2010,  we have reached nearly 562,000 young  people with our curriculum-based lesson  plans, helping to improve skills in the key  areas of science, technology, engineering  and maths (STEM). We are additionally playing an important role  in growing the infrastructure needed to lower  emissions from transport, having installed  around 13,000 electric vehicle charge points  since 2013. Collaborating to help communities Our strategic partnerships are building  a better future – whether it’s helping  vulnerable households with their energy  (see page 34), or tackling bad housing and  homelessness. Total energy customer account holdings fell  by 1,376,000, or 10%, during 2017 , including  the roll-off of 967 ,000 low-margin collective  switch and white-label fixed price tariffs. NPS fell by 3 points to + 17 † , reflecting a  more negative customer perception of  energy suppliers following the fourth quarter  price increases. However, electricity customer  account holdings increased by 7 ,000, or 2%,  as we successfully converted more of our  customers to a dual fuel offering. However, customer account holdings fell  64,000 or 9%, with around half the losses  in Industrial and Commercial, reflecting our  decision not to pursue renewal of some  low value multi-site contracts, but also  increasing competitive intensity. We have also  expanded our distributed solutions offering  in North America, which will be a major focus  area for growth. The transaction creates  a leading independent European E&P  business with an attractive mix of producing  assets and development projects.

In December, Spirit Energy was formed,  combining the Group’s remaining European  E&P business with that of Bayerngas Norge  AS. The Executive  Committee then considers these perspectives  alongside broader external and internal factors  to create a Group-wide set of prioritised risks. Increased volatility in  commodity prices could  provide more opportunities but  also give rise to higher collateral  costs and/or additional credit  risk for both EM&T and North  America Business. • The HSES management system is used to manage our  controls, focusing on areas of concern including process  safety, driving and working at heights. • Leadership teams in our front-line businesses establish  accountability for specific aspects of the customer  journey and assess performance against agreed  metrics weekly.

We are  focused on closing the gap by building a gender balanced talent  pipeline through initiatives to attract, develop and retain women. Other Senior  Executives will attend as required to provide information on  matters being discussed which fall into their area of responsibility. We are required to present a new Policy for approval at the 2018  Annual General Meeting (AGM) and have been consulting with our  major shareholders on proposed changes. The LTIP awards  were dependent on adjusted earnings per share (EPS), economic profit  (EP), safety performance, employee engagement and customer  service delivery as assessed by net promoter scores. We concur with management’s judgement that  other than those reversals recognised, previously recorded impairments should not be reversed at this time. For certain re-measurements, we audited the principles management use  to determine whether a trade should be recognised as part of ongoing  business performance or presented separately. We evaluated whether  those agreed principles had been applied consistently by reviewing key  contracts and testing a sample of trades to confirm that the accounting  treatment was appropriate. The classification of debt financial instruments,  predominantly held by Treasury, that are currently classified as  available-for-sale and measured at FVOCI will be FVTPL under  IFRS 9.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT NEW ACCOUNTING  POLICIES AND REPORTING CHANGES  Group’s financial assets that are debt instruments measured at  amortised cost or FVOCI. Additionally, Fundamental Reserved Matters, which require  unanimous consent, are judged to represent minority protection  rather than decision making rights associated with the relevant  activities. Accordingly, the costs of delivery are recognised as  incurred, when cash was spent or unilateral commitments made,  resulting in obligations that could not be avoided. If 2P  reserves estimates are revised downwards, earnings could be  affected by higher depreciation expense or an immediate write- down (impairment) of the asset’s book value.

(viii) Included within net taxation is a £21 million credit associated with the leased Spalding CCGT power station, previously impaired through exceptional items. The longer-term price assumptions thereafter are derived using valuation techniques based on available  external data and with reference to market comparators. Post-tax cash flows are derived from projected production profiles of each field, taking into account forward prices for gas and liquids over  the relevant period. (ii) An increased deferred PRT asset has been recognised, reflecting a reduction in long-term price forecasts and changes to expected decommissioning costs. (iv) A comprehensive review as part of business transformation activities in North America during 2016 enabled certain deferred tax balances to be adjusted. Distributable reserves are calculated on an  individual legal entity basis and the ultimate parent company, Centrica plc, currently has adequate levels of realised profits within its  retained earnings to support dividend payments. For Langage and Humber there will be a further £8 million cash outflow in 2018 to  reflect full settlement of the commodity hedge. Goodwill is attributable to enhanced geographical presence, cost savings, synergies, growth opportunities,  the assembled workforce and also arises from items such as deferred tax. Receivables from residential customers are generally reviewed for impairment on an individual basis once a customer  discontinues their relationship with the Group. (iii) The sale/purchase contract loss provision relates mainly to a number of European gas transportation contracts and Direct Energy wind farm power purchase agreements. Payments made under these contracts are contingent upon actual production and so there is no commitment to a minimum lease payment (2016: nil). On achievement of performance targets over a three-year  period, matching shares are either released immediately or delivered as nil cost options exercisable for seven years. Transactional exposure arises from the Group’s energy procurement,  production and generation activities, where many transactions are denominated in foreign currencies. The Group  continually reviews its rating thresholds for counterparty credit limits and updates these as necessary, based on a consistent set of  principles.
