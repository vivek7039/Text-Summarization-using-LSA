uk home supplying competitive and reliable energy to residential customers in the uk, and providing innovative services and solutions that help to keep their homes warm and working. as it is, the pressures we have faced from this quarter in our important home market have raised the degree of competitive difficulty and created an air of uncertainty that weighed heavily on our share price in 2017 . the strategic transition is being delivered well and all of our declared financial targets have been met. i hope that our executive team went a long way to addressing these concerns at the preliminary results in february. and this has been the subject of renewed challenge by your board since our trading update in november. your board discussed all aspects of our perceived risk exposure, with particular emphasis on process safety, political pressures, strategic delivery, cyber- security, capability development and leadership succession. we recognise in our recommended policy an increasing investor discomfort with reward for input if and when performance outcomes are lagging. longer- term reward remains very much aligned to the fortunes of shareholders, with deferred stock- based schemes ensuring that only sustained performance and growth is rewarded. more details are set out in the revised remuneration policy on pages 90 to 97 of this report. our current remuneration policy would have resulted in significant annual bonuses, though considerably less than last year, even after adjustment for the effects of weather and commodity prices. once again, our people have surpassed my expectations and i would like to thank them for all their hard work. but we, as the leaders of this business, must do more to support our own people. so, i have asked our non-executive director, joan gillman, to undertake a review of key employee matters and how we might assure ourselves that the voice of our people is being heard loud and clear in the boardroom. we bade farewell to lesley knox who stepped down after six years of much appreciated service as a non-executive director, for which she has our sincere gratitude. as board members, we all have personal experience of handling complaints from customers who contact us directly. through installing boilers, heating systems and their controllers we have always been in the ‘home energy management’ business. we are also finding that many customers value receiving these services from the same provider as their energy supply. the new propositions and services we have developed are not a distraction or somehow unrelated to our legacy businesses. we do not like losing any customers but most of these customer accounts generated very low gross margin and were loss-making at the operating profit level. our local heroes scheme has grown rapidly from its launch at the beginning of last year. this on- demand offer continues to accelerate and it complements our own contract relationships through british gas. thirdly, our efficiency programme will deliver an additional estimated saving of £20 per dual fuel customer by 2020. taking all of this together, and recognising that the formula for any potential cap is not yet known, we believe that we can deliver a sustainable energy supply business in the uk with healthy returns under most conceivable scenarios. we have converted some sites to peaking plant and have several projects underway to build new gas fired rapid response generation sites, as well as constructing a battery storage facility which is one of the largest in europe. we would be open to having a lower ownership percentage in a larger entity, provided our net e&p exposure remains broadly unchanged and we retain sufficient influence to shape the strategic direction of the business. we would therefore also be prepared to own less than 50% of spirit energy if the right opportunity came along. this has enhanced our capabilities and technologies, leaving us well positioned to capitalise on consumer trends. we have also set out plans for further significant cost reductions, totalling an additional £500 million a year by 2020, which will release more savings to support our aim of becoming the most efficient price setter for our chosen propositions and brands. in performance terms, it is about growing gross margin through our customer relationships, and driving the next phase of cost efficiency. we believe this is deliverable, even taking into account a potential price cap, for the reasons outlined earlier. the next phase to 2020 is all about performance delivery and financial discipline, as we marry customer-led gross margin growth with continuing to drive material levels of cost efficiency while maintaining capital discipline and a strong balance sheet. identifying and managing risk is essential to delivering our strategy read more about how we manage risk pages 52 to 62 customer-facing divisions in 2017 , we reorganised the group around the customer, creating two

operating and capital resources by 2020 to drive growth in our focus areas, broken down as follows: energy marketing & trading (em&t) services connected home distributed energy & power (de&p) ~£1.5 billion over 5 years we have invested over £700 million in these activities since the end of 2015 and expect further growth investment of around £250–£300 million per year out to 2020. we are reducing resource allocation to our asset portfolio by about £1.5 billion over this period. we are investing in a portfolio of innovative projects covering areas such as energy storage, electric vehicles, artificial intelligence and blockchain. io-tahoe an artificial intelligence driven data management company was created by combining internal innovation and acquired intellectual property. through

improving customer service levels in 2018. uk home brand nps reduced by 2pts to + 1 † , reflecting the impact of our standard tariff electricity price increase in september and a broader negative sentiment surrounding uk energy suppliers. annualised cost per home account fell by 8% compared to 2016, with efficiencies realised through our new operating model including the combination of multiple customer operations teams into one organisation, lower incoming call volumes resulting from investment in our digital platform which has made it easier to complete transactions online, consolidation of our planning and dispatch activities, and the integration of seven separate field forces into one. total energy customer account holdings fell by 1,376,000, or 10%, during 2017 , including the roll-off of 967 ,000 low-margin collective switch and white-label fixed price tariffs. in 2017 , we further strengthened our services offer with the uk nationwide launch of our technology-led local heroes on demand services platform, which plays towards the market trend of more customers seeking on demand and home emergency offers. nps fell by 3 points to + 17 † , reflecting a more negative customer perception of energy suppliers following the fourth quarter price increases. however, electricity customer account holdings increased by 7 ,000, or 2%, as we successfully converted more of our customers to a dual fuel offering. whitegate, our flexible gas fired power station, recorded another good performance, with a load factor of 85% and total generation volumes of 3,228gwh, up 3% compared to 2016. adjusted operating profit was up 2% compared to 2016, although down 4% in local currency. services customer account holdings were broadly flat compared to 2016, although within this paid direct energy protection plans rose 18%. within this, energy supply gross margin was up 2% despite the fall in customer account holdings, reflecting our focus on more valuable customer segments, while adjusted operating profit was up 6% which includes the benefit of cost efficiencies. these propositions enable customers to personalise, control and interact with their home through the hive product range. we now have 53,000 sensors deployed across more than 1,800 sites in 30 countries and are collecting around 14 billion data points per month. we have also expanded our distributed solutions offering in north america, which will be a major focus area for growth. de&p also includes our fleet of smaller gas fired peaking plants at brigg, peterborough and barry. as a result, we currently expect 2018 em&t adjusted operating profit to be no more than half the level of 2017 . the transaction creates a leading independent european e&p business with an attractive mix of producing assets and development projects. overall, 2017 capital expenditure was down 15% to £439 million, which reflects the impact of reduced spend on cygnus. this includes £289 million of disposal proceeds, with adjusted operating cash flow broadly offsetting capital expenditure during the year. csl also announced that it had completed a review into the feasibility of returning rough to injection and storage operations. from 2018, we expect to report both spirit energy and csl in one e&p reporting segment. revenue from the asset businesses, exploration & production

european e&p business with that of bayerngas norge as. details on the group’s capital management processes are provided under sources of finance in note 24(a). the executive committee then considers these perspectives alongside broader external and internal factors to create a group-wide set of prioritised risks. however, we have a low risk appetite for rewarding and retaining people who fail to demonstrate our values. – delegations of authority: accountability is delegated through the organisation to individuals in accordance with risk appetite. • we are committed to an open, transparent and competitive uk energy market that provides choice for consumers. increased volatility in commodity prices could provide more opportunities but also give rise to higher collateral costs and/or additional credit risk for both em&t and north america business. • the hses management system is used to manage our controls, focusing on areas of concern including process safety, driving and working at heights. • change activity is managed through a network of programme offices providing oversight and governance at the appropriate level. • regulatory compliance monitoring activities are performed by a single group-wide function to drive consistency and quality. in challenging conditions, it is critical that we attract and retain key capabilities across the business. the risk of industrial action in our businesses would have a potential impact on customer service levels and retention. this risk faces increased scrutiny as political and regulatory attention focuses on introducing competition by applying pressure over pricing strategies. • leadership teams in our front-line businesses establish accountability for specific aspects of the customer journey and assess performance against agreed metrics weekly. • significant committed facilities are maintained with sufficient cash held on deposit to meet working capital fluctuations as they arise. • counterparty exposures are restricted through a group credit limit policy which is regularly reviewed and adjusted as necessary. we rely on these parties to comply not only with contractual terms, but also legal, regulatory and ethical business requirements. prior to centrica, jeff worked in toronto for both kpmg, where he qualified as a chartered accountant, and the boston consulting group. he has considerable knowledge

political donations centrica operates on a politically neutral basis. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. we confirmed that forecast cash flows were consistent with board approved forecasts and analysed reasonably possible downside sensitivities. based on the sensitivities that we performed on these assumptions, we are satisfied that the group’s pre-tax impairment charge of £678 million is not materially misstated, and long-life assets and goodwill are not further impaired. we concur with management’s judgement that other than those reversals recognised, previously recorded impairments should not be reversed at this time. for certain re-measurements, we audited the principles management use to determine whether a trade should be recognised as part of ongoing business performance or presented separately. we evaluated whether those agreed principles had been applied consistently by reviewing key contracts and testing a sample of trades to confirm that the accounting treatment was appropriate. having performed this assessment it was concluded that the following components were considered to be the most significant and were subject to full scope audits: • uk home; • uk business; • north america home; • north america business; • energy marketing & trading; and • exploration & production. to enhance our understanding of the group’s operating segments, processes and balances in our first year as auditor, we also decided to perform full scope audits for all non-significant segments, being: • ireland; • connected home; • distributed energy & power; • central power generation; and • centrica storage. given our judgement to perform full scope audits in the non-significant segments noted above, we determined that a component materiality of £15 million for these businesses was appropriate, which reflected the lower risk profile of these segments. fair value movements on these commodity derivative trades do not reflect the underlying performance of the business because they are economically related to our upstream assets, capacity/off-take contracts or downstream demand, which are typically not fair valued. these divestments were in line with the group’s established wind farm strategy to realise value, share risk and reduce our capital requirements as individual projects developed, which involved bringing in partners at an appropriate stage or full disposal. additionally, fundamental reserved matters, which require unanimous consent, are judged to represent minority protection rather than decision making rights associated with the relevant activities. accordingly, the costs of delivery are recognised as incurred, when cash was spent or unilateral commitments made, resulting in obligations that could not be avoided. metering contracts the department for business, energy & industrial strategy has modified uk gas and electricity supply licences requiring all domestic premises to be fitted with compliant smart meters for measuring energy consumption by 31 december 2020. the group has a number of existing rental contracts for non-compliant meters that include penalty charges if these meters are removed from use before the end of their deemed useful lives. however, a change in these assumptions would have an impact on the amount of revenue recognised. if 2p reserves estimates are revised downwards, earnings could be affected by higher depreciation expense or an immediate write- down (impairment) of the asset’s book value. further details of the methodology and sensitivity to the assumptions are provided in note 7. goodwill goodwill does not generate independent cash flows and accordingly is allocated at inception to specific cgus or groups of cgus for impairment testing purposes. the results of these tests may then be verified by reference to external market valuation data. adjusted operating profit/(loss) adjusted operating profit/(loss) after taxation year ended 31 december 2017 £m 2016 £m 2017 £m 2016 £m centrica consumer uk home 819 810 674 672

(ii) an increased deferred prt asset has been recognised, reflecting a reduction in long-term price forecasts and changes to expected decommissioning costs. (iv) a comprehensive review as part of business transformation activities in north america during 2016 enabled certain deferred tax balances to be adjusted. based on current proposals, the group does not expect its tax position to be impacted materially. distributable reserves are calculated on an individual legal entity basis and the ultimate parent company, centrica plc, currently has adequate levels of realised profits within its retained earnings to support dividend payments. upon review of belgian gaap versus ifrs no material accounting policy alignments have been identified. (b) 2016 business combinations – measurement period adjustments during the year, there have been no material updates to the fair value of assets and liabilities recognised for businesses acquired in 2016. goodwill in respect of these acquisitions decreased by £1 million. for langage and humber there will be a further £8 million cash outflow in 2018 to reflect full settlement of the commodity hedge. a pre-tax profit on disposal of £64 million was recognised as an exceptional item (see note 7).

(c) net debt summary net debt predominantly includes capital market borrowings offset by cash, cash posted or received as collateral, securities and certain hedging financial instruments used to manage interest rate and foreign exchange movements on borrowings. for one-off services, such as installations, revenue is recognised at the date of service provision. purchases and sales entered into to optimise the performance of production facilities are presented net within revenue. financing costs not arising in connection with the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are expensed. more information is included in the remuneration report on pages 78 to 89. deferred matching share scheme (dmss): ● applicable employees: senior executive group. on achievement of performance targets over a three-year period, matching shares are either released immediately or delivered as nil cost options exercisable for seven years. ● grants after 2012: number of shares calculated according to eps, group ep, total shareholder return (tsr) and non-financial kpis. accordingly, the group recognises its interests in these arrangements as outlined above except that it presents gross liabilities and gross receivables of joint operations (including amounts due to or from non- operating partners) in the group balance sheet in accordance with the netting rules of ias 32. centrica financials_back-end.indd 162 16/03/2018 15:49 centrica plc annual report and accounts 2017 | 163 centrica plc annual report and accounts 2017 | 163 s2. all other subsequent expenditure, including the costs of day-to-day servicing, repairs and maintenance, is expensed as incurred. other pp&e, with the exception of upstream production assets (see above), are depreciated on a straight-line basis at rates sufficient to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of individual assets over their estimated useful lives. credit losses: historical assumptions regarding provisions have been updated to reflect the current uk environment. credit losses: historical assumptions regarding provisions have been updated to reflect the current uk environment. credit losses: historical assumptions regarding provisions have been updated to reflect the current irish market environment. credit losses: historical assumptions regarding provisions have been updated to reflect the current north american environment. credit losses: historical assumptions regarding provisions have been updated to reflect the current north american environment. summary of significant accounting policies overlift and underlift off-take arrangements for gas and oil produced from joint operations are often such that it is not practical for each participant to receive or sell its precise share of the overall production during the period. credit losses: historical assumptions regarding provisions have been updated to reflect the current uk and us environment. payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are recognised in the group income statement as they fall due. (a) trade receivables trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value, which is usually the original invoice amount, and are subsequently held at amortised cost using the effective interest method less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts. if collection is due in one year or less, receivables are classified as current assets. if payment is due within one year or less, payables are classified as current liabilities. accrued interest or dividends arising on available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in the group income statement. at each balance sheet date the group assesses whether there is objective evidence that available-for-sale financial assets are impaired. the accounting treatment of derivatives is dependent on whether they are entered into for trading or hedging purposes. the group enters into certain energy derivative contracts covering periods for which observable market data does not exist. when observable market data becomes available, any remaining deferred day-one gains or losses are recognised within the group income statement. for derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the group income statement and are included within gross profit or investment income and financing costs. the group’s overall financial risk management processes are designed to identify, manage and mitigate these risks. further detail on the group’s overall risk management processes is included within the strategic report – principal risks and uncertainties on pages 52 to 62. commodity price risk management is carried out in accordance with individual business unit policies and directives including appropriate escalation routes. transactional exposure arises from the group’s energy procurement, production and generation activities, where many transactions are denominated in foreign currencies. at 31 december 2017, there were no material unhedged non-functional currency monetary assets or liabilities, firm commitments or probable forecast transactions (2016: nil), other than transactions which have an inherent economic hedge and foreign currency borrowings used to hedge translational exposures. the group manages cash balances to protect against adverse changes in rates whilst retaining liquidity. the group deems a one percentage point move in uk, us and euro interest rates to be reasonably possible. the group continually reviews its rating thresholds for counterparty credit limits and updates these as necessary, based on a consistent set of principles. credit risk from financial assets is measured by counterparty credit rating as follows: 2017 2016 derivative financial instruments with positive fair values £m receivables from treasury, trading and energy procurement counterparties £m cash and cash equivalents £m derivative financial instruments with positive fair values £m receivables from treasury, trading and energy procurement counterparties £m cash and cash equivalents £m aaa to aa 15 78 2,024 8 83 1,118 aa– to a– 687 379 799 918 532 878 bbb+ to bbb– 465 279 27 673 317 37 bb+ to bb– 76 228 – 117 144 3 b+ or lower 82 59 – 50 76 – unrated (i) 65 44 14 107 90 – 1,390 1,067 2,864 1,873 1,242 2,036 (i) the unrated counterparty receivables primarily comprise amounts due from subsidiaries of rated entities, exchanges or clearing houses. ifrs 7 requires disclosure of information about the exposure to credit risk arising from financial instruments only. in other cases, credit risk is monitored and managed by grouping customers according to method of payment or profile. the group’s cash flow hedges consist primarily of: ● forward foreign exchange contracts used to protect against the variability of functional currency denominated cash flows associated with non-functional currency denominated highly probable forecast transactions; and ● cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts used to protect against the variability in cash flows associated with borrowings denominated in non-functional currencies. the average discount rate applied to value this type of contract during 2017 was 1% (2016: 1%) (europe) and 3% (2016: 3%) (north america) per annum. such gains and losses are deferred and amortised to the group income statement based on volumes purchased or delivered over the contractual period until such time as observable market data becomes available (see note s2 for further detail). benefits provided to customers vary in accordance with terms and conditions of the contracts entered into. it is the group’s policy to seek competitive tenders for all major consultancy and advisory projects. operation of an onshore windfarm poland / ay ordinary shares 50.0% greener ideas limited development of flexible power generation sites republic of ireland / az ordinary shares 50.0% rhiannon wind farm limited dormant united kingdom / a ordinary shares 50.0% three rivers solar 1 llc energy supply and/or services united states / ax membership interest 40.0% three rivers solar 2 llc energy supply and/or services united states / ax membership interest 40.0% three rivers solar 3 llc (iii) energy supply and/or services united states / ax membership interest 40.0% vindpark keblowo aps operation of an onshore windfarm denmark / ba ordinary shares 50.0% associates (ii) lake acquisitions limited holding company united kingdom / bb ordinary shares 20.0% veolia chp ireland limited energy supply and power generation republic of ireland / bc ordinary shares 20.0% (i) for list of registered addresses, refer to note s10(d).
