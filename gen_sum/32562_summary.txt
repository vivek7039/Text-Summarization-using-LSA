regeneration developer and investor. this combination of projects allows us to generate consistent returns and income through the property cycles. this reduces our risk exposure in any one individual project whilst allowing us to build a portfolio with significant upside potential. our focus is to hunt for overlooked and undervalued sites in areas of the market where value can be driven through regeneration. improving our investment portfolio u and i group plc annual report and accounts 2017 realising potential regenerating a great london high street having completed the development of the deptford project, we have retained deptford market yard (dmy) within our investment portfolio. it’s what allows us to deliver great places and generate value for all of our stakeholders. at u+i, however, we are optimistic about the future and our ability to proactively drive value and generate strong cash flows as evidenced by the board declaring a third consecutive supplemental dividend in addition to our ordinary dividend. there are strong grounds for our positive outlook, which reflect why i am excited to be chairing this company. these will not only deliver sustainable value; they are also an endorsement of u+i’s approach, strategy and growing reputation among public sector decision-makers. it responds to consumer demand for mixed-use environments where they can live, work, play and study. we are making measurable progress in our ambition to build a sustainable business, centred on mixed-use regeneration. i am particularly proud of these results, which reflect genuine value uplift, evidenced by cash profits. i have every confidence that we will produce a record result in the current year, targeting £65-£70 million of development and trading gains. i am optimistic too about our investment portfolio, which is being steadily realigned to reflect the group’s strategic focus on regeneration. during the year, we formed two specialist platforms – strategic joint ventures with majority capital partners. we operate an equity-efficient model, designed to minimise balance sheet risk and maximise shareholder returns. however, during q4 2016, activity started to return and confidence grew, following a series of unexpectedly strong economic indicators. the quarterly deloitte cfo survey – a key measure of business confidence – shows that most finance directors would still prefer to retain cash than invest it in new projects. household budgets are being squeezed by the rising cost of everyday goods, as wage growth remains elusive. this creates a further challenge for retailers, many of which are already struggling as e-commerce becomes ever more prevalent and business rates rise. against this, development has been limited for almost a decade so the supply of office space is tight and vacancies are low. with low unemployment, companies are striving to attract and retain top talent – dynamic, inspiring office space that encourages collaboration is one important way of doing so. looking ahead, rising construction costs and an uncertain economic environment are likely to limit the supply of central london office development. this presents clear opportunities for our office- repositioning platform with colony northstar, which focuses on reviving and reworking tired office buildings rather than new build office space, a process that is quicker to deliver and involves less cost risk. the challenges facing retailers are exacerbated by shifting spending patterns, as consumers become more demanding, leaning towards experiences, rather than material possessions, and are happy to rent or share goods and services, rather than buy them outright. however, well-located, affordable homes in the london suburbs continue to see strong demand and single digit price increases. demand is both from end users and housebuilders wanting ‘shovel-ready’ projects which we are able to deliver through our planning expertise. that growth requires 40,000 – 50,000 new residential units per annum and these are simply not being built. demand is particularly strong within suburban locations and the sub- £600,000 price points where we focus our regeneration efforts. these trends support u+i’s focus on well-located, attractive and high quality developments, primarily forward- funded by long-term capital partners. widely seen as an appealing city with strong links to the us, it benefits from a well thought out corporate tax policy which has attracted large numbers of international businesses in recent years. supply is increasing but rental rates are expected to continue rising this year before stabilising thereafter. demand for mixed-use regeneration schemes is widely expected to remain strong, boosted by social and structural change.

our strategy at a glance 1. grow pipeline build a pipeline of regeneration projects that deliver superior returns portfolio review p.22-39 our core skills as a business lie in smart land acquisition and adding value through the planning process. our focus is to build a pipeline of ppp and trading projects that generate excellent shareholder returns through the property cycle as we realise profits from asset disposals. this year we won four major ppp regeneration projects including 8 albert embankment and mayfield in manchester. our focus for the year ahead is to secure planning consent on a number of projects including blackhorse road, preston barracks and kensington church street. we maintain an efficient balance sheet with appropriate gearing levels and a sizeable cash buffer to keep us stable throughout the property cycle. the creation of specialist platforms allows us to deliver projects in a capital-efficient manner through joint ventures with majority capital partners. we also formed a jv with proprium capital partners to target income-producing long-term development sites within the london city region. our focus is to build a pipeline of ppp and trading projects that

contacts for acquisitions rather than being dependent on a single source of opportunity. opportunities continue to be sourced for development, trading and investment which satisfy group underwriting criteria. – the group maintains relationships with a wide range of both bank and non-bank lenders, reducing over reliance on any one partner. – the group’s ppp model seeks to build partnerships with local statutory and planning authorities as a way of mitigating risk. therefore from any starting point, over a five- year period the vast majority of projects will have moved through to exit. − the group continues its policy of de-risking developments by obtaining forward-funding for larger schemes and only carrying out limited on balance sheet development. successful, mixed-use regeneration projects can address all these issues, while generating returns for our shareholders too. as seasoned property entrepreneurs, we hunt better than many, looking in places that have been ignored by others. as creative, imaginative thinkers, we see value in places that may not always be obvious to others. it gives us several routes to market and different options for driving value from our projects. development and trading portfolio trading public private partnership − short-term profit flows (1-3 years) − planning gain is usually key − arbitrage/mispricing opportunities − irr of >30% −

our overall returns target of 12 per cent, we are £50m plus pa 12% post-tax total return* anticipated gains to fy2020 focused on driving £50 million gains from our development and trading activities per annum, with a minimum of £150 million to be delivered over the next three years. this has been a highly successful year for the business, winning four ppp projects: 8 albert embankment, mayfield, cockpit yard and westminster industrial estate. it was a challenging decision given the exceptionally high calibre of candidates; however, we were particularly impressed by u+i’s innovative approach. typically these projects allow us to acquire assets and realise gains over the short term. in december 2016, we secured outline planning consent which enabled a sale of the site to prologis. the site, which is close to birmingham international railway station and airport, will now be developed by prologis into a 310,000 sq. optimisation: we have also made good progress to optimise the value of specific assets for example at our retail scheme in killingworth. matalan currently occupy a large unit within the scheme that no longer fits their space requirements. by carving out these units from the overall scheme, we will realise disposals at a yield of circa 5.8 per cent. we will continue to invest in our core markets, focusing on assets where performance can be driven through a specific regeneration process. to date, we have acquired 10-acres of riverside land in joint venture, with future development potential. deptford market yard: growing value 36 u and i group plc annual report

new property deals. − the group has no specific debt on non-income producing assets or investments into ppp schemes. a summary of the group’s interest rate exposure is shown below: 2017 2016 group net

weighted average interest rate % 4.9 5.0 joint venture arrangements the group has a policy of working in joint venture arrangements as a way of: − leveraging our equity so we can participate in projects that would otherwise would be of too large for our balance sheet; − accessing deals with specialist partners who have secured positions on projects but require further equity and the planning and structuring skills, which are a key part of our business. the group has operations in certain jurisdictions that have been dictated to us by our majority capital partners. under most circumstances the group does not enjoy any fiscal advantage by being in those jurisdictions. the group’s principal exposure to foreign currency movements is in respect of its €47.0 million euro- denominated loan notes, euro-denominated bank loans and property assets. these types of structures mean that for a significant part (70%) of our development portfolio, we are not able to produce a reliable fair value in accordance with epra guidelines until such time as planning consent is obtained and land becomes unconditionally owned. we do this by transforming unloved town centres and brownfield sites into vibrant neighbourhoods, delivering a positive legacy for local residents, or investing in our people. our approach to sustainability is built around the most material impacts arising from mixed-use regeneration. field at preston barracks in brighton illustrates our focus on generating value from the outset by providing work space for local entrepreneurs. the building houses flexible work space for up to twelve start-ups in a dynamic and collaborative environment. field brighton based at the preston barracks regeneration site in brighton, field is a hub for start ups that design and make physical products providing this kind of temporary commercial space allows us to transform disused areas into creative zones and trial features that can be reflected in the final scheme. our places 49

our investment portfolio are more limited because they are not buildings we have designed or built ourselves. we have ongoing programmes for energy reduction in place across six assets, which are yielding positive results. u+i think is one example of how we promote an intellectually stimulating environment, where new ideas are explored and everyday thinking questioned. we offer an employee assistance programme for people to use if they are suffering from stress and/or have financial, domestic or work-related concerns. prior to joining the company, matthew worked as a fund manager at
