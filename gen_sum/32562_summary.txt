they are also an endorsement of u+i’s approach, strategy and growing reputation among public sector decision-makers. i have every confidence that we will produce a record result in the current year, targeting £65-£70 million of development and trading gains. i am optimistic too about our investment portfolio, which is being steadily realigned to reflect the group’s strategic focus on regeneration. the quarterly deloitte cfo survey – a key measure of business confidence – shows that most finance directors would still prefer to retain cash than invest it in new projects. this creates a further challenge for retailers, many of which are already struggling as e-commerce becomes ever more prevalent and business rates rise. against this, development has been limited for almost a decade so the supply of office space is tight and vacancies are low. with low unemployment, companies are striving to attract and retain top talent – dynamic, inspiring office space that encourages collaboration is one important way of doing so. looking ahead, rising construction costs and an uncertain economic environment are likely to limit the supply of central london office development. demand is both from end users and housebuilders wanting ‘shovel-ready’ projects which we are able to deliver through our planning expertise. widely seen as an appealing city with strong links to the us, it benefits from a well thought out corporate tax policy which has attracted large numbers of international businesses in recent years. our focus is to build a pipeline of ppp and trading projects that generate excellent shareholder returns through the property cycle as we realise profits from asset disposals. our focus for the year ahead is to secure planning consent on a number of projects including blackhorse road, preston barracks and kensington church street. we maintain an efficient balance sheet with appropriate gearing levels and a sizeable cash buffer to keep us stable throughout the property cycle. the creation of specialist platforms allows us to deliver projects in a capital-efficient manner through joint ventures with majority capital partners. our focus is to build a pipeline of ppp and trading projects that generate excellent shareholder returns through the property cycle as we realise profits from asset disposals. our focus for the year ahead is to secure planning consent on a number of projects including blackhorse road, preston barracks and kensington church street. we maintain an efficient balance sheet with appropriate gearing levels and a sizeable cash buffer to keep us stable throughout the property cycle. the creation of specialist platforms allows us to deliver projects in a capital-efficient manner through joint ventures with majority capital partners. however, construction finance is usually only ever secured on properties where the exit has been guaranteed through pre-sales or forward-funding. – the group maintains relationships with a wide range of both bank and non-bank lenders, reducing over reliance on any one partner. – the group’s ppp model seeks to build partnerships with local statutory and planning authorities as a way of mitigating risk. therefore from any starting point, over a five- year period the vast majority of projects will have moved through to exit. − the group continues its policy of de-risking developments by obtaining forward-funding for larger schemes and only carrying out limited on balance sheet development. development and trading portfolio trading public private partnership − short-term profit flows (1-3 years) − planning gain is usually key − arbitrage/mispricing opportunities − irr of >30% − equity multiple 1.5x − large scale mixed-use regeneration projects delivered in partnership (2-5 years) − max £20m equity in any one project but high upside potential in all − planning gain is key value driver − development is key profit driver − projects de-risked via forward funding or pre-sales − equity multiple 2.0x – 5.0x a balanced approach to development and trading project delivery time gains 26 u and i group plc annual report and accounts 2017 realised gains guidance range as at 26 april 2017 fy15 fy16 fy17 fy18 fy19 fy20 80 60 40 20 46 65-70 51 40-50 50-60 35 £m £155-£180m £m 3 year target the balance of this activity has enabled us to deliver another strong year of gains as outlined below, building on our strong track record over the past years. going forwards, in line with our overall returns target of 12 per cent, we are £50m plus pa 12% post-tax total return* anticipated gains to fy2020 focused on driving £50 million gains from our development and trading activities per annum, with a minimum of £150 million to be delivered over the next three years. this has been a highly successful year for the business, winning four ppp projects: 8 albert embankment, mayfield, cockpit yard and westminster industrial estate. it was a challenging decision given the exceptionally high calibre of candidates; however, we were particularly impressed by u+i’s innovative approach. the site, which is close to birmingham international railway station and airport, will now be developed by prologis into a 310,000 sq. optimisation: we have also made good progress to optimise the value of specific assets for example at our retail scheme in killingworth. by carving out these units from the overall scheme, we will realise disposals at a yield of circa 5.8 per cent. we will continue to invest in our core markets, focusing on assets where performance can be driven through a specific regeneration process. the group’s principal exposure to foreign currency movements is in respect of its €47.0 million euro- denominated loan notes, euro-denominated bank loans and property assets. we do this by transforming unloved town centres and brownfield sites into vibrant neighbourhoods, delivering a positive legacy for local residents, or investing in our people. field at preston barracks in brighton illustrates our focus on generating value from the outset by providing work space for local entrepreneurs. field brighton based at the preston barracks regeneration site in brighton, field is a hub for start ups that design and make physical products providing this kind of temporary commercial space allows us to transform disused areas into creative zones and trial features that can be reflected in the final scheme. u+i think is one example of how we promote an intellectually stimulating environment, where new ideas are explored and everyday thinking questioned. we offer an employee assistance programme for people to use if they are suffering from stress and/or have financial, domestic or work-related concerns. directors are also able to seek independent professional advice as necessary, at the company’s expense, in respect of their duties. the committee agreed that it did not consider a permanent internal audit function, either in-house or outsourced, was required at this time. annual bonus (% of salary) 20.1 r upton lead stakeholder engagement programme − principal spokesperson on all public affairs matters, including several high profile speaking engagements. it should be noted that these holdings, and percentage of share capital held, are likely to have changed since the company was notified. unallocated assets and liabilities comprise amounts that cannot be specifically allocated to operating segments;
