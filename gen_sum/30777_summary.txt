directors and employees are expected to ensure that their personal interests do not at any time conflict with those of bodycote. without bodycote, many companies would be using older in-house technology and running their equipment at reduced capacity, both of which drain energy resources. as a result all previous years have now been restated using iea conversion factors to ensure that year-on-year comparisons are consistent. the continued replacement of traditional lighting with led for environmental and improved safety has resulted in further co 2 reductions. our sites at
