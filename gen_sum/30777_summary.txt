Lili is an experienced strategy consultant and, since 2008, a  global partner in the London office of Bain & Company. Our business, by its nature, has limited forward visibility, but we  have entered the year with good momentum. This makes  Bodycote’s processing inherently more  efficient than customers’ in-house  operations (see page 34) and competitors,  thereby enhancing our competitive  position in the subcontract market. The scope of Bodycote’s  network enables us to specialise more  effectively than competitors at individual  locations and provides comprehensive  backup for our customers. ■ ■ Bodycote’s quality management systems,  validated by major engineering OEMs,  have been developed to meet the  requirements of international and national  accrediting bodies. –  HIP Services –  HIP Product Fabrication  –  Surface T echnology Return on capital employed Headline earnings per share Accident frequency Carbon footprint – Low Pressure Carburising (LPC) – Specialty Stainless Steel  Processes (S 3 P) – Corr-I-Dur ®   (CiD) Safety & environment At the foundation of our business is the provision of a safe working  environment for our employees, and to operate with minimal environmental impact.

Responsible business ethics All Bodycote personnel are expected to apply a high ethical standard,  consistent with an international UK-listed company. Directors and  employees are expected to ensure that their personal interests  do not at any time conflict with those of Bodycote. Bodycote operates modern, efficient equipment,  which is operated around the clock so as to optimise treatment  processing cycles. Without Bodycote, many companies would be  using older in-house technology and running their equipment at  reduced capacity, both of which drain energy resources. As a result all previous  years have now been restated using IEA conversion factors to  ensure that year-on-year comparisons are consistent. The continued replacement of traditional lighting with LED for  environmental and improved safety has resulted in further CO 2   reductions. Our sites at Sprockhövel, Otterfing, Esslingen, Korntal,  Wehingen, Gothenburg and Warsaw will benefit from projected  total savings of 192.4Te CO 2  annually.  Leadership  International operations  Mergers and acquisitions  Emerging markets  Current ﬁnancial experience  Service industry Chartered Accountant, qualiﬁed  with Deloitte & Touche after  graduating from University of  Oxford.

Financial statements Additional information 39 www.bodycote.com Stock code: BOY Strategic report Governance 25695    19 March 2018 3:29 PM    Proof 7 Corporate governance statement continued Induction All new directors are subject to a tailored induction programme covering a diverse range of topics including trading, investor relations,  organisational and legal matters as well as visits to operational sites. The Chairman also meets institutional investors to discuss  overall strategy, governance and any concerns that shareholders may have. Regular feedback from  the Group’s advisers on investor meetings and results presentations is circulated to all directors. All directors, attended the maximum number of Board, Audit and Nomination Committee meetings that they were scheduled to attend. No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s  share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. ■ ■ Give full consideration to succession planning for directors and other  senior executives in the course of its work. Other individuals and external  advisers may be invited to attend for all, or part of,  any meeting when it is appropriate. Lili Chahbazi joined the Board as a non-executive director on 1 January 2018  and A.M. Thomson was advised by international search consultancy Russell Reynolds. In our 2017 AGM results announcement we stated that Eva Lindqvist had confirmed to  reduce her number of directorships with listed companies. The  Committee also received quarterly reports on issues raised via the Open Door Line (an external independent service where employees may  report matters of concern) and assessed both how such calls are dealt with and whether there was any indication of material risk. Financial due diligence, taxation, internal audit, and actuarial services are not typically contracted to the external auditor. Business performance and incentive outcomes for 2017 Bodycote has performed strongly through 2017 , with a top line revenue growth of 9.6% at constant currencies. Strong returns have also been delivered, helped by the focus on capital investment in specialist markets and performance was achieved at  48.2% of maximum. Other benefits consist of company car (or allowance), family level private medical insurance, life assurance cover and sick pay. Bodycote Incentive Plan (BIP)  BIP awards made in 2015 had a three-year performance period ending on 31 December 2017 , after which they will vest immediately, with  50% of the award subject to satisfaction of a ROCE target and 50% subject to the headline earnings per share (EPS) target. Base salaries for Executive Directors are  typically reviewed annually (or more frequently  if specific circumstances necessitate this) by  the Committee in December each year. From 2018 onwards, 35% of any bonus  earned is deferred into shares for three years,  conditional on continued employment until  vesting date. If a contract is to be terminated, the Committee will determine such mitigation as it considers fair and reasonable in each case. In 2017 we no longer consider the completeness and accuracy of environmental remediation provisions to be a key audit matter. 78 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2017 25695    19 March 2018 3:24 PM    Proof 7 Impairment of intangible fixed assets (including goodwill)  Key audit matter  description Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29 The Group has a significant non-current asset base relating to intangible assets (including goodwill) of £201 .0m (2016:  £206.7m) as shown in notes 11 and 12.

Cash-generating units to which  goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be  impaired. Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, plus appropriate borrowing costs, less any recognised impairment loss. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair value on the balance sheet date. An initial  assessment has been performed and it is not anticipated that transition to IFRS 15 will have a material impact on the Group. ■ ■ IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2019, subject to EU endorsement, and will replace IAS 17 Leases. 2   The Group is externally financed by a mix of cash flows from operations, short-term borrowings, long-term loans and finance leases.
