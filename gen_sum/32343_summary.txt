interest rate environment and unorthodox monetary policy has created an almost desperate search for yield across a widening spectrum of investment classes. today, it is estimated that retailers and third party logistics operators account for 60-70% of all distribution warehousing real estate take up. looking forward, delivery times are likely to fall further as expectations grow and more demanding younger shoppers, in particular millennials, account for a larger proportion of retail spend. despite a more competitive landscape we have again made strong progress in growing our footprint
