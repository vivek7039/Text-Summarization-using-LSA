2017 we own, create and build desirable real estate that meets occupiers’ demands in a rapidly evolving retail environment. our portfolio is positioned around strong fundamentals of owning highly desirable assets, let to good companies and where over time the income will grow. the prolonged low interest rate environment and unorthodox monetary policy has created an almost desperate search for yield across a widening spectrum of investment classes. today, it is estimated that retailers and third party logistics operators account for 60-70% of all distribution warehousing real estate take up. average lease lengths on new lettings 18 years behaving as a reit with interest rates hovering not far from all time lows, and a growing number of people retiring every year, the demand for alternative sources of income is on the rise. open market rent reviews on distribution assets were particularly strong and we settled 26% of non food retail sales are expected to be online by 2020

part of our end to end logistics strategy, our investment focus in the year was on building our platform in urban logistics. looking forward, delivery times are likely to fall further as expectations grow and more demanding younger shoppers, in particular millennials, account for a larger proportion of retail spend. after a record year for distribution take up in 2016, occupier demand remains strong across the uk. these macro trends and attractive dynamics have seen investor demand for the asset class increase globally. despite a more competitive landscape we have again made strong progress in growing our footprint across this sector, whilst remaining patient, disciplined and rational. above: our 527,000 sq ft development for poundworld in wakeﬁeld the warehouse was developed at a yield of 6.3%. we will continue to monetise further retail assets upon completion of various asset management initiatives during the year. above: 74,000 sq ft retail park in king’s lynn sold for

supported and underpin a steady long term income return proﬁle the sustained low interest rate and uncertain environment has driven strong demand for long duration assets with stable cash ﬂows that are less sensitive to economic cycles. as such we believe that structural changes will put some of these capitalisation rates under outward pressure. we will behave rationally through maintaining a margin of safety in our actions whilst retaining appropriate portfolio liquidity and ﬂexibility. 1.2 billion parcels were delivered last year with next day delivery options increasing and a reduction in order cut off times. the uk convenience sector is a long standing feature of uk communities, however it is changing – from being shops used largely for emergency or distress purchases to being a regular part of many consumers’ grocery shopping repertoire. with limited speculative development ongoing at 4.3 million sq ft, the supply constrained market dynamics are likely to continue. increased traffic congestion, co 2 emissions and often noise pollution mean that urban neighbourhoods are historically incompatible. this will place further pressure on occupiers to be ﬁt for purpose and ensure they win at least their share of the growth. we add value through de-risked asset management and short cycle development to build a portfolio of desirable real estate. 1 m like for like income growth

structurally supported real estate that delivers repetitive, dependable and growing income. our investment activity in the year was focused on urban logistics investments largely funded by mature retail park sales. 2016 was a record year for occupier take up and supply remains restricted with limited speculative development. disciplined investing in distribution the investment market for mega and regional warehousing remains competitive, particularly where assets are let to strong covenants on long leases. we spent £71.0 million on our wakeﬁeld and warrington developments, achieving a blended yield of 6.6%, which is c.150bps better than completed investment yields. they are increasingly critical to the distribution networks for retailers, third party logistics providers and other operators in meeting rising consumer delivery expectations. distribution portfolio split as at 31 march 2017 mega regional urban logistics typical warehouse size 500,000+ sq ft 100-500,000 sq ft

ad hoc communication is often supplemented by site visits and provides further opportunity to mix with senior management. the executive directors have regular off site meetings to discuss business strategy and performance in a less formal environment. this induction process was carried out for andrew livingston who joined as a new non executive director in the year. speciﬁc brieﬁng papers were

a formal tender process in 2013. current uk regulations require rotation of the lead audit partner every ﬁve years, a formal tender of the auditor every ten years and a change of auditor every 20 years. however, the company’s policy recognises that there may be certain circumstances where, due to deloitte’s expertise and knowledge of the company or real estate sector, it is appropriate for them to undertake non audit work. they have also conﬁrmed that they have internal procedures in place to identify any aspects of non audit work which could compromise their role as auditors and to ensure the objectivity of their audit report. half of the bonus will be deferred into shares which vest in equal tranches over three years. performance is measured by reference to tsr versus the ftse

role, including signiﬁcant changes in group size and/or complexity or if it is necessary to remain competitive to retain a director. additional beneﬁts which are available to other employees on broadly similar terms may therefore be offered. awards are granted annually to executive directors in the form of a conditional share award or nil cost option. no material change will be made to the type of performance conditions without prior shareholder consultation. if a contract is to be terminated, the committee will determine such mitigation as it considers fair and reasonable in each case. the non executive directors do not have service contracts but are appointed under letters of appointment. each non executive is subject to an initial three year term followed by annual re-election at the company’s agm. this requirement provides further long term alignment with shareholders and ensures a focus on successful succession planning. all committee members are non executive directors of the company, which is an important pre-requisite to ensure executive directors’ pay is set by board members who have no personal ﬁnancial interest in the company other than as potential shareholders.
