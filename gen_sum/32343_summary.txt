Our portfolio is positioned around strong fundamentals of owning highly desirable assets, let to good companies and where over time the income will grow. The prolonged low interest rate environment and unorthodox monetary policy has created an almost desperate search for yield across a widening spectrum of investment classes. Today, it is estimated that retailers and third party logistics operators account for 60-70% of all distribution warehousing real estate take up. Open market rent reviews on distribution assets were particularly strong and we settled 26% of non food retail sales are expected to be online by 2020 compared to just 1 3% in 201 1 13 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Chief Executive’s review continued Distribution investments £107m Increasing focus on urban logistics As part of our end to end logistics strategy, our investment focus in the year was on building our platform in urban logistics. Looking forward, delivery times are likely to fall further as expectations grow and more demanding younger shoppers, in particular millennials, account for a larger proportion of retail spend. According to the UK Warehousing Association, there has been a 46% reduction of industrial space across Greater London since 1980. Despite a more competitive landscape we have again made strong progress in growing our footprint across this sector, whilst remaining patient, disciplined and rational. We will continue to monetise further retail assets upon completion of various asset management initiatives during the year. US private debt placement £1 30m 2.7% blended coupon LTV reduced 30% as at year end Our disciplined investment approach We focus on achieving attractive risk-adjusted returns which are structurally supported and underpin a steady long term income return proﬁle The sustained low interest rate and uncertain environment has driven strong demand for long duration assets with stable cash ﬂows that are less sensitive to economic cycles. We will behave rationally through maintaining a margin of safety in our actions whilst retaining appropriate portfolio liquidity and ﬂexibility. 1.2 billion parcels were delivered last year with next day delivery options increasing and a reduction in order cut off times. With limited speculative development ongoing at 4.3 million sq ft, the supply constrained market dynamics are likely to continue. This will place further pressure on occupiers to be ﬁt for purpose and ensure they win at least their share of the growth. We add value through de-risked asset management and short cycle development to build a portfolio of desirable real estate.

Our investment activity in the year was focused on urban logistics investments largely funded by mature retail park sales. Disciplined investing in distribution The investment market for mega and regional warehousing remains competitive, particularly where assets are let to strong covenants on long leases. We spent £71.0 million on our Wakeﬁeld and Warrington developments, achieving a blended yield of 6.6%, which is c.150bps better than completed investment yields. They are increasingly critical to the distribution networks for retailers, third party logistics providers and other operators in meeting rising consumer delivery expectations.

Opportunistic retail acquisitions Our MIPP Joint Venture acquired two single let warehouses for £18.4 million (Group Share: £9.2 million) at a yield of 6.8% and continues to see opportunities in selective high quality assets that are smaller lot sizes and offer the potential to generate stable, consistent income returns. Our occupancy rate at the year end was 99.6%, a high level that has been maintained for several years. In September, we entered into a new £130 million private debt placement which diversiﬁed our funding sources and provided further capacity for investment. Three quarterly payments totalling 5.4p per share have been made to date and a further 2.1p is proposed for payment on 10 July 2017 . A reconciliation between IFRS and EPRA net assets is detailed in note 8(c) to the ﬁnancial statements on page 128. These weightings are then mathematically combined to produce an overall gross risk rating which is colour coded using a traffic light system. In addition, further stress testing assessed the limits at which key ﬁnancial covenants and ratios would be breached or deemed unacceptable. The Company has medium term, ﬂexible funding with signiﬁcant headroom in covenant levels and no reliance on sales. Standardised appraisals and cost budgets are prepared for developments with regular monitoring of expenditure against budget to highlight potential overruns at an early stage. The property cycle is continually monitored with investment and divestment decisions made strategically in anticipation of changing conditions. At 31 March 2017 , the Group had hedging in place covering 87% of total available debt facilities including joint venture arrangements. Since then we have signiﬁcantly reduced our energy consumption and GHG emissions, enabling us to save over £3 1 7 ,000 in costs. Once developments are complete and operational, our tenants employ locally-based staff for their retail stores or distribution warehouses.

These activities beneﬁt local communities in a number of ways, primarily through: • Investment and construction jobs in the local area through our asset management and development activities; the ﬁt out work of our retailers also brings local job creation • Creation of desirable shopping destinations which provide amenities, diverse retail offerings and convenient shopping locations that will remain vibrant for the long term • Long term commitment of our retailers and occupiers, who typically sign 10-15 year leases bringing long term employment to the local area At our newly developed distribution warehouse in Warrington, for example, Amazon are expected to employ 1,200 people once fully operational. Future plans As well as continuing our local community engagement, we will continue to: • Target giving to community causes local to our assets • Support LandAid events and employee-led charity events • Match employee charity giving • Encourage pro bono work and employee volunteering 23 new leases signed with our occupiers that will bring long term local employment across 12 locations £35,695 total charitable contributions in the year Community Policy published 54 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Community consultation at Launceston We fully pre-let a former B&Q store redevelopment where we had previously accepted an early surrender.

This ad hoc communication is often supplemented by site visits and provides further opportunity to mix with senior management. The Executive Directors have regular off site meetings to discuss business strategy and performance in a less formal environment. This induction process was carried out for Andrew Livingston who joined as a new Non Executive Director in the year. Speciﬁc brieﬁng papers were provided on the Private Placement debt facility, scrip dividend alternative, Market Abuse Regulations, institutional feedback and Responsible Business.

Performance is measured by reference to TSR versus the FTSE 350 Real Estate Super Sector and EPRA EPS growth. Ensures a focus on successful succession planning providing an ongoing equity risk and is in line with emerging shareholder sentiment. Awards are granted annually to Executive Directors in the form of a conditional share award or nil cost option.

Scoping The Group is subject to a full scope audit on 100% of net assets, revenue and proﬁt before tax. Within revenue, there are certain transactions which warrant additional audit focus and have an increased inherent risk of error due to their non standard nature.
