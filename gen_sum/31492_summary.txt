What we have achieved during the year 58,020 properties under management 3 Gold awards won 23 assisted acquisitions by franchisees New acquisition Acquisition of Brook Financial Services Limited (“Brook”), providing mortgage, insurance and other financial services to the Group.

Brook is already working closely with all 39 Newton Fallowell offices and, with 25 Belvoir and six Northwood offices already on board, I have every confidence in their ability to roll out their financial services offering across the other Group networks. We firmly believe that Belvoir is best placed to take advantage of consolidation at both the franchisee and franchisor level. Experienced management team delivering significant progress 2017 marked 21 years of uninterrupted profit growth for the Belvoir Group. In addition we have recently completed our planned programme to franchise all but the two original Grantham- based Belvoir and Newton Fallowell corporate offices, enabling us to focus entirely on the further development of our franchise model. I am confident that with his background and experience Michael will make a valuable contribution to the Group’s strategy. Vendors, especially landlords, continue to value the local expertise and cost effectiveness available across our network of offices. Online agents have succeeded in lowering the public’s expectation of how much they should be paying for estate agency services. Whilst during 2017 a slow down in the property market was anticipated, the number of property transactions remained surprisingly stable and was only 1% down year on year and changes in our business model has meant that network revenue from estate agency increased. The increase in MSF reflects growth across our existing network of offices and a full year’s contribution from Northwood. Belvoir’s Rental Index for the final quarter of 2017 confirms that rents are rising broadly in line with average wages. As our lettings-biased networks, Belvoir and Northwood, grow their property sales business, Brook will enable our brands to increase further their revenue from estate agency- related services and mitigate some of the impact of the upcoming ban on tenant fees. In one case the new owner was already operating two existing lettings businesses, which will now be rebranded to Belvoir. The acquisition of Brook also helped us build on this opportunity, as franchisees can generate additional revenue from each house sale whilst offering their clients a more comprehensive property service. Current trading and outlook 2018 has started well with eight franchisees having completed on portfolio acquisitions estimated to bring in a total of £2.8m p.a. Proactive growth We proactively identify suitable businesses for our franchisees to bolt onto their existing business, whilst also initiating the roll out of additional property services to be offered by our franchisees, providing the opportunity for accelerated and sustained growth. I decided to focus on acquisition and have completed five portfolio purchases in as many years. As the rental market experienced a huge shift in rental values following the oil crisis and, in addition, as significant legislative changes were being faced, it was an opportunity for us to consolidate with other agents during this period. He is currently embarking on further grand plans for his existing Nuneaton and Hinckley business. Clayton is looking to maximise this opportunity even further by working with the Belvoir Central Office to create a new, updated version of the Belvoir shop fit that is vibrant and modern and fully embraces technology. We currently have seven members of staff undertaking professional qualifications, encompassing lettings, accountancy and project management. Her original purchase ledger role has been taken on by the latest addition to the finance team; accounting apprentice Adam Egner, who is working towards his level 2 AAT exams and has a 100% record on both exams taken to date. 12 Belvoir Lettings plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Our markets 2017 was very much a continuation from the year before for the property market with economic uncertainty resulting in flat transaction rates for sales although our own performance within this sector has remained positive. Our data shows that rents are increasing but at a slow, steady and sustainable rate. Banning of tenant fees, while less favourable in our opinion than a cap on fees, will help to rid the PRS of less reputable lettings agents who may have abused this revenue stream in the past. Through moving to a more cost-effective business premises, upgrading some of his technology for greater efficiency, improving his processes and putting more emphasis on selling the best level of insurance products to his landlords and tenants, Chris has completely compensated for all loss in tenant fees when the ban comes into place meaning Chris will go forward with a better performing, more efficient business as a result. Our markets continued 15 Annual report and accounts 2017 Belvoir Lettings plc The importance of estate agency for the Group With our Belvoir and Northwood networks being relative newcomers to estate agency, this market still represents more of an opportunity than a risk to us. The acquisition of Brook in July 2017 also presents an opportunity for increased revenue from sales once integrated into our franchisees’ business operations. This will be an extremely welcome addition to its income particularly when faced with the probable withdrawal of tenant fees in 2019. 140,000 120,000 100,000 80,000 60,000 40,000 20,000 0 Mar 17 Dec 17 Oct 17 Nov 17 Sep 17 Aug 17 Jul 17 Jun 17 May 17 Apr 17 Jul 16 Jan 17 Feb 17 Dec 16 Nov 16 Oct 16 Sep 16 Aug 16 Total UK residential property transactions Not seasonally adjusted Seasonally adjusted 3% 3% 14% 50% 26% 4% Total sales income 2017 T otal lettings income 2017 20% 80% 16 Belvoir Lettings plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Leveraging our expertise GROUP ACQUISITIONS STRATEGY Accelerating business growth through the acquisition of additional franchised lettings and estate agency networks and property-related services companies to the Belvoir Group Milestones of 2017 ∞ Integrated Northwood into the Group reducing the cost base by £300,000 p.a. in MSF ∞ Year-end pipeline of transactions with lawyers totalling £2.8m ∞ 73 franchisees enrolled on the acquisition research programme Focus for the future ∞ Target to add £6.6m of additional network revenue in 2018 under the Assisted Acquisitions programme ∞ Strengthen relations with business transfer agents and improve targeting of potential sellers ∞ Position our franchisees to take advantage of consolidation within the sector FRANCHISE RECRUITMENT Increasing UK coverage with newly franchised territories Milestones of 2017 ∞ Nine new offices opened in 2017 including one “hot start” ∞ Five existing offices sold on to new franchise owners ∞ Development of a new satellite recruitment strategy targeted at existing franchisees supporting new franchisees opening in adjacent territories Focus for the future ∞ Target to open six satellite offices in 2018 ∞ Expecting to resell six existing offices to a new franchise owner in 2018 ∞ Match new franchised territories with a portfolio acquisition, where possible, to give new franchisees an established income from day one Read about our brands on page 3 Read about our acquisitions on page 3 Read about our reach on page 2 Our strategy 17 Annual report and accounts 2017 Belvoir Lettings plc DIVERSIFICATION Continuing to expand our service offering with over two-thirds of our franchisees now offering property sales, and more proactive marketing of insurance and financial services Milestones of 2017 ∞ Property sales delivered a 47% increase in MSF to £270,000 (2016: £184,000) from the Belvoir network with 109 (2016: 93) of Belvoir offices having now completed sales training ∞ Three of the Newton Fallowell estate agents took up the lettings franchise for their territory ∞ Acquisition of Brook to enhance revenue opportunities from financial services Focus for the future ∞ Drive to maximise revenue from financial services and insurance products ∞ Continue to focus on improving reputation of local offices through online reviews ∞ Ongoing encouragement of franchisees to proactively offer additional services MARKETING AND PR Continuously driving for increased brand awareness Milestones of 2017 ∞ Belvoir won Gold at The Negotiator Awards for Franchise or Large Group of the Year ∞ Northwood won Best Lettings Agency in the allAgents Awards based entirely on customer reviews ∞ Belvoir Group marketing team undertook Northwood brand refresh ∞ Alignment of Group marketing suppliers to achieve economies of scale Focus for the future ∞ New Belvoir website for 2018 with more emphasis on lead management and conversion ∞ Further success with key industry awards across all brands ∞ Drive additional value by utlilising economies of scale wherever appropriate and, most importantly, using learnings to further improve each brand’s marketing success ∞ Increase focus on digital marketing to generate and convert leads Read about our services on page 8 Read about our awards on page 61 #MovingMemories In September Belvoir launched its #MovingMemories video campaign, an emotive video to capture the excitement, stress and occasional sadness that a house move can bring. Based on their assessment of prospects and viability above, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due. Belvoir saw acquisition activity double in 2017 and only provided 10% of the deal value as loans to franchisees.

MSF increased by 23% to £7.9m (2016: £6.4m), of which 17% resulted from Northwood being within the Group for twelve months (2016: seven). Operating profit before exceptional items The £0.4m reduction in non-exceptional administrative expenses to £6.5m (2016: £6.9m) reflected a number of underlying factors. These have been discussed in further detail throughout the Strategic report and are illustrated on page 22.

Belvoir Lettings plc, a public limited company listed on AIM, is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. Income, expenditure, unrealised gains and intra-group balances arising from transactions within the Group are eliminated. Acquisition-related transaction costs are recorded as an exceptional administrative expense in the Group statement of comprehensive income. Amortisation begins when the intangible asset is first available for use and is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of each intangible asset over its expected useful life, as follows: Trade names/brands – between 10 and 20 years Customer relationships – between 10 and 25 years Master franchise agreements – 25 years Acquired trade names are identified as separate intangible assets where they can be reliably measured by valuation of future cash flows. The trade names which have been identified separately are assessed as having a life reflecting their respective trading histories. Customer relationship assets are being written off over a remaining life of ten to 25 years. Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets are stated at deemed cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges. Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or revaluation of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that asset, as follows: Freehold land – not depreciated Freehold property – 2% straight line on cost Fixtures and fittings – 20% to 33% straight line on cost Material residual value estimates and expected useful lives are updated as required but at least annually. Impairment testing of goodwill, other intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash flows (cash generating units). Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. These changes were substantively enacted on 6 September 2016 and accordingly the deferred tax balance has been calculated using a rate of 17%. As this remains conditional on shareholders’ approval, provision has not been made in these financial statements. Belvoir Yardley came under corporate ownership between 3 May 2017 and 1 November 2017, when it was resold to a new franchise owner. 18 Maturity of borrowings and net debt – term loan 2017 £’000 2016 £’000 Group and Company Repayable in less than six months 615 449 Repayable in seven to twelve months 434 444 Current portion of long-term borrowings 1,049 893 Repayable in years one to five 5,938 6,811 Total borrowings 6,987 7,704 Less: interest included (543) (742) Total net debt 6,444 6,962 The bank loan is secured by a fixed and floating charge over the Group assets. In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments.

The Company’s review includes external ratings, when available, and in some cases bank references. Deferred tax at 17% has been provided on the value of intangible assets defined as customer contracts.
