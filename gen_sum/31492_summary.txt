group is looking to grow further through the acquisition of additional significant franchise networks or companies offering specialist property-related services from which our franchisees can benefit. brook is already working closely with all 39 newton fallowell offices and, with 25 belvoir and six northwood offices already on board, i have every confidence in their ability to roll out their financial services offering across the other group networks. we firmly believe that belvoir is best placed to take advantage of consolidation at both the franchisee and franchisor level. experienced management team delivering significant progress 2017 marked 21 years of uninterrupted profit growth for the belvoir group. in addition we have recently completed our planned programme to franchise all but the two original grantham- based belvoir and newton fallowell corporate offices, enabling us to focus entirely on the further development of our franchise model. vendors, especially landlords, continue to value the local expertise and cost effectiveness available across our network of offices. online agents have succeeded in lowering the public’s expectation of how much they should be paying for estate agency services. whilst during 2017 a slow down in the property market was anticipated, the number of property transactions remained surprisingly stable and was only 1% down year on year and changes in our business model has meant that network revenue from estate agency increased. the increase in msf reflects growth across our existing network of offices and a full year’s contribution from northwood. belvoir’s rental index for the final quarter of 2017 confirms that rents are rising broadly in line with average wages. as our lettings-biased networks, belvoir and northwood, grow their property sales business, brook will enable our brands to increase further their revenue from estate agency- related services and mitigate some of the impact of the upcoming ban on tenant fees. in one case the new owner was already operating two existing lettings businesses, which will now be rebranded to belvoir. the acquisition of brook also helped us build on this opportunity, as franchisees can generate additional revenue from each house sale whilst offering their clients a more comprehensive property service. franchising offers a relatively low risk way for young people to get into business with one in five franchise owners launching their business in the last two years being under the age of 30. it also offers opportunity for scale with 29% of franchises running multiple outlets. current trading and outlook 2018 has started well with eight franchisees having completed on portfolio acquisitions estimated to bring in a total of £2.8m p.a. proactive growth we proactively identify suitable businesses for our franchisees to bolt onto their existing business, whilst also initiating the roll out of additional property services to be offered by our franchisees, providing the opportunity for accelerated and sustained growth. adjusted basic eps increased to 11.3p (2016: 8.8p)* * see note 9 on page 48. our process selection we work closely with potential new franchisees to ensure that they are a good fit for our business model of high quality service delivery and sound business ethics. i decided to focus on acquisition and have completed five portfolio purchases in as many years. as the rental market experienced a huge shift in rental values following the oil crisis and, in addition, as significant legislative changes were being faced, it was an opportunity for us to consolidate with other agents during this period. we currently have seven members of staff undertaking professional qualifications, encompassing lettings, accountancy and project management. her original purchase ledger role has been taken on by the latest addition to the finance team; accounting apprentice adam egner, who is working towards his level 2 aat exams and has a 100% record on both exams taken to date. 12 belvoir lettings plc annual report and accounts 2017 our markets 2017 was very much a continuation from the year before for the property market with economic uncertainty resulting in flat transaction rates for sales although our own performance within this sector has remained positive. through moving to a more cost-effective business premises, upgrading some of his technology for greater efficiency, improving his processes and putting more emphasis on selling the best level of insurance products to his landlords and tenants, chris has completely compensated for all loss in tenant fees when the ban comes into place meaning chris will go forward with a better performing, more efficient business as a result. our markets continued 15 annual report and accounts 2017 belvoir lettings plc the importance of estate agency for the group with our belvoir and northwood networks being relative newcomers to estate agency, this market still represents more of an opportunity than a risk to us. the acquisition of brook in july 2017 also presents an opportunity for increased revenue from sales once integrated into our franchisees’ business operations. this will be an extremely welcome addition to its income particularly when faced with the probable withdrawal of tenant fees in 2019. total group msf income 17+ 83+n belvoir

calculated to write off the cost of each intangible asset over its expected useful life, as follows: trade names/brands – between 10 and 20 years customer relationships – between 10 and 25 years master franchise agreements – 25 years acquired trade names are identified as separate intangible assets where they can be reliably measured by valuation of future cash flows. the trade names which have been identified separately are assessed as having a life reflecting their respective trading histories. subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets are stated at deemed cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges. depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or revaluation of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that asset, as follows: freehold land – not depreciated freehold property – 2% straight line on cost fixtures and fittings – 20% to 33% straight line on cost material residual value estimates and expected useful lives are updated as required but at least annually. impairment testing of goodwill, other intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment for the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash flows (cash generating units). cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually. with the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. belvoir
