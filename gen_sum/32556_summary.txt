dependent on any single sector, service or facility. its customer base extends over a wide spectrum of the uk economy, offering resilience and mitigating cyclicality. the group’s four operating divisions support each other by providing control over waste flows and security of disposal routes. the group’s services are organised across four operating divisions: industrial & commercial (i&c); municipal; resource recovery & treatment (rr&t); and energy. the facilities sort dry mixed recyclables to make them suitable for use as secondary raw materials in manufacturing processes. the confidence shown in biffa by existing and new shareholders alike was therefore hugely gratifying. these and certain other items resulted in the group reporting a statutory loss after tax of £10.9m (prior year £5. i would also like to thank the group’s loyal employees for their hard work and commitment this year. steve marshall chairman 2 see consolidated statement of profit or loss strategic report www.biffa.co.uk 10 biffa plc annual report and accounts 2017 chief executive’s statement a successful year the past 12 months has been an exciting time for our business, as we transitioned to a public company following our ipo in october 2016. this was a significant milestone for biffa, achieved despite uncertain capital markets, and has positioned the group well for the future. our acquisitions are mentioned on page 25, but i want to make special mention of a couple. underlying free cash flow 1 was £28.8m, substantially increased on the prior year once significant one off items are excluded. the waste management industry continues to be one which evolves in a way that involves an ever increasingly complicated supply chain. i would like to personally thank all the people of biffa for their hard work and dedication, especially through a demanding listing process. ian wakelin chief executive 13 june 2017 our strategy continues to deliver results and therefore remains

as a result of increasing environmental regulation and awareness, as well as developing trends and customer preferences. why these kpis are important being able to offer a range of waste collection, processing and disposal services enables biffa to meet the increasingly complex waste management needs of its customers and regulators, giving it competitive advantage. additionally, scale brings operational efficiency, ensuring we can provide competitively priced services whilst generating attractive returns. why these kpis are important the uk waste market is expected to continue its broader shift away from landfill disposal toward recycling and energy recovery. we were successful in growing our i&c business, with notable new customers including john lewis partnership, coca cola enterprises and engie. we also captured benefits from project fusion and delivered significant operational improvements in our materials recycling facilities. disposing of residual waste, and in recent years we have developed a network of facilities to prepare waste into refuse derived fuel (rdf), from where it is sent for incineration in both the uk and other european countries. • underlying operating profit margin growth from 5.7% to 7 .4%: prior year acquisitions fully integrated while other cost efficiencies and price discipline delivered into the base business. a significant cost of the i&c business relates to the cost of jeff anderson md, industrial & commercial we have continued to deliver strong growth in our operating margins by increasing collection efficiency and integrating our acquisitions. local government customers have also recognised the need to see a balance of risk and reward with the outsource service providers – which has seen a move toward gain share arrangements in areas such as recycling performance and also for service improvement initiatives. performance summary the municipal division has continued to see strong growth with revenue increasing by 13. we are very proud to partner with some of the best performing local another strong customer performance in a competitive market with major new business wins and an excellent track record of contract extensions” roger edwards md, municipal employees 3,500 locations 49 strategic objectives the municipal division will continue to seek to grow revenue profitably through maximising customer retention through contract extensions and by capitalising on the trend toward larger scale contracts. in parallel we continued to focus on developing alternative treatments for certain materials, including composting, aggregates recycling and polymer reprocessing. the landfill market is increasingly focused on waste that cannot be recycled or treated for energy recovery. separate food waste collections have grown in recent years and this has supported the development of ad facilities. currently there appears to be excess capacity and this has resulted in a downward pressure on gate fees. • partnership with covanta to investigate the feasibility of developing large scale efw plants in two uk locations. the board will continually review organic growth opportunities, value enhancing acquisitions and shareholder returns to ensure it operates with an optimal capital structure. cash flow a summary of the group’s cash flows is shown below: fy 17 (£m) fy 16 (£m) underlying

material misstatement or loss. strategic report www.biffa.co.uk 28 biffa plc annual report and accounts 2017 principal risks and uncertainties summarised opposite are the key risks, not in order of significance, identified which could have a material impact on the group’s reputation, operations or financial performance. if the group were to violate health & safety laws/ regulations it could have a material adverse effect on biffa’s business and reputation. financial • group delegated authorities in place to manage internal and board review/approval of all material transactions. • board and executive level review with update included in monthly report summarising current pipeline of identified potential targets. • due diligence undertaken for all m&a transactions including use of external advisers depending on target value and complexity. a standardised approach using an established valuation model is also in place with all transactions reviewed/approved by the investment committee and (where appropriate) board. • group’s funding arrangements contain flexibility designed to allow for expansion/relief in the event of material acquisitions. • protection from change of law or force majeure for unforeseen circumstances is designed into contracts. financial reputational operational • externally hosted business continuity recovery sites for key admin and support functions with a tri-annual testing programme in place. • intrusion detection in place and an imminent migration to a cloud-based “always on” security service protecting against key cyber threats. • web filtering, malware protection and regular penetration testing in place protecting against key cyber threats. any economic weakness that leads to reduced volumes of waste and recyclate could adversely impact the group’s business. • biffa performance share plan developed and approved to form a key retention measure for senior management. we also have 59 apprentices in training and will look to double this number from april 2017 . we understand the importance of nurturing and developing our internal talent, particularly in relation to succession planning for senior positions within biffa. the ‘&me’ programme was developed following analysis of our sickness absence and accident data before being deployed throughout biffa from november of 2016. the &me programme includes an employee assistance programme (eap) which gives all employees free and confidential access to professional advice on a range of issues such as debt, relationship problems or other commonly occurring daily life stressors 24 hours a day. we compare our employee engagement levels with other business metrics such as profitability, health & safety performance and customer service. vehicle and plant movements a key priority at all biffa facilities is to ensure robust pedestrian segregation systems are in place. biffa operates in accordance with a “5 metre” rule to ensure that vehicles and mobile plant operators stop work if pedestrians enter their safe working zone. biffa was the first waste management company to enter into a primary authority agreement with hampshire fire and rescue service. the development of strong partnerships with police services and local authorities is growing nationwide to tackle this. biffa has publicly supported the new health & safety executive (hse) strategy “helping great britain work well” and has provided a commitment in support of this hse strategy such as our driving recklessly on pavements and people in bins campaigns detailed above. biffa the commentator: influencing uk waste policy and thought leadership through our environmental external affairs activities we keep abreast of the changing policy and legal landscape which we help to shape it through our engagement. 2015 saw increased focus in this area to continue driving performance forward, including production of a new, target-driven, three-year environmental compliance and training strategy. this approach involves focus on reducing our energy consumption, continually improving how we manage landfill methane and increasing the quantities of recyclate released to market. it also includes increasing the amount of renewable energy that we generate directly from biogas and other renewable fuels as well as indirectly, through our supply of refuse derived fuels to energy from waste facilities. community volunteering biffa’s people also get directly involved in helping the local communities we serve. similarly, where major new developments are planned, biffa engages with the local community and regulators to discuss proposals. nationality: british appointment date: 28 september 2016 committee memberships: n r external appointments steve is chairman of wincanton plc.

on each non-executive director can be found in their biographies on pages 42 and 43. each non-executive director is appointed for an initial fixed term of three years, subject to annual re-election by shareholders. four further board and two remuneration committee meetings were held as part of the ipo process prior to admission. directors are provided with appropriate documentation approximately one week in advance of each board or committee meeting during the year. the system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and it must be recognised that it can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. each director provides the company secretary with information regarding any actual or potential interests that may conflict with those of the company, such as other external directorships, and any other potential interests that each thinks may cause a conflict requiring prior board authorisation on an annual basis. a full, formal and tailored induction programme will be developed for any new directors joining the board. the committee concluded that it was satisfied with management’s valuations of these assets and liabilities. any control deficiencies identified will be followed up with action plans tracked by the committee. policies and procedures, including clearly defined levels of delegated authority, have been communicated across the group. this policy requires audit committee approval for any non-audit services the value of which exceeds £50,000. whistleblowing the group adopted procedures at least 12 months prior to admission by which all employees may, in confidence, report any concerns. board succession planning will however be reviewed before the end of financial year 2018 and annually thereafter. these activities were undertaken in the context of a strong year of underlying financial performance in what was also a transformational year for biffa, which included increasing revenues by 6.8% and growing underlying operating margins from 6.7% to 7 .5%. indeed, we are very keen to encourage an open dialogue with our shareholders on executive remuneration. it is anticipated that any salary increases will generally be in line with those awarded to salaried staff. benefits may be provided up to an aggregate value of £50,000 for each executive director (or such higher amount as the remuneration committee considers appropriate). n/a pension to provide retirement benefits the executive directors will receive a defined contribution provision (or cash supplement). the remuneration committee may impose such conditions as it considers appropriate which must be satisfied before any award will vest. the chairman and non-executive directors do not participate in any new cash or share incentive plans since admission. in addition, while performance and targets used in the annual bonus plan and psp will generally remain unaltered, if events occur which the committee determines would make a different or amended target a fairer measure of performance, such amended or different target can be set provided that it is not materially more or less difficult to satisfy, having regard to the event in question. the committee may make minor amendments to the remuneration policy set out above for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation, without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment. it may, however, be necessary in some cases to make buy-out awards on terms that are more bespoke than the existing annual bonus plan and psp . the service agreements of all executive directors, which are available for inspection at the company’s registered office, comply with this policy: • ian wakelin’s service agreement is terminable by either party on not less than 12 months’ written notice or immediately upon payment in lieu of notice, and contains a 12-month garden leave clause. the contract provides for immediate termination upon payment in lieu of notice and contains a six-month garden leave clause. if there is a takeover, scheme of arrangement, demerger or other corporate reorganisation of the company, participants may be required, or may be allowed, to exchange their deferred bonus awards for equivalent awards in the acquiring company. 0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000 2250 2500 long-term incentive ian wakelin chief executive ofﬁcer minimum on-target maximum minimum on-target maximum michael topham chief

mismatches in international rules resulted in draft legislation on areas such as interest deductibility being issues during the year. the price to earnings multiple is derived from market observable data for a broadly comparable business. the fair value of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities are determined based on discounted cash flow analysis using current market rates for similar instruments. the group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates. the interest on floating rate financial instruments is re-set at intervals of less than one year. these amounts include receivable balances from local authority clients, hence are not exposed to significant credit risk. this analysis assumes that, where interest rates are currently less than 1%, any reduction is capped at zero. restoration costs are incurred as each site is filled, and in the period immediately after its closure. aftercare costs are incurred as each site is filled and for a number of years post closure. 32. evp related items the group is engaged in a dispute with hmrc concerning historic landfill tax. investments are tested for impairment when an
