• Due to its diverse operations and operating scale, Biffa is not dependent on any single sector, service or facility. The Group’s four operating divisions support each other by providing control over waste flows and security of disposal routes. The Group’s services are organised across four operating divisions: Industrial & Commercial (I&C); Municipal; Resource Recovery & Treatment (RR&T); and Energy. The facilities sort dry mixed recyclables to make them suitable for use as secondary raw materials in manufacturing processes. These and certain other items resulted in the Group reporting a statutory loss after tax of £10.9m (prior year £5. I would also like to thank the Group’s loyal employees for their hard work and commitment this year. Steve Marshall Chairman 2 See Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss Strategic Report www.biffa.co.uk 10 Biffa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Chief Executive’s Statement A Successful Year The past 12 months has been an exciting time for our business, as we transitioned to a public company following our IPO in October 2016. Underlying Free Cash Flow 1 was £28.8m, substantially increased on the prior year once significant one off items are excluded. The waste management industry continues to be one which evolves in a way that involves an ever increasingly complicated supply chain. I would like to personally thank all the people of Biffa for their hard work and dedication, especially through a demanding listing process.

Why these KPIs are important The UK waste market is expected to continue its broader shift away from landfill disposal toward recycling and energy recovery. We were successful in growing our I&C business, with notable new customers including John Lewis Partnership, Coca Cola Enterprises and Engie. • Underlying Operating Profit margin growth from 5.7% to 7 .4%: Prior year acquisitions fully integrated while other cost efficiencies and price discipline delivered into the base business. Local government customers have also recognised the need to see a balance of risk and reward with the outsource service providers – which has seen a move toward gain share arrangements in areas such as recycling performance and also for service improvement initiatives. We are very proud to partner with some of the best performing local Another strong customer performance in a competitive market with major new business wins and an excellent track record of contract extensions” Roger Edwards MD, Municipal Employees 3,500 Locations 49 Strategic objectives The Municipal division will continue to seek to grow revenue profitably through maximising customer retention through contract extensions and by capitalising on the trend toward larger scale contracts. In parallel we continued to focus on developing alternative treatments for certain materials, including composting, aggregates recycling and polymer reprocessing. The landfill market is increasingly focused on waste that cannot be recycled or treated for energy recovery. Separate food waste collections have grown in recent years and this has supported the development of AD facilities. Currently there appears to be excess capacity and this has resulted in a downward pressure on gate fees. The Board will continually review organic growth opportunities, value enhancing acquisitions and shareholder returns to ensure it operates with an optimal capital structure. If the Group were to violate health & safety laws/ regulations it could have a material adverse effect on Biffa’s business and reputation. • Board and executive level review with update included in monthly report summarising current pipeline of identified potential targets. • Due diligence undertaken for all M&A transactions including use of external advisers depending on target value and complexity. A standardised approach using an established valuation model is also in place with all transactions reviewed/approved by the Investment Committee and (where appropriate) Board. Financial Reputational Operational • Externally hosted Business Continuity recovery sites for key admin and support functions with a tri-annual testing programme in place. • Intrusion detection in place and an imminent migration to a cloud-based “always on” security service protecting against key cyber threats. Any economic weakness that leads to reduced volumes of waste and recyclate could adversely impact the Group’s business. We understand the importance of nurturing and developing our internal talent, particularly in relation to succession planning for senior positions within Biffa. We compare our employee engagement levels with other business metrics such as profitability, health & safety performance and customer service. Vehicle and Plant Movements A key priority at all Biffa facilities is to ensure robust pedestrian segregation systems are in place. Biffa operates in accordance with a “5 metre” rule to ensure that vehicles and mobile plant operators stop work if pedestrians enter their safe working zone. Biffa was the first waste management company to enter into a primary authority agreement with Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service. 2015 saw increased focus in this area to continue driving performance forward, including production of a new, target-driven, three-year environmental compliance and training strategy. This approach involves focus on reducing our energy consumption, continually improving how we manage landfill methane and increasing the quantities of recyclate released to market. These include: • Carbon Saver Gold accreditation: Biffa has maintained this certification over the last 10 years, in addition to maintaining other accreditations including ISO 14001. Our I&C division operates a charitable giving scheme through which depots accrue funds for every day with no LTI. Similarly, where major new developments are planned, Biffa engages with the local community and regulators to discuss proposals.
