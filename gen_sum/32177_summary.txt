annual report, such as operating cash proﬁt, are not deﬁned under ifrs and are therefore termed apms. infrastructure continues to execute its updated strategy effectively, generating good returns with a strong pipeline of new business. martine verluyten has decided not to seek re-election at the annual general meeting on 29 june 2017 . i am conﬁdent that the group will remain opportunistic but disciplined as we navigate what promises to be another year of signiﬁcant uncertainty. overview 3i group annual report and accounts 2017 04 chief executive’s review we continued to make very strong progress at 3i in fy2017 . we sold our debt management business for £270 million during the year, as we were not conﬁdent that this business would meet our return requirements and justify its relative complexity in a more onerous regulatory environment in the future. we aim to double the earnings of new investments under our ownership through operational improvements, international growth and careful m&a strategies. as a fast growth, disruptive retailer, action has been transformed by the successful execution of its international expansion strategy. as a result, its chinese capacity has doubled and sales have increased by more than 100%. aspen pumps, audley travel, basic-fit, q holding and euro-diesel also performed well, with strong, organic earnings growth. however, it is inevitable that there will be some challenges in any broad-based private equity portfolio and our high street retailer, christ, suffered from declining footfall. this is particularly important in an economic environment where there are limited opportunities for attractive new investment at sensible prices. we launched our north american infrastructure business in march 2017 as a natural and key strategic extension of 3i’s established european platform. outlook 3i is now performing as it should, with careful investment and active asset management generating very strong returns. the broader environment remains volatile and challenging but we remain conﬁdent in our ability to deliver continued, good growth for shareholders. its product range consists of 13 categories, with products sourced from over 400 suppliers, offered at low prices due to action’s scale and highly efﬁcient supply chain. it is well positioned in the growing non-food discount market with superior earnings and cash conversion capability relative to its peers. for more information, visit www.action.nl £106m invested in september 2011 £1 ,708m value at march 2017 net sales (€m) ebitda (€m) 2012 2013 2014 2015

and generated £982 million of proceeds at an average money multiple of 3.7x. for partial realisations and reﬁnancings, valuations of any remaining investment are included in the multiple. it also completed two small acquisitions, designed to allow direct control of its distribution channels and product bolt-ons. macro-economic developments are impacting a small number of our investments, especially those exposed to capital expenditure in the oil and commodities sector (dynatect) or weaker consumer sentiment and decelerating tourist ﬂows which have reduced spending on the high street in europe (christ). the decline in multiple is principally due to basic-fit, which listed in june; it was previously valued using a multiple materially higher than the portfolio average at 31 march 2016, and is now held on a quoted basis. when setting multiples, we consider factors such as exit plans, relative performance and investment size. the gse that tcr provides is critical infrastructure, without which some of europe’s busiest airports could not operate. wig is independent of any network operator and invests in infrastructure that can be accessed by all networks. table 5: unrealised

methodology, including deﬁnitions and rationale, is included in the portfolio valuation – an explanation section on pages 158 and 159. assets under management infrastructure aum increased to £2.9 billion (31 march 2016: £2.3 billion) principally due to 3in’s fundraising and strong portfolio performance. while we continue to see a good ﬂow of new investment opportunities, there remains strong demand for infrastructure assets as capital ﬂows towards more defensive sectors. it was also the year in which we sold our debt management business to investcorp. further information on the private equity and infrastructure valuations is included in their respective business reviews. we expect that expenses in fy2018 will be broadly double the second half costs of £63 million. since its introduction in 2012, this measure has been deﬁned as cash portfolio and fee income less accrued operating expenses, the latter being used as it was not considered to be materially different from cash operating expenses. the consequence of this year’s valuation increase is that our largest private equity fund, efv, went through its performance hurdle and consequently we recognised signiﬁcant carried interest receivable. a share of this receivable is accrued as carried interest payable to the associated plan participants. the group is a long-term investor and does not hedge its foreign currency denominated portfolio. subject to shareholder approval, the ﬁnal dividend of £178 million will also be paid in july 2017 . portfolio companies (held directly by 3i group plc) portfolio

ﬂows and disclose the underlying investment activity. the apms that we use may not be directly comparable with those used by other companies. all employees share the responsibility for upholding 3i’s strong control culture and supporting effective risk management. in addition, all staff are assessed on how they have demonstrated 3i’s values as part of their annual appraisal. other infrastructure investments made by the group should be capable of delivering capital growth and fund management fees which together generate mid-teens returns. • overall responsibility for maintaining a system of internal controls that ensures an effective risk management and oversight process operates across the group. the group believes that its consistent strategy of focusing on core sectors and geographies, its institutional process- led approach to investment and strong culture will help it to navigate what it expects will be another challenging year for ﬁnancial markets. we review our internal processes and investment decisions in light of actual outcomes on an ongoing basis. we comply fully with applicable human rights legislation in the countries in which we operate, for example covering areas such as freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, equal remuneration and protection against discrimination. we are committed to ensuring that the businesses we invest in comply with all applicable laws in relation to their employees (amongst other things) and, where appropriate, that they work towards meeting relevant international standards (such as the ilo fundamental conventions) where those are more stringent. our corporate responsibility strategy is deﬁned by three key priorities: 1. recruit and develop a diverse pool of talent 2. invest responsibly 3. embed responsible business practices throughout the organisation this section aims to provide a brief summary of our approach to corporate responsibility. we believe that there are great beneﬁts to be gained from having a diverse and varied workforce. the members of our executive committee have an open-door policy and know most employees by name. we promote and facilitate the ownership of 3i shares among employees through variable compensation or share investment plans. graduate training scheme our graduate recruitment scheme, designed to develop our next generation of world-class investment professionals and business leaders, was launched in 2015. we are a small organisation, however we believe this programme is important in fostering a distinctive 3i culture. good corporate governance is fundamental to the way that 3i, and its investee companies, conduct business. chairman’s introduction in an uncertain environment, strong corporate governance is critical to ensuring our long-term success. director of schroders plc from 2002 to 2008, during which time he was chief financial ofﬁcer and later vice chairman. previous experience formerly finance director of daily mail and general trust plc (“dmgt”) from january 2011 to april 2017 . prior to ge, was a partner at the law ﬁrms travers smith and latham & watkins. alan giddins managing partner, private equity a member of the executive committee and the group’s investment committee since 2010. previous experience joined 3i in 2005. prior to joining 3i, spent 13 years in investment banking, latterly as a managing director at société générale. shareholders can also remove any director by ordinary resolution of which special notice has been given. the chairman is available to maintain a dialogue with shareholders on strategy, corporate governance and directors’ remuneration as required. the chairman and senior independent director are also available to meet with shareholders as required. the investor relations team also manages a programme of engagement with smaller shareholders, implemented through regular presentations and meetings. these included conferences organised by morgan stanley, société générale, kbw, bank of america merrill lynch, jpmorgan cazenove and citi. the committee also monitors internal audit activity quarterly, covering change management and other areas of identiﬁed higher risk. this report highlighted the main drivers of value movement analysed between performance, multiple movements and other factors. multiples are selected by reference to quoted comparable companies, m&a transactions and input in certain cases from corporate ﬁnance advisers. we also take into account growth proﬁle, geographic location, business mix, degree of diversiﬁcation and leverage/reﬁnancing risk. earnings data is received monthly from private equity portfolio companies and monitored closely by management. actual earnings may then be adjusted in management’s proposed valuations, for example, to reﬂect a full year’s trading of an acquired business, removing proﬁt from discontinued activities, any forecast uncertainty or to exclude exceptional transaction costs. imminent sale assets at any point in time it is likely that a number of potential exit processes from the portfolio are underway. judgement is applied by management as to the likely eventual exit proceeds and certainty of completion. however, as a general rule an asset moves to an imminent sale basis only when a process is materially complete and the remaining risks are estimated to be small, given the amount of completion risk around unquoted equity transactions. discount rates are selected by management with reference to market transactions, weighted average cost of capital calculations and other public data. meanwhile, we continued to strengthen our investment capabilities through new hires and talent management in both remaining businesses. director remuneration for

notes have nil value. it is not possible to identify with certainty investments that will be sold within one year. these adjustments may be required to reﬂect market participants’ considerations about fair value that may include, but are not limited to, liquidity and the portfolio effect of holding multiple investments within the investment entity subsidiary. there was no particular circumstance to indicate that a fair value adjustment was required and after due consideration we concluded that the net asset values were the most appropriate reﬂection of fair value at 31 march 2017 . in particular, 3i designates groups of ﬁnancial instruments as being at fair value when they are managed, and their performance evaluated, on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy, and where information about the groups of ﬁnancial instruments is reported to management on that basis. level 3 inputs are sensitive to assumptions made when
