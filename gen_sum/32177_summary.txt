Infrastructure continues to execute its updated strategy effectively, generating good returns with a strong pipeline of new business. I am conﬁdent that the Group will remain opportunistic but disciplined as we navigate what promises to be another year of signiﬁcant uncertainty. Overview 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2017 04 Chief Executive’s review We continued to make very strong progress at 3i in FY2017 . We aim to double the earnings of new investments under our ownership through operational improvements, international growth and careful M&A strategies. As a fast growth, disruptive retailer, Action has been transformed by the successful execution of its international expansion strategy. However, it is inevitable that there will be some challenges in any broad-based Private Equity portfolio and our high street retailer, Christ, suffered from declining footfall. This is particularly important in an economic environment where there are limited opportunities for attractive new investment at sensible prices. We launched our North American Infrastructure business in March 2017 as a natural and key strategic extension of 3i’s established European platform. Outlook 3i is now performing as it should, with careful investment and active asset management generating very strong returns. The broader environment remains volatile and challenging but we remain conﬁdent in our ability to deliver continued, good growth for shareholders. Its product range consists of 13 categories, with products sourced from over 400 suppliers, offered at low prices due to Action’s scale and highly efﬁcient supply chain. It is well positioned in the growing non-food discount market with superior earnings and cash conversion capability relative to its peers. 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2017 16 9 BoConcept 17 Private Equity Top ten investments 1 6 Basic-Fit 10 Ponroy Santé 19 8 Schlemmer 18 7 ATESTEO Action 1 Scandlines 2 Audley Travel 5 Weener Plastic 4 Q Holding 3 1 This does not include one investment that has been excluded for commercial reasons. It owns several well-known brands, including Biolane, Yves Ponroy, Vitarmonyl, Manhaé, Lécitone, Force G, Ultrabiotique and Naturé Moi. Our local teams have been able to ﬁnd an interesting range of investment opportunities, both for 3i and its portfolio companies, particularly in Europe. In March 2017 , Agent Provocateur went into administration, giving rise to a realised loss of £49 million on our investment. It also completed two small acquisitions, designed to allow direct control of its distribution channels and product bolt-ons. The GSE that TCR provides is critical infrastructure, without which some of Europe’s busiest airports could not operate. WIG is independent of any network operator and invests in infrastructure that can be accessed by all networks. While we continue to see a good ﬂow of new investment opportunities, there remains strong demand for infrastructure assets as capital ﬂows towards more defensive sectors. The consequence of this year’s valuation increase is that our largest Private Equity fund, EFV, went through its performance hurdle and consequently we recognised signiﬁcant carried interest receivable. In addition, all staff are assessed on how they have demonstrated 3i’s values as part of their annual appraisal. Other infrastructure investments made by the Group should be capable of delivering capital growth and fund management fees which together generate mid-teens returns. • Overall responsibility for maintaining a system of internal controls that ensures an effective risk management and oversight process operates across the Group. It also forms part of our half-yearly portfolio company reviews as described in the Valuations Committee report on page 74. We are committed to ensuring that the businesses we invest in comply with all applicable laws in relation to their employees (amongst other things) and, where appropriate, that they work towards meeting relevant international standards (such as the ILO Fundamental Conventions) where those are more stringent. Director of Schroders plc from 2002 to 2008, during which time he was Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and later Vice Chairman. The Board reviews membership of these Committees regularly and aims to ensure that undue reliance is not placed on particular Directors. The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it and its duly authorised Committees for decision. The Chairman is available to maintain a dialogue with shareholders on strategy, corporate governance and Directors’ remuneration as required. The Investor Relations team also manages a programme of engagement with smaller shareholders, implemented through regular presentations and meetings. These included conferences organised by Morgan Stanley, Société Générale, KBW, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Cazenove and Citi. The Committee also monitors Internal Audit activity quarterly, covering change management and other areas of identiﬁed higher risk. Multiples are selected by reference to quoted comparable companies, M&A transactions and input in certain cases from corporate ﬁnance advisers. Imminent sale assets At any point in time it is likely that a number of potential exit processes from the portfolio are underway. Discount rates are selected by management with reference to market transactions, weighted average cost of capital calculations and other public data. Meanwhile, we continued to strengthen our investment capabilities through new hires and talent management in both remaining businesses. Deferred bonuses awarded in FY2017 The two Executive Directors are considered to be AIFMD Identiﬁed Staff and, as such, 60% of their annual bonuses will be delivered in 3i Group plc shares deferred for four years (and which vest one quarter per annum over those four years). At least 50% of any bonus award will be deferred into shares vesting in equal instalments over four years. • Prior to 2011 Executive Directors were eligible for membership of the 3i Group Pension Plan, a deﬁned beneﬁt contributory scheme. • At least 50% of any bonus award will be deferred into shares vesting in equal instalments over four years. • All performance targets, along with relative weightings, are reviewed and set by the Committee prior to awards being made. • The Committee can reduce any award which would otherwise vest if gross debt or gearing targets are missed. • The Board is responsible for determining all other non-executive Director fees, which are reviewed annually to ensure they remain appropriate. It may be necessary to compensate the new Executive Director for variable pay being forfeited from their current employer. For both internal and external appointments, it may be deemed appropriate to buy out awards held in carried interest or other asset-related incentive arrangements. An Executive Director may be eligible to receive a time pro-rated annual bonus in respect of the year up until he or she ceased employment.

These changes will affect future UK corporate taxes payable and the rate at which deferred tax assets are expected to reverse. These transactions are disclosed as additions to portfolio cost with an equal reduction made where loan notes have nil value. In particular, 3i designates groups of ﬁnancial instruments as being at fair value when they are managed, and their performance evaluated, on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy, and where information about the groups of ﬁnancial instruments is reported to management on that basis. Level 3 inputs are sensitive to assumptions made when ascertaining fair value as described in the Portfolio valuation – an explanation section. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated based on expected discounted future cash ﬂows. Carried interest and performance fees payable greater than one year of £124 million (31 March 2016: £85 million) have no stated maturity as they result from investment related transactions and it is not possible to identify with certainty the timing of when the investments will be sold.
