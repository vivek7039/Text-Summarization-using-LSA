Danlind provides McBride with access to accelerated growth in the key strategic category of auto dishwash tablets, through its well-invested capacity, technology platform and high quality product range. For its financial year ending 31 December 2017, on a standalone basis, Danlind is currently expected to generate c.£2.5 million of EBITDA. Raw material pricing pressures continue as the Group remains determined to drive its cost base still lower. Most products offered by discounters are usually private label, as they compete on price, quality and simplicity rather than offering a wider choice of brands. For McBride, this is not different from direct supply to major retail customers, while assisting in maximisation of asset utilisation. Our strong asset base creates the opportunity to further develop manufacturing agreements with other industry players such as branders. Customers Our scale and reach across all key European markets enables McBride to provide customer oriented service propositions aligned with channel requirements. The outlook shows promising positive developments as a result of strong continued growth see case study on page 19. The Contract Manufacturing organisation is now fully in place, and closer relationships with key customers are being established see case study on page 18. It remains apparent that overall there is an increasing interest from brand owners to outsource manufacturing of their products. By combining factory machinery into one site we have improved our flexibility and responsiveness across different capsule formats. The solution also created extra space, which has granted greater on-site storage, reduced external warehousing and lower working capital needs. The benefit Future annual savings from this project, together with its contribution to our ‘customer choices’ simplification programme, exceed £3 million. We have realised a step change in efficiency, with 20% fewer staff delivering the same Household volumes as before. For cost considerations, packaging design has an impact on the performance, weight, stability and time to market efficiency of finished products. R&D packaging and computer modelling laboratory Applying a scientific approach 18 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic progress continued Case study Contract manufacturing Major growth opportunity McBride has been an active contract manufacturing supplier for many years, although the scale of this activity within the Company was limited through historical choices. In recent years, brand owners have shown an increasing propensity to outsource some of their manufacturing requirements. These characteristics enable us to produce a substantial range of product categories and showcase our technological expertise. These attributes are augmented further by our financial strength that enables us to support additional expansion initiatives from contract manufacturing customers. As an example, in the laundry capsule category, McBride is offering a leading brand owner access to its next generation innovation for these products. It should be recognised, however, that the decision-making process by branders to transfer strategic parts of their manufacturing capability to third parties can take longer than decisions made by retailers and in many cases longer than we have previously seen. In addition, we collaboratively designed a new shelf-ready case for the products to be merchandised on store shelves. Excluding “customer choices”, overall volumes were lower by a further 2.8% across the Group as some of our markets became increasingly competitive. When adjusting for the impact of various hedging activities underlying adjusted operating profit improved by £3.5 million or 8.5%. The Group meets its funding requirements through internal cash generation and bank credit facilities, most of which are committed until June 2022. Link to strategy Grow Further focus on improvement in managing wastage in manufacturing process 31 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Strategic report Social Employee support A key principle to our business success is creating a culture whereby all colleagues across the Group are recognised as a valuable asset and supported to become fully engaged, aligned and achieve their full potential. All conform with the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) and our sites are independently audited at a frequency determined by risk. Colleagues’ children who undertake a university course or apprenticeship are offered an award to support their education. In the period July 2016 to June 2017 we made three stock donations which benefited 1,476 voluntary and community organisations. McBride donated a range of products, including items such as shower gel, washing up liquid and handwash, which the charity redistributed among service users. Neil’s financial background and expertise leave him eminently suitable to hold the role of Audit Committee Chair.

Conflicts of Interest Our procedure for capturing Directors’ interests can be found in the Other statutory information section on page 63. No failings or weaknesses have been identified which had a material effect on the Company’s financial performance. However, as the Board is small, comprising only six members, we continue to believe that quotas are not appropriate. Operation • Benefits include private medical insurance, sick pay, a fully expensed car (or equivalent cash allowance), disability and life assurance cover. Operation • Executive Director service contracts will stipulate the Company’s compensation commitments to be honoured in an early termination event. Neither Executive has had a salary increase since joining McBride, despite their and the Group’s strong performance. For performance above this level, awards will vest on a rising scale, with full vesting only if EPS CAGR reaches 17%. Chris Smith has a contracted agreement that this payment relieves the Company of any liability for pension provision on his behalf. There will be no resetting or retesting of the performance conditions, other than in exceptional circumstances as set out on page 52. (2) There have been no changes from those detailed below between 30 June 2017 and the date of this Report. We are keen to engage our employees by providing an open environment where they can contribute their own ideas and challenge those of others. If current employees become disabled they will continue to be employed, wherever practicable in the same job. If cash flow or discount rate assumptions were to change, further impairment losses may be recognised in the next financial year. It was calculated using a number of assumptions, including future CPI rate changes, increases to pension benefits and mortality rates. Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances. Provided the conditions specified by IAS 39, ‘Financial instruments: recognition and measurement’ are met, hedge accounting may be used to mitigate this volatility in profit or loss. 85 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Strategic report Personal (4) Household Total Care & Total Total UK North (1) South (2) East (3) Household Aerosols segments Corporate (5) Group 2016 £m £m £m £m £m £m £m £m £m Segment revenue 164.9 179.0 69.2 121.9 535.0 145.9 680.9 — 680.9 Adjusted operating profit/(loss) 42.7 2.7 45.4 (9.2) 36.2 Amortisation of intangible assets (0.9) Exceptional items (see note 5) (2.4) Operating profit 32.9 Net finance costs (7.1) Profit before taxation 25.8 Inventories 56.9 18.8 75.7 — 75.7 Capital expenditure 10.6 2.2 12.8 — 12.8 Amortisation and depreciation 16.0 3.1 19.1 — 19.1 Revenue by major customer In 2017 and 2016, no individual customer provided more than 10% of the Group’s revenue.

Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses on remeasurement are immediately recognised in the Company income statement. This effectiveness testing is performed at each reporting date to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective. Derivative financial instruments with maturity dates of more than one year from the balance sheet date are disclosed as non-current. The Company has entered into a number of financial derivative contracts and each is discussed in turn. The contracts are all measured at fair value, which is determined using valuation techniques that utilise observable inputs. 122 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Group five-year summary Year ended 30 June 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 £m £m £m £m £m Revenue 705.2 680.9 704.2 744.2 761.4 Adjusted operating profit 41.5 36.2 28.5 22.0 23.6 Amortisation of intangible assets (0.7) (0.9) (1.0) (1.4) (1.1) Exceptional items (1.0) (2.4) (17.8) (34.5) (7.5) Operating profit/(loss) 39.8 32.9 9.7 (13.9) 15.0 Net finance costs (20.6) (7.1) (7.1) (7.4) (6.0) Profit/(loss) before tax 19.2 25.8 2.6 (21.3) 9.0 Taxation (10.3) (8.8) (3.3) 2.2 (3.5) Profit/(loss) after tax 8.9 17.0 (0.7) (19.1) 5.5 Earnings per share Diluted 4.9p 9.3p (0.4p) (10.5p) 3.0p Adjusted diluted 13.1p 11.1p 8.3p 5.3p 7.3p Payments to shareholders (per ordinary share) 4.3p 3.6p 3.6p 5.0p 5.0p At 30 June 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 £m £m £m £m £m Non-current assets Property, plant and equipment 140.9 136.2 129.8 143.4 173.6 Intangible assets 21.7 20.0 19.7 26.3 34.1 Other assets 12.7 22.5 21.5 14.6 6.2 175.3 178.7 171.0 184.3 213.9 Current assets 244.6 240.0 225.4 245.8 231.9 Current liabilities (241.3) (219.6) (218.0) (229.8) (246.9) Non-current liabilities (114.4) (130.0) (120.9) (131.7) (92.2) Net assets 64.2 69.1 57.5 68.6 106.7 Net debt 75.7 90.9 92.4 84.7 86.8 123 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Strategic report Useful information for shareholders Financial calendar Next key dates for shareholders in 2017 and 2018: Record date for entitlement to B Shares 27 October 2017 Record date for entitlement to B Share allotments payable on B Shares issued and not previously redeemed 27 October 2017 Annual General Meeting 24 October 2017 2017/18 Q1 interim management statement 24 October 2017 Ex-entitlement to B Shares date 30 October 2017 Credit CREST accounts with B Share entitlements 30 October 2017 Latest date for receipt by registrar of completed election forms and submitting CREST elections 17 November 2017 Despatch of cheques in respect of B Shares which have been redeemed 1 December 2017 Payment into bank accounts in respect of B Shares which have been redeemed by certificated shareholders who have valid mandate instructions in place 1 December 2017 Despatch of share certificates for B Shares not being redeemed 1 December 2017 Payments on redeemed B Shares issued in CREST 1 December 2017 Payments of B Share allotments payable on B Shares issued and not previously redeemed 1 December 2017 2017/18 Half year end 31 December 2017 2017/18 Half year trading statement January 2018 Interim results announced February 2018 2017/18 Year end 30 June 2018 2017/18 Year end trading statement July 2018 Full year preliminary statement September 2018 These dates are provisional and may be subject to change.
