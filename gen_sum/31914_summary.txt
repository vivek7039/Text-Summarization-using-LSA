statements additional information strategic report as the leading provider of private label household and personal care products, we manufacture and supply europe’s major retailers for their private label offering and our extensive manufacturing platform provides contract manufacturing capacity to brand owners. danlind provides mcbride with access to accelerated growth in the key strategic category of auto dishwash tablets, through its well-invested capacity, technology platform and high quality product range. danlind will enable mcbride to gain entry into growth segments where it is currently under-represented. raw material pricing pressures continue as the group remains determined to drive its cost base still lower. for mcbride, this is not different from direct supply to major retail customers, while assisting in maximisation of asset utilisation. retailers will increasingly rely on sophisticated large private label manufacturers to assist them with competitive advantage. with our staple products, overall demand patterns are steady and change only over extended time horizons. business model external drivers 7 mcbride plc annual report and accounts 2017 corporate governance financial statements additional information strategic report manufacturing excellence ‘manufacturing excellence’ is an investment programme targeted at an optimised asset configuration supporting our market and growth ambitions. our strong asset base creates the opportunity to further develop manufacturing agreements with other industry players such as branders. customers our scale and reach across all key european markets enables mcbride to provide customer oriented service propositions aligned with channel requirements. as a pan-european employer, mcbride has access to a wide variety of talent so that whatever we do, whatever organisation we build, mcbride can deliver upon its ambition and promises – with its people engaged, developed and positively challenged. mcbride positioning and differentiation strategic objectives and value delivery sustainable profit streams permitting appropriate investment in assets, retaining our leading position in the industry to deliver earnings growth to shareholders maximise market‑leading position and size to deliver scale advantage for value creation and development of growth opportunities our three to five year ambition for adjusted operating profit margin (ebita%) is 7.5% with roce targeted at 25%-30% 8 mcbride plc annual report and accounts 2017 mcbride is in the midst of a transformation programme with the ambition of setting the business on a growth path, delivering sustainable returns, turning mcbride’s size into scale for the benefit of all stakeholders. the market dynamics offer further opportunities that will require targeted investments into our key sites. three sources of growth have been identified: organic market share – we have defined those product categories where we can outgrow the market providing we offer the technology, cost position and capacity required to supply varying channels and geographic markets: • we have a strong position in certain categories such as auto dishwash and laundry capsules, which are showing growth above market average and where our cost, technology and capacity leadership allows us to accelerate our growth even further; • categories where growth is in line with market averages but our existing or future cost position will allow us to outgrow the market. additionally a workstream to further optimise our warehousing and distribution network is also under way. the contract manufacturing organisation is now fully in place, and closer relationships with key customers are being established see case study on page 18. it remains apparent that overall there is an increasing interest from brand owners to outsource manufacturing of their products. mcbride is meeting this challenge through a focused approach of reorganisation, investment and efficiency improvement. by combining factory machinery into one site we have improved our flexibility and responsiveness across different capsule formats. through a focused operational excellence team, driving initiatives the output of liquid capsules has increased by 30%. the solution also created extra space, which has granted greater on-site storage, reduced external warehousing and lower working capital needs. the benefit future annual savings from this project, together with its contribution to our ‘customer choices’ simplification programme, exceed £3 million. we have realised a step change in efficiency, with 20% fewer staff delivering the same household volumes as before. for cost considerations, packaging design has an impact on the performance, weight, stability and time to market efficiency of finished products. the 3d printing capability allows us to study a new bottle design offering differentiated options with our operational capabilities in mind, by simulating packaging performance and confirming decisions before any prototyping or testing on our main production lines takes place. r&d packaging and computer modelling laboratory applying a scientific approach 18 mcbride plc annual report and accounts 2017 strategic progress continued case study contract manufacturing major growth opportunity mcbride has been an active contract manufacturing supplier for many years, although the scale of this activity within the company was limited through historical choices. in recent years, brand owners have shown an increasing propensity to outsource some of their manufacturing requirements. these characteristics enable us to produce a substantial range of product categories and showcase our technological expertise. these attributes are augmented further by our financial strength that enables us to support additional expansion initiatives from contract manufacturing customers. as an example, in the laundry capsule category, mcbride is offering a leading brand owner access to its next generation innovation for these products. it should be recognised, however, that the decision-making process by branders to transfer strategic parts of their manufacturing capability to third parties can take longer than decisions made by retailers and in many cases longer than we have previously seen. in addition, we collaboratively designed a new shelf-ready case for the products to be merchandised on store shelves. excluding “customer choices”, overall volumes were lower by a further 2.8% across the group as some of our markets became increasingly competitive. when adjusting for the impact of various hedging activities underlying adjusted operating profit improved by £3.5 million or 8.5%. household £50.3m pca £(0.7)m corporate £(8.1)m household – uk £155.4m – north £192.8m – south £76.4m – eas t £131.1m pca £149.5m 22 mcbride plc annual report and accounts 2017 executive review continued these cost increases, both pricing and currency, were more impactful in the second half year. our focus on delivering scale advantage through manufacturing and cost leadership delivered supply chain saving initiatives of £10.9 million while overhead saving initiatives, some of which were announced in previous years, delivered a further £9.8 million in the year. within italy, revenue is down primarily driven by the impact from our “customer choices” project. our european businesses saw volumes lower by 7.9% overall at constant currency with the main markets for these products, uk and france, continuing to see private label volumes under pressure from branders and high levels of in-store promotional activity. rik de vos chris smith chief executive officer chief finance officer

corporate governance financial statements additional information strategic report notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 june 2017 1. basis of preparation description of business mcbride plc (‘the company’) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the united kingdom. segment information is presented in note 4. accounting period the group’s annual financial statements are drawn up to 30 june. actual outcomes could differ from those estimates and affect the group’s results in future years. cash flows are estimated by applying assumptions to budget sales, production costs and overheads over a five-year forecast period and by applying a perpetuity growth rate to the forecast cash flow in the fifth year. if cash flow or discount rate assumptions were to change, further impairment losses may be recognised in the next financial year. 78 mcbride plc annual report and accounts 2017 notes to the consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 30 june 2017 1. basis of preparation continued critical accounting judgements and estimates continued (iv) contingent consideration contingent consideration payable in a business combination is generally remeasured at each balance sheet date and the change in its carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. it was calculated using a number of assumptions, including future cpi rate changes, increases to pension benefits and mortality rates. at 30 june 2017, the group held provisions amounting to £4.7 million (2016: £6.4m), which principally represented reorganisation and restructuring costs. deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences but, where there exist deductible temporary differences, judgement is required as to whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised based on the availability of future taxable profits. ‘adjusted operating profit’ and ‘adjusted earnings per share’ are not defined under ifrs and, therefore, these measures as defined by the group may not be comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies. changes in the amount of contingent consideration payable that result from events after the acquisition date, such as meeting a revenue or profit target, are not measurement period adjustments and are, therefore, recognised in profit or loss. cost represents the expenditure incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition. bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances. provided the conditions specified by ias 39, ‘financial instruments: recognition and measurement’ are met, hedge accounting may be used to mitigate this volatility in profit or loss. 83 mcbride plc annual report

fair value represent observable market data as follows: • level 1 – unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; • level 2 – inputs other than level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and • level 3 – inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 97

in the lease rentals and their fair value has been assessed relative to prevailing market interest rates. the group’s cash balances are managed such that there is no significant concentration of credit risk in any one bank or other financial institution. the group’s borrowing facilities are monitored against forecast requirements and timely action is taken to put in place, renew or replace credit lines. at 30 june 2017, £5.4 million (2016: £8.3m) was drawn against these facilities in the form of overdrafts and short-term borrowings. while the magnitude of these exposures is relatively low, the group’s policy is to hedge committed transactions in full and to hedge a proportion of highly probable forecast transactions on a twelve-month rolling basis. following consultation with staff and the uk fund’s trustee, the uk defined benefit fund was closed to future service accrual from 29 february 2016. staff affected by this change were offered a new defined contribution scheme from
