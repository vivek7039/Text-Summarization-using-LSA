The Group has a formal governance framework in place underpinning our approach to risk management. Management’s assessment of our principal risks is based on impact, likelihood, and any change from the prior year. We have detailed and tested procedures in place for dealing with these types of scenarios when they arise. Low High Impact Consumer Finance Regulation and Compliance Credit Risk and Liquidity Property Availability & Lease Cost Competition Business Systems & Information Infrastructure Brand & Reputation Seasonality/ Extreme Weather Product Liability Claim Our People Economic Environment Supply Chain & Infrastructure Remote Highly probable Likelihood Group Principal Risks Map Shows movement in risk. • We offer a range of products and price points in our categories to ensure that customers can trade up or down. Strategic Report Key Risk Description Mitigation Change In Risk Level Business systems and information infrastructure The Group’s business involves a high number of operational and financial transactions across numerous sites that rely on the continuous operation of our IT systems. • The committed bank revolving credit facility has been agreed and is in place until October 2018. • When sourcing products we ensure that at least two factories can produce each product providing resilience. • Key aspects of our business activities that have the potential to impact reputation are monitored closely. Suppliers are required to provide evidence that the product supplied is compliant with all current regulations. • The Board has adopted a succession plan which includes strategy and contingency measures should key individuals not be available. Our future success is at risk if we do not recruit and retain high-calibre people. Property – availability/ lease costs The Group’s business requires that it leases substantial amounts of retail space. The Group continues to hold a significant cash balance and maintains an undrawn £12.0m committed revolving credit facility. In addition, the Group operates a Whistleblowing Policy, aimed principally at our employees, but also available to others working in our supply chains which allows the reporting of any wrongdoing and extends to human rights violations including modern slavery. ScS is a growing business and in the last 12 months we have created 104 new jobs across our organisation. Using this approach is key to the development of our distribution teams in identifying potential drivers whilst offering career progression and promotion. Using technology to deliver some learning interventions means our training can be more cost-effective and highly responsive in terms of identifying best working practices. In recent years our partner sponsorship of their award-winning Tackle It and Making Celebrating 100 stores, by celebrating 100 ‘good causes’ As part of our celebrations for reaching 100 stores nationwide, we wanted to say a big ‘thank you’ and give something back to each of the local communities that supported us on our journey from one local store in Sunderland to 100 across the UK. | Pupils The Friends of Larkfield were delighted with their donation which will help fund school resources.

Details of Committee meetings and attendance are set out in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 41. A long-term incentive plan was awarded during 2017 the details of which can be found in our 2016 Annual Report. The Executive Directors are also provided with private medical insurance and Life Assurance that provides cover of up to four times base salary. Pre-bonus EBITDA £16,514,528 £19,254,675 £20,932,013 £22,609,350 % maximum 12.5% 50% 75% 100% David Knight £53,550 £214,200 £321,300 £428,400 Chris Muir £30,000 £120,000 £180,000 £240,000 Bonuses are calculated on a straight-line basis for performance between target levels. *** David Knight and Chris Muir opt to receive part of their pension contributions as a cash allowance. There were no payments to past Directors for loss of office in the year ended 29 July 2017. In addition, where the Committee considers it appropriate to do so, additional relocation expenses may be paid. The cost of benefits paid to an Executive Director in any one year is capped at £100,000, but this may be exceeded in exceptional circumstances, for example, if the cost of a benefit were to increase significantly. As the regulations require a formal cap for a three-year period, future bonus potential will only increase where appropriate against market data and, in any event, will be subject to an overall maximum of 200% of salary for any Executive Director. Corporate Governance I Remuneration Element Purpose Operation Maximum Long-term incentives Awards may be made annually of £nil-cost options based on performance conditions. A small group of senior management also participate in the LTIP for performance share awards. Also the Company employee share incentive plan (SIP), which was adopted prior to admission has been launched. Assumptions • The minimum scenario reflects fixed remuneration only which is base salary, pension and benefits. • If a new Executive Director’s salary is set on appointment below the median market rates, phased increases (as a percentage of salary) above those granted generally to other employees may be awarded subject to the individual’s performance and development. There are no enhanced provisions on a change of control under the Executive Directors’ service contracts. They are appointed for an initial three-year period subject to being re-elected by members annually. Remuneration Element Purpose Operation Maximum Non-Executive Directors fees Helps recruit and retain high quality, experienced individuals. Paul Daccus is appointed under the terms of a Relationship Agreement with Sun Capital Partners Management V, LLC dated 22 October 2014. No person has any special rights over the Group’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. This applies to recruitment, training, career development and promotion for all employees, regardless of physical ability, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age or ethnic origin. As such there is a material balance of inventory greater than one year old which gives rise to a risk that this aged stock may be unsaleable and therefore not held at the lower of cost and net realisable value. To check whether stock items were being sold at less than book value, a sample of aged stock items sold in the year was selected and the book value compared to proceeds and any associated provision. No material exceptions were noted and we concurred with the provision held by management for aged stock items. We tested on a sample basis the year-end debtor amount to invoice and subsequent receipt post year end. These policies have been consistently applied to all of the years presented, unless otherwise stated. Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, and represents amounts receivable for goods supplied, stated net of discounts, charges associated with interest-free credit sales, returns and value added taxes. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less.
