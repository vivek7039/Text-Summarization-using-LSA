increase the value of content per aircraft by 20 to 250%. one example of such tools is the results cone, a framework designed to enable more effective problem solving and teamwork. this is achieved by highlighting and addressing implicit thought habits which drive behaviours that inhibit successful outcomes in the workplace. the global fleet has grown significantly in recent years, totalling over 47,000 aircraft compared with 31,000 a decade ago. this has been influenced by high oil prices, the low cost of debt and newer, more advanced aircraft coming to market. this was partially offset by declining demand for boeing 777x and airbus a380 platforms where deliveries decreased significantly during the year. good success in recent competitive tenders means we have large jet delivery

aerospace-focused divisions declined during 2017, with good growth on the f-35 joint strike fighter and p-8 poseidon offset by declining revenue on platforms with significant reductions in production rates, including the eurofighter, f-16 falcon and apache. this was partly offset by declining revenue on modestly younger platforms such as the boeing 727 and airbus a300. capability-based business units deploy technological know-how and intellectual property across all our markets so we are not dependent on single customers, individual programmes or market segments. meggitt performance energy revenue declined by 8% in 2017 on an organic basis, including a 21% decline at heatric (our printed circuit heat exchanger business) compared to 2016 when it completed the last of its material contracts to supply pches for floating liquid natural gas (‘flng’) and floating production storage and offloading (‘fpso’) vessels, secured before the significant reduction in oil price. this was the first quarter of year on year growth since q1 2014, and together with organic order growth of 80%, underpins confidence that heatric will return to revenue growth in 2018. organic revenues in power generation segments decreased by 5% in the year, with meggitt sensing systems experiencing weak demand for its sensing systems which are typically focused on the large frame turbine market. growth in civil aftermarket was offset by a 21% organic decline in civil oe, reflecting lower demand for brake control units across a range of regional and business jet programmes and for torque tubes on the airbus a380. in civil aerospace, orders grew by 11% organically, reflecting strong competitive positions on high volume dual source engine programmes. in june 2017, we completed the sale of three

these measures are embedded in the group’s meggitt production system (mps) criteria for moving through its six-phase programme. for the purpose of these plans, actual and target underlying operating profit figures are measured at constant currency. for executive directors, the 2018 ltip includes a return on capital employed (roce) measure rather than rota. for the purpose of these plans, underlying operating profit and trading assets are measured at constant currency. investment is measured as total expenditure in the year as disclosed in note 8 to the group consolidated financial

predominantly the weakness of sterling compared to the us dollar, which partly reversed in the second half. energy revenue declined organically by 8%, including a 21% decline at heatric which completed the last of its significant contracts to support large capital projects in offshore gas during 2016. heatric, as expected, grew strongly in the fourth quarter of 2017. organic revenues in power generation segments also declined during the year, down 5%, driven by lower demand for sensors which are typically sold onto larger industrial gas turbines, partly offset by modest growth in demand for valves and actuators for small frame and aero-derivative gas turbines. we are therefore monitoring developments in this area but do not currently consider any provision is required.

industry, and we have taken steps to manage this risk through chemical hazard assessments conducted at all of our business units. we have performed extensive reliability and qualification testing on potential safer alternatives to prioritise substances scheduled for restriction. for example, we have identified and qualified a non-chromate based primer which is currently being used in a number of our aircraft braking system components and have identified safer alternatives to chlorinated solvents previously used in some of our operations. ethics coordinator available 24 hours a day, 7 days a

financial measures. reasons for this can include adverse prior audit findings, a change in it system, site moves, senior leadership changes or operational performance issues. the approach for 2017 was to deliver these reviews using subject matter experts based around four core strategic it areas: programmes, operations, fix-the-fundamentals and security. the committee believed tony’s extensive industry knowledge, skills and operational experience; gained during a thirty one year career with rolls-royce plc and messier-dowty would be crucial as the group continued to support customers during an unprecedented period of ramp-ups on their new programmes. stip: personal objectives for the executive directors include quality, on time delivery, inventory, footprint consolidation and net purchasing costs. all other benefits except salary remain the same as mr wood was already an executive director. 2018 stip targets and actual performance will both reflect the impact of these two new

consolidated financial statements (prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards (ifrss as adopted by the european union and the companies act 2006)) and the company’s audited financial statements (prepared in accordance with financial reporting standard 101 reduced disclosure framework (frs 101) and the companies act 2006) for the year ended 31 december 2017. there are no significant events affecting the group since the end of the year requiring disclosure except the post balance sheet event disclosed in the table below. incorporation by reference certain laws and regulations require that specific information should be included in the directors’ report. all other employees there are no agreements that would provide compensation for loss of employment resulting from a takeover except that provisions in the company’s share plans may cause options and/or award granted to employees under such plans to vest on a takeover. • we identified 11 reporting units which, in our view, required a full scope audit based on their size or risk. we noted that it would require significant downside changes before a material impairment would be required and having assessed the likelihood of these changes in assumptions arising we concluded that these were not considered to be reasonably possible. we determined that these disclosures appropriately draw attention to the significant areas of estimate and judgement. we determined that these disclosures appropriately draw attention to the significant areas of estimate and uncertainty. foreign currencies functional and presentational currency the group consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. 2. summary of significant accounting policies continued segment reporting operating segments are those segments for which results are reviewed by the group’s chief operating decision maker (‘codm’) to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated. goodwill is tested annually for impairment, and also whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. programme participation costs programme participation costs consist of incentives given to original equipment manufacturers in connection with their selection of the group’s products for installation onto new aircraft where the group has obtained principal supplier status. notes to the consolidated financial statements continued strategic report governance financial statements other information annual report and accounts 2017 meggitt plc 115 impairment of non-current non-financial assets assets are reviewed for impairment annually and also whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. other receivables are discounted to present value where the impact is significant, using a pre-tax rate. qualifying assets are those that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, which would generally be at least 12 months. 116 meggitt plc financial statements annual report and accounts 2017 provisions provision is made for environmental liabilities, onerous contracts, product warranty claims and other liabilities when the group has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. notes to the consolidated financial statements continued strategic report governance financial statements other information annual report and accounts 2017 meggitt plc 117 2. summary of significant accounting policies continued share-based compensation the group operates a number of share-based compensation schemes, which are principally equity-settled. consideration paid for own shares, including any incremental directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from retained earnings. none of these are expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements when they are adopted except as disclosed below: ifrs 15, ‘revenue from contracts with customers’ this standard establishes principles for reporting the nature, amount and timing of revenue arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. • contract accounting revenue certain contracts will no longer meet the criteria for revenue to be recognised as work is performed, but will instead only be recognised at a point in time, usually when goods are delivered to the customer. • revenue from power by the hour and cost per brake landing type contracts revenue will no longer be recognised by reference to the number of aircraft flying hours or aircraft landings but when maintenance events are carried out. • revenue from other services no significant changes to the current method of accounting will arise. these risks are managed by a centralised treasury department, in accordance with board approved objectives, policies and authorities (see also pages 37 to 38 of the chief financial officer’s review). in addition, many of the group’s principal customers are either government departments or large multinationals. key ratios are monitored to ensure continued compliance with covenants contained in the group’s principal credit agreements. it is reasonably foreseeable that, depending on groundwater testing results in 2018, the periods for which operations and maintenance will be required could increase by up to five years. in making this judgement, the group makes estimates of aftermarket revenues which are dependent on aircraft utilisation, fleet lives and operator service routines. the board considers net interest expense on retirement benefit obligations to be a non-trading item and accordingly excludes it from underlying profit measures. work in progress acquired in a business combination is recognised at fair value, which is typically estimated selling price less costs to complete, costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for work still to be carried out. 18. goodwill 2017 £’m 2016 £’m cost at 1 january 2,095.7 1,815.5 exchange rate adjustments (140.9) 282.8

assessment taking into account past default experience and is analysed as follows: 2017 £’m 2016 £’m at 1 january 6.1 6.1 exchange rate adjustments (0.4) 0.7 businesses disposed (0.2) – credit to income statement – net operating costs (1.0) (0.7) at 31 december 4.5 6.1 at 31 december 2017, trade receivables and amounts recoverable on contracts of £67.5m (2016: £57.1m) are past due but not impaired. the non-current portion of bank and other borrowings measured at fair value, is classified as level 3 in the fair value measurement hierarchy, as it has been determined using significant inputs which are a mixture of those based on observable market data (interest rate risk) and those not based on observable market data (credit risk). 144 meggitt plc financial statements annual report and accounts 2017 32. derivative financial instruments continued foreign currency forward contracts although the group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against foreign currency exposures, it has decided that the costs of meeting the extensive documentation requirements to be able to apply hedge accounting under ias 39 ‘financial instruments: recognition and measurement’ are not merited. a. provision has been made for known exposures arising from environmental remediation at a number of sites (see note 4). provision has been made for the expected costs arising from these activities based on information currently available. there is a provision, included within other provisions, for certain claims which cannot be recovered from insurers. deferred tax assets not recognised, would be recoverable in the event they reverse and suitable taxable profits are available. for all funded schemes, benefit payments are made from funds administered by third parties unrelated to the group. notes to the consolidated financial statements continued strategic report governance financial statements other information annual report and accounts 2017 meggitt plc 149 35. retirement benefit obligations continued details on the sensitivity of scheme liabilities to changes in assumptions are provided below: • the impact of a 50 basis point reduction in discount rate would cause scheme liabilities at 31 december 2017 to increase by approximately £123.0m. this risk is partly mitigated through the funded schemes investing in matching assets as described above. based on latest oe delivery forecasts from external agencies, the future estimated expenditure under contractual commitments to incur development costs and programme participation costs at 31 december 2017, which under the group’s current accounting polices would be expected to be recognised as intangible assets when incurred, are shown below. pty limited (in liquidation) (australia) bradley tonks, pkf
