our managed cloud services are delivered from a network of fully owned data centres across the uk. we have again enjoyed a substantial increase in profitability over the year, driven by that organic and acquisitive revenue growth. after nearly 6 years of first class commitment and service, crawford beveridge has chosen not to stand for re-election as non-executive director at our forthcoming annual general meeting. there is an inevitability around this fundamental change in how it is delivered but there is also a built in delay mechanism as systems, processes and applications are dealt with on a ‘one by one’ basis rather than in one full organisation wide swoop, as applications and workloads are individually considered for an upgrade, refresh or rewrite. we are well established as a major player in providing the flexible cloud solutions that businesses require. through our iomart cloud unit we provide complex hosting solutions, involving private, public and hybrid cloud solutions with customers typically paying for these services on a monthly basis on contracts ranging from one to three years in length. our server infrastructure business, delivering dedicated physical servers to customers, is run as one unit encompassing the rapidswitch and redstation brands. with our larger customers we have multi-year contracts for the provision of complex managed hosting solutions. this was offset by administrative expenses rising at a slower rate than revenue which improved the segment’s ebitda percentage margin. after deducting payments for corporation tax of £3.9m (2016: £4.3m) the net cash flow from operating activities was £33.9m (2016: £26.6m). cash flow from investing activities in line with our strategy of accelerating our growth by acquisition the group continued to incur substantial sums on investing activities, spending a total of £15.2m (2016: £32.6m) in the year. as a result, the group spent £10.2m (2016: £12.4m) on assets, net of related finance lease drawdowns, trade creditor movements and non-cash reinstatement provisions. we have therefore added adjusted diluted eps and in particular the growth of this measure as a kpi. any diminution in the level of service could have serious consequences for customer acquisition and retention. in all cases these supplies are obtained from reputable organisations chosen after a thorough selection process. from 1992 to 2002 richard served as finance director of kingston scl, which provided administration and billing software to the mobile communications market, during which time he was involved in a management buy-out and subsequent trade sale of the company. immediately prior to joining iomart richard served as finance director of epoint group limited, a technology company based in scotland. during a 16-year career with deloitte llp, ian undertook roles within corporate finance and global advisory services. two directors will retire from office at the company’s forthcoming agm and stand for re-appointment. significant variances from plan are discussed at board meetings and actions set in place to address them. in conjunction with the company’s brokers and other financial advisers all relevant news is distributed in a timely fashion through appropriate channels to ensure shareholders are able to access material information on the company’s progress. it strives to do this through, amongst other things, the application of high standards in recruitment. in line with best practice, we will also voluntarily submit this report to an advisory shareholder vote at the annual general meeting. • performance is assessed based on the achievement of profit targets in three years set with reference to our organic and acquisitive growth strategy. • the group operates a sharesave scheme for all employees including executive and non-executive directors. non-executive directors’ fees were reviewed during the year to ensure that they are appropriate for a company of our size and complexity. on 1 february 2017, angus macsween, richard logan, sarah haran and ian ritchie each exercised 4,702 share options under the company’s sharesave scheme at an exercise price of 191.4p per share each resulting in a gain on exercise of £5,436. angus macsween and richard logan offer themselves for re-election at the forthcoming annual general meeting. year ended 31march 2017 34

2. accounting policies (continued) acquisitions of subsidiaries are dealt with by the acquisition method. the fair value is derived based on discounted cash flows from estimated recurring revenue streams. year ended 31march 2017 37 iomart group plc annual report and accounts 2017 2. accounting policies (continued) software software is recognised at cost on purchase and amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, which does not generally exceed five years. consequently, these acquisition costs are included as administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. adjusted profit before tax adjusted profit before tax is defined as profit before tax adjusted for the following: • amortisation charges on acquired intangible assets; • share based payment charges; • mark to market adjustments in respect of interest rate swaps; • where bank facilities are restructured during the year any accelerated write off of arrangement fees; and • m&a activity including: - professional fees; - any non-recurring integration costs - any gain or loss on the revaluation of contingent consideration - any interest charge on contingent consideration adjusted profit before tax is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate the financial performance of companies, particularly in the sector that the group operates, where m&a activity forms a significant part its activities. the group considers adjusted profit before tax to be a useful measure of performance because it eliminates the impact of certain non-recurring items associated with acquisitions and other charges commonly excluded from profit before tax by investors and analysts for valuation purposes. year ended 31march 2017 38 iomart group plc annual report and accounts 2017 2. accounting policies (continued) goodwill, other individual assets or cash-generating units that include goodwill, and those intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually. discount factors are determined for each cash generating unit to reflect the underlying risks involved. with the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. loans and receivables are measured subsequent to initial recognition at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. provision against trade and other receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. financial derivatives such as forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are carried at fair value through profit or loss subsequent to initial recognition. all other financial liabilities are recorded initially at fair value, net of direct issue costs. all other financial liabilities are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest-related charges recognised as an expense in finance costs through profit or loss. all goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. all share-based remuneration plans are ultimately recognised as an expense through profit or loss with a corresponding credit to ‘retained earnings’. the segment uses several routes to market including iomart cloud, rapidswitch, redstation, backup technology and systemsup. for that reason the group has not disclosed details of segmental assets and liabilities. there is no single country where revenues are individually material other than the united kingdom. these calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the board covering a two-year period. the lease agreements are typically for periods of 2 to 3 years and do not have contingent rent or escalation clauses. the agreements have industry standard terms and do not contain any restrictions on dividends, additional debt or further leasing. year ended 31march 2017 58
