Our managed cloud services are delivered from a network of fully owned data centres across the UK. We have again enjoyed a substantial increase in profitability over the year, driven by that organic and acquisitive revenue growth. After nearly 6 years of first class commitment and service, Crawford Beveridge has chosen not to stand for re-election as Non-Executive Director at our forthcoming Annual General Meeting. There is an inevitability around this fundamental change in how IT is delivered but there is also a built in delay mechanism as systems, processes and applications are dealt with on a ‘one by one’ basis rather than in one full organisation wide swoop, as applications and workloads are individually considered for an upgrade, refresh or rewrite. We are well established as a major player in providing the flexible cloud solutions that businesses require. Through our iomart Cloud unit we provide complex hosting solutions, involving private, public and hybrid cloud solutions with customers typically paying for these services on a monthly basis on contracts ranging from one to three years in length. Our server infrastructure business, delivering dedicated physical servers to customers, is run as one unit encompassing the RapidSwitch and Redstation brands. This growth was helped by a full year contribution from SystemsUp which we acquired in June 2015. This growth was helped by a full year contribution from United Hosting which we acquired in November 2015. With our larger customers we have multi-year contracts for the provision of complex managed hosting solutions. This was offset by administrative expenses rising at a slower rate than revenue which improved the segment’s EBITDA percentage margin. After deducting payments for corporation tax of £3.9m (2016: £4.3m) the net cash flow from operating activities was £33.9m (2016: £26.6m). As a result, the Group spent £10.2m (2016: £12.4m) on assets, net of related finance lease drawdowns, trade creditor movements and non-cash reinstatement provisions. We have therefore added adjusted diluted EPS and in particular the growth of this measure as a KPI. Any diminution in the level of service could have serious consequences for customer acquisition and retention. In all cases these supplies are obtained from reputable organisations chosen after a thorough selection process. Crawford Beveridge Non-Executive Director Aged 71, appointed 2011; Crawford Beveridge CBE has over 40 years’ experience in the technology industry, including 16 years at Sun Microsystems ("Sun"), where he was Executive Vice President and Chairman, EMEA, APAC and the Americas, until retiring in January 2010. From 1992 to 2002 Richard served as finance director of Kingston SCL, which provided administration and billing software to the mobile communications market, during which time he was involved in a management buy-out and subsequent trade sale of the company. Immediately prior to joining iomart Richard served as finance director of ePOINT Group Limited, a technology company based in Scotland. During a 16-year career with Deloitte LLP, Ian undertook roles within corporate finance and global advisory services. Two Directors will retire from office at the Company’s forthcoming AGM and stand for re-appointment. Significant variances from plan are discussed at Board meetings and actions set in place to address them. In conjunction with the Company’s brokers and other financial advisers all relevant news is distributed in a timely fashion through appropriate channels to ensure shareholders are able to access material information on the Company’s progress. It strives to do this through, amongst other things, the application of high standards in recruitment. In line with best practice, we will also voluntarily submit this report to an advisory shareholder vote at the annual general meeting. • Performance is assessed based on the achievement of profit targets in three years set with reference to our organic and acquisitive growth strategy. Non-executive directors’ fees were reviewed during the year to ensure that they are appropriate for a company of our size and complexity. On 1 February 2017, Angus MacSween, Richard Logan, Sarah Haran and Ian Ritchie each exercised 4,702 share options under the Company’s sharesave scheme at an exercise price of 191.4p per share each resulting in a gain on exercise of £5,436. In accordance with the company’s Articles of Association Angus MacSween, Richard Logan and Crawford Beveridge are due to retire by rotation. Angus MacSween and Richard Logan offer themselves for re-election at the forthcoming annual general meeting.

The fair value is derived based on discounted cash flows from estimated recurring revenue streams. Consequently, these acquisition costs are included as Administrative Expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The Group considers adjusted profit before tax to be a useful measure of performance because it eliminates the impact of certain non-recurring items associated with acquisitions and other charges commonly excluded from profit before tax by investors and analysts for valuation purposes. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. Reinstatement costs The Group has made alterations to properties which it occupies under lease arrangements. Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. Loans and receivables are measured subsequent to initial recognition at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Provision against trade and other receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. Financial derivatives such as forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are carried at fair value through profit or loss subsequent to initial recognition. All other financial liabilities are recorded initially at fair value, net of direct issue costs. All other financial liabilities are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest-related charges recognised as an expense in finance costs through profit or loss. All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. All share-based remuneration plans are ultimately recognised as an expense through profit or loss with a corresponding credit to ‘retained earnings’. The segment uses several routes to market including iomart Cloud, RapidSwitch, Redstation, Backup Technology and SystemsUp. There is no single country where revenues are individually material other than the United Kingdom. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the Board covering a two-year period. The lease agreements are typically for periods of 2 to 3 years and do not have contingent rent or escalation clauses. The agreements have industry standard terms and do not contain any restrictions on dividends, additional debt or further leasing. RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED) The carrying amounts of financial liabilities presented in the statement of financial position relate to the following measurement categories as defined in IAS 39: At fair value through profit or loss £’000 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost £’000 Other (non-IAS 39) £’000 Total £’000 2017 Non-current: Trade payables - (102) - (102) Finance leasing capital obligations - - (625) (625) Current: Trade payables - (5,958) - (5,958) Accruals - (6,616) - (6,616) Bank loan - (18,639) - (18,639) Contingent consideration due on acquisitions (2,373) - - (2,373) Finance leasing capital obligations - - (233) (233) Interest rate swap contract (44) - - (44) Total for category (2,417) (31,315) (858) (34,590) 2016 Non-current: Trade payables - (455) - (455) Finance leasing capital obligations - - (826) (826) Contingent consideration due on acquisitions (2,068) - - (2,068) Current: Trade payables - (5,215) - (5,215) Accruals - (6,203) - (6,203) Bank loan - (34,525) - (34,525) Contingent consideration due on acquisitions (1,135) - - (1,135) Finance leasing capital obligations - - (573) (573) Interest rate swap contract (128) - - (128) Total for category (3,331) (46,398) (1,399) (51,128) The Group’s financial liabilities per the fair value hierarchy classifications under IFRS 13 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ are described below: Category of financial liability Fair value at 31 March 2017 £’000 Level in hierarchy Description of valuation technique Inputs used for valuation model Total gains and (losses) recognised in profit or loss £’000 Contingent consideration due on acquisitions (2,373) 3 Based on level of future revenue and profitability and probability that vendors will comply with obligations under sale and purchase agreement. RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED) The reconciliation of the carrying amounts of financial instruments classified within Level 3 is as follows: Contingent consideration 2017 £’000 2016 £’000 Balance at start of the year (3,203) (1,650) Acquired through business combination - (3,921) Settled in cash during the year 1,160 1,650 Recognised in profit or loss under: - Gain on revaluation of contingent consideration - 870 - Finance costs (330) (152) Balance at end of year (2,373) (3,203) Total amount included in profit or loss on Level 3 instruments under gain on business combinations and finance costs (330) 718 Liquidity risk The Group seeks to manage financial risk to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash safely and profitably. These financial statements were approved by the board of directors and authorised for issue on 12 June 2017. The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis and are presented in Sterling (£). Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Company and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. Loans and receivables are measured subsequent to initial recognition at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Financial derivatives such as forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are carried at fair value through profit or loss subsequent to initial recognition. All other financial liabilities are recorded initially at fair value, net of direct issue costs. All other financial liabilities are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest-related charges recognised as an expense in finance costs through profit or loss. All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. All equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense through profit or loss with a corresponding credit to “Profit and loss reserve” unless the share based payment arrangement relates to an employee of a subsidiary company where in such instances the share based payment is added to the cost of investment in that subsidiary as a capital contribution. 3 To reappoint Angus MacSween (who retires by rotation and, being eligible, offers himself for re-election) as a director of the Company. 4 To reappoint Richard Logan (who retires by rotation and, being eligible, offers himself for re-election) as a director of the Company.
