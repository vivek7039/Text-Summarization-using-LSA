Countryside has delivered another year of significant progress completing 3,389 homes while maintaining a strong balance sheet and with excellent visibility over our future growth ambitions. A search for Richard’s successor is well under way and an announcement of the appointment will be made in due course. Additionally, as 73 per cent of this land is controlled via options or conditional contracts, it ensures both balance sheet efficiency and flexibility through the cycle. Group strategy Our mixed-tenure model gives us the ability to build sites out more quickly, delivering much needed high-quality housing. In addition, we were presented with a further nine awards during the year for work at Acton Gardens (London), Abode (Cambridge), Woolley Hall (Berkshire) and Englemere (Ascot). National House Building Council (“NHBC”) reportable items were 0.21 per home (2016: 0.23), which was again significantly ahead of the industry benchmark.

Strategy Our Partnerships division specialises in medium to large-scale urban regeneration of public sector land delivering much needed quality housing. It delivers a resilient, low-risk, low-capital model developing urban regeneration in partnership with public sector landowners, such as local authorities and housing associations. These projects were awarded to Countryside as a result of our proven track record in delivering complex, multi-phase schemes alongside design excellence. “Regeneration is a complicated process but it can be made easier when working with an organisation such as Countryside.

In total, we had 19,826 plots within our Housebuilding land bank (2016: 19,322), of which only 27 per cent was owned outright with the rest controlled by either option agreements or conditional contracts. Tucked away on its own purpose-built road and with no other residential schemes close by, St Luke’s Park is more than just a collection of new homes. A further 41 sites were under construction but not yet open for sale, sustaining the production growth underpinning our medium-term targets. As discussed above the impact of a change in discount rate applied to deferred land and overage payments was £7.6m. In 2018, Countryside intends that the dividend will continue to represent 30 per cent of adjusted profit after tax. In 2017 we ran the Group’s second all-employee survey, and once again over 80 per cent of our people responded. We fully complied with investigations into these matters by the relevant enforcing authorities and resolved both issues to their satisfaction. This section describes how these risks are identified, managed and mitigated appropriately in order to deliver the Group’s strategic objectives. A robust land appraisal process ensures each project is financially viable and consistent with the Group’s strategy. This has resulted in a diverse and experienced executive team to drive the performance of those business divisions. This has been borne out by our performance evaluation process for 2017, the results of which are described on page 48.

These Committees have appropriately skilled members, senior management participation and access to specialist advice when considered necessary. The Board is also supported by an Executive Committee, further details of which can be found on page 44. David Howell, our Chairman, and Richard Adam are available to shareholders who have concerns that cannot be addressed through the normal channels. The Board has recruited Non-Executive Directors of a high calibre with broad commercial and other relevant experience. James Van Steenkiste resigned as a Director on 5 June 2017 so the attendance covers his period of office. Other specific responsibilities are delegated to the Board Committees, which operate within clearly defined terms of reference. Each Director provides the Company Secretary with information regarding any actual or potential interests that may conflict with those of Countryside, such as other directorships, and any other potential interests that each thinks may cause a conflict requiring prior Board authorisation on a semi-annual basis. The Committee also ensured that recommendations for internal control improvements were being implemented by management on a timely basis. Following this review no significant weaknesses or failings were identified and noted improvement areas are being addressed by management. Management regularly reviews the carrying value of all sites under development and other inventory such as undeveloped land. We also included operational inefficiency downsides including delays to the delivery of key sites and enhanced cost inflation. The Nomination Committee recognises that diversity, in all its dimensions, across an organisation, including at Board level, is important to support innovation, strategic development and operational efficiency. The Nomination Committee will consider candidates for appointment as Non-Executive Directors from a wider pool, including those with limited (or no) listed company experience.

Our audit approach Context Countryside Properties PLC is a British housebuilder and urban regeneration company listed on the London Stock Exchange. Group management has established internal controls to review and ensure the appropriateness of estimates made on an individual development or contract basis. This inventory provision may be reversed in future periods when there is evidence of improved selling prices or reduced expenditure forecast on a development. We understand that this matter is due to be considered by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee at their meeting on 22 November 2017. These are reviewed for impairment at such time as there is a change in circumstances by which the carrying value may no longer be recoverable. Dividends Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established. Forecast revenue is based on a Board-approved five-year plan which takes into account current market trends and the Group’s growth plans. Both brands have been valued using the income method and are being amortised over a useful economic life of 20 years.

The different levels have been defined as follows: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. T echniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, have been used to determine fair value for the Level 3 financial instruments. The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. This risk arises from bank loans that are drawn under the Group’s loan facilities with variable interest rates based upon UK LIBOR.
