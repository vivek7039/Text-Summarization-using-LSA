residential schemes close by, st luke’s park is more than just a collection of new homes. this reduction was driven in part by our decision to manage price points down to focus on the market below

we believe that our people feel valued, well led and excited about the future. regular on-site inspections are carried out internally by the group’s qualified health and safety professionals. we also

and development countryside has a structured induction programme for all newly appointed non-executive directors which includes visits to the business divisions and their respective management teams in each of countryside’s business sectors and meetings with members of the executive committee. each director provides the company secretary with information regarding any actual or potential interests that may conflict with those of countryside, such as other directorships, and any other potential interests that each thinks may cause a conflict requiring prior board authorisation on a semi-annual basis. the non-executive directors do not have any entitlement to compensation if their office is terminated. the committee also ensured that recommendations for internal control improvements were being implemented by management on a timely basis. following this review no significant weaknesses or failings were identified and noted improvement areas are being addressed by management. no significant issues were raised and the audit committee concluded that it continues to operate effectively. profit recognition in relation to commercial land transactions can be subjective and dependent on contractual terms. management regularly reviews the carrying value of all sites under development and other inventory such as undeveloped land. the fair value is calculated using a discounted cash flow forecast based on likely future redemptions and defaults, taking into account future house price inflation and discounted using an interest rate equivalent to a second charge mortgage. management reviews the carrying value regularly and takes into account third party evidence where available. we also included operational inefficiency downsides including delays to the delivery of key sites and enhanced cost inflation. the nomination committee recognises that diversity, in all its dimensions, across an organisation, including at board level, is important to support innovation, strategic development and operational efficiency. the nomination committee will consider candidates for appointment as non-executive directors from a wider pool, including those with limited (or no) listed company experience. no significant issues were raised and the nomination committee concluded that it continues to operate effectively. committee attendance the number of
