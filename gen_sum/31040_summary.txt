Adoption of kite-marks and continued investment in manufacturing efficiency over this time has retained a competitive position for these products. In the mid-90s, this proposition evolved to combine these discrete products into performance systems, such as pushfit plumbing, for example. Working closely with end customers in this way helps to generate pull-through demand for Polypipe’s solutions through the distribution channel.

This, combined with the persistent uncertainty associated with the conditions of Brexit, has acted as a considerable hindrance to major new investment in private sector construction, especially for new high-end residential and commercial offices projects within London that are particularly reliant on foreign investment.

With storm events and water shortages occurring more frequently due to environmental change, Polypipe’s engineered solutions help its customers ensure their developments are resilient. As the trend of urbanisation continues on a global scale, Polypipe maintains its position as an authority on water management in these environments, helping an expanding population deal with flood events and enjoy healthy, green space in and around the built environment. At just 85mm deep, and with a very high void ratio, Permavoid was the ideal solution for this roof garden application. OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 12 Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 Polypipe Group plc 12 LEGACY MATERIAL SUBSTITUTION PROPOSITION AHEAD OF LEGISLATIVE TAILWINDS GEOGRAPHIC REACH COMPLEMENTARY ACQUISITIONS 3 4 5 6 Using engineered plastics rather than traditional materials such as concrete or clay can lead to innovative project solutions that offer transportation, installation and cost-saving benefits. This planning policy is further interpreted into national frameworks, local legislation and regulations, which provide a dynamic legislative environment. New continuous corrugation investment at Horncastle Investment in robotic automation at Broomhouse Lane 13 13 Stock Code: PLP polypipe.com STRATEGIC REPORT As a Board we continually review our performance measures that are critical to the measurement and delivery of our strategic objectives and delivery of sustainable shareholder returns. Furthermore, Polypipe works with industry leading partners such as Veolia to source quality recyclable bales of plastic bottles and containers. Recent life cycle analysis (LCA) reports suggest that there are clear environmental benefits to producing plastic products from recovered plastics, compared with using virgin polymers and disposing of the product post-use via incineration or landfill; and these environmental gains are particularly high for high density polyethylene (HDPE), such as that used to make plastic bottles. While global warming may mean increasing temperatures, it also means increased rainfall events that have the potential to be erratic. In residential dwellings and tall commercial buildings, Polypipe’s solutions start the process of managing water at roof level. SUSTAINABLE PROCESSES Polypipe does not just recycle all in-process material waste; we monitor every process and pursue continuous improvement in our operations to make a bigger difference. SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS Our products are not only sustainably produced, but they enhance sustainability in their installation and everyday use. Nuaire’s BPS units were specified with Condenser / Direct Expansion (DX) reverse cycle coils, which are capable of providing heating and cooling. Underfloor heating resolved this issue completely, with no large wall mounted equipment required, and so provided the optimal retrofit solution. Underfloor heating installed across the whole floor produces a consistent and ambient heat throughout the entire room LEADERSHIP IN CLIMATE MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS POLYPIPE BRAND ENABLING SUSTAINABLE BUILDING TECHNOLOGY 21 21 Stock Code: PLP polypipe.com STRATEGIC REPORT “ Polypipe’s balanced business model, underpinned by the long-term growth drivers of legacy material substitution and continuing legislative tailwinds, has helped produce another record performance in 2017.” CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW In my first review since appointment as Chief Executive Officer, I am pleased to report that Polypipe has delivered another record performance in 2017, with revenue from continuing operations 6.3% higher than the prior year at £411.7m (2016 restated: £387.2m) and underlying operating profit 6.0% higher at £72.6m (2016 restated: £68.5m). I believe this deal represents excellent shareholder value and once completed will allow the Group to concentrate on its higher margin product areas. This advanced, lower cost automation technology has the potential to unlock productivity opportunities that have not been achievable previously because of technical or financial constraints. No change 30 Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 Polypipe Group plc 30 Risk Potential impact Mitigation Change in potential impact and/or probability Reliance on key customers Some of the Group’s businesses are dependent on key customers in highly competitive markets. The Group focuses on delivering exceptional customer service and maintains strong relationships with major customers through direct engagement at all levels. The Group maintains customer service matrices which are continually tracked and monitored with intervention made where required. Formal Board level approvals are required in accordance with the Group’s delegation of authority structure for any acquisition activity. Polypipe’s tool making and repair business, Mason Pinder, based in Thorne, achieved over 3,400 days without a lost time accident. This is an outstanding achievement and a significant milestone, of which everyone at Mason Pinder can be proud. The Group collects electricity and natural gas usage information from each business unit on a monthly basis. Martin Payne Chief Executive Officer 20 March 2018 CASE STUDY APPRENTICES Rob Bell received recognition at the National EEF Awards, as ‘Highly Commended for Business Apprentice Final Year’. Rob completed the academic element of his apprenticeship in July 2017, and has been working as a Quality & Process Technician since. Before joining Polypipe, Mr Payne served as Group Finance Director at Norcros plc, a leading supplier of branded showers, taps, bathroom accessories, tiles and adhesives. Mr Hammond has recently retired as Deputy Managing Partner of Caird Capital LLP , which is the adviser to Cavendish Square Partners LP . As the above table demonstrates, every effort is made to ensure that all Directors, where possible, attend scheduled Board meetings. Areas which the Committee believed could potentially be improved were discussed and included in its action plan for next year. Mr Hall received no termination payment although he will receive a time prorated annual bonus for 2017 payable at the end of March 2018. { There will be an appropriate balance between rewards for delivery of short- term and longer-term performance targets taking into account, where relevant, existing shareholdings. Individual award levels and performance conditions on which vesting will be dependent are reviewed annually by the Committee. The Sharesave Plan is structured in accordance with HMRC requirements so has no performance conditions but requires participants to make regular contributions into a savings contract. £1,800,000 £1,500,000 £1,200,000 £900,000 £600,000 £300,000 £0 On target Maximum 48% 100% 26% 26% 32% 34% 34% £518,390 £1,066,640 £1,614,890 Minimum Maximum 37% 32% 31% On target 54% 23% 23% £1,000,000 £800,000 £600,000 £400,000 £200,000 £0 Minimum 100% £342,575 £623,075 £903,575 Maximum 37% 32% 31% Minimum 100% £1,000,000 £800,000 £600,000 £400,000 £200,000 £0 £340,750 £625,750 £910,750 On target 54% 23% 23% Martin Payne Glen Sabin Paul James Fixed Pay Annual Bonus Long-Term Incentive Plan 60 60 Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 Polypipe Group plc REMUNERATION POLICY Assumed performance Assumptions used All performance scenarios (Fixed pay) Consists of total fixed pay, including base salary, benefits and pension { Base salary – salary effective as at 1 January 2018 { Benefits – the value of benefits received in 2017 have been included. In particular, the Committee may consider it appropriate to ‘buy out’ terms or remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer (discussed below). However, such buyout awards would only be considered where there is a strong commercial rationale to do so. In considering which elements to include, and in determining the approach for all relevant elements, the Committee will take into account a number of different factors, including (but not limited to) market practice, existing arrangements for other Executive Directors and internal relativities. If appropriate, different measures and targets may be applied to a new appointee’s annual bonus in their year of joining. It is envisaged that any future appointments would have equivalent contractual arrangements unless otherwise stated in this Report. Deferred Share Bonus Plan { On cessation of employment, unvested shares will vest in full unless the Committee determines otherwise. DIFFERENCES IN POLICY FROM BROADER EMPLOYEE POPULATION A greater proportion of Executive Directors’ potential wealth is ‘at risk’, either through their existing shareholding or through LTIP awards than for our employees generally and a greater proportion determined by performance than for our employees generally. His pay arrangements upon appointment were in line with the updated Remuneration Policy and comprise: { Annual salary of £285,000. In addition, certain buy-out arrangements (set out on page 66) have been agreed to partially compensate Paul James for bonus and long-term incentive awards that were forfeited when he left his previous employer, Dixons Carphone plc. 2017 2016 All figures shown in £’000 Salary and fees (1) Benefits (2) Annual bonus (3) Pension (4) Total Salary and fees (1) Benefits (2) Annual bonus (3) Pension (4) Other (5) Total Executive Directors David Hall (6) 343 18 287 69 717 447 24 388 89 – 948 Martin Payne (6) 327 14 236 60 637 179 8 134 36 312 669 Glen Sabin (7) 69 5 45 10 129 – – – – – – Non-Executive Directors Ron Marsh 140 – – – 140 130 – – – – 130 Paul Dean 63 – – – 63 60 – – – – 60 Moni Mannings 53 – – – 53 50 – – – – 50 Mark Hammond 45 – – – 45 42 – – – – 42 Notes to the table – methodology (1) Salary and fees – Executive Director salaries were increased by 2.5% effective 1 January 2017 consistent with the average increases awarded to the Company’s UK workforce. Glen Sabin’s annual salary was set at £275,000 per annum upon appointment to the Board as Chief Operating Officer in October 2017. Executive Directors receive benefits including car allowance, private family medical insurance and life assurance of four times annual salary. Fully achieved 10.0% Martin Payne: objectives linked to satisfactory handover from previous CEO and continuing effective leadership of the Company. The Committee determined that he should be treated as a good leaver in respect of these awards which therefore vested on 2 October 2017.

Nuaire designs its BIM models as ‘type catalogues’ allowing the parametric selection of units and components from a single Revit file. We have concluded that revenue is appropriately recognised in the correct accounting period and found no evidence of management bias. 2.12 Impairment of non-financial assets The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there are any indicators that an asset may be impaired. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year. After initial measurement, such assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less impairment. For financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques. Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair value on the balance sheet date. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually (at 31 December) and when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Inter-segment sales are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. At 31 December 2017, 68.2% (2016: 75.3%) of net trade receivables were covered by credit insurance which is subject to the normal policy deductibles.
