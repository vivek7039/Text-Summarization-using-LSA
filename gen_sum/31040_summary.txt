report as a board we continually review our performance measures that are critical to the measurement and delivery of our strategic objectives and delivery of sustainable shareholder returns. furthermore, polypipe works with industry leading partners such as veolia to source quality recyclable bales of plastic bottles and containers. recent life cycle analysis (lca) reports suggest that there are clear environmental benefits to producing plastic products from recovered plastics, compared with using virgin polymers and disposing of the product post-use via incineration or landfill; and these environmental gains are particularly high for high density polyethylene (hdpe), such as that used to make plastic bottles. while global warming may mean increasing temperatures, it also means increased rainfall events that have the potential to be erratic. sustainable processes polypipe does not just recycle all in-process material waste; we monitor every process and pursue continuous improvement in our operations to make a bigger difference. nuaire’s bps units were specified with condenser / direct expansion (dx) reverse cycle coils, which are capable of providing
