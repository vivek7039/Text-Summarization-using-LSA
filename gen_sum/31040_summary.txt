glance polypipe is firmly established as one of europe’s largest and most innovative manufacturers of plastic piping systems, with over 20,000 product lines and 195 uk and european product approvals. across the group, we now have 30.7% of all employees currently contributing to one or more schemes. adoption of kite-marks and continued investment in manufacturing efficiency over this time has retained a competitive position for these products. in the mid-90s, this proposition evolved to combine these discrete products into performance systems, such as pushfit plumbing, for example. working closely with end customers in this way helps to generate pull-through demand for polypipe’s solutions through the distribution channel. production of pipe and fittings serves as a foundation for the

creation model unique and differentiated polypipe’s marketplace output trends over the next two years, overall construction output is forecast to remain broadly flat in 2018, rising by only 0.2%, before growth of 1.7% in 2019, driven primarily by growth in private housing and infrastructure. this, combined with the persistent uncertainty associated with the conditions of brexit, has acted as a considerable hindrance to major new investment in private sector construction, especially for new high-end residential and commercial offices projects within london that are particularly reliant on foreign investment. as long as house price inflation continues, housebuilders will be keen to increase supply, especially given that the government’s help-to-buy schemes have skewed demand towards new housebuild and they remain positive with respect to increasing supply. public non-housing output £m – 2015 constant prices commercial output £m – 2015 constant prices infrastructure output £m – 2015

the competitive advantage polypipe understands its customers’ businesses and the challenges they face, making us well placed to help deliver solutions that meet key market drivers. with storm events and water shortages occurring more frequently due to environmental change, polypipe’s engineered solutions help its customers ensure their developments are resilient. the company can act as a key partner in providing modern building practices in regards to managing water as a scarce resource, empowering town planners and regional authorities to create drainage systems that support modern city living. as the trend of urbanisation continues on a global scale, polypipe maintains its position as an authority on water management in these environments, helping an expanding population deal with flood events and enjoy healthy, green space in and around the built environment. at just 85mm deep, and with a very high void ratio, permavoid was the ideal solution for this roof garden application.

proposition ahead of legislative tailwinds geographic reach complementary acquisitions 3 4 5 6 using engineered plastics rather than traditional materials such as concrete or clay can lead to innovative project solutions that offer transportation, installation and cost-saving benefits. this planning policy is further interpreted into national frameworks, local legislation and regulations, which provide a dynamic legislative environment. new continuous corrugation investment at horncastle investment in robotic automation at broomhouse lane 13 13 stock code: plp polypipe.com strategic report as a board we continually review our performance measures that are critical to the measurement and delivery of our strategic objectives and delivery of sustainable shareholder returns. % topline growth leverages the group’s installed manufacturing and logistics facilities to sustain higher drop-through profits. % optimised working capital management combined with sustained operational profitability allow the group to be cash generative. as the group grows, efforts continue on continuous improvement initiatives towards achieving a group-wide, shared safety culture. therefore, in an environment where extreme storm events are becoming frequent, and existing combined sewage outfall infrastructure is reaching capacity, the use of plastics can be engineered as a very effective part of the solution to manage water. furthermore, polypipe works with industry leading partners such as veolia to source quality recyclable bales of plastic bottles and containers. producing pipe with recycled plastics instead of virgin plastic reduces the embedded carbon dioxide further still. recent life cycle analysis (lca) reports suggest that there are clear environmental benefits to producing plastic products from recovered plastics, compared with using virgin polymers and disposing of the product post-use via incineration or landfill; and these environmental gains are particularly high for high density polyethylene (hdpe), such as that used to make plastic bottles. while global warming may mean increasing temperatures, it also means increased rainfall events that have the potential to be erratic. in residential dwellings and tall commercial buildings, polypipe’s solutions start the process of managing water at roof level. the company’s market leading geocellular solutions, permavoid, enables architects and m&e consultants to create podium decks within roofs that can capture water and release it into surrounding drainage systems at a controlled rate to ensure systems are not overwhelmed. nuaire’s energy-efficient and low-noise ventilation systems, with integral heat recovery and air filtration, provide solutions to these issues, offering developers low-energy solutions which safeguard the health of residents, in terms of providing sufficient fresh air. sustainable processes polypipe does not just recycle all in-process material waste; we monitor every process and pursue continuous improvement in our operations to make a bigger difference. sustainable materials polypipe is proud to manufacture plastic pipes that are strong yet light in weight. sustainable solutions our products are not only sustainably produced, but they enhance sustainability in their installation and everyday use. water management solutions our sustainable journey in

growth drivers of legacy material substitution and continuing legislative tailwinds, has helped produce another record performance in 2017.” chief executive officer’s review in my first review since appointment as chief executive officer, i am pleased to report that polypipe has delivered another record performance in 2017, with revenue from continuing operations 6.3% higher than the prior year at £411.7m (2016 restated: £387.2m) and underlying operating profit 6.0% higher at £72.6m (2016 restated: £68.5m). there is very little strategic overlap between our uk and french businesses as they operate in different product areas, the latter operating in the significantly lower margin electrical conduit, potable water, gas and irrigation pipe product groups. further selling price increases are being actioned in early 2018 to address this and other inflationary effects. this advanced, lower cost automation technology has the potential to unlock productivity opportunities that have not been achievable previously because of technical or financial constraints. residential systems delivered an underlying operating profit 13.3% higher than the prior year of £44.3m (2016: £39.1m) representing a 19.8% margin (2016: 19.3%). more encouragingly, exports to europe performed well, and in particular our italian business, effast, made good progress. the cash consideration payable by ryb s.a. will be €16.5m on a cash-free, debt-free and normalised working capital basis. continued focus on deleveraging following the nuaire acquisition in august 2015 has seen our net debt to ebitda ratio reduce substantially to 1.6 times ebitda at 31 december 2017 (2016: 1.9 times), demonstrating the continued cash generative nature of our business. accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward- looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty therein. the board does recognise however that it will not always be possible to eliminate these risks entirely. no change 30

commercial rationale to do so. in considering which elements to include, and in determining the approach for all relevant elements, the committee will take into account a number of different factors, including (but not limited to) market practice, existing arrangements for other executive directors and internal relativities. if appropriate, different measures and targets may be applied to a new
