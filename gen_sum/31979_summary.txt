deploy their own capital or expertise. 5. high speed our network can provide download speeds of up to 380mbps, no matter how challenging the location. this project will research, develop and validate key technologies required to enable the plug-and-play integration of satellite communications into 5g networks. he has worked at vodafone as group strategy director and more recently founded and ran

group plc annual report and accounts 2017 our satellites provide high performance, affordable connectivity to governments, businesses and individuals across emea either directly through satellite dishes installed at the user location, or by providing backhaul connectivity to mobile networks. this project will research, develop and validate key technologies required to enable the plug-and-play integration of satellite communications into 5g networks. strategic report chief executive’s review continued avanti communications group plc annual report and accounts 2017 5 satellite assets you will note from the financial statements that we have impaired the carrying value of hylas 1 and hylas 2. hylas 1 is 7 years old now and its cost per mhz is high in comparison to the new generation of high throughput satellites. avanti performed all of its obligations under the contract and had extended payment deadlines for goi to assist with administrative delays. the outstanding amount at 30 june was $16.8 million and has been fully provided in these accounts. we are in discussion with a number of current and new distributors to sign up master partnership distribution agreements with avanti to market this new capacity which is largely over sub saharan africa countries. avanti has pioneered the use of ka-band technology, which enables us to service this market at a lower cost than legacy operators. in turn, this vastly increases the addressable market for satellite data communications, particularly in the high growth geographies where avanti’s capacity is focused, but also closer to home where avanti can offer universal superfast broadband across europe. as a result of this low population density, fibre will not be deployed in european equivalent scale in the local loop during the lifetime of our satellites and so africa is moving directly to wireless. in wireless technology, ka-band hts satellite is the best way to deliver high capacity, low cost, data services. this enables our high throughput satellites to transmit over 10 times more data per satellite than legacy systems, significantly reducing end-user costs and creating a larger addressable market. like other infrastructure companies, avanti’s business model involves significant upfront capital expenditure to launch services and a largely fixed operating cost base. thus avanti’s estate of spectrum rights should provide secure long term value to the business. we were also pleased at that point to welcome onto the board craig chobor, michael leitner and peter reed as representatives of key stakeholders. however, if the group increases its indebtedness (e.g. to finance future missions) interest costs may never fall beneath 30% of uk tax ebitda. strategic report financial review continued

satellite services, consultancy services and equipment sales over their current terms. principal risks and uncertainties the group faces a number of risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity, financial position or future performance, not all of which are wholly within our control or known to us. the group faces a number of ongoing operational risks including credit and foreign exchange risk. generally when a balance becomes more than 90 days past its due date, we consider that the amount will not be fully recoverable. this remains subject to a formal consent solicitation process with the bondholders and a shareholder vote to be held in early 2018. strategic report financial review continued avanti communications group plc annual report and

already developed strategies and have controls in place and are reporting on performance, or we are developing more detailed strategies within our existing systems to focus on specific aspects. the company has clear accountability mechanisms in place to monitor and report on compliance with these directives. environment at avanti we feel an environmental responsibility to both our service providers and their wider communities. the strategic report on pages 3 to 13 was approved by the board of directors on 27 december 2017 and signed on its behalf by: alan harper nigel fox chief

basic salary base salary is set by the committee and reviewed annually, taking into account an individual’s performance and experience measured by appraisal and market practice. our response our procedures included:  assessing transparency: assessing the going concern disclosure for clarity, including that there is disclosure of a material uncertainty by:  reviewing refinancing documentation including level of initial consenting investors to corroborate financing situation; and  evaluating assumptions used in forecast models, in particular those relating to forecast revenue and cash collection; and  evaluating track record of assumptions, including forecast revenue, versus actual results; and  assessing reasonably possible downside scenarios that would result in the cash flow falling such that the headroom against available facilities reduced to nil. based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the other information. a fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the frc’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. this resolution requires greater than 50% of votes cast by independent shareholders to be passed. management considered various downside scenarios to test the group’s resilience against operational risk including:  slower build in fleet/satellite utilisation  planned revenue from exploitation of spectrum rights and satellite interim missions doesn’t materialise however, were those downside scenarios to materialise, management would take mitigating actions, notably the ability

satellite broadband communications services is recognised for avanti’s three main products as follows:  pure – raw bandwidth – customers have exclusive use of a defined number of mhz in specific beams. policies applicable to all revenue streams the group offers certain products and services as part of multi-deliverable arrangements. assets acquired under hire purchase or a finance lease are capitalised in the statement of financial position. on consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign undertakings are translated into us dollars at year end exchange rates. cancellations must be treated as accelerated vesting and all remaining future charges are immediately recognised. financial statements notes to the accounts continued 48 avanti communications group plc annual report and accounts 2017 2. principal accounting policies continued intangible assets intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. investments are reviewed for indicators of impairment on an annual basis when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. borrowings interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. the group assess relative fair value by reference to standalone selling prices, and bandwidth capacity renewal rates. the maximum additional impairment charge that may be required in a future financial period is immaterial at $1.6m. the exclusivity right does not convey or include any satellite capacity, which must be purchased separately. under present tax legislation, these losses and other temporary differences may be carried forward indefinitely. conversely, if revenues generated by hylas 4 fall materially short of expectations there will be a negative impact to the group’s effective tax rate. in the uk, with effect from 1 april 2017, only 50% of profits above $5m may be offset by losses brought forwards. financial statements notes to the accounts continued avanti communications group plc annual report and accounts 2017 59 13. property, plant and equipment continued hylas 1 satellite

london.  €10.15m (2016: €10.5m) related to an agreement where the outstanding debt is payable in quarterly instalments over periods ranging from 3-5 years. the company has current trade and other
