High speed Our network can provide download speeds of up to 380Mbps, no matter how challenging the location. This project will research, develop and validate key technologies required to enable the plug-and-play integration of satellite communications into 5G networks. He has worked at Vodafone as Group Strategy Director and more recently founded and ran Eaton Towers, which served most of the major telco that are a key part of the strategy for expansion at Avanti. The search for a full time replacement is underway and we hope to make an announcement shortly. I would also like to thank our employees, customers, suppliers and investors for their ongoing support. Paul Walsh Chairman STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 4 Avanti Communications Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Our satellites provide high performance, affordable connectivity to governments, businesses and individuals across EMEA either directly through satellite dishes installed at the user location, or by providing backhaul connectivity to mobile networks. This project will research, develop and validate key technologies required to enable the plug-and-play integration of satellite communications into 5G networks. Avanti performed all of its obligations under the contract and had extended payment deadlines for GoI to assist with administrative delays. The outstanding amount at 30 June was $16.8 million and has been fully provided in these accounts. Avanti has pioneered the use of Ka-band technology, which enables us to service this market at a lower cost than legacy operators. In turn, this vastly increases the addressable market for satellite data communications, particularly in the high growth geographies where Avanti’s capacity is focused, but also closer to home where Avanti can offer universal superfast broadband across Europe. In wireless technology, Ka-band HTS satellite is the best way to deliver high capacity, low cost, data services. This enables our High Throughput Satellites to transmit over 10 times more data per satellite than legacy systems, significantly reducing end-user costs and creating a larger addressable market. Like other infrastructure companies, Avanti’s business model involves significant upfront capital expenditure to launch services and a largely fixed operating cost base. Thus Avanti’s estate of spectrum rights should provide secure long term value to the business. We were also pleased at that point to welcome onto the Board Craig Chobor, Michael Leitner and Peter Reed as representatives of key stakeholders. However, if the Group increases its indebtedness (e.g. to finance future missions) interest costs may never fall beneath 30% of UK Tax EBITDA. High yield debt As described above, the 2023 notes were amended in a consent solicitation process during December 2016 and January 2017. STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW continued 10 Avanti Communications Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Backlog Our backlog comprises our customers’ committed contractual expenditure under existing contracts for the sale of bandwidth, satellite services, consultancy services and equipment sales over their current terms. Principal risks and uncertainties The Group faces a number of risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity, financial position or future performance, not all of which are wholly within our control or known to us. Generally when a balance becomes more than 90 days past its due date, we consider that the amount will not be fully recoverable. All Avanti employees also have some responsibility for sustainability, whether it is in their interactions with service providers or making efficiencies to support our environmental aims. For areas identified as having a high importance, we have either already developed strategies and have controls in place and are reporting on performance, or we are developing more detailed strategies within our existing systems to focus on specific aspects. The Company has clear accountability mechanisms in place to monitor and report on compliance with these directives. Environment At Avanti we feel an environmental responsibility to both our service providers and their wider communities. Alan co-founded Eaton Towers in 2008, a leading telecom tower company and held the position of Chief Executive Officer until early 2015. From 1997 until 2013, Richard was Senior Vice President and Treasurer at Loral Space & Communications Inc., a multi-billion dollar US based satellite telecommunications company which owned the fourth largest satellites services company, Telesat Canada, as well as one of the largest satellite manufacturers, Space Systems Loral. Prior to his current position at Solus, Craig was part of the CDO and hedge fund teams at Stanfield Capital Partners covering a variety of industries including retail, cable, euro cable, printing, publishing, television, radio, media, wireless, and satellite telecommunication.

As a Board, we monitor closely for developments in legislation, regulation and industry guidelines to ensure that our corporate governance policies are kept up to date and that the Board committees take into account all of the latest guidance in their areas of activity. The Company Secretary attends all Board meetings and is available to advise on any corporate governance issues that may arise. Through their other business activities, each member of the Committee has significant experience in financial matters. Management’s consideration of whether or not to provide against amounts due from customers reflects a key judgement. There is a risk that these amounts may not recoverable due to the performance of subsidiary entities. Their remuneration accordingly consists of base pay, annual bonus, Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’), share options, pension contributions and other benefits such as health care.

In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, all Directors offer themselves for re-election every three years. Our response Our procedures included:  Assessing transparency: Assessing the going concern disclosure for clarity, including that there is disclosure of a material uncertainty by:  reviewing refinancing documentation including level of initial consenting investors to corroborate financing situation; and  evaluating assumptions used in forecast models, in particular those relating to forecast revenue and cash collection; and  evaluating track record of assumptions, including forecast revenue, versus actual results; and  assessing reasonably possible downside scenarios that would result in the cash flow falling such that the headroom against available facilities reduced to nil. Accounting Policy Changes New and amended accounting standards adopted by the Group There are no new IFRS or IFRIC Interpretations that are effective for this financial year that have had a material impact on the Group. IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ was issued in July 2014 and will be effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Policies applicable to all revenue streams The Group offers certain products and services as part of multi-deliverable arrangements. Assets acquired under hire purchase or a finance lease are capitalised in the Statement of Financial Position. On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign undertakings are translated into US Dollars at year end exchange rates. Cancellations must be treated as accelerated vesting and all remaining future charges are immediately recognised. Investments are reviewed for indicators of impairment on an annual basis when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. Borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. The Group assess relative fair value by reference to standalone selling prices, and bandwidth capacity renewal rates. The maximum additional impairment charge that may be required in a future financial period is immaterial at $1.6m. The exclusivity right does not convey or include any satellite capacity, which must be purchased separately. Accordingly, the Group's profits for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 19.75% (2016: 20.0%). Under present tax legislation, these losses and other temporary differences may be carried forward indefinitely. Conversely, if revenues generated by HYLAS 4 fall materially short of expectations there will be a negative impact to the Group’s effective tax rate. In the UK, with effect from 1 April 2017, only 50% of profits above $5m may be offset by losses brought forwards. The IRU agreement is accounted for as a finance lease and a net book value (‘NBV’) of $33.4m is included within satellites in operation and also within the assets held under finance lease disclosure provided above. Filiago is a German based Internet service provider specialising in the sale of satellite broadband services to consumer and enterprise customers. Trade and other receivables continued Net trade receivables and accrued income have decreased mainly as a result of a significant provision made against a government receivable, described below, in addition to the comparative balance being high due to contracts reaching milestones at the end of the final quarter of that financial year which resulted in invoicing or revenue accruals. Of the accrued income balance $9.6m (2016: $16.4m) was due from investment grade customers who are either Governments or very well established corporations whose underlying customer is a government. Avanti performed all of its obligations under the contract and had extended payment deadlines for GoI to assist with administrative delays. However, after no payments had been received for a significant period of time, Avanti terminated the contract and has initiated arbitration proceedings in London.  €10.15m (2016: €10.5m) related to an agreement where the outstanding debt is payable in quarterly instalments over periods ranging from 3-5 years. The Company has current trade and other receivables of £5.5m relating to amounts due from Group companies. In addition, the assessment also notably includes HYLAS 4 cash flows forecast for a period of 19 years following that satellite coming into service.
