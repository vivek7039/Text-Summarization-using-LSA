We provide complete solutions  combining hardware, software and  related services for some of the most  technically-demanding industrial  applications. Mark Williamson  Chairman Summary  2017 has been a positive year, both in terms of operational  performance and strategic delivery. Our Business Model  BECOMING  the partner of choice What sets us apart High barriers to entry from continuous  investment in R&D, intellectual property and  strong customer relationships. Supplier partnerships Supply chain management is an important tool in enabling  us to deliver high quality at a competitive cost, whilst ensuring  compliance with international standards and regulations. As customers increasingly require an integrated solution, we are  strategically positioning Spectris to align with their needs and this   is transforming our business. In Asia, LFL sales continued to grow strongly (up 9%), helped  particularly by China which grew 11%, along with Japan and India. This will be  supported by our new central HR function with its talent  management and organisational capability programme. UNDERSTANDING  our markets  Market Review We serve a broad spectrum of blue-chip customers across key manufacturing industries around the world. Focusing on PROFITABLE GROWTH We monitor progress against the delivery of our  strategic goals using five financial and two   non-financial key performance indicators (‘KPIs’). An element of the Executive Directors’  remuneration is linked to two KPIs: adjusted  earnings per share growth and economic profit. This has increased year-on-year  due to the Group now reporting  all accidents resulting in one day  or more absent from work rather  than three days. This provides a fully  integrated software and hardware solution for environmental  monitoring in controlled manufacturing processes, helping   companies ensure cleanliness in their manufacturing environment     Segment performance Reported sales £464.9m (2016: £418.9m) Adjusted operating profit £83.1m (2016: £76.2m) Reported operating profit £68.6m (2016: £66.2m) Sales by end-user market (%) Metals, minerals &  mining Pharmaceuticals &  fine chemicals Other Academic research Semicon,  telecoms &  electronics 16 32 23 13 16 Sales by destination (%) North America Europe Asia 8 24 27 41 Rest of the world 20 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report The world’s population continues to grow,   with the result that food production needs to  increase to keep up with demand. This has been  driven by a significant increase in semiconductor capital spending   as the demand for consumer electronics and IIoT applications rises. We have seen an improving backdrop in the mining sector which  has led to improved demand for equipment and services. Segment outlook We expect the automotive and aerospace sectors to benefit from  further growth in demand for engineering software applications. The data  analytics offering also continues to be deployed in several other  industries, including power generation, chemical, wastewater   and ethanol. During the year, we acquired Setpoint, a leading provider of  vibration and condition monitoring solutions to process industries. It has become an integrated product line of Brüel & Kjær Vibro,  growing our presence in the condition monitoring market. Brüel & Kjær Vibro’s systems are now considered fleet-wide  standard for wind turbines used by three utility companies: one  each in Canada, the USA and Central America. F&B sales were up strongly as a result of  targeting key growth markets in this segment, including savoury  snacks. The instrument  also offers faster communications processing and easy integration  into production networks to support customers’ IIoT programmes. After adjusting for Microscan, LFL sales  increased by 6% and there was a favourable impact of 6% from  foreign currency exchange movements. A focus on lean operations,  tighter inventory management and the consolidation of distribution  centres globally have all contributed to this performance. During the year, Red Lion launched a new generation of human  machine interface products (‘HMIs’) which provide enhanced  functionality for remote monitoring and control. Excluding acquisitions, disposals  and foreign exchange, the LFL reduction in average trade working  capital was 2.1pp, with improvements across all segments. As such, risk management is   built into our day-to-day activities and forms an integral part of   how we operate. The  resulting risk registers are then subject to review on an ongoing  basis as part of regular operational reviews. As such, risk management is built into our day-to-day  activities and forms an integral part of how we operate. › A programme of continuous improvement focusing  on information security risks evaluates whether the  Group’s existing controls in this area would benefit from  additional strengthening. 2017 update During 2017, we continued to make good strategic progress in  transitioning our customer offering towards the provision of  solutions encompassing hardware, software and services. Mitigation  › Maintain a broad spread of markets, products and customers   to limit risks associated with any given territory. A programme of  guidance and training in good information protection processes  was implemented with an initial focus on higher risk jurisdictions. Energy efficiency has been identified as a key performance indicator  and further details can be found on page 19. As part of Project Uplift activity during 2017, the Group  implemented new global freight contracts with Geodis and UPS  across over 60 sites. We comply with the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and our  anti-slavery training has been extended to all employees worldwide. The system is also being used  by a number of operating companies for objective setting and  performance reviews. Malvern Panalytical, one of our UK businesses, has received the  Investors in People accreditation for their training, appraisal,  employee development and skills programmes. Responsibility for vetting and managing suppliers is  therefore devolved to local management but must meet the  Group’s ethical standards. Robin began his career at Rolls-Royce plc  where he served in a variety of engineering and management roles. › Karim Bitar spent a day with the Project Uplift working group to  gain an insight into their work. I would like to thank FIT  Remuneration Consultants LLP for their strong and steady support  during my time as Chairman of the Committee. › To encourage share  ownership by the Executive  Directors and ensure that their  interests are aligned with  those of shareholders.

The fixed pay  element includes basic salary, pension, benefits in kind, taxable expenses and all-employee share plan participation. This index has been chosen because it is a widely  recognised performance benchmark for large companies in the UK. Ordinarily, appointments do not continue beyond nine years after first election,  at which time Non-executive Directors cease to be presumed independent under the UK Corporate Governance Code. No revisions to adopted IFRS that became applicable in 2017 had a significant  impact on the Group Financial Statements. Adjustments to contingent consideration are treated as an adjusting item for the purposes of  alternative performance measures (see Note 2). Other acquired intangible assets (including software not specific to an item of property, plant and equipment) are initially  recognised at cost (plus any associated implementation costs where applicable). When quoted prices on an active market are not available, fair value is determined by reference to price quotations for similar  instruments traded. In addition, Project Uplift programme implementation costs are excluded from adjusted  profit to better reflect year-on-year operating performance. These units offer different  applications, assist companies at various stages of the production cycle and are focused on specific industries. By their nature these are often complex and could take a significant period of time to  be agreed with the tax authorities. Included within ‘Other’ are three (2016: four) cash-generating units in which none of the goodwill balances is considered to be individually  significant. 118 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial Statements Spectris plc 119  Included within ‘Freehold property’ is an amount of £11.4m (2016: £11.9m) attributable to automotive testing tracks. Costs are expected to be incurred within one  year and there is little judgement in determining the amount. Where  applicable, the valuations were updated to 31 December 2017 for IAS 19 (Revised) ‘Employee Benefits’ purposes by qualified  independent actuaries. 128 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial Statements Spectris plc 129  From 2014, awards were made under the Restricted Shares Plan ('RSP') to selected employees. The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined using discounted cash flow techniques based on readily available market data. It is not expected that the cash flows described above could occur significantly earlier or at substantially different amounts. Contingent liabilities  In the normal course of business, Group companies have provided bonds and guarantees through local banking arrangements amounting  to £20.0m (2016: £19.3m).
