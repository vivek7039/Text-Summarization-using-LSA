spectris plc enhancing our business results overview in my first year as chairman of spectris, it is pleasing to see the group deliver a 6% increase in constant currency, organic (like-for-like, ‘lfl’ 1 ) sales, driving an 8% lfl increase in adjusted operating profit. this is consistent with our policy of making progressive dividend payments based upon affordability and sustainability. he made a significant contribution to the group’s strategic progress, offering great insight, intellect and robust challenge. mark williamson chairman summary 2017 has been a positive year, both in terms of operational performance and strategic delivery. project uplift project uplift is a group-wide programme focused on reducing complexity, freeing up resources and stimulating growth with the aim of creating a cost-efficient and scalable platform from which we can grow profitably, whilst preserving the entrepreneurial spirit of our businesses. our business model becoming the partner of choice what sets us apart high barriers to entry from continuous investment in r&d, intellectual property and strong customer relationships. around 40% of sales come from customer operating expenditure budgets or aftermarket, providing more resilience to revenues. supplier partnerships supply chain management is an important tool in enabling us to deliver high quality at a competitive cost, whilst ensuring compliance with international standards and regulations. we believe that suppliers should have the opportunity to benefit from their relationship with us. appointed key personnel at group level as leaders in hr, lean, supply chain, software and digital. drive greater efficiency through operational excellence, for example, by applying lean initiatives throughout the group. continue to look for new opportunities in key strategic growth markets through acquisition or licensing of technologies. as customers increasingly require an integrated solution, we are strategically positioning spectris to align with their needs and this is transforming our business. for in-line instrumentation, the recovery of capital spending in energy and utilities and process industries led to higher lfl sales whilst industrial controls benefited from an improved performance at omega as well as an ongoing recovery in north american industrial spending. in asia, lfl sales continued to grow strongly (up 9%), helped particularly by china which grew 11%, along with japan and india. this will be supported by our new central hr function with its talent management and organisational capability programme. understanding our markets market review we serve a broad spectrum of blue-chip customers across key manufacturing industries around the world. generally, the industry is under increasing pressure to ensure therapies are delivered rapidly yet safely. energy global commodity markets have seen a wide swing in prices over the past five years which has put pressure on producers to reduce capital investment, focus on productivity and dedicate spend to more cost-effective projects. demand drivers see pages 20–27 for more detail on the operating companies’ customer offerings 14 annual report and

spectris plc demand for a solutions-based approach is being driven by changing market forces and we see a number of key trends behind this. this data is translated into a format that enables more effective decision-making and automation optimisation. a tissue paper producer in spain, a customer for btg’s duroblade coating blades, is one of the first tissue mills in the world to be equipped with btg’s new yankee performance scorecard. this integrated solution uses a risk-based environmental monitoring programme to help pharmaceutical manufacturers to visualise possible sources of contamination in their critical production processes and correct potential problems before they occur, thereby maintaining consistent product quality and meeting increasingly stringent regulatory requirements. its largest gear and transmission production facility at kassel, germany, produces around 17,500 transmissions per day. focusing on profitable growth we monitor progress against the delivery of our strategic goals using five financial and two non-financial key performance indicators (‘kpis’). an element of the executive directors’ remuneration is linked to two kpis: adjusted earnings per share growth and economic profit. see note 2 to the financial statements, page 103, for a reconciliation between adjusted and reported items. see pages 28–32 for more information see

performance indicators 18 annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report we focus on cash generation and use cash conversion as a kpi as we believe cash represents an effective measure of the quality of our earnings. we are committed to ensuring the health, safety and well-being of our people and monitor how we are performing by measuring work-related accidents or ill health resulting in lost time in excess of one day (years prior to 2017, three days). this has increased year-on-year due to the group now reporting all accidents resulting in one day or more absent from work rather than three days. sales growth for the year was driven primarily by asia, particularly in china, south korea and india. on a lfl basis, before project uplift costs, adjusted operating profit increased 12% and adjusted operating margins increased by 0.9pp, reflecting the higher lfl sales, slightly reduced gross margin from adverse product mix, and lower net overhead costs, with the rise in merger-related costs being partly mitigated by good cost control and the benefit of an insurance settlement. materials analysis malvern panalytical continued to bring the two teams together as a single operating company. numerous opportunities to promote the malvern product line to customers of the former panalytical brand and vice versa have translated into incremental orders and revenue, with an increasing list of opportunities being actively pursued. at particle measuring systems ('pms'), there has been a continued drive to provide our high-level consulting services to existing hardware customers following the acquisition of cas clean air service ag in 2016. for example, an american pharmaceutical corporation, which already had our air particle sensors installed at their largest us site, requested consultancy support for particle and microbiological contamination in their filling lines, which then led to a request for further equipment at their site. pms is focused on providing complete sterility assurance solutions to the life sciences industry and the customer proposition was further enhanced by a global partnership with novatek international, a leader in regulatory compliant data management software. this provides a fully integrated software and hardware solution for environmental monitoring in controlled manufacturing processes, helping companies ensure cleanliness in their manufacturing environment segment performance reported sales £464.9m (2016: £418.9m) adjusted operating profit £83.1m (2016: £76.2m) reported operating profit £68.6m (2016:

america europe asia 8 24 27 41 rest of the world 20 annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report the world’s population continues to grow, with the result that food production needs to increase to keep up with demand. based on an epsilon 1 xrf spectrometer from malvern panalytical, soilcares' subscription-based solution, called lab-in-a-box, enables individual farmers or farming organisations to have direct access to soil testing services on site, something which has previously only been possible in a laboratory. in asia, japanese academic budgets have also been under pressure and although lfl sales were down in china for the year, the government’s new ‘double first class’ initiative to develop world-class universities is already impacting positively. this has been driven by a significant increase in semiconductor capital spending as the demand for consumer electronics and iiot applications rises. our customers are also driven by yield enhancement, which can be improved by ensuring ultra-clean manufacturing environments and therefore the ability to measure ever smaller particles is a key demand driver for our products, alongside the need to meet regulatory requirements. we have seen an improving backdrop in the mining sector which has led to improved demand for equipment and services. however, the growth in capital investment budgets for larger-scale greenfield investments may be more modest. within the semiconductor and telecoms industry, we expect to see continued growth in semiconductor investment, driven by the growing demand for consumer electronics, iiot applications and autonomous vehicles, albeit at more muted rates than in 2017. adjusted operating profit before project uplift costs increased 8% on a lfl basis and lfl operating margins before project uplift costs increased by 0.4pp, primarily reflecting the higher sales volumes and gross margin improvement due to cost-of-sales efficiencies. lfl sales into the two key regions, europe and asia, rose but declined in north america. the venture will benefit from macquarie capital’s unrivalled expertise as a world-leading infrastructure adviser and investor. segment outlook we expect the automotive and aerospace sectors to benefit from further growth in demand for engineering software applications. the data analytics offering also continues to be deployed in several other industries, including power generation, chemical, wastewater and ethanol. during the year, we acquired setpoint, a leading provider of vibration and condition monitoring solutions to process industries. it has become an integrated product line of brüel & kjær vibro, growing our presence in the condition monitoring market. simultaneously, segment performance reported sales £310.9m (2016: £275.6m) adjusted

america. f&b sales were up strongly as a result of targeting key growth markets in this segment, including savoury snacks. customers will benefit from simplified service support with one organisation handling both gauging and inspection. the instrument also offers faster communications processing and easy integration into production networks to support customers’ iiot programmes. segment outlook the mix in our pulp and paper business is expected to continue to improve during 2018 with our new focus on complete solutions, including digital capabilities, aimed at the growing tissue, pulp and packaging markets. the wind energy sector remains healthy and offers the potential for additional capabilities beyond vibration to encompass other condition monitoring in order to provide more predictive analysis and offer a full-service wind farm optimisation programme. after adjusting for microscan, lfl sales increased by 6% and there was a favourable impact of 6% from foreign currency exchange movements. the operational improvements at omega were reflected in a good sales performance and higher gross margins. a focus on lean operations, tighter inventory management and the consolidation of distribution centres globally have all contributed to this performance. during the year, red lion launched a new generation of human machine interface products (‘hmis’) which provide enhanced functionality for remote monitoring and control. these hmis allow customers to interconnect devices from a variety of leading manufacturers more easily. reported sales £262.5m (2016: £246.8m)

performance measures exclude certain non-operational items which management has defined in note 2 to the financial statements. a reconciliation of reported and adjusted measures is provided in note 2 to the financial statements. excluding acquisitions, disposals and foreign exchange, the lfl reduction in average trade working capital was 2.1pp, with improvements across all segments. as such, risk management is built into our day-to-day activities and forms an integral part of how we operate. this process forms part of the group’s overall internal control framework, as described on page 61. risk management process our approach to risk management incorporates both bottom-up and top-down elements to the identification, evaluation and management of risks and all risks are evaluated with reference to the group’s achievement of its strategic objectives, as outlined on pages 8 and 9. our business units are required to undertake formal risk management reviews at least twice a year. the resulting risk registers are then subject to review on an ongoing basis as part of regular operational reviews. › formal export controls compliance procedures in place, including strict product classification and transaction screening protocols. 2017 update the group continued to take a number of actions aimed at further mitigating this risk. as such, risk management is built into our day-to-day activities and forms an integral part of how we operate. › a programme of continuous improvement focusing on information security risks evaluates whether the group’s existing controls in this area would benefit from additional strengthening. mitigation › rigorous financial, commercial and legal assessment of target businesses involving external consultants as appropriate. › strict authority levels which, subject to size, involve review by the board for such transactions. 2017 update during 2017, we continued to make good strategic progress in transitioning our customer offering towards the provision of solutions encompassing hardware, software and services. 2017 update we continued to identify and qualify secondary sources of supply where key dependencies have been identified. mitigation › maintain a broad spread of markets, products and customers to limit risks associated with any given territory. › as a consequence, we believe that brexit presents only limited short-term direct impact for the group. a programme of guidance and training in good information protection processes was implemented with an initial focus on higher risk jurisdictions. all key spectris global manufacturing operations are certified to iso 9001, with all key manufacturing operations certified to the new standard, or working towards certification by october 2018. ftse4good we have been a constituent of the ftse4good index series since it was founded in 2001. ftse4good is an equity index series designed to measure the performance of companies demonstrating strong environmental, social and governance practices and facilitates investment in companies that meet globally recognised corporate responsibility standards. our measurement technology is used in the research and development of new materials, helping to identify mechanical stress on wind turbine components at an early stage in order to extend their life span and improve safety. as part of project uplift activity during 2017, the group implemented new global freight contracts with geodis and ups across over 60 sites. this assurance statement is only valid when published with the report to which it refers. we comply with the uk modern slavery act 2015 and our anti-slavery training has been extended to all employees worldwide. the system is also being used by a number of operating companies for objective setting and performance reviews. malvern panalytical, one of our uk businesses, has received the investors in people accreditation for their training, appraisal, employee development and skills programmes. we monitor the situation closely and make every effort to retain our employees in this highly-competitive environment. human rights considerations are also included in the due diligence process we undertake before any potential acquisition. responsibility for vetting and managing suppliers is therefore devolved to local management but must meet the group’s ethical standards. › a bespoke anti-bribery and corruption training course was developed and deployed for use by sales teams engaging with third parties which underlines that such third parties must at all times adopt our explicit standards of ethical behaviour expected when working on our behalf. in 2017, there has also been a focus on reinforcing ethical leadership responsibility at operating company level, with a series of engagement sessions focused on the role of leaders in embedding ethical culture within our organisation. the 2017 winner is jason chen, a sales manager based in taiwan with particle measuring systems, who was chosen by our judging panel as representing a shining example of absolute integrity and ethical leadership in everyday work. we welcome the opportunity at our annual general meeting to meet and answer shareholders’ questions. she has extensive international management experience, most recently as general manager residential controls at invensys plc. mark serföz ő general counsel and company secretary (appointed october 2017) mark joined spectris from rolls-royce plc where he served as director of risk for four years and before that he spent 18 years

the chief executive and group finance director covered a range of areas. the awards were granted on 6 june 2017. a holding period of two years applies following vesting. this index has been chosen because it is a widely recognised performance benchmark for large companies in the uk. any impairment of goodwill over a performance period will be added back to capital employed. ordinarily, appointments do not continue beyond nine years after first election, at which time non-executive directors cease to be presumed independent under the uk corporate governance code. details of the external non-executive appointments held by executive directors during 2017 are set out in the table below: company name fee retained john o’higgins 1 johnson matthey plc £8,051 clive watson spirax-sarco engineering plc £59,000 1. john o’higgins was appointed on 16 november 2017. his fee is pro-rated from that date. it is also possible that funding arrangements for the group’s defined benefit pension arrangements would need to be enhanced following a change of control if that resulted in a weakening of the employer covenant. voting subject to any special rights or restrictions, every shareholder on the register not less than 48 hours (excluding non-working days) before the time fixed for a general meeting, will have one vote for every fully-paid share that they hold. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. further work was performed at a group level over the consolidation and components not in scope. we also provided direction on enquiries made by the component auditors through online and telephone conversations. no revisions to adopted ifrs that became applicable in 2017 had a significant impact on the group financial statements. these financial statements are presented in millions of sterling rounded to the nearest one decimal place. the group’s net debt balance at 31 december 2017 was £50.5m (2016: £150.9m), with available undrawn committed borrowing facilities of £406.5m (2016: £406.0m). there are no other standards that are not yet effective and that would be expected to have a material impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions. adjustments to contingent consideration are treated as an adjusting item for the purposes of alternative performance measures (see note 2). other acquired intangible assets (including software not specific to an item of property, plant and equipment) are initially recognised at cost (plus any associated implementation costs where applicable). inventory acquired as part of business combinations is valued at fair value less cost to sell. in respect of warranties, a provision is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold. tax positions are reviewed to assess whether a provision should be made based on prevailing circumstances. in determining estimated fair value, investments are valued at quoted bid prices on the trade date. when quoted prices on an active market are not available, fair value is determined by reference to price quotations for similar instruments traded. in addition, project uplift programme implementation costs are excluded from adjusted profit to better reflect year-on-year operating performance. accordingly, we have modified the basis on which btg’s lfl results are translated into sterling by using the actual underlying transaction currency mix for determining transactional gains/losses to provide more accurate and reliable information on btg’s underlying performance. these units offer different applications, assist companies at various stages of the production cycle and are focused on specific industries. the operating companies in this segment are brüel & kjær sound & vibration, esg solutions, hbm and millbrook. the operating companies in this segment are brüel & kjær vibro, btg, ndc technologies and servomex. the operating companies in this segment are microscan (disposed 2 october 2017), omega engineering and red lion controls. by their nature these are often complex and could take a significant period of time to be agreed with the tax authorities. these estimates include judgements about the position expected to be taken by each tax authority. actual outcomes and settlements may differ significantly from the estimates recorded in these consolidated financial statements. following an ifric agenda decision during the year, an amount of £5.1m relating to accrued interest on the potential tax liabilities, which in previous years was held as a current tax liability, has now been reclassified as a
