science and excellence in development and commercialisation performance 2012 ﬁnancial performance was deﬁned by signiﬁcant revenue decline associated with the loss of exclusivity for several products corporate governance in addition to the regular programme of meetings for the board and its committees 2012 was a busy year with new appointments, a record number of business development deals and our strategic review financial statements met or exceeded ﬁnancial targets as a result of disciplined ﬁnancial management and lower reported tax rate additional information more information about our business and about being an astrazeneca shareholder innovation is at the core of everything we do at astrazeneca – from our research into effective new medicines to how we run our business. we operate in over 100 countries and our innovative medicines are used by millions of patients worldwide. in her place, john varley took over as senior independent non-executive director and rudy markham became chairman of the audit committee. pascal joined us from roche where he had been serving as chief operating ofﬁcer of the company’s pharmaceuticals division. the board is certain that pascal’s leadership qualities, combined with his strategic thinking and extensive dear shareholder i am glad i was able to meet a number of you in april 2012 when astrazeneca held its annual general meeting in london. it was the day on which david brennan announced his decision to retire from astrazeneca as your chief executive ofﬁcer. the board and i would like to record our appreciation for his impressive leadership in this period. the world pharmaceutical market is still growing and underlying demographic trends remain favourable to long-term industry growth. chairman’s statement astrazeneca annual report and form 20-f information 2012 7 overview strategy performance corporate governance financial statements additional information on the demand side, we face increased competition from generic medicines as some of the world’s most successful drugs come off patent. r&d costs have risen signiﬁcantly over the past decade, while industry-wide probability of success continues to decline. that path must also include a commitment to the responsible and sustainable development of our business. on the other hand, taken together, symbicort, faslodex, onglyza, iressa, brilinta/brilique and seroquel xr accounted for more than $600 million of revenue growth. leif johansson chairman “ 2012 financial performance was defined by significant revenue decline associated with the loss of exclusivity for several products. astrazeneca has a unique combination of scientiﬁc capabilities in small molecules, biologics, immunotherapies and antibody engineering. our collaboration with amgen encompasses ﬁve clinical stage projects in inﬂammation, including brodalumab, which has already entered phase iii development. chief executive ofﬁcer’s review astrazeneca annual report and form 20-f information 2012 9 overview strategy performance corporate governance financial statements additional information brilinta/brilique, our treatment for acute coronary syndromes, is now approved in 88 countries and launched in 82. i believe that, while performance since its launch has been disappointing, especially in the us, brilinta/brilique has the potential to become a major product for astrazeneca, given its signiﬁcant mortality beneﬁts relative to the standard of care. successful pharmaceutical innovation, delivered responsibly, improves health for patients, brings beneﬁts to stakeholders and delivers long-term shareholder value. a key goal for our planning process is therefore to ensure that we sustain the cycle of successful innovation and, as a result, continue to refresh our portfolio of patented products and so generate value for shareholders. over the past decade, we have developed strong commercial franchises that address respiratory, cardiovascular, oncology and neuroscience diseases. we know that their trust depends on us acting with integrity and staying true to our core values. the advances made through innovation improve healthcare for more people and make our business model sustainable. they decide whether to grant marketing authorisation based on the medicine’s safety proﬁle, effectiveness and quality. for example, while some companies have pursued a focused strategy, others have diversiﬁed by acquiring or building branded generics businesses or consumer portfolios, arguing that this enables them to better meet changing customer needs and smooth risk for shareholders. we also face increased competition from generic medicines as some of the world’s most successful drugs come off patent. finally, greater regulatory constraints are being placed on the pharmaceutical industry by governments and those who pay for medicines. faster-developing economies, such as china, india and brazil, offer new opportunities for the pharmaceutical industry to help an expanding number of patients who can beneﬁt from innovative medicines. consequently, there is a heightened interest by health authorities in both comparative clinical effectiveness and the ongoing beneﬁt/risk assessment of medicines after they have been approved. astrazeneca annual report and form 20-f information 2012 19 performance corporate governance financial statements additional information strategy overview the committee discussions ended without reaching an agreement and, barring future action by congress, sequestration was to take effect on 2 january 2013. sequestration would have impacted most federal government healthcare programmes with broad reductions in federal government spending. in germany, europe’s largest pharmaceutical market, manufacturers are now required to prove the additional beneﬁt of their drugs over existing alternatives. this is partly due to lower investment by generic manufacturers in r&d and market development. this is due to a more complex manufacturing process for biologics compared with small molecule medicines. for some audiences, there is a perception that pharmaceutical companies place their commercial goals above the interests of patients, physicians and payers. innovative medicines offer beneﬁts that go beyond improving patient outcomes, helping to deliver economic efﬁciencies and supporting more effective allocation of scarce resources. the decrease in costs associated with hospital care for cardiovascular diseases is estimated to be almost four times larger than the increase in costs of cardiovascular medicines that deliver improved patient outcomes and overall efﬁciencies for healthcare systems. innovation means benefits for healthcare systems + astrazeneca annual report and form 20-f information 2012 23 strategy corporate governance financial statements additional information performance overview we are working more closely than ever before with the people who pay for healthcare to make sure we can answer their questions about the value of our medicines in delivering better, cost-effective healthcare to patients, including evidence about a medicine’s use in the ‘real world’ once it has been approved. we are transforming our r&d organisation to improve productivity and pioneering innovative ways of conducting research. positive phase iii investment decisions

the greatest potential to meet patient need through the application of novel science. in 2012, we continued our research focus on six therapy areas: cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neuroscience, infection, oncology and respiratory & inﬂammation. the gmd organisation provides a consistent, global platform dedicated to conducting trials for small molecules and biologics. performance | business

be recognised as an industry leader in the publication and sharing of clinical trial information. performance | business review astrazeneca annual report and form 20-f information 2012 34 including mechanisms for highlighting those that require immediate attention. > our disclosure policy goes beyond legal requirements, which currently require publication for phase ii studies onwards only. these disclosure requirements are set out in our bioethics policy and compliance is mandatory across the group. calls for ‘open access’ to clinical data raise complex practical, legal and ethical issues around full disclosure of patient information. patent term extensions (pte) are available in certain major markets including the eu and us to compensate for these delays. see the principal risks and uncertainties section from page 75. many of our products are subject to challenges by third parties. details of material challenges by third parties can be found in note 25 to the financial statements from page 184. we believe that this should apply only when all other ways of meeting the emergency needs have been considered and where healthcare frameworks and safeguards are in place to ensure that the medicines reach those who need them. for example, primary care physicians tend to be younger on average than previously, a greater proportion is female, and more work part-time. these selling channels have now been rolled out in more than 30 countries and across a range of products. for example, we support the concept of differential pricing, provided that appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure that differentially priced products are not diverted from patients who need them to be sold and used in more afﬂuent markets. they also contribute to increased productivity by reducing or preventing the incidence of diseases that keep people away from work. we also have a network of nominated signatories who review our promotional materials against all applicable requirements. we believe that the movement in both numbers reﬂects our enhanced management oversight and compliance monitoring. these sites are intended to commence phased commercial production in 2014. the work is led by our global engineering group who put a strong focus on carrying out these projects fully in line with our ethical and safety standards. in 2012, we continued to establish more efﬁcient processes, with experts from our global supply chain organisation providing cross-functional support throughout the business. we factor in a wide range of potential risks to global supply, such as disasters that remove supply capability or the unavailability of key raw materials, and work to ensure that these risks are effectively mitigated. we also have a programme in place to provide appropriate supply capabilities for our new products. the process is based on an escalating set of risk-based due diligence activities, applied in a pragmatic way. forty-three percent of suppliers audited demonstrated standards that met our expectations, with a further 53% implementing improvements to address minor non- compliances. we will not use suppliers who are unable or unwilling to meet our expectations in a timely way. 12 1.15 11 1.21 10 1.21 greenhouse gas emissions (million tonnes) 12 47.2 11 49.0 10 46.9 waste production (thousand tonnes) 12 3.6 11 4.5 10 4.5 water use (million m

with the right capabilities operating in a high performance culture that enables us to bring great medicines to patients workforce composition ﬁgure overleaf. in addition, speciﬁc steps have been taken to retain key people and talent within our business. with approximately 51,700 people in over 100 countries worldwide, we value the talents, skills and capabilities that a global workforce brings to our business. these capabilities are deﬁned for each level in the organisation and apply to all our employees. these manager accountabilities are further enabled across all markets through the deployment of our global hr platform. women make up 50% of our global workforce, giving us a real opportunity to develop female leaders. driving employee engagement we use a variety of global leadership communication channels to engage employees in our business strategy. the net effect of these changes since the end of 2006 has been to reduce our total headcount by some 15,100 from 66,800 to 51,700. this decrease includes a reduction of 2,600 positions in 2010, 5,000 in 2011 and a further 6,300 in 2012, which resulted from our business change plans announced since 2010. we are committed to ensuring that astrazeneca’s core values, robust people policies, consultation infrastructure and prior experience were integrated into this multi-faceted business transformation. however, each change programme has its unique challenges and a standard solution may not always be appropriate. introduction at astrazeneca, we are dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialisation of prescription medicines that make a difference in healthcare. successful pharmaceutical innovation, delivered responsibly, improves health for patients, brings beneﬁts to stakeholders and delivers long-term shareholder value. in this way we can continue to be valued for what we do and trusted for the way we do it.” nancy rothwell non-executive director with responsibility for overseeing responsible business astrazeneca annual report and form 20-f information 2012 49 strategy corporate governance financial statements additional information performance overview external assurance bureau veritas has provided external assurance on the responsible business information contained within this annual report on pages 33-34, 38-39, 42, 44-46 and below, and of the performance related content of the responsibility section of our website. the full assurance statement, which contains detailed scope, methodology, overall opinion and recommendations can be found on our website, astrazeneca.com/responsibility. through our three patient assistance programmes in the us we donated products valued at an average wholesale price of over $1.12 billion (2011: $938 million). we also donated products worth over $5.8 million, valued at average wholesale price, to charitable organisations americares and direct relief international. while these scores are encouraging, we lost ground in some areas including innovation management and health outcomes contribution. through yhp , we have reached over 250,000 young people in communities across ﬁve continents with health information. our marketed products cardiovascular diseases > crestor 1 (rosuvastatin calcium) is a statin used for the treatment of dyslipidaemia and hypercholesterolemia. > atacand 2 (candesartan cilexetil) is an angiotensin ii antagonist used for the 1 st line treatment of hypertension and symptomatic heart failure. brilinta/brilique is an oral antiplatelet treatment for acs in a new chemical class called cyclo-pentyl-triazolo-pyrimidines which are selective adenosine diphospate (adp) receptor antagonists that act on the p2y12 adp-receptor. the nhe3 inhibitor is a novel approach to treating sodium and ﬂuid retention in patients with renal impairment. additional data from ongoing clinical studies will be submitted to further support the beneﬁt/risk proﬁle of forxiga with resubmission targeted for

additional information performance overview in august, astrazeneca announced that it had entered into an agreement with pﬁzer for the otc rights for nexium. we aim to develop our position in gastrointestinal (gi) treatments by continuing to focus on our existing proton pump inhibitors (ppis) and the development of new therapies for irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) and inﬂammatory bowel disease (ibd). nexium is also approved for this use in children from the age of four years (approvals vary between countries). > cubicin 2 (daptomycin) is a cyclic lipopeptide anti-bacterial used for the treatment of serious infections in hospitalised patients. 1bn worldwide market value infection astrazeneca annual report and form 20-f information 2012 59 strategy corporate governance financial statements additional information performance overview immunoprophylaxis in the marketplace indicated for the prevention of rsv in paediatric patients at high risk of serious rsv disease. many bacterial infections currently have few satisfactory treatment options, prompting demand for new and better therapies. azd9773 (formerly known as cytofab), was a potential treatment for severe sepsis licensed from protherics inc. (now part of the btg plc group). the caz avi phase iii programme was initiated in 2011 and includes seven trials to conﬁrm the efﬁcacy and tolerability of caz avi in adult patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections, complicated urinary tract infections or nosocomial pneumonia. patients with infections which are resistant to commonly used antibiotics will also be included in the phase iii programme. our early research and development efforts aim to address multi-resistant bacterial strains expressing metallo-betalactamases, for which very few, if any, treatment options exist. our most advanced programme, azd5847 (a novel anti-tubercular oxazolidinone antibiotic), progressed to phase iia trials in south africa, with support from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases. we anticipate that this collaboration will continue to progress through discovery stages in 2013. in 2012, we extended our range of external collaborations with new screening agreements with the liverpool school of tropical medicine and the drugs for neglected diseases initiative. source: (left) who bulletin, volume 89, 2011 source: (above) who fact sheet april 2009 25,000 5m astrazeneca annual report and form 20-f information 2012 61 strategy corporate governance financial statements additional information performance overview neuroscience for use in intensive care sedation and conscious sedation for surgical as well as diagnostic procedures. > naropin (ropivacaine) is used as a long-acting local anaesthetic for surgical anaesthesia and acute pain management. however, despite these advances there have been very few novel treatments delivered during the last 10 to 15 years and it is clear that a new way of working is required which captures advances in neuroscience and harnesses them through the drug development life-cycle. we will consider any treatments for psychiatric, neurological or analgesic disorders affecting the central or peripheral nervous system which have a solid scientiﬁc basis, a high probability to deliver meaningful new medicines to patients, and will provide an acceptable return on investment. that same therapy could be as well suited for parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) or other disorders. apoe is considered second only to age as a risk factor for the development of alzheimer’s disease. drug discovery efforts involving apoe have been hampered by challenging biology and a lack of suitable in vivo models. clear opportunities exist for novel approaches targeting deﬁned patient sub-groups not adequately treated with current generic broad spectrum agents. there remains a high unmet medical need for products that enable continued opioid pain control by reducing or eliminating side effects. at any time, more than 450 million people worldwide are affected by mental, neurological or behavioural problems, and the rate is steadily rising. our 2012 focus arimidex, ﬁrst launched in 1995, remains a leading global hormonal therapy for patients with early breast cancer. it offers an additional, efﬁcacious, hormonal therapy option for patients with hormone-receptor positive advanced breast cancer. caprelsa is also approved in canada and remains under review by other regulatory agencies around the world. selumetinib, a potent mitogen-activated protein kinase (mek) inhibitor licensed from array biopharma, inc., continues in phase ii development. > pulmicort turbuhaler (budesonide in a dry powder inhaler) is an inhaled corticosteroid used for maintenance treatment of asthma. we aspire to enter the rheumatology market through our biologics pipeline and targeted small molecule approaches such as fostamatinib. the collaboration will also capitalise on astrazeneca’s global commercial reach in respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. most emerging biologic agents are likely to be used initially after failure of standard therapies (including corticosteroids and immunosuppressants) or in combination in order to provide incremental beneﬁt, prevent ﬂares and allow reduction of high-dose chronic steroid use. in june, astrazeneca acquired ardea, a san diego, california-based biotechnology company focused on the development of small molecule therapeutics. ardea’s clinically most advanced product candidate, lesinurad (formerly known as rdea594), is currently in phase iii development. instead of being shed, the skin cells pile up, causing painful and itchy, red, scaly patches that can bleed. loss of exclusivity on seroquel ir in march 2012 as well as the impact of increased generic competition experienced by our other mature brands was partially offset by strong performance from our key brands, brilinta, crestor , onglyza, symbicort and faslodex. > astrazeneca is the eighth largest prescription-based pharmaceutical company in western europe, with a 3.4% market share of sales by value. this was partially offset by volume growth attributable to crestor , seroquel xr, symbicort, iressa and faslodex. > established row sales were up 4%, driven by continued growth of symbicort, crestor , nexium and the seroquel franchise. sales in brazil were down as a result of generic competition for crestor and seroquel ir. in 2012, the overall reduction in our proﬁt before tax for the year due to higher minimum medicaid rebates on prescription drugs, discounts on branded pharmaceutical sales to medicare part d beneﬁciaries and an industry-wide excise fee was $858 million. this amount reﬂects only those effects of the affordable care act that we know have had or will have a direct impact on our ﬁnancial condition or results of operations and which we are therefore able to quantify based on known and isolatable resulting changes in individual ﬁnancial items within our financial statements. while it is unlikely that there will be widespread adoption of a broad national price control scheme in the near future, there will continue to be increased attention to pharmaceutical prices and their impact on healthcare costs for the foreseeable future. these and other measures all contribute to an increasingly difﬁcult environment for branded pharmaceuticals in europe. price reductions were partially offset by performance of crestor, nexium and symbicort, which all gained market share. brilinta was successfully launched in australia with reimbursement through the australian pharmaceutical beneﬁts scheme becoming available from august. some strong growth markets such as vietnam are also implementing price and volume controls in an attempt to control government spending. the latin american pharmaceutical market continues to grow, underpinned by a reasonably stable political and economic climate. these plans are supported by the provision of training and crisis simulation activities for business managers. in the remainder of this section we describe the principal risks and uncertainties which we consider to be material to our business in that they may have a signiﬁcant effect on our ﬁnancial condition, results of operations and/or reputation. we believe that the forward-looking statements about astrazeneca in this annual report, identiﬁed by words such as ‘anticipates’, ‘believes’, ‘expects’ and ‘intends’, are based on reasonable assumptions. production and release schedules for biologics may be more signiﬁcantly impacted by regulatory processes than other products. in recent years, companies sponsoring ndas and regulatory authorities have been under increased public pressure to apply more conservative beneﬁt/risk criteria. as a result, certain countries may seek to limit or deny effective ip protection for pharmaceuticals. delays to anticipated launch dates can result from a number of factors including adverse ﬁndings in pre-clinical or clinical studies, regulatory demands, price negotiation, competitor activity and technology transfer. as a result, we cannot be certain that compounds currently under development will achieve success, and our ability to accurately assess, prior to launch, the eventual efﬁcacy or safety of a new product once in broader clinical use can only be based on data available at that time, which is inherently limited due to relatively short periods of product testing and relatively small clinical study patient samples. if a new product does not succeed as anticipated or its rate of sales growth is slower than anticipated, there is a risk that we are unable to fully recoup the costs incurred in launching it, which could materially adversely affect our business or results of operations. the failure to exploit potential opportunities appropriately in emerging markets may materially adversely affect our reputation, business or results of operations. see the intellectual property section on page 35 which contains a table of certain patent expiry dates for our key marketed products. this is a particular risk in some emerging markets where appropriate patent protection may be difﬁcult to obtain or enforce. details of 505(b)(2) actions can be found in note 25 to the financial statements from page 184. we also bear the risk that we may be found to infringe patents owned or licensed exclusively by third parties, including research-based and generic pharmaceutical companies and individuals. infringement accusations may implicate, for example, our manufacturing processes, product intermediates or use of research tools. details of signiﬁcant infringement claims against us by third parties enforcing ip rights can be found in note 25 to the financial statements from page 184. if we are not successful in maintaining exclusive rights to market one or more of our major products, particularly in the us where we achieve our highest revenue, our revenue and margins could be materially adversely affected. while we seek to manage such risks by, for example, acquiring licences, foregoing certain activities or uses, or modifying processes to avoid infringement claims and permit commercialisation of our products, such steps can entail signiﬁcant cost and there is no guarantee that they will be successful. for example, a new comparative effectiveness research organisation, the patient-centered outcomes research institute, has been established and an independent payment advisory board, with broad authority to propose to cut medicare expenditures, is scheduled to commence in 2014. the affordable care act expands the patient population eligible for medicaid and will provide new insurance coverage for individuals through state-operated and federal-operated health insurance exchanges from 2014. large employers have typically offered generous health insurance beneﬁts, but many are struggling with increasing health insurance premiums and may, therefore, opt to shift employee coverage into the health insurance exchanges, which will be operational by 2014. the pharmaceutical industry could be adversely impacted by such shifts if the health insurance exchanges do not offer a prescription drug beneﬁt that is as robust as beneﬁts historically provided by large employers. in particular, as discussed in the pricing pressure section on page 18, greece, portugal and spain have all introduced measures to lower healthcare spending, including mandatory discounts, clawbacks and price referencing rules, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. performance | risk astrazeneca annual report and form 20-f information 2012 80 biosimilars impact while no application for a biosimilar has been made in relation to an astrazeneca biologic, various regulatory authorities are implementing or considering abbreviated approval processes for biosimilars that would compete with patented biologics. in 2012, the fda also implemented user fee programmes to support biosimilar product review and policy development. there is also an increase in the maximum applicable penalties for bribery, including up to 10 years imprisonment and unlimited ﬁnes. details of these matters are included in note 25 to the financial statements from page 184. we devote signiﬁcant resources to the considerable challenge of compliance with this legislation, including in emerging and developing markets, at considerable cost. senior management transitions can introduce uncertainty and could materially adversely impact our business or results of operations. as previously disclosed, we terminated our previous outsourcing relationship for the provision of it infrastructure services. this migration activity may not be completed on time and within budget, which could adversely impact our business or results of operations. in addition, we may experience limited supply of biological materials, such as cells, animal products or by-products. this may lead to signiﬁcant delays and/or difﬁculties in obtaining goods and services on commercially acceptable terms. litigation, particularly in the us, is inherently unpredictable and unexpectedly high awards for damages can result from an adverse verdict. substantial product liability claims that result in court decisions against us or in the settlement of proceedings could materially adversely affect our ﬁnancial condition or results of operations, particularly where such circumstances are not covered by insurance. furthermore, in the past we incurred substantial costs relating to product liability litigation involving seroquel ir. regulatory authorities have wide-ranging administrative powers to deal with any failure to comply with continuing regulatory oversight and this could affect us, whether such failure is our own or that of our contractors or external partners. failure to comply with applicable laws, including ongoing control and regulation, could materially adversely affect our business or results of operations. environmental and occupational health and safety liabilities impact we have environmental and/or occupational health and safety-related liabilities at some currently or formerly owned, leased and third party sites, the most signiﬁcant of which are detailed in note 25 to the financial statements from page 183. while we carefully manage these liabilities, if a signiﬁcant non-compliance issue, environmental, occupational health or safety incident for which we are responsible were to arise, this could result in us being liable to pay compensation, ﬁnes or remediation costs. in addition, our ﬁnancial provisions for any obligations that we may have relating to environmental or occupational health and safety liabilities may be insufﬁcient if the assumptions underlying the provisions, including our assumptions regarding the portion of waste at a site for which we are responsible, prove incorrect or if we are held responsible for additional contamination or occupational health and safety-related claims. additionally, if we need access to external sources of ﬁnancing to sustain and/or grow our business, such as the debt or equity capital ﬁnancial markets, this may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, in the event of a severe and/or sustained economic downturn. further information on debt funding arrangements is contained in the financial risk management policies section on page 99. political and socio-economic conditions impact we operate in over 100 countries across the world, some of which may be subject to political and social instability. deterioration of, or failure to improve, socio-economic conditions, and situations and/or events resulting therefrom, depending on their severity, could adversely affect our supply and/or distribution chain in the affected countries and the ability of customers or ultimate payers to purchase our medicines. movements in the exchange rates used to translate foreign currencies into us dollars may materially adversely affect our ﬁnancial condition or results of operations. > macro factors such as greater demand from an ageing population and increasing requirements of emerging markets. the most signiﬁcant features of our ﬁnancial results in 2012 are: > revenue was down 15% to $27 ,973 million (reported: 17%). > symbicort, faslodex, onglyza, iressa, brilinta/brilique and seroquel xr delivered aggregate cer revenue growth of $600 million for the full year. as a result, core ﬁnancial measures merely allow investors to differentiate between different kinds of costs and they should not be used in isolation. the set retains strategic management of the costs excluded from reported ﬁnancial information in arriving at core ﬁnancial measures, tracking their impact on reported operating proﬁt and eps, with operational management being delegated on a case-by-case basis to ensure clear accountability and consistency for each cost category. in light of current market conditions, debts within these eurozone countries have been subject to enhanced monitoring and scrutiny by the group. revised core ﬁnancial measures as detailed in our announcement of 12 november 2012, with effect from our ﬁrst quarter results in 2013, the group will update its deﬁnition of core ﬁnancial measures to exclude all intangible asset amortisation charges and impairments, except those for is-related intangibles. adjusting for these items removes the volatility when impairments are booked on such assets and is intended to provide a better measure of underlying business performance. we negotiate best available premium rates with insurance providers on the basis of our extensive risk management procedures. insurance for product liability has not been available on commercially acceptable terms for several years and the group has not held product liability insurance since february 2006. taxation tax risk management forms an integrated part of the group’s risk management processes. the group has a centralised treasury function to manage these risks in accordance with board-approved policies. accrual assumptions are built up on a product-by-product and customer-by- customer basis, taking into account speciﬁc contract provisions coupled with expected performance, and are then aggregated into a weighted average rebate accrual rate for each of our products. inevitably, however, such estimates involve judgements on aggregate future sales levels, segment mix and the customers’ contractual performance. purchases of ip and product rights to supplement our r&d portfolio are capitalised as intangible assets. although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of legal proceedings, we do not currently expect them to have a material adverse effect on our ﬁnancial position, but they could signiﬁcantly affect our ﬁnancial results in any particular period. in keeping with local terms and conditions, most of these plans are ‘deﬁned contribution’ in nature, where the resulting income statement charge is ﬁxed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees’ pay. this methodology results in a less volatile income statement charge than under the alternative approach of recognising actuarial gains and losses over time. investment decisions in respect of deﬁned beneﬁt schemes are based on underlying actuarial and economic circumstances with the intention of ensuring that the schemes have sufﬁcient assets to meet liabilities as they fall due, rather than meeting accounting requirements. innovation means benefits beyond medical advances + astrazeneca annual report and form 20-f information 2012 105

control over ﬁnancial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this annual report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting. it was anticipated that louis schweitzer would retire from the board in 2012 and, consequently, a thorough search for a new chairman was started at the beginning of 2011. although mr schweitzer retired a few months earlier than originally envisaged, succession plans were well-advanced and our new chairman, leif johansson, joined the board in april 2012 and became chairman in june. we have not yet produced a remuneration report that is fully compliant with the proposed new regulations because they are still to be published in their ﬁnal form. more information about the

his retirement in 2012, mr brennan was eligible to take a pension or lump sum equivalent based on accrued service and ﬁnal pensionable pay (ie without actuarial reduction) due to his satisfaction of a condition in the pension plan relating to combined age and service exceeding 85 years. in accordance with the articles, following their appointment, directors must retire at each agm and may present

other reserves relate to exchange adjustments arising on goodwill. revenues are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party. in preparing their individual financial statements, the accounting policies of some overseas subsidiaries do not conform with adopted ifrss. therefore, where appropriate, adjustments are made in order to present the consolidated financial statements on a consistent basis. internal development expenditure is capitalised only if it meets the recognition criteria of ias 38 ‘intangible assets’. such payments are expensed if they represent compensation for subcontracted research and development services not resulting in a transfer of intellectual property. assets capitalised are amortised, on a straight-line basis, over their useful economic lives from product launch. under this policy, it is not possible to determine precise economic lives for individual classes of intangible assets. the form of this arrangement is a jointly controlled operation under ias 31 ‘interests in joint ventures’. fixed deposits fixed deposits, comprising principally funds held with banks and other financial institutions, are initially measured at fair value, plus direct transaction costs, and are subsequently remeasured to amortised cost using the effective interest rate method at each reporting date. such a designation has been made where this significantly reduces an accounting mismatch which would result from recognising gains and losses on different bases. subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment losses. subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. these amendments were endorsed by the eu in 2012. remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. non-monetary items arising from foreign currency transactions are not retranslated in the

decision by astrazeneca not to pursue a regulatory filing for tc-5214. unremitted earnings may be liable to overseas taxes and/or uk taxation (after allowing for double tax relief) if distributed as dividends. the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised totalled approximately $8,655m at 31 december 2012 (2011: $9,155m; 2010: $16,768m). all of these functional activities take place (and are managed) globally on a highly integrated basis. we consider that the set is astrazeneca’s chief operating decision making body (as defined by ifrs 8). where necessary these are implemented through cross-functional sub-committees that consider the group-wide impact of a new decision. no terminal value is included as these cash flows are more than sufficient to establish that an impairment does not exist. for each group of cash flows we use an appropriate discount rate reflecting those risks and tax effects. economic benefits include relief from contingent payments and other cost efficiencies, together with the strategic advantages of increased freedom to operate. the intangible assets relating to purchased product rights are subject to impairment testing and would be partially or wholly impaired if a product is withdrawn or if activity in any of the affected therapy areas is significantly curtailed. the advance payment has been accounted for as an intangible asset and is being amortised over 20 years. the different levels have been defined as follows: > level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. in the absence of specific market data, these unlisted investments are held at cost, adjusted as necessary for impairments, which approximates to fair value. a gain of $34m has been made on these bonds since designation due to increased credit risk. further details are included in note 24. other provisions comprise amounts relating to specific contractual or constructive obligations and disputes. these principles are appropriate to astrazeneca’s business at the present date; should circumstances change they may require review. in consideration for these rights, forest paid novexel, then an astrazeneca group company, a sum of $210m on 3 march 2010 and will also pay additional sums equivalent to half of any future specified development milestone payments that become payable by astrazeneca. the board considers short-term requirements against available sources of funding, taking into account forecast cash flows. surplus cash generated by business units is substantially converted to, and held centrally in, us dollars. this currency exposure is managed centrally, based on forecast cash flows including the principal currencies of swedish krona (sek), pounds sterling (gbp), euro (eur), australian dollar (aud), canadian dollar (cad), japanese yen (jpy), romanian leu (ron) and russian ruble (rub). exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings not designated in a hedge relationship are taken to profit. transactional one hundred percent of the group’s major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three months, are hedged, where practicable, using forward foreign exchange contracts against individual group companies’ reporting currency. foreign exchange gains and losses on forward contracts transacted for transactional hedging are taken to profit. given the profile of our customers, including large wholesalers and government-backed agencies, no further credit risk has been identified with the trade receivables not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made. the most significant concentration of financial credit risk at 31 december 2012 was $6,589m invested in five us dollar aaa-rated liquidity funds. the group’s current uk, swedish and us schemes are described below; other arrangements apply elsewhere. there is also one senior staff long-term incentive scheme, under which 76 participants may be eligible for awards granted as astrazeneca adss. generally, awards can be granted at any time, but not during a close period of the company. this plan provides for the grant of restricted stock unit (rsu) awards to selected below set-level employees and is used in conjunction with the astrazeneca performance share plan to provide a mix of rsus and performance shares. an option will normally be exercisable between three and 10 years following its grant provided any relevant performance condition has been satisfied. in particular, astrazeneca has environmental liabilities at some currently or formerly owned, leased and third party sites. similarly, stauffer management company llc (smc), which was established in 1987 to own and manage certain assets of stauffer chemical company acquired that year, and/or its indemnitees, have been named as prps or defendants at 28 sites where smc is likely to incur us environmental consequences. astrazeneca has also given indemnities to third parties for a number of sites outside the us. it is possible that astrazeneca could incur future environmental costs beyond the extent of our current provisions. in march 2012, the court ruled that, based on the nda application alone, it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over astrazeneca’s claims for infringement of its patents relating to methods of using rosuvastatin compounds to treat certain cardiovascular conditions. in november 2012, the court ruled that legal proceedings astrazeneca is involved in various legal proceedings considered typical to its business, including actual or threatened litigation and/or actual or potential government investigations relating to employment matters, product liability, commercial disputes, pricing, sales and marketing practices, infringement of ip rights, the validity of certain patents and competition laws. we also do not believe that disclosure of the amount sought by plaintiffs, if known, would be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings. as part of each settlement, each generic company was granted a licence to enter the us market with its proposed anda version of generic esomeprazole magnesium on 27 may 2014, subject to regulatory approval, or earlier, in certain circumstances. seroquel ir (quetiapine fumarate) us regulatory proceedings in march 2012, in response to the fda’s notice that generic seroquel ir had been granted final approval, astrazeneca filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the district of columbia seeking a temporary restraining order to vacate these approvals, and an injunction to enjoin any further approvals of generic quetiapine. generic versions of seroquel xr have been launched in austria, denmark, germany, italy, portugal, uk, romania and elsewhere. shionogi arbitration crestor royalty calculation in july 2012, shionogi &
