We have previously outlined a strategic review for both of these segments to improve efficiencies and reduce costs. Their diligence and calmness under pressure meant that short-term considerations have not caused us to deviate from our strategic priorities. I believe that their dedication to driving our high-quality businesses puts us in an excellent position for growth. We constantly review systems across all our facilities in the belief that everyone has a right to risk-free working conditions. Full-year results were in line with market expectations and we now hope to have put a difficult period behind us. Every year, more than 23 million people from 92 countries visit the packaged goods giant’s global network of websites. This helps to deliver enduring client relationships out of which the Group can build long-term market strength and shareholder value. We deliberately operate a flat corporate structure that gives autonomy to individual management teams whilst encouraging and facilitating collaboration within the Group. This is enhanced by having a Managing Director responsible for more than one subsidiary business, such as in our Data segment.

Despite these issues and their impact on the results, we are pleased to report encouraging underlying progress within our core Strategic Marketing segment. The principal challenges remain in our legacy Marketing Activation and Books segments where, despite their strong market positions, increased competition continues to exert downward pressure on margins. The answer was Tesco Now, a service with no minimum basket order, delivering groceries quickly and on demand. Tesco had already conducted experiments to collect shopper data, providing early insight for a discovery phase run by TAB’s strategy team. With Tesco being such a strong brand, it was essential for the app to behave and feel like an integrated channel. Short, quick feedback loops embedded in the app will continue to provide data on emerging pain points and highlight areas of improvement for future releases. The two are working together to develop innovative connected digital experiences using voice, virtual reality and Internet of Things technology for clients. Our healthcare consultancy, Hive, has gained several major new clients during the period including Roche, Leo Pharma, Lundbeck, Ipsen, and Almirall. We see the US and further international expansion as a significant contributor to future growth for this business. While our expertise in grocery retail remains an important strength, diversification of the client base beyond this sector continues to be a priority. While we have been successful in securing this work, it should be noted that Books Marketing Activation * Before Adjusting Items. We will also continue to focus on margin protection while differentiating our competitive offering through targeted investment in new service lines and further additional cross-sales initiatives. Having defined top line customer journeys, they are now developing these further, focusing on messaging, creative, General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’) compliance and more. Having worked with Realise for more than a decade, the global asset management company required specialist search marketing services. “We’ve brought together multiple teams from different disciplines to build its new European web platform: strategy, user experience, content, technical support, data intelligence and more. “Amaze One combines the best of both worlds – a data-driven business rooted in digital creativity and audience understanding,” Proudler states. That will only increase over time.” CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES 13 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Data within St Ives – which includes Response One, Bench, Amaze One and Occam – has contributed major client wins in the financial year, allowing the businesses to enter this period on a firm footing. The cross-fertilisation of knowledge in working practices, new technologies, partnership arrangements with technology providers and organisational structure have contributed significantly to growth in both companies over the past year.” J Schwan, CEO and founder of Solstice, adds: “We blend resources with TAB so utilisation improves considerably for both businesses.

Schwan says: “We’re solving the problem with Pivotal, a software partner, to help businesses modernise development capabilities. Seven years after launching, and following its acquisition by St Ives in early 2016, the company boasts a market-leading range of capabilities. Net debt reduced by £26 million STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW The analysis of Adjusting Items is set out in table B above. Revenue from our Strategic Marketing segment increased by 13% as a result of both strong organic and acquisitive growth. Second half margin improved as these new clients and contracts delivered revenue without the requirement to substantially increase manpower costs. The amount of deferred consideration payable, based upon their budgets and latest forecasts, is set out in table C above. This approach helped to define the strategic direction of vehicle launches in 2017, setting a template for future activity. Legacy businesses Issues arising within Marketing Activation and Books may distract or inhibit the Board’s focus on its strategic objectives. Diversification through growth in the US and opportunities pursued to open overseas offices, where client demand warrants it. Retaining staff is a key priority for the Group as it continues to invest in new and existing service-orientated businesses. Place a strong emphasis on compliance with local taxation rules by embedding the Group’s processes and procedures. Apply the Group’s policies on Ethical Trading, Share Dealing, Equal Opportunities, Dignity at Work and Whistle- blowing. Wherever practicable, the Group will modify procedures or equipment so that full use can be made of an individual’ s ability. Donations are usually made in cash but may include the provision of time and materials to provide added-value services for charities. It also understands the importance of corporate social responsibility and aims to ensure this is reflected in our business practices. The Group is committed to building strong working relationships with its suppliers, ensuring that they are aligned on quality, delivery, innovation, risk and compliance. One of these initiatives is ‘girl.Code’, which encourages girls at schools in Manchester and the local area to study computer science. 35 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The process by which the Board exercises control is by holding (a) nine scheduled Board meetings per annum; (b) an annual Board strategy away day; (c) regular meetings of senior management within each of the Strategic Marketing, Marketing Activation and Books segments which are chaired by an Executive Director; and (d) regular management meetings of each operation within these segments. The Group’s Internal Audit function consists of two qualified accountants who, as necessary, draw on additional resource from professional services firms. Internal Audit reviews subsidiary risk registers and ensures they are updated by the heads of finance in each business. Matt headed up the Group’s Marketing Services businesses from March 2012 until his appointment as Chief Executive on 1 August 2014. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE BOARD OF DIRECTORS KEY TO COMMITTEES 37 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Brad Gray Chief Financial Officer Appointed: 1 August 2014 Committee: Experience: Brad Gray, ACA joined the Group from Grant Thornton in 1988, and held a number of finance positions for the following six years. Richard was Executive Vice President of ICI plc, where he had held various posts for 26 years until 2000, before changing career and qualifying as a barrister. This issue was isolated to Clays and did not impact other businesses in the Group as our subsidiaries operate on a largely autonomous basis. There exists further opportunity for our businesses to work closer together through collaboration following the senior management changes made within Digital and Data. Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise. The Committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements to replace deferred or incentive pay forfeited by an executive leaving a previous employer. Salary levels will remain as follows: From 1 August From 1 August 2017 2016 % increase Matt Armitage Chief Executive £400,000 £400,000 0% Brad Gray Chief Financial Officer £230,000 £230,000 0% Pension and benefits No changes in pension contribution rates or benefits provision to the Executive Directors are to be applied during the year. However, it is intended that retrospective disclosure, including any such adjustment of targets, will be provided in the Directors’ Remuneration Report within two years. These levels are considered appropriate to ensure that there is robust long-term alignment achieved between Executive Directors and shareholders. There is a risk that revenue may be misstated due to the degree of judgement exercised by management in estimating future costs. Key observations We have not identified any issues or exceptions relating to revenue recognised over our reporting threshold. Statutory loss before tax was adjusted to add back other pension costs classified as Adjusting Items by the Group (£0.5 million). Redundancies and restructuring costs related to the closure or disposal of a site are recorded within this caption.
