without an increased contribution from large sites. that involves two basic imperatives: shortening the period to first house completion and accelerating quality delivery thereafter. nigel hugill —

re-opening the waterbeach military heritage museum. the project is one that our management team has been tracking for several years and which we worked hard to buy. we are determined that strategic sites can make an increased contribution in our chosen markets within 100 miles of london and the largest provincial cities. the purchase will enable us to preserve balance by taking on some new major propositions that are not yet adopted in local plans. those clear objectives play to the strengths of our management in combining placemaking with transport. shareholders should not take the recent realisations as a sign that we are giving up on commercial development. equally, the barriers to large‑ scale housing projects are considerable and we have moved far in a comparatively short time. there is much now in the corporate tank but still more that can be achieved. meanwhile, political mathematics direct increasingly towards large sites, witness housing reset in the autumn budget. significant positives to our enlarging business base underlined by further advantageous post balance sheet transactions and public pronouncements. the core reason for establishing urban&civic was to provide new housing choices and accelerate supply through master development. buying from administrators is never straightforward and our new project purchase demonstrates the ability of urban&civic to work through large site challenges that other developers often find too daunting. urban&civic has taken charge of project delivery with a collective determination that the partnership can provide an appropriate financial and environmental legacy. the remainder is grounded on disciplined on‑ site procedures honed over 30 years of large and complex project delivery. following recent commercial asset sales, substantively all group project loans are ten‑ year facilities from the uk government’s homes and communities agency. no real negatives to report, other than perhaps, the pipeline of catesby monetisations has become a little held up including by post‑ appeal judicial challenges. our projects are rigorously managed with key infrastructure, schools, cycleways, footpaths, roads, planting and playgrounds all delivered early to reduce any sense of pioneering amongst incoming residents. 15 annual report and accounts 2017 — urban&civic plc s view our operational review pages 38

income as master developer, urban&civic retains project responsibility and licenses fully serviced plots in typical lot sizes of 150 to 200, ready for the housebuilders to commence early construction. put another way, our licence arrangements see us sell roughly five years forward for a basic consideration paid annually plus overage. urban&civic is acting as wholesaler to our housebuilder customers but with better security over contracted income. we are now five years forward sold across four sites to a range of successful housebuilders with licence participations or overage in practically all instances. the civic living designs are more contemporary and will feature a higher proportion of apartments. we are confident they will help broaden the product mix alongside housebuilders already on site. 16 urban&civic plc — annual report and accounts 2017 — chief executive’s statement continued — 1 priors hall, corby. cash returned back into the business, after accounting for development project bank debt, exceeded £30.0 million. the priors hall transaction represents an important business win on a project that we have monitored closely for several years. priors hall has been achieving sales of around 200 new homes a year despite being under managed and over leveraged. our skills and experience as incoming master developer confer competitive advantage for which we expect to be rewarded with superior returns. mortgage approvals are likely to be up over the year and transactions about 5 per cent higher. it is tempting for my generation to be overly sanguine about property prices but outside 18 urban&civic plc — annual report and accounts 2017 — chief executive’s statement continued 1 the comparison is not so direct at priors hall in northamptonshire, where we acquired an existing over leveraged project in administration. quality delivery is a necessary accompanying condition in superseding the historically sedate rates of sale too often witnessed on large scale sites elsewhere. we have sought to augment our reputation on this by establishing and testing some repeatable metrics. your company is shortlisted or actively evaluating a number of significant new projects including opportunities along the cambridge to oxford corridor. should we achieve planning consent at wintringham and waterbeach in the current financial year, with at least one/two new strategic scale projects to come alongside, that would meet the previous target that we set ourselves of having 40,000 residential dwellings with urban&civic as master developer. we are also evaluating making an application to open up a new area of 1,500+ further dwellings at alconbury, which is consistent with the emerging local plan for huntingdonshire. my expectation is for a resolution to grant in the first quarter of 2018. such is our growing reputation that housebuilder customers are prepared now to invest time and resources in working up designs ahead of consent. 19 annual report and accounts 2017 — urban&civic plc s — 1 t own house square, hopkins homes, alc onbur y . this confidence is reflected by housebuilders continuing to enter into contracts with urban&civic containing minimal annual commitments that extend well beyond the brexit horizon. across all regions, it has been estimated that initial mortgage payments for first‑ time buyers are currently equivalent to about a third of average post‑ tax earnings. with high employment and borrowing costs remaining at historic lows, overall levels of housing market activity are, in my view, likely to trend upwards. your company has been blazing its own trail towards the creation of a new asset class for licence sales on strategic projects. here we put some of the market’s key questions to our chief executive and managing director. 21 annual report and accounts 2017 — urban&civic plc s 100 m iles major catesby contracted major catesby under offer manchester city centre cambridge to oxford brain belt link bude cambridge oxford urban&civic strategic sites following your most recent purchase, what is your level of capacity in terms of manpower and cash flow to deliver further schemes? the fundamental switch of mindset on strategic sites is that they are better seen as large‑ scale property development than conventional housebuilding. construction has started on site already to convert some of the existing barracks buildings into 240 rooms for medical staff at papworth hospital. nevertheless, encouraging regional builders fits squarely with the government agenda and is an important component of our master developer model. the bigger point from our perspective is will government reduce access to young buyers when 95 per cent of mortgages are otherwise economically unavailable? group site locations 22 urban&civic plc — annual report and accounts 2017 — market re view continued is that a concern? our starting position is that we will build out the

market‑ leading returns for shareholders, whilst recognising that it operates in a sector that is subject to market volatility and where risks are ever present. operations low the board seeks to deliver developments effectively, complying with all legislation and avoiding actions that could adversely impact performance or reputation. market risk – external environment the business model may be affected by external factors such as economic conditions, the property market, quoted property sector and political and legislative factors, such as changes in tax policy or a change in government. • ongoing monitoring with the assistance, when required, of appropriate professional advisers (tax, accounting, regulatory and company law). • the group annually approves a business plan and produces rolling longer term cash flow forecasts with detailed sensitivity analysis. • material capital commitments, which have not previously been approved in the group business plan, require additional board approval. • due diligence carried out (including appropriate references) on principal contractor and design consultants prior to appointment. • employees generally work on a number of projects across the group and are not dedicated to one particular site. with the addition this year of wintringham and priors hall, our strategic sites will deliver around 29,470 new homes, more than 7 million sq.ft. • swynford stores opened to support both new residents, local neighbours and our enterprise zone tenants. t eam and funding: • expansion of the urban&civic team to include community development

strong lineup of tenants, including b&m bargains & home stores, mcdonald’s, sue ryder and greggs. the revenue created by these developments also allows us to reinvest in our strategic site portfolio. • in accordance with catesby’s strategic objectives to increase land activities for sites between 500 and 2,000 dwellings, a site for circa 2,000 dwellings in an area of identified high housing need has been secured with a view to bringing the site forward through the local plan process. we also focus hard on quality because things that work well, feel right, look good and last a long time are the essential components of great places. we believe urban&civic’s approach and expertise as master developer not only allow us to take on more complex sites but also create a serviced land product which ensures a level playing field for housebuilders of all sizes. ultimately, we want to capture the impact all our schemes have over time, in terms of direct and indirect economic effects. the approach we take at alconbury weald is emblematic of our focus on making places that create and reinforce economic opportunity. in last year’s report we noted that 53 local people had already found employment through the service. steve was referred to edge by the local jobcentre, after a period of unemployment had left him lacking confidence in his future prospects. at edge he met adviser christine dade, who invested the face-to-face time and support steve needed to turn his situation around. steve soon found an opportunity at t&c electricals in st neots, where he now works. since july, another 30 people like steve have used support from edge to rejoin the world of work. edge also helps people out of work into self-employment, one example being local skateboarder jason emery who has turned his hobby into a business offering lessons at alconbury’s new skate park, with financial support from urban&civic. in february, we were delighted to see this work acknowledged by the then secretary of state for work and pensions damian green when he visited edge in huntingdon with prospective cambridgeshire and peterborough mayoral candidate james palmer, to find out more about our innovative partnership-based approach. whilst at alconbury we have already laid out the cricket pitch to give it time to bed in for play in 2019. at rugby, we have focused strongly on sustainable drainage where we started by carrying out an earthworks study ahead of the delivery of the first parcel, to ensure that all spoil would be retained on site. redrow was the first major uk housebuilder to score a maximum rating of “three trees” from the wwf with 99.83 per cent of timber sustainability sourced and offering a low carbon, reliable and efficient replacement for concrete blocks. on large sites delivered over many years, getting drainage right plays a surprisingly important role in the future environment. our team has also been working with the colleges’ project teams on design, build, branding, business engagement and curriculum development. j o nathan d jan o g ly m p, s pe a k i n g at t h e to ppi n g o u t c er emon y for i m et december 2017 may 2017 april 2016 66 urban&civic plc — annual report and accounts 2017 investing in our communities our approach the success of the communities we build is highly dependent on good relationships with local people. this is because both rugby and alconbury are much further along on their development stages. we expect to increase investment at all our strategic land sites, as each development stage progresses. last year we reported on our support for the waterbeach toddler playgroup; however, this year another, perhaps more surprising, example is the work we have done at waterbeach to create space for those resting in peace. our “top secret” initiative, which provides ongoing support for a project engaging young people in historical research, creative expression, promotion and event management, worked with two local schools, local heritage groups and the neighbouring us air force base, reaching around 1,000 people. we aim to maintain and where relevant increase this kind of investment in the future. phil partridge completed the berlin marathon in september and raised around £1,000 for prostate cancer uk. 44 community activities number 113,050 people estimated reach our green skills team celebrating delivery of the allotments. students involved have also been offered health and safety training, improving their employability in the construction sector. urban&civic’s performance in the year has been: • reportable incidents: one • fatalities: nil • prosecutions, fines and notices: nil • incidents requiring first aid: three — corpora te re sponsibility continued 71 annual report and accounts 2017 — urban&civic plc s employees our approach like any company, great employees hold the key to everything we do. in 2017 we filled posts at urban&civic and catesby with new colleagues, including katie yates, lucy smith, olivia brown, jack williams, kerry milburn, kirill simdyashkin, stephanie burton, galina bardarska, michael van den berg, james findlay, carlo d’emidio and peter briggs. we have adopted a diversity policy that is reviewed annually and it can be found on our website. appointments are made on merit, skills and experience but with due regard to the benefits of diversity. having qualified as a chartered accountant with deloitte & touche, david has over 20 years of experience in the real estate sector. he has held a number of non-executive positions in finance and property organisations including manchester building society. prior to joining gi, mark spent six years with nomura principal finance group, which became terra firma capital partners, where he served as a senior partner. his early career was with deloitte & touche, where he finished as head of its london m&a advisory practice. mark tagliaferri represents gi partners, the group’s largest shareholder, and is therefore not considered to be independent. during the year, specific training has been provided through presentations at board meetings by senior management and external advisers. the board also undertook its first externally facilitated evaluation process, which is described later in this report. note: robert dyson has been excluded from this table as he will not be seeking re-election at the 2018 agm. the nomination committee has previously decided that it would not impose a quota relating to gender balance at board level, but gives full consideration to achieving a diverse working environment when considering the appointment of any new directors. zygos has adopted an industry standard voluntary code of conduct addressing gender and ethnic diversity. the non-executive directors have worked with executive management to ensure they fully understand our information needs and recognise the importance of measuring performance against projections to enable a clear appraisal of progress, in conjunction with financial and risk analysis. i hope that shareholders will support the committee and vote in favour of these resolutions. proceeds from land parcel sales under licence arrangements are receivable in stages; a fixed price element initially being earned when risks and rewards of ownership transfer, with a further variable overage element being receivable when homes are sold. members of the committee assessed the substantive conditions attaching to these arrangements when deciding how much and at what point revenue should be recognised, which was determined with reference to contractual terms and forecast timescales over which these amounts were payable. this was carried out through both formal and informal meetings with the external audit team. the grant of these awards was delayed due to an administrative oversight, which has since been addressed. this represents an increase for all three executive directors from the current policy which stipulates a minimum shareholding requirement of 200 per cent. a two-year post-vesting holding period of awards made under the psp is also in place. details of any payments to former directors will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise. any ongoing costs will be met by the company for a period of no more than 12 months. further, there are no special provisions providing for additional compensation on an executive director’s cessation of employment with the group. basic salary/fees¹ benefits2 bonus3 long-term incentives4 pension5 total 2017 £’000

other than as specified by the company’s articles of association. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. we therefore identified the accounting for these sales to be an area of significant audit risk and focus. we also agreed to report differences below this threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. basis of consolidation where the company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary.
