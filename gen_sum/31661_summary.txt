The project is one that our management team has been tracking for several years and which we worked hard to buy. We are determined that strategic sites can make an increased contribution in our chosen markets within 100 miles of London and the largest provincial cities. The purchase will enable us to preserve balance by taking on some new major propositions that are not yet adopted in Local Plans. Equally, the barriers to large‑ scale housing projects are considerable and we have moved far in a comparatively short time. The core reason for establishing Urban&Civic was to provide new housing choices and accelerate supply through Master Development. Buying from administrators is never straightforward and our new project purchase demonstrates the ability of Urban&Civic to work through large site challenges that other developers often find too daunting. Urban&Civic has taken charge of project delivery with a collective determination that the partnership can provide an appropriate financial and environmental legacy. Following recent commercial asset sales, substantively all Group project loans are ten‑ year facilities from the UK Government’s Homes and Communities Agency. No real negatives to report, other than perhaps, the pipeline of Catesby monetisations has become a little held up including by post‑ appeal judicial challenges. Our projects are rigorously managed with key infrastructure, schools, cycleways, footpaths, roads, planting and playgrounds all delivered early to reduce any sense of pioneering amongst incoming residents. Put another way, our licence arrangements see us sell roughly five years forward for a basic consideration paid annually plus overage. We are now five years forward sold across four sites to a range of successful housebuilders with licence participations or overage in practically all instances. The Priors Hall transaction represents an important business win on a project that we have monitored closely for several years. Priors Hall has been achieving sales of around 200 new homes a year despite being under managed and over leveraged. Our skills and experience as incoming Master Developer confer competitive advantage for which we expect to be rewarded with superior returns. It is tempting for my generation to be overly sanguine about property prices but outside 18 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT continued 1 The comparison is not so direct at Priors Hall in Northamptonshire, where we acquired an existing over leveraged project in administration. Quality delivery is a necessary accompanying condition in superseding the historically sedate rates of sale too often witnessed on large scale sites elsewhere. Your Company is shortlisted or actively evaluating a number of significant new projects including opportunities along the Cambridge to Oxford Corridor. Should we achieve planning consent at Wintringham and Waterbeach in the current financial year, with at least one/two new strategic scale projects to come alongside, that would meet the previous target that we set ourselves of having 40,000 residential dwellings with Urban&Civic as Master Developer. We will, however , continue to account for the trading profits on realised sales only as they come through. We are also evaluating making an application to open up a new area of 1,500+ further dwellings at Alconbury, which is consistent with the emerging Local Plan for Huntingdonshire. Such is our growing reputation that housebuilder customers are prepared now to invest time and resources in working up designs ahead of consent. This confidence is reflected by housebuilders continuing to enter into contracts with Urban&Civic containing minimal annual commitments that extend well beyond the Brexit horizon. Across all regions, it has been estimated that initial mortgage payments for first‑ time buyers are currently equivalent to about a third of average post‑ tax earnings. With high employment and borrowing costs remaining at historic lows, overall levels of housing market activity are, in my view, likely to trend upwards. Your Company has been blazing its own trail towards the creation of a new asset class for licence sales on strategic projects. 21 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc S 100 M iles Major Catesby contracted Major Catesby under offer Manchester city centre Cambridge to Oxford brain belt link Bude CAMBRIDGE OXFORD Urban&Civic strategic sites Following your most recent purchase, what is your level of capacity in terms of manpower and cash flow to deliver further schemes? The fundamental switch of mindset on strategic sites is that they are better seen as large‑ scale property development than conventional housebuilding. Construction has started on site already to convert some of the existing Barracks buildings into 240 rooms for medical staff at Papworth Hospital. Nevertheless, encouraging regional builders fits squarely with the Government agenda and is an important component of our Master Developer model. The bigger point from our perspective is will Government reduce access to young buyers when 95 per cent of mortgages are otherwise economically unavailable? Our starting position is that we will build out the more complicated parcels, notably those containing a high proportion of apartments. You will note I have proportionally consolidated this sum in the above table for ease of comparability going forward. Surplus on revaluation of investment properties There have been a number of reclassifications over the last two years that have mirrored the Group’s changing view on those assets it intends to hold for income generation and capital growth and those it intends to sell. The £2.9 million decrease reflects an intensive period of construction activity, particularly in relation to our strategic land sites and hotel development at Stansted. Following the post year‑ end sale of Stansted, this facility was paid down and requires no further repayments until maturity in June 2019. David Wood Group Finance Director 27 November 2017 32 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Long-term viability statement In accordance with provision C.2.2. Operations Low The Board seeks to deliver developments effectively, complying with all legislation and avoiding actions that could adversely impact performance or reputation. • The Group annually approves a business plan and produces rolling longer term cash flow forecasts with detailed sensitivity analysis. • Material capital commitments, which have not previously been approved in the Group business plan, require additional Board approval. • Employees generally work on a number of projects across the Group and are not dedicated to one particular site. With the addition this year of Wintringham and Priors Hall, our strategic sites will deliver around 29,470 new homes, more than 7 million sq.ft. • In accordance with Catesby’s strategic objectives to increase land activities for sites between 500 and 2,000 dwellings, a site for circa 2,000 dwellings in an area of identified high housing need has been secured with a view to bringing the site forward through the Local Plan process. We also focus hard on quality because things that work well, feel right, look good and last a long time are the essential components of great places. Ultimately, we want to capture the impact all our schemes have over time, in terms of direct and indirect economic effects. The approach we take at Alconbury Weald is emblematic of our focus on making places that create and reinforce economic opportunity. Steve was referred to EDGE by the local jobcentre, after a period of unemployment had left him lacking confidence in his future prospects. At EDGE he met adviser Christine Dade, who invested the face-to-face time and support Steve needed to turn his situation around. In February, we were delighted to see this work acknowledged by the then Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Damian Green when he visited EDGE in Huntingdon with prospective Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Mayoral Candidate James Palmer, to find out more about our innovative partnership-based approach. On large sites delivered over many years, getting drainage right plays a surprisingly important role in the future environment. Our team has also been working with the colleges’ project teams on design, build, branding, business engagement and curriculum development. Urban&Civic’s performance in the year has been: • Reportable incidents: One • Fatalities: Nil • Prosecutions, fines and notices: Nil • Incidents requiring first aid: Three — CORPORA TE RE SPONSIBILITY continued 71 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc S EMPLOYEES OUR APPROACH Like any company, great employees hold the key to everything we do. We have adopted a diversity policy that is reviewed annually and it can be found on our website. Having qualified as a chartered accountant with Deloitte & Touche, David has over 20 years of experience in the real estate sector. Prior to joining GI, Mark spent six years with Nomura Principal Finance Group, which became Terra Firma Capital Partners, where he served as a senior partner. His early career was with Deloitte & Touche, where he finished as head of its London M&A Advisory Practice. During the year, specific training has been provided through presentations at Board meetings by senior management and external advisers. Note: Robert Dyson has been excluded from this table as he will not be seeking re-election at the 2018 AGM. This represents an increase for all three Executive Directors from the current policy which stipulates a minimum shareholding requirement of 200 per cent. Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise. Further, there are no special provisions providing for additional compensation on an Executive Director’s cessation of employment with the Group. As a result, the Group recognises tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. At 30 September 2017, another investment property, which represents 16 per cent of the year-end carrying value, has also been valued by CBRE Limited, and further properties, representing 24 per cent of the year-end carrying value, have been valued by Directors, either with reference to post-balance-sheet sales price achieved or cost incurred to date.
