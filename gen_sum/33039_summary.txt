per share, 27% higher than last year, moving to a two-thirds pay out ratio a year earlier than we had previously announced. we are looking at the ways in which communications technology can help to build a fairer, more inclusive society. pensions investment performance on assets in the bt pension scheme (btps) was very good, with year end value at a record £38 billion. under a new and more conservative actuarial methodology, the deﬁcit at 31 december 2005 was calculated as £3.4 billion. your board i will be stepping down as chairman in the autumn after more than six challenging and fascinating years with bt. overview chairman’s message 4 bt group plc annual report & form 20-f the 2007 ﬁnancial year was a very good one for your company – our results once again were excellent. his successor is maarten van den bergh, who has been a non-executive director since september 2000. maarten, who prior to his retirement was president of the royal dutch petroleum company, also chairs the remuneration committee and is our senior independent director. franc ¸ois joined the board on 24 april 2007 as chief executive bt global services (in which role he succeeds andy green who became ceo of group strategy and operations). possibilities that really do enable them to lead fuller lives and run more proﬁtable, innovative businesses. even when we hit ﬁve million broadband connections in 2005 – more than a year ahead of schedule – there was no time to take it easy. in the future, bt’s services will increasingly be based on software – designed, delivered and updated remotely by computers over broadband networks. these services will be faster, more innovative, reliable and simpler to use – often delivered by the push of a button. we have set ourselves the target of becoming number one for customer service within two years. in recent years, we’ve acquired a reputation for winning and delivering complex, large-scale networked it services contracts. our extensive global network enables us to serve customers in all the world’s key commercial centres – either directly or through partnership arrangements. our services are helping organisations meet the needs of their own customers wherever they may be. bt people have already shown what they are capable of; and there’s a lot more where that came from. 2400 2000 1600 1200 800 400 0 new wave revenue (£m) per quarter

calls with broadband. at 31 march 2007, our ﬂagship mpls (multi-protocol label switching) network service provided coverage and support to over 100 countries from more than 1,300 points of presence. bt is proving to be a world leader in delivering networked it services through, for example, our work for the nhs national programme for information technology, which is helping to transform the lives of doctors, nurses and patients across england by delivering new computer systems and services to improve the way patient information is stored and accessed. the deal, which is worth around an additional £270 million, means that we will continue to deliver voice, data and mobile services globally to unilever until 2012. july 2006 we reached agreement with dutch electronics giant philips on a ﬁve-year contract to provide a fully managed solution for data, voice, conferencing and mobile communications services in over 40 countries in emea (europe, the middle east and africa). september 2006 we signed a seven-year managed services agreement with pepsico inc to provide and manage an integrated portfolio of data, lan (local area network), security, conferencing, remote access and internet services to support the it requirements of pepsico’s international division. february 2007 we announced that we were signing a strategic agreement with credit suisse, worth over £575 million, to provide a broad package of mobile and internet technologies and advanced connectivity services which will enhance its operating efﬁciency as an integrated global bank. as part of this, we have taken on approximately 250 people employed in europe and are now responsible for providing nis services to capgemini customers. february 2007 hp and bt announced that they had signed seven-year

of security software, all brought together through the bt home hub. bt vision, which does not require a regular monthly subscription, is the ﬁrst widely available tv service of its kind. under an agreement with leading pay tv sports broadcaster, setanta, bt vision will carry 46 live premiership games a season. customers will also be able – via bt vision’s replay tv service – to access a selection of terrestrial programmes released in the previous week. convergent services for consumers we are also playing a lead role in the development of internet telephony or volp (voice over ip). from october 2006, we cut the cost of calling many non-geographic numbers and since january 2007 have been offering all our customers who opt for paperless billing a reduction in their monthly rental. all bt privacy customers can be added to the telephone preference service register which ﬁlters out most unsolicited marketing calls. bt openzone offers customers a high-speed, wireless broadband connection over which they can access the internet to work, talk or play. bt ireland also has a signiﬁcant wholesale business, supporting other leading operators, ﬁxed and mobile. we have a number of agreements with service providers and mobile operators to upgrade their ip capability. in addition, we have used our expertise and geographic reach to provide bespoke data housing solutions. report of

movio,a service that delivers digital broadcast television and radio to mobile handsets over the dab (digital audio broadcasting) spectrum. since then, many of our wholesale customers have contributed on a regular basis to this major industry consultation process. revenues were £5,177 million, driven by strong market volume growth, which more than offset the impact of a price reduction for wlr (wholesale line rental). combined with bt’s use of unbundled lines, this brought the total to 10.7 million (bt lines of business – 8.8 million; non-bt customers – 1.9 million) in the uk as at 31 march

resolved more rapidly than they used to be. there was a concerted drive to ensure that openreach people fully understood the behavioural implications of compliance. a key area of focus has been enhancing the ways in which customers can deal with bt, simultaneously saving costs and improving customer service. and at 31 march 2007, we had over 2.8 million customers receiving e-bills – up 22% in the ﬁnancial year – over 900,000 of whom do not receive a paper bill – a 90% increase on 31 march 2006. we have also been reducing the complexity of our systems and processes. we also continued to reduce overheads such as accommodation, using buildings more efﬁciently and introducing ﬂexible working practices. in the 2007 ﬁnancial year, we vacated around 40 buildings and installed an additional 1,300 ﬂexible workstations which can be shared by multiple users. albacom (now bt italia) provides data transmission, voice and internet services to the italian business communications market. march

controls covering public-switched telephony services, ofcom concluded that the retail price control which ended on 31 march 2006 would not be replaced. our charges for a range of interconnect services are controlled by ofcom, under the ncc (network charge control) regime. depending on the degree of competition, charges are cap- controlled each year by rpi minus x for services ofcom considers unlikely to become competitive in the near future, and safeguard cap-controlled (ie no increases above rpi) for services likely to become competitive. on 1 october 2004, ofcom introduced a ppc charge control to replace the annual determinations previously carried out by oftel. bt does not have universal service obligations outside the uk, although in certain member states we may be required to contribute towards an industry fund to pay for the cost of meeting universal service obligations in those countries. we have concluded that it would not be appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such claim. by ensuring that the services we offer customers are consistently focused on meeting their needs, straightforward and report of the directors business review 22 bt group plc annual

generate value by launching innovative solutions as high- technology businesses in the global marketplace. speciﬁcally, our it teams delivered the emp (equivalence management platform) that is helping openreach to serve its customers. these properties mainly house exchange equipment and are needed as part of our continuing activities. for a number of years we have measured the link between customer satisfaction and csr performance. childline, a uk charity, receives 4,500 calls every day but lack of funds means that many hundreds go unanswered. we are working with childline on a campaign to ensure that every child’s call for help is answered. in fact, we have been actively managing our uk co 2 emissions for a number of years – they are currently 60% below their 1996 levels. in the 2008 ﬁnancial year, we will be integrating sustainability into our business processes such as product and proposition development. products such as remote working and teleconferencing, for example, play an important part in creating sustainable businesses. all of them have the potential to impact our business, revenue, proﬁts, assets, liquidity and capital resources adversely. most of bt’s wholesale ﬁxed-network activities in the uk are subject to signiﬁcant regulatory controls. ofcom has promoted competition in the ﬁxed-network area by measures including local loop unbundling, carrier pre-selection (making it easier for bt customers to route some or all of their calls over our competitors’ networks) and the introduction of wholesale access products. we have entered into a number of complex and high-value networked it services contracts with customers. these estimates are based on our best judgment of the efﬁciencies we plan to deploy. pensions declining investment returns and longer life expectancy may result in the cost of funding bt’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme becoming a signiﬁcant burden on our ﬁnancial resources. report of the directors business review 28 bt group

2007, 2006 and 2005 ﬁnancial years reﬂect the continued strong growth in new wave services as we drive value from transforming the business. speciﬁc items are therefore analysed and discussed separately from the line of business results in this financial review. business includes the external revenue of bt retail from small and medium sized enterprises (sme) customers. during the 2005 ﬁnancial year albacom contributed post tax losses of £22 million prior to becoming a subsidiary. both ifrss and us gaap require segmental information to be presented on a consistent basis for all years reported. some of the products and services that openreach now sell were previously provided by bt wholesale, but in a different form. as a result of the undertakings, new ‘equivalent products’ which did not previously exist had to be created for both external and internal customers. ebitda is deﬁned as the group proﬁt (loss) before depreciation, amortisation, ﬁnance expense and taxation. ebitda before speciﬁc items is considered to be a useful measure of the group’s operating performance because it reﬂects the underlying operating cash costs, by eliminating depreciation and amortisation, and excludes signiﬁcant one off or unusual items which have little predictive value. we aim to provide them with networked it services and a complete range of managed solutions. bt retail’s results reﬂect the strategic shift towards growing new wave products and services while defending traditional revenue streams. bt openzone, our public wireless broadband service, grew usage by 60% compared to the 2006 ﬁnancial year. the majority of these initiatives were targeted at people related costs, with signiﬁcant savings in billing, it operations and other support functions. these savings allowed the business to invest in new wave activities such as bt vision and dabs.com. there have also been new ongoing infrastructure costs of supporting openreach and the equivalent management platform (emp) which enables openreach to manage all communication providers’ orders, both external and from other bt lines of business, on an equivalent basis. bt retail 2006 £m 2005 £m

revenue, including broadband and managed services, grew by 56% to £1,033 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. business transformation in april 2007, we announced a new structure that will deliver

executive directors in 2006/07, save that the committee agreed increases in annual base salary effective from 1 june 2006 for ben verwaayen and hanif lalani to bring their remuneration more into line with the market. for the executive directors and other relevant senior executives, (but not openreach executives, see ‘openreach’ on page 59) the importance of meeting these operational targets is recognised by linking 100% of their potential bonus to bt’s corporate performance. under his service agreement, the chairman is not entitled to receive annual grants of incentive awards or options. normally, awards vest and options become exercisable only if a predetermined performance target has been achieved. the proportion of options that are exercisable reduces on a straight-line basis between upper quartile and median performance. the annual bonus will continue to reward performance against eps, free cash ﬂow and a customer-related measure. for the chief executive, at target, two thirds of any bonus will continue to be payable in deferred shares. the annual bonus is linked to all openreach targets and long-term incentives are paid in cash instead of shares. (iv) other matters executive share ownership a mandatory shareholding programme was introduced for the ﬁnancial year 2005/06 onwards. current shareholdings are set out on page 62. progress towards meeting these targets has been made during the ﬁnancial year 2006/07. sir mike rake, who will replace sir christopher bland as chairman, entered into a service agreement as a director and chairman to take effect from 26 september 2007. ben verwaayen’s contract entitles him on termination of his contract by bt to payment of £700,000. former directors sir peter bonﬁeld received, under pre-existing

concerning the content, presentation and delivery of papers for each board meeting, so that the directors have enough information to be properly briefed sufﬁciently far ahead of each board meeting and at other appropriate times. we also conduct a survey every two years to establish the effectiveness of our relationships with suppliers. a conﬁdential helpline and dedicated e- mail facility are also available to employees who have questions about the application of these principles. more information, including details of charitable donations made by the group, is available in business review – our commitment to society. these activities are carried out on an even- handed basis related broadly to the major uk political parties’ electoral strength. the pension funds’ assets can be used only in accordance with their respective rules and for no other purpose. risk assessment and evaluation takes place as an integral part of the group’s annual strategic planning cycle. based on this assessment, management has concluded that as at 31 march 2007, the group’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting was effective. in practice, these documents are being sent to shareholders more than 20 working days before the agm. at 16 may 2007, 91 million treasury shares had been transferred to meet the company’s obligations under its employee share plans. those standards require that we plan

internal control over ﬁnancial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. where the group acts as agent in a transaction it recognises revenue net of directly attributable costs. revenue from

stage of completion, as determined by the proportion of costs incurred relative to the estimated total contract costs, or other measures of completion such as contract milestone customer acceptance. unless the ﬁnancial outcome of a contract can be estimated with reasonable certainty, no attributable proﬁt is recognised. where monetary items form part of the net investment in a foreign operation and are designated as hedges of a net investment or as cash ﬂow hedges, such exchange differences are initially recognised in equity. on consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign undertakings are translated into sterling at year end exchange rates. foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in a separate component of equity, the translation reserve. (x) asset impairment (non financial assets) intangible assets with ﬁnite useful lives and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment if events or changes in circumstances (assessed at each reporting date) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. goodwill and intangible assets with indeﬁnite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually. the group’s net obligation in respect of deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans is calculated separately for each scheme by estimating the amount of future beneﬁt that employees have earned in return for their service to date. financial assets financial assets at fair value through income statement a ﬁnancial asset is classiﬁed in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term (held for trading) or if so designated by management. provisions are made speciﬁcally where there is objective evidence of a dispute or an inability to pay. bank overdrafts are included within loans and other borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet. financial assets were held at the lower of cost and net realisable value in accordance with uk gaap. providing for doubtful debts bt provide services to around 18 million individuals and businesses, mainly on credit terms. estimates, based on our historical experience are used in determining the level of debts that we believe will not be collected. goodwill the recoverable amount of cash generating units has been determined based on value in use calculations. asset lives are assessed annually and changed when necessary to reﬂect current thinking on their remaining lives in light of technological change, network investment plans (including the group’s 21cn transformation programme) prospective economic utilisation and physical condition of the assets concerned. we believe the estimates, assumptions and judgements are reasonable but this can involve complex issues which may take a number of years to resolve. consolidated

bt’s international sharesave, which is a three year plan, have been valued using the same assumptions. the options granted in previous years will be exercisable subject to continued employment and meeting corporate performance targets. in particular, this includes fees for audit reports issued on the group’s regulatory ﬁnancial statements. all transactions in derivative ﬁnancial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities. at 31 march 2007, the group’s ﬁxed:ﬂoating interest rate proﬁle, after hedging, on net debt was 75:25 (2006: 85:15). the majority of these instruments were cross currency swaps with a remaining term ranging from 2 months to 24 years. reﬁnancing risk is managed by limiting the amount of borrowing that matures within any speciﬁed period. the interest receivable under these swap contracts are at a weighted average rate of 6.9% (2006: 6.9%) for euro cross currency swaps and 8.2% (2006: 8.2%) for dollar cross currency swaps and interest payable are at a weighted average rate of 9.2% (2006: 8.5%). at 31 march 2007, the group had outstanding forward currency contracts with a total notional principal amount of £nil
