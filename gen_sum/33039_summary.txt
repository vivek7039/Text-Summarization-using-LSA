A separate annual review and notice of meeting (including summary ﬁnancial statements) for the year ended 31 March 2007 has been issued to all shareholders. PENSIONS Investment performance on assets in the BT Pension Scheme (BTPS) was very good, with year end value at a record £38 billion. YOUR BOARD I will be stepping down as Chairman in the autumn after more than six challenging and fascinating years with BT. Overview Chairman’s message 4 BT Group plc Annual Report & Form 20-F The 2007 ﬁnancial year was a very good one for your company – our results once again were excellent. Franc ¸ois joined the Board on 24 April 2007 as Chief Executive BT Global Services (in which role he succeeds Andy Green who became CEO of Group Strategy and Operations). Even when we hit ﬁve million broadband connections in 2005 – more than a year ahead of schedule – there was no time to take it easy. In the future, BT’s services will increasingly be based on software – designed, delivered and updated remotely by computers over broadband networks. These services will be faster, more innovative, reliable and simpler to use – often delivered by the push of a button. Our extensive global network enables us to serve customers in all the world’s key commercial centres – either directly or through partnership arrangements. BT people have already shown what they are capable of; and there’s a lot more where that came from. Report of the Directors Business review We are committed to increasing shareholder value by transforming our customers’ experience through service excellence. At 31 March 2007, we had a total of 314,000 mobile connections in the UK (both GSM and our new, intelligent ﬁxed/mobile service, BT Fusion). At 31 March 2007, our ﬂagship MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) network service provided coverage and support to over 100 countries from more than 1,300 points of presence. As part of this, we have taken on approximately 250 people employed in Europe and are now responsible for providing NIS services to Capgemini customers. February 2007 HP and BT announced that they had signed seven-year outsourcing contracts with Anglo American worth in total around US$450 million. In the latest Gartner’s assessment (Magic Quadrant Report of Pan-European Network Service Providers), BT Global Services is ranked top for both. 27% 9% 9% 55% At a time when convergent, new wave products and services are radically reshaping the communications industry, customers of all kinds have more choice than ever before.

BT Vision, which does not require a regular monthly subscription, is the ﬁrst widely available TV service of its kind. Customers will also be able – via BT Vision’s replay TV service – to access a selection of terrestrial programmes released in the previous week. Convergent services for consumers We are also playing a lead role in the development of internet telephony or VolP (voice over IP). From October 2006, we cut the cost of calling many non-geographic numbers and since January 2007 have been offering all our customers who opt for paperless billing a reduction in their monthly rental. All BT Privacy customers can be added to the Telephone Preference Service register which ﬁlters out most unsolicited marketing calls. BT Openzone offers customers a high-speed, wireless broadband connection over which they can access the internet to work, talk or play. Revenues were £5,177 million, driven by strong market volume growth, which more than offset the impact of a price reduction for WLR (wholesale line rental). A key area of focus has been enhancing the ways in which customers can deal with BT, simultaneously saving costs and improving customer service. In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, we vacated around 40 buildings and installed an additional 1,300 ﬂexible workstations which can be shared by multiple users. March 2007 We acquired International Network Services Inc. (INS), a leading global provider of IT consulting and software solutions, based in California.

During the 2007 ﬁnancial year, we reduced our accident rate by 10% to 2.4 lost time incidents per million working hours at 31 March 2007. In fact, we have been actively managing our UK CO 2 emissions for a number of years – they are currently 60% below their 1996 levels. Pensions Declining investment returns and longer life expectancy may result in the cost of funding BT’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme becoming a signiﬁcant burden on our ﬁnancial resources. Some of the products and services that Openreach now sell were previously provided by BT Wholesale, but in a different form. As a result of the Undertakings, new ‘equivalent products’ which did not previously exist had to be created for both external and internal customers. BT Retail’s results reﬂect the strategic shift towards growing new wave products and services while defending traditional revenue streams. The majority of these initiatives were targeted at people related costs, with signiﬁcant savings in billing, IT operations and other support functions.

BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION In April 2007, we announced a new structure that will deliver faster, more resilient and cost effective services to customers wherever they are. The group’s deﬁnition of free cash ﬂow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Unrealised gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are required to be reported in earnings at each reporting date. Before this, Franc ¸ois worked for Ascend Communications where he held the position of senior vice president, EMEA and International until its acquisition by Lucent. Prior to his retirement in May 2001, Clay was executive deputy chairman of CMG having joined the board when it acquired Admiral. As a result of regulatory or similar requirements, it may be necessary to employ the company’s external auditors for certain non-audit work. This has been crucial as BT’s revenues from traditional business have fallen and new Report of the Directors Corporate governance 56 BT Group plc Annual Report & Form 20-F Filename: 51384_05.3d Time: 15:18:09 Date: 19/05/07 Checksum: 375510139 wave services, generated mainly from networked IT services and broadband, have been developed to provide revenue growth.

A conﬁdential helpline and dedicated e- mail facility are also available to employees who have questions about the application of these principles. More information, including details of charitable donations made by the group, is available in Business review – Our commitment to society. These activities are carried out on an even- handed basis related broadly to the major UK political parties’ electoral strength. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that as at 31 March 2007, the group’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting was effective. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over ﬁnancial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Estimates, based on our historical experience are used in determining the level of debts that we believe will not be collected. We believe the estimates, assumptions and judgements are reasonable but this can involve complex issues which may take a number of years to resolve. Some of the products and services that Openreach now sell were previously provided by BT Wholesale, but in a different form. As a result of the Undertakings, new ‘equivalent products’ which did not previously exist had to be created for both internal and external customers. d The 2007 financial year includes £139 million relating to interest on settlement of open tax matters disclosed as a specific item (see note 4). INS, Counterpane and I3IT have been fully integrated into BT Global Services, which is considered to be the relevant cash generating unit (CGU). These are determined using cash ﬂow projections derived from ﬁnancial budgets approved by the board covering a four year period. The company has concluded that it would not be appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such claim. The offer became unconditional on 23 January 2007 once sufﬁcient acceptances had been received from shareholders and all regulatory clearances were obtained. Options granted under BT’s international sharesave, which is a three year plan, have been valued using the same assumptions. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT continued The maturity proﬁle of interest bearing ﬁnancial assets based on contractual repricing dates is less than one year.
