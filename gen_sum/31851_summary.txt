If Stonegate does exercise its right to reduce the amount of consideration payable for each Revolution share by the amount of any dividend (or other distribution) that has not been paid, Revolution shareholders will be entitled to receive and retain that dividend (or other distribution). At the heart of that progress is our focused strategy to: > build customer loyalty, ensuring that all visits to our venues are an excellent experience; > drive continued profit improvement from existing sites; and > expand the estate into new profitable locations. We do not take anything for granted with employees in all areas of our business contributing fully to this goal. Our two brands currently list in the region of 100 different cocktails and change menus four times per annum to ensure that there is always something new. We regularly introduce specials to determine whether a new dish could become part of the regular menu. > Our people development teams are continually enhancing training and recruitment programmes to ensure that we have front line staff capable of providing outstanding customer service.

Notwithstanding that, certain sites deliver more profit than others and the Group’s profits are sensitive to this. Market expectations rely on the Group sourcing and developing a number of suitable sites per annum. Macroeconomic factors, such as employment levels, interest rates and consumer confidence, can be important influences on disposable income. To mitigate this risk, the Group employs specialist rent review advisers, who deal only with tenant reviews. *** Adjusted EBITDA excludes exceptional items and bar opening costs (see reconciliation table on page 18 of the Financial Review). We anticipate seeing further profit improvements at these sites in the coming period and, ultimately, for adjusted EBITDA*** conversion to exceed 20 per cent. *** Adjusted EBITDA excludes exceptional items and bar opening costs (see reconciliation table on page 18 of the Financial Review). Further improvements in both sales and profit are being achieved at these venues that will drive the returns higher.

The majority (if not all) of any bonus will be determined by financial measures with only a minority being paid for achieving threshold performance levels. The service agreement is terminable by Mark McQuater or Revolution on not less than 12 months’ prior written notice. Mike Foster’s employment is terminable by him or Revolution on not less than six months’ prior notice.

The Committee reviews its relationships with external advisers on a regular basis and believes that no conflicts of interest exist. For each Executive Director, their performance-related bonus is based 80 per cent on an annual scorecard of financial performance metrics and 20 per cent on personal strategic objectives that reflect key drivers of the business, such as new openings, customers, quality and staff. This bonus will also be wholly payable in cash and subject to recovery provisions for three years from date of payment.

The Group also employs four full-time stock-takers who are checking stocks and various other related compliance matters such as cash counts on a risk assessed basis.

Operating segments An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. These amounts have now been written off to the consolidated income statements for those respective periods and net assets reduced accordingly. Judgement is therefore applied in determining the element of internal employment costs which are directly attributable to capital projects. Operating expenses 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017 £’000 53 weeks ended 2 July 2016 Restated* £’000 Administrative expenses 12,697 10,203 Sales and distribution 82,959 74,580 Total operating expenses 95,656 84,783 Exceptional items Administrative expenses: – professional fees for aborted corporate transaction — 1,063 – other exceptional fees (see below) 239 — – termination of Directors’ contracts 190 329 – impairment of property, plant and equipment 1,476 — – movement on onerous lease provisions 1,964 (997) – charges arising from long-term incentive plans 483 987 Total exceptional items 4,352 1,382 During the year the Group was subject to significant senior personnel changes in its finance function and as a result of identifying some significant accounting adjustments undertook a full accounting review. This included professional fees incurred for an aborted corporate transaction and the contract termination costs relating to Sean Curran’s resignation as Chief Financial Officer. A sensitivity analysis has been performed on each of these key assumptions with other variables held constant. All cash balances are held with reputable banks and the Board monitors its exposure to counterparty risk on an ongoing basis. Market interest rate risk arises from the Group’s holding of interest-bearing financial assets and liabilities. If interest rates at each period-end reporting date had moved by 5 per cent, the impact on results would not have been significant. They are presented in Pounds Sterling, with values rounded to the nearest hundred thousand, except where otherwise indicated. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
