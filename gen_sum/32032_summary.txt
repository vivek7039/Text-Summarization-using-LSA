report another successful year, with revenue for the 12 months ended 31 may 2017 up 17.4% to £50.5m (2016: £43.0m). our broad range of employee benefit services is targeted towards medium-sized and larger corporates. last year, my longstanding business partner bob woods stepped down after ten years in the role of executive chairman to focus on his client portfolio, new business development and acting as an ambassador for mattioli woods. the new set go structure combined with a smaller board is logical, practical and in all our people’s best interests. > continues on page 16 chief executive

financial statements 15 15 mattioli woods plc annual report 2017 “demand has surpassed our expectations and we have built a well-diversified portfolio of structured products within the fund” mark fuller head of structured products mattioli woods has seen huge demand for its industry-leading structured products fund, which has attracted over £100m of investment in its first six months. a big proportion of this time (more than three months) was taken up obtaining all the necessary regulatory approvals. it is intended to be held for the long- term, and clients should invest with at least a two-year investment horizon. the vast majority of funds rely on assets invested in going up to achieve a return. it should be noted that revenues in our employee benefits business are not linked to the value of client assets in the same way that certain of our wealth management revenue streams are. pension consultancy and administration retirement planning is often central to our clients’ wealth management strategies. third party administration fees increased 31.4% to £4.6m (2016: £3.5m), with £1.2m of revenues generated by mc trustees during the period. this continues to be well received by clients, with £20.6m (2016: £9.9m) invested in seven (2016: eight) new syndicates completed during the year . we believe the government’s emphasis on workplace advice presents new opportunities for us to realise further synergies between our employee benefits and wealth management businesses. 12 direct schemes lost to an alternative provider as a percentage of average scheme numbers during the period. mattioli woods plc annual report 2017 18 chief executive officer’s review continued previously, i set out our aim to reduce the ters incurred by clients and i see both a market expectation and possible regulatory or legislative pressure to reduce product costs, which could bring about some continued pressure on sector margins. the continued development of the group’s technology infrastructure is a key part of our strategy and although taking longer than we initially anticipated, investment in our bespoke pension administration and wealth management platform continues in line with expected spend. we are reviewing the possibility of moving to a hosted it infrastructure, which may offer improved data security, business continuity and scalability for future growth. our core values provide a framework for integrity, leading to responsible and ethical business practices. we are proud of our consistently high client retention rate, but continue seeking ways to strengthen this. we address this through ongoing quality control procedures and the provision of regular training for all our staff. however, a great strength of our business is that we can continue to derive income from investments in all asset classes, while ensuring our clients’ investment strategies are appropriately aligned to the prevailing market conditions and suitable for their financial needs. corporate social responsibility we believe that running a profitable and growing business, which creates jobs and contributes to the economic success of the areas in which it operates, is a good platform for good corporate social responsibility. our business has benefited greatly from winning numerous awards and we feel its right to help other businesses reap the rewards of such accolades. in addition, we sponsor a variety of local clubs, business and sports related events across the country. the purpose-built structure will provide 50,000 sq ft of space and house more than 400 staff when they switch from enderby next year . mattioli woods’ staff have been taken on a series of monthly visits to see first-hand how the building project is developing. » majority of clients’ funds held within registered pension schemes or isas, where less likely to withdraw funds and lose tax benefits; » broad range of investment solutions enables clients to shelter from market volatility through diversification, while continuing to generate revenues for the group; and » market volatility is closely monitored by the asset management executive committee. high high evolving technology the
