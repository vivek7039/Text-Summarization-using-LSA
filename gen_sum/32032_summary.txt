A big proportion of this time (more than three months) was taken up obtaining all the necessary regulatory approvals. It is intended to be held for the long- term, and clients should invest with at least a two-year investment horizon. The vast majority of funds rely on assets invested in going up to achieve a return. Third party administration fees increased 31.4% to £4.6m (2016: £3.5m), with £1.2m of revenues generated by MC Trustees during the period. This continues to be well received by clients, with £20.6m (2016: £9.9m) invested in seven (2016: eight) new syndicates completed during the year . We believe the Government’s emphasis on workplace advice presents new opportunities for us to realise further synergies between our employee benefits and wealth management businesses. 12 Direct schemes lost to an alternative provider as a percentage of average scheme numbers during the period. Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017 18 Chief Executive Officer’s review continued Previously, I set out our aim to reduce the TERs incurred by clients and I see both a market expectation and possible regulatory or legislative pressure to reduce product costs, which could bring about some continued pressure on sector margins. The continued development of the Group’s technology infrastructure is a key part of our strategy and although taking longer than we initially anticipated, investment in our bespoke pension administration and wealth management platform continues in line with expected spend. We are reviewing the possibility of moving to a hosted IT infrastructure, which may offer improved data security, business continuity and scalability for future growth. We are proud of our consistently high client retention rate, but continue seeking ways to strengthen this. We address this through ongoing quality control procedures and the provision of regular training for all our staff. However, a great strength of our business is that we can continue to derive income from investments in all asset classes, while ensuring our clients’ investment strategies are appropriately aligned to the prevailing market conditions and suitable for their financial needs. Corporate social responsibility We believe that running a profitable and growing business, which creates jobs and contributes to the economic success of the areas in which it operates, is a good platform for good corporate social responsibility. Our business has benefited greatly from winning numerous awards and we feel its right to help other businesses reap the rewards of such accolades. In addition, we sponsor a variety of local clubs, business and sports related events across the country. The purpose-built structure will provide 50,000 sq ft of space and house more than 400 staff when they switch from Enderby next year . Mattioli Woods’ staff have been taken on a series of monthly visits to see first-hand how the building project is developing. » Succession planning is a key consideration throughout the Group; » Success of the Group should attract high calibre candidates; » Share-based schemes in operation to incentivise staff and encourage retention; » Recruitment programmes in place to attract appropriate new staff; » Cross functional acquisition team brought into acquisition projects at an early stage; and » Keyman cover for company founders. We look forward to this being a linchpin in opening up new markets for us” Ian Mattioli MBE Chief Executive Officer Mattioli Woods strengthened its brand with the announcement of a three-year deal with rugby giants, Leicester Tigers in August 2016.
