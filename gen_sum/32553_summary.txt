trillion 1 – enough to lift around 1.4 billion people out of poverty for six years. in october 2016 apple reported that up to 90% of its products purchased via a well-known online marketplace are counterfeit. staying one step ahead effective product authentication, from source to consumption, can combat this surge in illicit trade. printed features, holograms and uniquely encoded materials known as taggants all have a part to play. but the right joined-up approach, with multiple stakeholders working together to address issues such as cross border pricing and complex supply chains, will go a long way to ensuring that governments, brands and consumers stay one step ahead of the criminals. but rarely governments can realistically make such investments without a reliable, demonstrable understanding of its population base. it’s not hard to imagine the chaos if immigration control was closed for several hours because digital passports couldn’t be checked. yes, these will undoubtedly have a key part to play – for example, capturing birth data offline in remote areas and then uploading once connection is available can potentially transform civil registration. this means that everyone, everywhere, can now have an address and therefore play their full part in society. watch more online at www.delarue.com/about-us/our-strategy strategic report corporate governance accounts

a contingency, alternative suppliers are pre‑qualified wherever possible and where necessary we retain higher levels of stocks. any loss of product or high security components has the potential to cause reputational and financial damage. we have robust physical security and materials control procedures at our production sites, which reduce the risk of inadvertent loss or theft during manufacturing. losses from cancelled orders and non‑ payment of debt could lead to a reduction in operating profit. these include the ability to maintain a dividend, meet current investment plans, and comply with liquidity ratios. adjusted profit before tax* was consistent with the prior year at £58.7m (2015/16: £58.5m), resulting from adjusted operating profits which were flat on the prior year
