Acknowledgements Dignity would like to thank all those who participated in producing this Annual Report, particularly the members ofstaff for their contributions. Size and scale We operate a network of 826 funeral locations throughout the UK, generally trading under established local names. Meeting their needs means that our employees must be caring, thoughtful and truly engaged with those they serve. The high quality of our oﬀering, more competitively priced, is how we will diﬀerentiate ourselves, locally and nationally. We believe the funeral industry will beneﬁt signiﬁcantly from proper regulation to ensure that clients are not misled into accepting below-par service and standards. It is estimated that three quarters of all funerals result in a cremation with the remainder being burials. This size still gives the Group good scope to acquire owner managed businesses in areas where it is not well represented. Changing client demands It is clear that direct cremations represent a small, but increasing proportion of all funerals. They should be interpreted as a direction of travel for consumer behaviour rather than precise metrics about the entire market. We are also reviewing the advantages of launching into other segments under diﬀerent sub-brands, including a mid-market oﬀering. There is much catching up to do but also major opportunities for those leading players who get it right.

Ground-breaking research into cremations We wish to provide our clients with the best possible service, one which fully meets or exceeds their needs. 8 8 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 | 13 Chief Executive’s review – Outlook Q&A What has happened in your market to trigger this change of strategy? 16 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Non-ﬁnancial KPIs 590,000 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 590,000 588,000 550,000 560,000 Deﬁnition This is as reported by the Oﬃce for National Statistics. 1 Dec6 Dec7 Dec8 Dec9 Dec10 Dec11 Dec12 Dec13 Dec14 Dec15 Dec16 Dec17 Overview 01 – 03 Strategic Report 04 – 43 Governance 44 – 74 Financial Statements 75 – 129 Other Information 130 – 132 Key performance indicators continued We strive to maintain and improve client satisfaction across our business. This ﬁnancial performance reﬂects the lower number of funerals performed, offset by some increases in average income and acquisition activity. In overall terms, approximately 69,000 (2016: 49,000) new plan sales were made and the number of active pre-arranged funeral plans increased to 450,000 (2016: 404,000) as at 29 December 2017. This is why working closely with these organisations means we can continue to uphold the very best industry practices. The prestigious accolade is an independent seal of excellence that recognises businesses for delivering exceptional experiences, as rated by real customers. Maintenance capital expenditure of £2.9 million has been incurred on central projects predominantly relating to IT that will help the business as a whole operate more eﬃciently. Financial review continued 30 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 | 31 Financial review – Outlook Q&A 2018 will be a challenging year for the Group but I am conﬁdent we have the ﬁnancial and management strength to meet these challenges head on. This focus on our core strengths is balanced by a more cautious approach to risk in other areas. However, the Group took decisive action to reduce its funeral pricing in January 2018, which will be supported by an improved online presence. If this stricter test is not achieved, then the Group’s ability to pay dividends would be impacted. Each year 20,000 people complete their time with the British Army, Navy or Royal Air Force and resettle into civilian life. The garden is named after Violet Mornington who was just ﬁve years old when she died of an extremely rare blood disorder in July 2013. Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 | 43 CDP encourages best practice in reporting and reducing environmental impact through a scoring process. Dignity’s lower market-based carbon emissions ﬁgure in Scope 2 reﬂects a larger proportion of purchased electricity generated by low-carbon sources than the UK grid average. There were five independent Non-Executive Directors who served for the period: Jane Ashcroft, Alan McWalter, Martin Pexton, David Blackwood and Mary McNamara. Each Non-Executive Director is appointed for a fixed term of two years, subject to annual re-election by shareholders. This term may then be renewed by mutual consent up to a maximum of nine years in accordance with the Code. Martin Pexton resigned from the Board and this Committee on 3 February 2017 so did not attend any meetings in 2017. Finally, the Company’s Articles provide that all Directors retire by rotation with one third being subject to re-election each year. 2017 annual bonus outcome The Group demonstrated good operational performance, continued excellent client survey results and made further acquisitions of established funeral businesses. This performance was achieved against the backdrop of a challenging environment which is becoming increasingly competitive in 2018 and beyond. The annual bonus in 2017 was measured against stretching earnings before interest and tax ('EBIT') targets, our key short-term ﬁnancial performance indicator. The LTIP award granted in 2015 was subject to performance against two equally weighted measures, relative total shareholder return (‘TSR’) and earnings per share growth (‘EPS’). Following vesting, Executive Directors will be required to retain their net of tax vested shares for two years. The maximum annual award that can be made to an individual in any given ﬁnancial year is 150 per cent of salary. Notes • Minimum comprises fixed pay, which includes 2018 basic salary, the value of benefits in 2017 and a 15 per cent company pension contribution. Overview 01 – 03 Strategic Report 04 – 43 Governance 44 – 74 Financial Statements 75 – 129 Other Information 130 – 132 Report on Directors’ remuneration continued for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017 64 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 How shareholder views are taken into account The Remuneration Committee is committed to ensuring an open dialogue with our shareholders and therefore, where changes are being made to the remuneration policy or where there is a material change in which we operate our policy, we will consult with major shareholders in advance. However, full retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be provided in next year's Remuneration Report. Mary McNamara was appointed to the Board on 1 March 2017 and her remuneration as Non-Executive Director is from that date. Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 | 69 There has been no change in the interests set out above between 29 December 2017 and 14 March 2018. Therefore there is a risk that central management may override controls to intentionally misstate revenue transactions through inappropriate manual journal entries. This included analysing and selecting journals for testing which appeared unusual in nature either due to size, preparer or being manually posted. • Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identiﬁed in the paragraphs above. Our procedures involved: journal entry testing, with a focus on manual journals and journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the business; enquiries of group management, internal audit; and focused testing, as referred to in the key audit matters section above. 82 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Consolidated income statement for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017 52 week period 53 week period ended ended 29 December 30 December 2017 2016 Note £m £m Revenue 3 324.0 313.6 Cost of sales (130.6) (128.1) Gross profit 193.4 185.5 Administrative expenses (95.4) (87.8) Operating profit 3 98.0 97.7 Analysed as: Underlying operating profit 3 104.6 101.7 (Loss)/profit on sale of fixed assets (0.1) 0.1 External transaction costs in respect of completed and aborted transactions 5 (4.7) (4.1) Acquisition related amortisation (1.8) – Operating profit 3 98.0 97.7 Finance costs 4 (26.9) (26.9) Finance income 4 0.1 0.4 Profit before tax 5 71.2 71.2 Taxation – before exceptional items (13.4) (15.8) Taxation – exceptional – 1.8 Taxation 6 (13.4) (14.0) Profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders 3 57.8 57.2 Earnings per share for profit attributable to equity shareholders – Basic (pence) 8 115.8p 115.3p – Diluted (pence) 8 115.6p 114.6p Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017 52 week period 53 week period ended ended 29 December 30 December 2017 2016 Note £m £m Profit for the period 57.8 57.2 Items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss Remeasurement gain/(loss) on retirement benefit obligations 28 3.2 (12.5) Tax (charge)/credit on remeasurement on retirement benefit obligations (0.5) 2.3 Restatement of deferred tax for the change in UK tax rate – (0.3) Other comprehensive income/(loss) 2.7 (10.5) Comprehensive income for the period 60.5 46.7 Attributable to: Equity shareholders of the parent 60.5 46.7 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 | 83 Overview 01 – 03 Strategic Report 04 – 43 Governance 44 – 74 Financial Statements 75 – 129 Other Information 130 – 132 Consolidated balance sheet as at 29 December 2017 29 December 30 December 2017 2016 Note £m £m Assets Non-current assets Goodwill 9 226.1 215.9 Intangible assets 9 159.4 142.2 Property, plant and equipment 10 248.0 235.4 Financial and other assets 11 14.3 11.3 647.8 604.8 Current assets Inventories 13 7.3 6.1 Trade and other receivables 14 38.3 37.0 Cash and cash equivalents 15 49.3 67.1 94.9 110.2 Total assets 742.7 715.0 Liabilities Current liabilities Financial liabilities 16 4.5 8.8 Trade and other payables 17 57.8 59.3 Current tax liabilities 6.2 5.4 Provisions for liabilities 19 1.5 1.6 70.0 75.1 Non-current liabilities Financial liabilities 16 561.2 581.5 Deferred tax liabilities 20 30.3 25.7 Other non–current liabilities 17 2.3 2.8 Provisions for liabilities 19 8.5 7.5 Retirement benefit obligation 28 24.0 25.9 626.3 643.4 Total liabilities 696.3 718.5 Shareholders’ equity Ordinary share capital 22 6.2 6.1 Share premium account 11.1 8.5 Capital redemption reserve 141.7 141.7 Other reserves (4.6) (3.5) Retained earnings (108.0) (156.3) Total equity 46.4 (3.5) Total equity and liabilities 742.7 715.0 The financial statements on pages 82 to 119 were approved by the Board of Directors on 14 March 2018 and were signed on its behalf by: M K McCollum S L Whittern Chief Executive Finance Director 84 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Consolidated statement of changes in equity for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017 Ordinary Share Capital share premium redemption Other Retained Total capital account reserve reserves earnings equity £m £m £m £m £m £m Shareholders’ equity as at 25 December 2015 6.1 4.8 141.7 (4.5) (192.0) (43.9) Profit for the 53 weeks ended 30 December 2016 – – – – 57.2 57.2 Remeasurement loss on defined benefit obligations – – – – (12.5) (12.5) Tax on pensions – – – – 2.3 2.3 Restatement of deferred tax for the change in UK tax rate – – – – (0.3) (0.3) Total comprehensive income – – – – 46.7 46.7 Effects of employee share options – – – 3.0 – 3.0 Tax on employee share options – – – 0.2 – 0.2 Proceeds from share issue (1) – 3.7 – – – 3.7 Gift to Employee Benefit Trust – – – (2.2) – (2.2) Dividends (note 7) – – – – (11.0) (11.0) Shareholders’ equity as at 30 December 2016 6.1 8.5 141.7 (3.5) (156.3) (3.5) Profit for the 52 weeks ended 29 December 2017 – – – – 57.8 57.8 Remeasurement gain on retirement benefit options – – – – 3.2 3.2 Tax on pensions – – – – (0.5) (0.5) Total comprehensive income – – – – 60.5 60.5 Effects of employee share options – – – 1.3 – 1.3 Tax on employee share options – – – 0.1 – 0.1 Proceeds from share issue (2) 0.1 2.6 – – – 2.7 Gift to Employee Benefit Trust – – – (2.5) – (2.5) Dividends (note 7) – – – – (12.2) (12.2) Shareholders’ equity as at 29 December 2017 6.2 11.1 141.7 (4.6) (108.0) 46.4 (1) Relating to issue of 213,851 shares under 2013 LTIP scheme and 104,008 shares under 2013 SAYE scheme. Further information can be found in the non consolidation of pre-need trusts note within critical accounting estimates and judgements below. Costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives (three to eight years) using the straight line method. Cost includes, where appropriate, directly attributable costs incurred in bringing each asset to its present location and condition. Cost includes all directly attributable costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred in completion and sale. This standard requires disclosure so as to help users of financial statements better understand change in an entities debt. This standard establishes a new five step model that will apply to revenue arising from contracts with customers. This standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and will therefore impact the Group’s 2019 financial results. This standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and will therefore impact the Group’s 2020 financial results. 2 Financial risk management The Group finances its operations by a mixture of shareholders’ funds, Secured Notes and bank borrowings. This ratio was determined when raising the debt as being sufficient to ensure all borrowings could be repaid.

Accordingly, the Board believes that earnings per share calculated by reference to this underlying profit after taxation is also a useful indicator of financial performance. 128 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Financial record* Summarised consolidated income statement 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 £m £m £m £m £m Revenue Funeral services 221.8 217.8 212.6 184.4 176.2 Crematoria 74.0 67.5 63.1 55.2 53.8 Pre-arranged funeral plans 28.2 28.3 29.6 29.3 26.7 324.0 313.6 305.3 268.9 256.7 Underlying operating profit Funeral services 79.5 79.0 76.8 66.3 60.8 Crematoria 40.0 37.6 34.6 29.1 27.4 Pre-arranged funeral plans 8.0 8.5 7.8 7.4 6.7 Central overheads (22.9) (23.4) (20.5) (17.9) (16.5) 104.6 101.7 98.7 84.9 78.4 Underlying finance costs (26.9) (26.9) (27.0) (30.6) (28.9) Finance income 0.1 0.4 0.5 4.2 3.4 Underlying profit before tax 77.8 75.2 72.2 58.5 52.9 Taxation (13.8) (15.8) (15.5) (13.1) (12.9) Underlying profit after tax 64.0 59.4 56.7 45.4 40.0 Underlying earnings per share (pence) 128.3p 119.8p 114.8p 85.8p 72.1p Operating profit 98.0 97.7 95.5 82.9 75.1 Profit/(loss) after tax 57.8 57.2 56.9 (55.0) 40.4 Basic earnings per share (pence) 115.8p 115.3p 115.2p (104.0p) 72.8p Key performance indicators 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 Total estimated number of deaths in Britain (number) 590,000 590,000 588,000 550,000 560,000 Number of funerals performed (number) 68,800 70,700 73,500 65,600 68,000 Funeral market share** (per cent) 11.5% 11.8% 12.3% 11.7% 11.9% Number of cremations performed (number) 63,400 59,500 57,700 53,400 55,500 Crematoria market share (per cent) 10.7% 10.1% 9.8% 9.7% 9.9% Active pre-arranged funeral plans (number) 450,000 404,000 374,000 348,000 323,000 Cash generated from operations (£million) 115.4 121.1 125.2 104.4 94.2 Net debt 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 £m £m £m £m £m Net amounts owing on Secured Notes per financial statements (565.1) (573.9) (586.5) (594.6) (403.0) Add: unamortised issue costs on Secured Notes (0.6) (0.7) (0.7) (0.7) (16.3) Gross amounts owing on Secured Notes per financial statements (565.7) (574.6) (587.2) (595.3) (419.3) Net amounts owing on Crematoria Acquisition Facility per financial statements – (15.7) (15.7) (15.6) (15.6) Add: unamortised issue costs on Crematoria Acquisition Facility – (0.1) (0.1) (0.2) (0.2) Gross amounts owing (565.7) (590.4) (603.0) (611.1) (435.1) Accrued interest on Secured Notes (0.3) (0.3) (12.8) (5.7) (14.3) Accrued interest on Crematoria Acquisition Facility and Revolving Credit Facility (0.2) (0.1) (0.1) – – Cash and cash equivalents 49.3 67.1 98.8 86.5 79.3 Net debt (516.9) (523.7) (517.1) (530.3) (370.1) Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 | 129 Overview 01 – 03 Strategic Report 04 – 43 Governance 44 – 74 Financial Statements 75 – 129 Other Information 130 – 132 Summarised consolidated balance sheet 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 £m £m £m £m £m Non-current assets Goodwill and intangible assets 385.5 358.1 328.2 276.5 250.4 Property, plant and equipment 248.0 235.4 200.6 192.3 183.6 Financial and other assets 14.3 11.3 10.3 10.4 12.7 647.8 604.8 539.1 479.2 446.7 Current assets Cash and cash equivalents – excluding collateralisation of Liquidity Facility 49.3 67.1 98.8 86.5 79.3 Cash and cash equivalents – collateralisation of Liquidity Facility – – – – 63.0 Cash and cash equivalents 49.3 67.1 98.8 86.5 142.3 Other current assets 45.6 43.1 38.3 36.5 34.4 94.9 110.2 137.1 123.0 176.7 Total assets 742.7 715.0 676.2 602.2 623.4 Current liabilities 70.0 75.1 82.7 60.6 143.6 Non-current liabilities 626.3 643.4 637.4 634.1 437.6 Total liabilities 696.3 718.5 720.1 694.7 581.2 Equity attributable to shareholders 46.4 (3.5) (43.9) (92.5) 42.2 Total equity and liabilities 742.7 715.0 676.2 602.2 623.4 NOTES * This information has been extracted from the current and previous Annual Reports and accordingly does not constitute audited information.
