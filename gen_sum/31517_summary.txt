purpose is to be the company that everyone knows they can trust at one of the most diﬃcult times in their lives, now and for generations to come. size and scale we operate a network of 826 funeral locations throughout the uk, generally trading under established local names. 45crematoria we have already helped more than 824,000 people plan for their funerals in advance, of which 450,000 remain outstanding. dignity plc annual report & accounts 2017 | 05 long-serving operations director, andrew davies would retire in april 2018. he stepped down from the board in january 2018. his successor was appointed from within the company and will not be a main board appointment. meeting their needs means that our employees must be caring, thoughtful and truly engaged with those they serve. as indicated in january, the board believes that whilst the combination of action being taken will lead to substantially lower proﬁts in 2018, it should create a new platform to allow many years of further stable growth. it also diﬀerentiates us from many competitors in what is still, regrettably, an unregulated industry. the high quality of our oﬀering, more competitively priced, is how we will diﬀerentiate ourselves, locally and nationally. we believe the funeral industry will beneﬁt signiﬁcantly from proper regulation to ensure that clients are not misled into accepting below-par service and standards. delivering excellent client service in an evolving digital age and increasingly competitive funeral sector we have long been known for our high quality of service and every year we have reported on exceptionally high levels of client satisfaction. there are approximately 290 crematoria in the uk, with circa 66 per cent owned by local authorities. it is estimated that three quarters of all funerals result in a cremation with the remainder being burials. this size still gives the group good scope to acquire owner managed businesses in areas where it is not well represented. consequently, price and aﬀordability are rightly becoming increasingly important factors for a growing number of clients. combined with the internet which allows them to shop around, prices are coming under growing pressure. changing client demands it is clear that direct cremations represent a small, but increasing proportion of all funerals. they should be interpreted as a direction of travel for consumer behaviour rather than precise metrics about the entire market. we are also reviewing the advantages of launching into other segments under diﬀerent sub-brands, including a mid-market oﬀering. there is much catching up to do but also major opportunities for those leading players who get it right. overview 01 – 03 strategic report 04 – 43 governance 44 – 74 financial statements 75 – 129 other information 130 – 132 chief executive’s review continued 12 | dignity plc annual report & accounts 2017 while increasing competition often leads to higher standards, in an unregulated industry this is far less certain and the funeral industry is a case in point. ground-breaking research into cremations we wish to provide our clients with the best possible service, one which fully meets or exceeds their needs. 8 8 dignity plc annual report & accounts 2017 | 13 chief executive’s review – outlook q&a what has happened in your market to trigger this change of strategy? it means rigorously reviewing our operations to ensure that they are more eﬃcient and eﬀective. we have the ﬁnancial strength and quality of management to deliver on our strategic priorities. in 2018 ﬁnd the optimum relationship between price, service and demand for our funeral business going forward. 16 | dignity plc annual report & accounts 2017 non-ﬁnancial kpis 590,000 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2013 2014 2015

maintain and improve client satisfaction across our business. this ﬁnancial performance reﬂects the lower number of funerals performed, offset by some increases in average income and acquisition activity. four locations were closed, principally where it was considered commercially appropriate not to renew leases. the new relationship between volumes and prices will take longer to become clear and we expect to provide further updates on these estimates when we release our ﬁrst quarter trading update in may 2018. a further update will be provided in august with the group’s interim results, which is also expected to provide an update on the group’s operating model. many of our funeral directors have a proud heritage, serving their local communities for generations. average assets per plan are greater than the amount currently received for performing a funeral. dignity began using feefo as its primary customer review platform in spring 2016. feefo has allowed us to engage with our customers and gain true insight into their experience with our business so we can continue to enhance it further. this is why working closely with these organisations means we can continue to uphold the very best industry practices. a gold trusted service dignity funeral plans has won the feefo gold trusted service award 2018. the prestigious accolade is an independent seal of excellence that recognises businesses for delivering exceptional experiences, as rated by real customers. maintenance capital expenditure of £2.9 million has been incurred on central projects predominantly relating to it that will help the business as a whole operate more eﬃciently. these items have been adjusted for in determining underlying measures of proﬁtability as these underlying measures are those used in the day to day management of the business and allow for greater comparability across periods. our challenge as a board is to protect market share and reposition the group for growth. financial review continued 30 | dignity plc annual report & accounts 2017 dignity plc annual report & accounts 2017 | 31 financial review – outlook q&a 2018 will be a challenging year for the group but i am conﬁdent we have the ﬁnancial and management strength to meet these challenges head on. this focus on our core strengths is balanced by a more cautious approach to risk in other areas. identify risks are identified through discussion with senior management and incorporated in the risk register as appropriate. the group believes that its focus on excellent client service helps to mitigate this risk. however, the group took decisive action to reduce its funeral pricing in january 2018, which will be supported by an improved online presence. there have been no material changes, with satellites being opened and businesses acquired in appropriate areas. regulation could result in increased compliance costs for the industry as a whole or other unforeseen consequences. if this stricter test is not achieved, then the group’s ability to pay dividends would be impacted. our company’s core values spring from the simple fact of being a truly people business. dignity plc annual report & accounts 2017 | 39 the board places a high priority on attracting and retaining the right people as an integral part of our strategic objective of continuing to prioritise excellent client service which we believe will lead to organic growth. kate was the ﬁrst person to have ever received a distinction grade for all 28 assignments. each year 20,000 people complete their time with the british army, navy or royal air force and resettle into civilian life. our aim is to continue providing excellent leadership in the pursuit of safe and environmentally responsible workplaces. 96 per cent of the coﬃns manufactured by dignity are from forest stewardship council (‘fsc’) accredited timber. dignity plc annual report & accounts 2017 | 43 cdp encourages best practice in reporting and

and comprehensive explanation of what good governance means within dignity, what it means to us as the board of directors, how it is applied and how it guides our decision making. she is also senior independent director and chairman of the remuneration committee for motorpoint group plc. 48 | dignity plc annual report & accounts 2017 mike mccollum chief executive full biography on page 46 steve whittern finance director full biography on page 46 richard portman corporate services director full biography on page 46 steve wallis commercial director steve joined what is now dignity in 1996. his key areas of responsibility include group digital, pricing and proposition, marketing and external aﬀairs. andrew has progressed through a variety of roles within both the co-operative group and independent sectors. there were five independent non-executive directors who served for the period: jane ashcroft, alan mcwalter, martin pexton, david blackwood and mary mcnamara. each non-executive director is appointed for a fixed term of two years, subject to annual re-election by shareholders. this term may then be renewed by mutual consent up to a maximum of nine years in accordance with the code. jane ashcroft, david blackwood and mary mcnamara are independent of management, as defined by the code. any significant control weaknesses would be reported to the full board at their next meeting. any significant weaknesses are reported to management and the audit committee on a timely basis. these provide clear guidance on the correct or most appropriate course of action in various circumstances. • a comprehensive review and ratiﬁcation of the viability statement for dignity included in 2017 annual report. he was replaced by mary mcnamara who joined on 1 march 2017. all, committee members, apart from myself, are independent non-executive directors. given that the number of executive directors was reducing from four to three it was decided that it would not be necessary to replace alan mcwalter with a new independent non-executive director so the overall size of the board fell from nine to seven but there would still be an equal number of executive and non- executive directors. 2017 annual bonus outcome the group demonstrated good operational performance, continued excellent client survey results and made further acquisitions of established funeral businesses. this performance was achieved against the backdrop of a challenging environment which is becoming increasingly competitive in 2018 and beyond. the annual bonus in 2017 was measured against stretching earnings before interest and tax ('ebit') targets, our key short-term ﬁnancial performance indicator. the ltip award granted in 2015 was subject to performance against two equally weighted measures, relative total shareholder return (‘tsr’) and earnings per share growth (‘eps’). on behalf of the remuneration committee, i would like to thank shareholders for their ongoing support. beneﬁts include provision of a company car (or cash allowance in lieu), fuel, landline telephone and broadband at each executive director’s home residence, mobile phone, family private medical cover and a pre-arranged funeral plan for the individual or spouse. deferred shares vest after two years subject to continued employment but no further performance targets. • bonus is payable on a pro- rata basis for performance between the ﬁrst and second targets. awards normally vest after three years subject to the achievement of stretching performance conditions and continued employment. awards are subject to recovery and withholding provisions in the event of ﬁnancial misstatement or miscalculation. see note 1. following vesting, executive directors will be required to retain their net of tax vested shares for two years. the maximum annual award that can be made to an individual in any given ﬁnancial year is 150 per cent of salary. the chairman and non-executive directors shall be entitled to have reimbursed all expenses that they reasonably incur in the performance of their duties, including those expenses that have been deemed to be taxable beneﬁts by hmrc. this will be achieved by setting a speciﬁc number of shares required to be held by each executive director based on their 2016 salary and the 28 day average share price to 25 february 2016. this resulted in the following required holdings of ordinary shares. notes • minimum comprises fixed pay, which includes 2018 basic salary, the value of benefits in 2017 and a 15 per cent company pension contribution. fees for a new chairman or non-executive director will be set in line with the approved policy. service contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection at the company's registered office.

a risk that central management may override controls to intentionally misstate revenue transactions through inappropriate manual journal entries. this included analysing and selecting journals for testing which appeared unusual in nature either due to size, preparer or being manually posted. we performed our own sensitivities on the group’s forecasts and determined whether adequate headroom remained. • based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identiﬁed in the paragraphs above. our procedures involved: journal entry testing, with a focus on manual journals and journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the business; enquiries of group management, internal audit; and focused testing, as referred to in the key audit matters section above. 82 | dignity plc annual report & accounts 2017 consolidated income statement for the 52 week period ended 29 december 2017 52

other advisory services – – 0.3 0.3 external transaction costs the current period relates to external adviser fees for completed and aborted transactions, which are not deductible for tax purposes. the current period effective tax rate is impacted by prior year taxation items of £2.0 million which are not expected to recur. these items have been adjusted for in determining underlying measures of profitability as these underlying measures are those used in the day to day management of the business and allow for greater comparability across periods. accordingly, the board believes that earnings per share calculated by reference to this underlying profit after taxation is also a useful indicator of financial performance. the fair value of these interests has been identified and recognised as a separate intangible asset. for further details of the trade receivables past due and impaired refer to note 21(c). dignity plc annual report & accounts 2017 | 107 overview 01 – 03 strategic report

sale in accordance with ias 39 and has been initially measured at the fair value of consideration paid with subsequent measurement based upon a level 3 fair value estimate. these facilities have been replaced with a £50 million revolving credit facility (‘rcf’), provided by the royal bank of scotland, which is secured against certain trade and assets held by legal entities outside of the group’s securitisation structure. the remaining £5.0 million facility expires in october 2019. these facilities incur commitment fees at market rates.
