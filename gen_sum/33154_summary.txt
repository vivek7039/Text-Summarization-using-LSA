I am acutely aware that there is no room for complacency in a sector which has seen unprecedented change, bringing both opportunities and challenges. My sincere thanks to them for everything that has been done so far.” Sebastian James Group Chief Executive 16 July 2015 Cautionary statement Certain statements made in this Annual Report and Accounts are forward looking. It has also evolved bespoke customer relationship management tools which enable services such as upgrade reminders, data storage and tariff checks. This has made a number of new markets available to Dixons Carphone, including wellness, security, content and home management. The market is served by a relatively small number of global manufacturers supplying goods to local, regional, national and international electrical retailers. In addition, innovation drives new service requirements, including TV installation, data backup, computer set up and instructional Showhow teach-ins. However, increasing penetration of digital technology in the home drives faster replacement cycles as these products become less discretionary. As a result we are able to offer customers very competitive prices against our competitor set and still be more profitable. Using tablets in store, we ask customers a few simple questions to help them find the right deal. We confirmed the total figure of £80 million and that this would be achieved a year earlier than anticipated in 2016/17. Behind our end-to-end service operation we have a comprehensive infrastructure, including technical phone support, delivery, installation, repair and recycling. We are also utilising our intellectual property to assist third parties, such as Samsung and now Sprint, in connected retailing. As a Group we need to make the right choices as to how each division utilises or preserves cash, whether it be in determining ranges and stock held in store, growing mobile share with accompanying working capital utilisation or managing returns and related processes. Capital employed is based on net assets including capitalised leases, but excluding goodwill, cash, tax and the defined benefit pension obligations. Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15 Strategic report Performance review 22 Group Group pro forma Headline revenue was up 2% to £9,936 million (2013/14: £9,752 million) and up 6% on a local currency basis, with both including a 2% benefit due to an extra five weeks of trading from the Carphone Warehouse business. In May 2015, the Group launched iD, a new mobile network focused on providing users with increased contract flexibility, greater access to free data roaming and competitively priced 4G tariffs. In addition the ‘Epoq’ kitchen business has provided very encouraging results with strong revenue growth, driving market share and appliance sales. Although it has been negatively impacted by these pressures, we have a strong management team in place, which continues to innovate and develop the business. We have also focused the business model to a greater extent on franchise operations and reduced our own store portfolio. Discussions, which commenced with potential acquirers during 2014/15, are advanced and an announcement confirming details of the disposal is expected in due course. Our first combined Dixons Carphone SAYE scheme in the UK and Ireland was launched with 20% of colleagues electing to join. Dental insurance and a Health Cash Plan are also available at special corporate rates for employees who wish to participate. Our customer experience plan has identified key areas for improvement and we have invested heavily to fix these. At present, energy is derived from nuclear and oil (fossil) sources which generate a CO2 output of 42,604 tonnes per annum. In the last year, 75% of material generated by our stores now goes to recycling schemes and not into landfill. For the time being we will continue to operate charitable activities through our new CAF account Dixons Carphone Foundation. Other charitable support Dixons continued their support of Children in Need enabling colleagues across our store, service and logistics networks to get behind fundraising efforts for a nationally branded fundraising event that supports causes across the UK and local to their places of work. Consideration is currently being given to replacement for John Allan as Senior Independent Director and the Board will update shareholders once a decision has been taken. These directors are John Gildersleeve, Andrea Gisle Joosen, Tim How, Jock Lennox, Baroness Morgan of Huyton and Gerry Murphy. These systems are also refined as necessary to meet changes in the Group’s business and associated risks. He is supported by a dedicated investor relations department that, amongst other matters, organises presentations for analysts and institutional investors. The Company is committed to communication with all of its members, whether institutional investors, private or employee shareholders. Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15 Corporate Governance 45 Capital structure The Company’s only class of share is ordinary shares. No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. Where assignments are expected to generate fees of over £100,000, approval must be obtained from the Audit Committee in advance. In order to keep overall remuneration weighted towards variable pay that incentivises outperformance we are providing a modest level of benefits. A defined benefit pension plan continues in operation for Dixons’ longer serving employees, which is now closed to new participants and future accrual. • Operation Bonus payments are determined after the year end and subject to a minimum profit threshold being achieved before payment is due. Our arrangements are intentionally more leveraged than a standard UK performance share plan: no payouts would be due at a threshold level of performance and the higher payout levels would result only where significant shareholder value had been created (for example, £1.6 billion of incremental shareholder returns at the Maximum level). Recruitment table Area Feature Policy Service contract and incentive plan provisions Notice period • Up to 12 months from either side. Annual remuneration Salary • To be determined on appointment, taking into account factors including market levels, experience, internal relativities and cost. There is an obligation on directors to mitigate any loss which they may suffer if the Company terminates their service contract. The Committee may also take external legal advice, where required, to assist it in carrying out its duties.

The following directors were appointed on 6 August 2014: Sebastian James, Humphrey Singer, Katie Bickerstaffe, Graham Stapleton, Andrea Gisle Joosen, Tim How and Jock Lennox. We performed audit tests to assess whether inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The Dixons Retail plc audit report also included risks related to non-underlying items, defined benefit pension assumptions and customer support agreement revenue recognition.

consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to those companies reporting under IFRS and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. Commission includes a share of customer airtime spend, to the extent that it can be reliably measured and there are no ongoing service obligations. Once classified as held for sale, intangible assets and property, plant & equipment are no longer amortised or depreciated. Where share-based payments have external performance criteria (such as TSR targets) a Monte Carlo model is used to measure fair value. These intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and, where appropriate, provision for impairment in value or estimated loss on disposal. Software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and, where appropriate, provision for impairment in value or estimated loss on disposal. Amortisation is provided to write off the cost of assets on a straight line basis between three and eight years. Such assumptions are based on extensive historical evidence, and provision is made for the risk of potential changes in customer behaviour. Supplier funding amounts that have been recognised and not invoiced are shown within accrued income on the balance sheet. This information is predominantly based on geographical areas which are either managed separately or have similar trading characteristics such that they can be aggregated together into one segment. In forming the five year projections, management draws on past experience as a measure to forecast future performance. All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments. This has been partially offset by shares with a value of £1 million included within Dixons Retail Employee Share Trust. It is expected that any costs associated with these contingent liabilities will be incurred over the next four years. Discussions which commenced with potential acquirers during 2014/15 are advanced and an announcement confirming details of the disposal is expected in due course.

Throughout the period under review, in accordance with Group policy, no speculative use of derivatives, foreign exchange or other instruments was permitted. These exposures primarily arise from inventory purchases, with most of the Group’s exposure being to US Dollar and Euro fluctuations. Future cash flows arising from these financial instruments depend on interest rates and periods agreed at the time of rollover. The Group has designated financial instruments under IAS 39 as follows: Cash flow hedges At 2 May 2015 the Group had forward and swap foreign exchange contracts in place with a notional value of £1,487 million (2014: £nil) that were designated and effective as cash flow hedges. Investments where the Company does not have control or significant influence are treated as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value.
