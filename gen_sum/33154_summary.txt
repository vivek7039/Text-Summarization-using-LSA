i am acutely aware that there is no room for complacency in a sector which has seen unprecedented change, bringing both opportunities and challenges. my sincere thanks to them for everything that has been done so far.” sebastian james group chief executive 16 july 2015 cautionary statement certain statements made in this annual report and accounts are forward looking. elkjøp elkjop.no elgiganten elgiganten.se elgiganten.dk gigantti gigantti.fi lefdal lefdal.com phone house phonehouse.se southern europe • kotsovolos is greece’s leading specialist electrical retailer. it has also evolved bespoke customer relationship management tools which enable services such as upgrade reminders, data storage and tariff checks. we have had a strong start, with pro forma headline profit before tax rising 21% to £381 million. sir charles dunstone chairman 16 july 2015 dixons carphone plc annual report and accounts 2014/15 strategic report group chief executive’s statement 5 i am very proud to be reporting on the first year of the newly merged dixons carphone group. we are also - cautiously - encouraged by the impact on arpu from higher levels of data usage. enabled by an innovative it platform, it will target a number of specific customer segments, with a particular focus on personalising plans with flexible tariffs and introducing shared data tariffs, market-leading roaming and the re-introduction of - already very popular - 12 month contracts. a great deal has been achieved this year, but there is still much to do. this has made a number of new markets available to dixons carphone, including wellness, security, content and home management. mnos across western europe have been investing significantly in the development of their 4g network infrastructures. after several years of downward pressure on arpu, increased data usage provides an exciting opportunity for mnos. the market can also be broken down into two distinct distribution channels: ‘assisted’ and ‘unassisted’. the market is served by a relatively small number of global manufacturers supplying goods to local, regional, national and international electrical retailers. these shifts have helped us to gain market share and it underpins our view that a strong service led multi-channel operation satisfies both customer and supplier needs while delivering a sustainable business as customer shopping habits continue to evolve. in addition, innovation drives new service requirements, including tv installation, data backup, computer set up and instructional showhow teach-ins. however, increasing penetration of digital technology in the home drives faster replacement cycles as these products become less discretionary. while we do compete against general retailers, this is usually limited to certain lower price categories as these retailers do not offer the full range of products, assisted sale or the other services we are able to provide. selling connected devices requires a range of experience and processes that many retailers find impossible to emulate. cws already provides managed services to a number of businesses and is actively exploring further opportunities. the internet empowers customers with greater access to information including product knowledge and price transparency. as a result we are able to offer customers very competitive prices against our competitor set and still be more profitable. there are four distinct activities that we believe are the key strengths of our multi-channel, service-based model and which will support our competitive advantage going forward: i. work closely with suppliers to harness benefits available to our business model: suppliers want to ensure that customers not only choose their brands, but also experience the benefits of the latest products. using tablets in store, we ask customers a few simple questions to help them find the right deal. we confirmed the total figure of £80 million and that this would be achieved a year earlier than anticipated in 2016/17. behind our end-to-end service operation we have a comprehensive infrastructure, including technical phone support, delivery, installation, repair and recycling. this applies to a number of market segments, including health, security, content and home management. our objective is to provide our customers with a seamless and personalised experience where convenience, ease of navigation and simplicity are key in attracting customers to shop with us whether it is online, in-store or a combination of both. we have comprehensive customer research programmes spanning a variety of tools including exit surveys, mystery shoppers and focus groups as well as effective data gathering through, for example, our ‘happy or not’ tools launched in our elkjøp business and now introduced to curryspcworld. we now provide tailor-made development programmes and support further education qualifications for our colleagues throughout the business. store portfolio we operate a wide variety of stores to suit the local customer demographics. we are also utilising our intellectual property to assist third parties, such as samsung and now sprint, in connected retailing. each of these brands have specific target markets defined in conjunction with our customer research findings. as a group we need to make the right choices as to how each division utilises or preserves cash, whether it be in determining ranges and stock held in store, growing mobile share with accompanying working capital utilisation or managing returns and related processes. capital employed is based on net assets including capitalised leases, but excluding goodwill, cash, tax and the defined benefit pension obligations. dixons carphone plc annual report and accounts 2014/15 strategic report principal risks to achieving the group’s objectives 16 the group recognises that taking risks is an inherent part of doing business and that competitive advantage can be gained through effectively managing risk. the group’s overall risk environment is relatively unchanged since last year, notwithstanding changes to specific risks. dixons carphone plc annual report and accounts 2014/15 strategic report performance review 22 group group pro forma headline revenue was up 2% to £9,936 million (2013/14: £9,752 million) and up 6% on a local currency basis, with both including a 2% benefit due to an extra five weeks of trading from the carphone warehouse business. in may 2015, the group launched id, a new mobile network focused on providing users with increased contract flexibility, greater access to free data roaming and competitively priced 4g tariffs. in addition the ‘epoq’ kitchen business has provided very encouraging results with strong revenue growth, driving market share and appliance sales. we expect that this operation will also provide opportunities in smart home and integrated products. although it has been negatively impacted by these pressures, we have a strong management team in place, which continues to innovate and develop the business. we have also focused the business model to a greater extent on franchise operations and reduced our own store portfolio. discussions, which commenced with potential acquirers during 2014/15, are advanced and an announcement confirming details of the disposal is expected in due course. the term loan was amortised by £25 million during the period and is due to reduce by a further £50 million on 30 june 2016. these facilities mature in 2017 and we expect to complete refinancing of our facilities during 2015/16. our first combined dixons carphone saye scheme in the uk and ireland was launched with 20% of colleagues electing to join. these policies include guidance on being family friendly through to colleague dispute management, diversity and equal opportunities. this is aided by the introduction of smart working - a flexible approach to time spent in the office, designed to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness as well as creating a more fluid working environment. relaxation rooms where employees can watch tv, play pool, play video games or take time out are provided in support functions along with on-site restaurants offering a range of foods, which are reviewed regularly to ensure they offer a balanced menu. a number of products and services are also available to support employees, such as private medical insurance. dental insurance and a health cash plan are also available at special corporate rates for employees who wish to participate. our customer experience plan has identified key areas for improvement and we have invested heavily to fix these. 5. the 65,000 sq ft customer call centre in sheffield has been upgraded to led lighting throughout. dixons carphone will merge its reporting against the carbon reduction commitment (crc) energy efficiency scheme for 2015/16. at present, energy is derived from nuclear and oil (fossil) sources which generate a co2 output of 42,604 tonnes per annum. in the last year, 75% of material generated by our stores now goes to recycling schemes and not into landfill. we have allowed a wide range of re-use companies and frn charities access to all 16 of our csc depots to select white goods units they feel are reuseable resulting in over 60,000 units last year being diverted from a scrap yard for destruction to be cleaned, refurbished and reused, for example, by low income families in many different regions of the uk. dixons carphone plc annual report and accounts 2014/15 strategic report corporate responsibility 34 tablets for schools we believe the use of technology in education can inspire children with a lifelong love of learning, motivate them to know more and empower independent thinking. this account was set up in march 2015 to deliver our ambition of making lives better through technology. for the time being we will continue to operate charitable activities through our new caf account dixons carphone foundation. during 2014/15, a total of £73,000 was transacted through the dsg international foundation for children in need. other charitable support dixons continued their support of children in need enabling colleagues across our store, service and logistics networks to get behind fundraising efforts for a nationally branded fundraising event that supports causes across the uk and local to their places of work. our sheffield contact centre supported the live comic relief television appeal by taking donation calls. over 250 employees from across dixons carphone will take part, many of them trialling wearable technology for training. the spring online taster sessions created a unique way in which to show prospective customers how to use products through employee engagement and initiated an advocacy through staff, attendees, event holders and communities across the uk. this strategic report was approved by the board and signed on its behalf by: sebastian james humphrey singer group chief executive group finance director 16 july 2015 16 july 2015 dixons carphone plc annual report and accounts 2014/15 corporate governance board of directors 36 sir charles dunstone – chairman sir charles dunstone is the chairman of dixons carphone and the nominations committee. during this time he was responsible for new business development, strategic initiatives and investor relations. prior to joining the dixons group, he was finance director of coca cola enterprises (uk) ltd and prior to that also held a number of finance roles at coca cola enterprises (uk) ltd and cadbury schweppes plc. he has retained his responsibilities as chief executive officer of uk & ireland for carphone warehouse. john is also non-executive deputy chairman and senior independent director of spire healthcare group plc. consideration is currently being given to replacement for john allan as senior independent director and the board will update shareholders once a decision has been taken. these directors are john gildersleeve, andrea gisle joosen, tim how, jock lennox, baroness morgan of huyton and gerry murphy. it is noted that john gildersleeve was a non-executive director of old carphone warehouse for more than nine years but the board does not believe this affects his independence having given detailed consideration to his performance and the extent to which he has shown himself to be independent of management in thought and action during the period under review. (2) john allwood was the senior independent director until his resignation when john allan took on this role until his resignation on 17 february 2015. dixons carphone plc annual report and accounts 2014/15 corporate governance 41 board governance matters the chairman is responsible for ensuring that all directors are properly briefed on issues arising at board meetings and that they have full and timely access to relevant information. each risk identified is ranked according to a score based on the likelihood of an event occurring and its impact on the business should it occur due to either failure or absence of mitigating controls. these systems are also refined as necessary to meet changes in the group’s business and associated risks. he is supported by a dedicated investor relations department that, amongst other matters, organises presentations for analysts and institutional investors. no person has any special rights of control over the company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. as part of the general committee procedures managerial judgement was assessed and no major issues noted. where assignments are expected to generate fees of over £100,000, approval must be obtained from the audit committee in advance. no further need for appointments were identified other than an appointment of a senior independent director. in order to keep overall remuneration weighted towards variable pay that incentivises outperformance we are providing a modest level of benefits. we are therefore very pleased this year to have been able to launch a combined dixons carphone plc sharesave plan for all uk and ireland employees, which has enjoyed a take-up rate of approximately 20% of the combined uk and ireland workforce. a defined benefit pension plan continues in operation for dixons’ longer serving employees, which is now closed to new participants and future accrual. • operation bonus payments are determined after the year end and subject to a minimum profit threshold being achieved before payment is due. • operation discretionary awards of either nil-priced or market priced options are granted over dixons carphone plc shares. • maximum opportunity grants under the dixons carphone share option plan are subject to overall dilution limits. our arrangements are intentionally more leveraged than a standard uk performance share plan: no payouts would be due at a threshold level of performance and the higher payout levels would result only where significant shareholder value had been created (for example, £1.6 billion of incremental shareholder returns at the maximum level). these are illustrative amounts and the actual outcomes may differ depending on share price growth. for sebastian james, humphrey singer and katie bickerstaffe the share plan has been annualised over four years. remuneration policy for the wider workforce dixons carphone employs a large number of people across different countries. recruitment table area feature policy service contract and incentive plan provisions notice period • up to 12 months from either side. annual remuneration salary • to be determined on appointment, taking into account factors including market levels, experience, internal relativities and cost. there is an obligation on directors to mitigate any loss which they may suffer if the company terminates their service contract. further details on current external directorships and fees can be found in the annual remuneration report. the committee may also take external legal advice, where required, to assist it in carrying out its duties. that is, the measures have been selected to reflect our key strategic objectives and are aligned to our group balanced scorecard, with a minimum profit gate that must be achieved before any bonus is paid out. dixons carphone plc annual report and accounts 2014/15 corporate governance 67 the performance metrics and their weightings for 2015/16 are shown in the

those parts of the companies act 2006 applicable to those companies reporting under ifrs and article 4 of the ias regulation. a reconciliation of headline profit and losses to total profits and losses is shown in note 2. items excluded from headline results can evolve from one financial year to the next depending on the nature of exceptional items or one-off type activities described above and the exclusion of pension interest is such an item applicable to the 13 months ended 2 may 2015. headline performance measures and non- headline performance measures may not be directly comparable with other similarly titled measures or ‘adjusted’ revenue or profit measures used by other companies. commission includes a share of customer airtime spend, to the extent that it can be reliably measured and there are no ongoing service obligations. e) other income, including non-operating income other income, which is incidental to the group’s principal activities of selling goods and services and accordingly is not recorded as part of revenue, is recognised when the group dixons carphone plc annual report and accounts 2014/15 financial statements 89 obtains the right to consideration by performance of its contractual obligations. once classified as held for sale, intangible assets and property, plant & equipment are no longer amortised or depreciated. where share-based payments have external performance criteria (such as tsr targets) a monte carlo model is used to measure fair value. no provision is made for tax which would have been payable on the distribution of retained profits of overseas subsidiaries or associated undertakings where it has been determined that these profits will not be distributed in the foreseeable future. these intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and, where appropriate, provision for impairment in value or estimated loss on disposal. internally generated software is recognised as an intangible asset only if it can be separately identified, it is probable that the asset will generate future economic benefits which exceed one year, and the development cost can be measured reliably. software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and, where appropriate, provision for impairment in value or estimated loss on disposal. amortisation is provided to write off the cost of assets on a straight line basis between three and eight years. rates applied to different classes of property, plant & equipment are as follows: land and buildings 1 ⅔% – 4% per annum fixtures, fittings and equipment 10 – 33 ⅓% per annum assets capitalised as finance leases are depreciated over the term of the lease. cost incorporates any attributable discounts and bonuses received from suppliers in respect of that inventory. other other provisions relate mainly to warranties provided in relation to business disposals and provisions in respect of the expected costs of insurance claims, contingent liabilities recognised through business combinations and costs associated with onerous contracts. such assumptions are based on extensive historical evidence, and provision is made for the risk of potential changes in customer behaviour. supplier funding amounts that have been recognised and not invoiced are shown within accrued income on the balance sheet. however, the future costs assumed are inevitably only estimates, which may differ from those ultimately incurred. • ifrs 15 'revenue from contracts with customers' provides guidance on the recognition, timing and measurement of revenue. this information is predominantly based on geographical areas which are either managed separately or have similar trading characteristics such that they can be aggregated together into one segment.

instruments financial instruments that are measured at fair value in the financial statements require disclosure of fair value measurements by level based on the following fair value measurement hierarchy: • level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; • level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices); and • level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs). throughout the period under review, in accordance with group policy, no speculative use of derivatives, foreign exchange or other instruments was permitted. these exposures primarily arise from inventory purchases, with most of the group’s exposure being to us dollar and euro fluctuations. future cash flows arising from these financial instruments depend on interest rates and periods agreed at the time of rollover. within one year £million in more than one year but not more than five years £million in more than five years £million total £million 2 may

related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and accordingly are not disclosed. all transactions entered into with related parties were completed on an arm’s length basis. b) investments investments held in subsidiaries and joint ventures are recognised at cost, being the fair value of consideration, acquisition charges associated with the investment and capital contributions by way of share-based payments, less any provision for permanent diminution in value. investments where the company does not have control or significant influence are treated as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value. fair value is measured by use of a binomial model for share-based payments with internal performance criteria (such as eps targets) and a monte carlo model for those with external performance criteria (such as tsr targets). c6 creditors: amounts falling due within one year 2 may 2015 £million 29 march 2014 £million amounts owed to group undertakings 119 21 other
