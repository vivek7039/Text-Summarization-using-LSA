therapy programmes. vectura’s breadth of capabilities enable products utilising engineered particles, dry powders, aqueous formulations for nebulisation, and pressurised propellant-based solutions or suspensions delivered via inhalers developed internally by our device design team. this reduction in treatment time, along with an improved cleaning regime, saves a typical patient over one hour per day. vectura’s simple and easy to use proprietary hand-held fox ® nebuliser enhances the delivery of this known product, significantly reducing treatment times for patients. at our capital markets day in june 2017, the management team presented a comprehensive overview of vectura’s differentiated formulation and device development capabilities. the review determined that these capabilities are best deployed across relatively lower-risk, higher-value development opportunities, particularly in well-known on-market medicines. a pipeline progress update will be provided in q3 2018. read more about

development process with multiple variables and challenges given the inherent complexity associated with developing inhaled generics, we believe that there are only a handful of companies which have the necessary capabilities to successfully develop these programmes. however, one issue remained outstanding regarding the clinical endpoint (cep) study and hikma, supported by vectura, progressed a dispute resolution process. both these programmes use our akit a ® smart nebuliser, improving the delivery of budesonide to achieve differentiated outcomes for asthma patients. we monitor our employee
