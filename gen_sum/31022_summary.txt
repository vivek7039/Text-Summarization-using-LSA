This application of Vectura’s FOX ® smart nebuliser technology, from the Activaero acquisition, has enabled an almost one-hour reduction in the total daily treatment time for patients who are receiving treatment (iloprost) up to six times a day, a very meaningful improvement in patient quality of life. Outlook The Board sees Vectura as being a highly competitive business with strong underlying revenues from our in-market products. CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT Delivering sustainable growth with risk-balanced investment It has been an important year of progress for Vectura. Over time, smaller niche disease areas will increasingly become an important revenue source and it is in this market segment that we would look to establish a successful specialist commercial product portfolio. Our core values PA TIENT FOCUS INNOVA TION COLLABORA TION ACHIEVEMENT Read more on pages 64 to 69 11 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Vectura Group plc STRATEGIC REPORT Future self-commercialisation of our specialist assets remains an option open to us but only as part of a wider commercial portfolio. Typically, our formulation licensing expertise is seen in the revenues from novel patented molecules for inhaled delivery including Novartis’ Ultibro ® Breezhaler ® and GSK’s Ellipta ® portfolio. Existing early-stage novel programmes will be out-licensed where the cost, risk and likely returns do not meet our newly defined investment criteria. Operational highlights In-market portfolio Our key inhaled growth drivers, flutiform ® and Ultibro ® Breezhaler ® , have continued to perform strongly in market. Following the initial rapid launch of Stiolto, its market share is now stabilising with Ultibro ® Breezhaler ® maintain its market-leading position and strong trajectory growth supported changes to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) global COPD management strategy and a robust clinical data set. In addition to Breelib TM we have made very good progress with our two leading AKITA ® budesonide clinical programmes. Vectura’s pipeline asset VR315 (US) is one of only three known AB-rated generic Advair ® applications that has been submitted to the FDA for review. With continued focus on cost management, it is expected that generics will take an increasingly larger share of global medicine spend, increasing from 27% in 2012 to 36% by 2017 16 . Smaller niche disease areas will increasingly become an important revenue source where we aim to establish a successful specialist commercial portfolio for new Vectura-enhanced therapy programmes. Vectura’s breadth of capabilities enable products utilising engineered particles, dry powders, aqueous formulations for nebulisation, and pressurised propellant-based solutions or suspensions delivered via inhalers developed internally by our device design team. STRATEGIC REPORT Spotlighting our capabilities CASE STUDY: Breelib ™ meets iloprost — a modern nebuliser for an established drug What is Breelib™? This reduction in treatment time, along with an improved cleaning regime, saves a typical patient over one hour per day. Vectura’s simple and easy to use proprietary hand-held FOX ® nebuliser enhances the delivery of this known product, significantly reducing treatment times for patients. At our Capital Markets Day in June 2017, the management team presented a comprehensive overview of Vectura’s differentiated formulation and device development capabilities. The review determined that these capabilities are best deployed across relatively lower-risk, higher-value development opportunities, particularly in well-known on-market medicines. By delivering against these activities during 2018, we will free up capacity to support future new development programmes and achieve cost savings through a lower internal programme expenditure. Kyorin has estimated that there are 2.6m children between the ages of five and 14 who suffer from asthma in Japan. 8 Chen W, Thomas J, Sadatsafavi M. Risk of cardiovascular comorbidity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis. US – launched 2014) Anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator (ICS/LABA) delivered using Vectura’s proprietary Gyrohaler ® DPI device is a cost-effective alternative to Seretide ® and/or other ICS/LABA treatments. Steadily rising healthcare costs have also led to increased scrutiny on drug pricing by governments, the media and consumers. 39 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Vectura Group plc STRATEGIC REPORT A complex development process with multiple variables and challenges Given the inherent complexity associated with developing inhaled generics, we believe that there are only a handful of companies which have the necessary capabilities to successfully develop these programmes. However, one issue remained outstanding regarding the Clinical Endpoint (CEP) study and Hikma, supported by Vectura, progressed a dispute resolution process. Both these programmes use our AKIT A ® smart nebuliser, improving the delivery of budesonide to achieve differentiated outcomes for asthma patients. We monitor our employee engagement to ensure that adverse trends or issues can be addressed in a timely manner. 84% of employees participated in the survey, which was administered by an independent third party enabling us to compare our results with external benchmarks. As such the Group believes these products are well placed to capture value in an attractive niche market where relatively few competitors have relevant assets. Our multiple locations provide flexibility for potential employees and an ability to target talent pools across a wide geography. This period therefore provides the Board with an appropriate degree of confidence while still providing a suitable longer-term outlook. Novartis has reported that this annual growth rate was impacted by short-term normalisation of stocking effects in certain territories. Intangible assets recognised from the Skyepharma and Activaero combinations will continue to be amortised over their remaining useful lives. The Group made scheduled corporation tax payments relating to prior years for its US and Swiss operations of £2.9m (nine-months ended 31 December 2016: £2.6m). These payments were almost offset by cash inflows from research and development tax credits received of £2.1m (nine-months ended 31 December 2016: £2.4m).

Frank Condella Non-Executive Vice Chairman N 73 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Vectura Group plc GOVERNANCE Appointment to the Board Dr Susan Foden joined the Vectura Board in January 2007. In addition, there was a two-day Board meeting to focus on strategic development, looking at the Group’s longer-term horizon. Although no Executive Director held an external non-executive position, this would be considered as part of their future development. It is anticipated that, subject to a suitable handover period, Frank Condella will step down from the Board in due course.

No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. There is a risk that the carrying amount of investments may become impaired if forecast financial performance or other events, such as regulatory approvals, are not in line with expectations. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less any further costs expected to complete the sale of goods. In instances where the financial assets meets neither category, they are measured at fair value through profit and loss (“FVTPL”). A contract is considered complete once all performance obligations relevant to the receipt of future revenues have been satisfied. It is not expected that IFRS 15 will result in a material impact on underlying core revenue streams (royalties, product supply and share of net sales). It is therefore expected that a significantly higher proportion of signing milestones will be recognised immediately on entering into new collaborative arrangements. Details relating to the discounted cash flow models used in the impairment tests of the cash-generating units are as follows: Valuation basis Fair value less cost of disposal Key assumptions Time to develop and launch pipeline products Net sales forecasts and related royalty inflows Milestones for pipeline products Profit margins for product supply Terminal growth rate Discount rate Taxation rate Determination of assumptions Net sales forecasts are determined from partner forecasts and external market data. These intangible assets are being amortised over a period of between two and seven years with reference to average applicable patent lives in the Group’s main territories. As an acquired programme from the Skyepharma merger, VR2076 had a book value of £8.7m, which accordingly has been fully impaired.

Any vested shares granted to the main Board member and Executive Leadership Team must be held for two years after vesting. These awards vest in full provided that an 18-month or 36-month service condition from their date of grant on 22 September 2016 and personal performance targets are met. Should any challenge from the relevant tax authority arise, it is possible that penalties (between 0–40% of underpaid taxation) could be levied.
