we aim to transform the lives of airways disease patients by enhancing the delivery and performance of inhaled products and through the development of high-quality generic alternatives to branded therapies. 3 underlying revenues exclude the impact of licensing milestones and development services revenues which can vary materially from period to period and excludes material royalties that are not recurring as a result of patent expiry or legal dispute. adjusted ebitda 2 of £25.8m is underpinned by key products flutiform ® , ultibro ® breezhaler ® and seebri ® breezhaler ® , which together delivered gross margin of £41.1m, up 18.8% on an underlying full year comparative basis, with flutiform ® supply chain gross margin up 6.2 percentage points to 37.6%. this application of vectura’s fox ® smart nebuliser technology, from the activaero acquisition, has enabled an almost one-hour reduction in the total daily treatment time for patients who are receiving treatment (iloprost) up to six times a day, a very meaningful improvement in patient quality of life. through a robust internal framework of systems and controls, we strive to maintain the highest standards. outlook the board sees vectura as being a highly competitive business with strong underlying revenues from our in-market products. i look forward with optimism as we work towards successful outcomes from developing our refocused pipeline and believe the group is increasingly well positioned to achieve its ambition of becoming the industry-leading inhaled drug-device development specialist, delivering significant value for our shareholders. chief executive’s statement delivering sustainable growth with risk-balanced investment it has been an important year of progress for vectura. our current revenues result primarily from partnered sales in the largest respiratory disease segments of asthma and copd. over time, smaller niche disease areas will increasingly become an important revenue source and it is in this market segment that we would look to establish a successful specialist commercial product portfolio. our core values pa tient focus innova tion collabora tion achievement read more on pages 64 to 69 11 annual report and accounts 2017 vectura group plc strategic report future self-commercialisation of our specialist assets remains an option open to us but only as part of a wider commercial portfolio. typically, our formulation licensing expertise is seen in the revenues from novel patented molecules for inhaled delivery including novartis’ ultibro ® breezhaler ® and gsk’s ellipta ® portfolio. proprietary device licensing is a relatively small part of the business, again typically for novel patented molecules. investment priority is being given to projects where vectura has the highest probability of value creation with known medicines, either as partnered generics or as medicines with enhanced delivery mechanisms, using vectura’s advanced proprietary devices. existing early-stage novel programmes will be out-licensed where the cost, risk and likely returns do not meet our newly defined investment criteria. operational highlights in-market portfolio our key inhaled growth drivers, flutiform ® and ultibro ® breezhaler ® , have continued to perform strongly in market. following the initial rapid launch of stiolto, its market share is now stabilising with ultibro ®

and a robust clinical data set. in addition to breelib tm we have made very good progress with our two leading akita ® budesonide clinical programmes. alongside these changing demographics, the number of people who can access healthcare continues to increase. generic erosion is expected to have the most impact in ics, ics/ laba and lama classes 7 . vectura’s pipeline asset vr315 (us) is one of only three known ab-rated generic advair ® applications that has been submitted to the fda for review. with continued focus on cost management, it is expected that generics will take an increasingly larger share of global medicine spend, increasing from 27% in 2012 to 36% by 2017 16 . smaller niche disease areas will increasingly become an important revenue source where we aim to establish a successful specialist commercial portfolio for new vectura-enhanced therapy programmes. vectura’s breadth of capabilities enable products utilising engineered particles, dry powders, aqueous formulations for nebulisation, and pressurised propellant-based solutions or suspensions delivered via inhalers developed internally by our device design team. we have more than 140 expert pharmaceutical scientists and device engineers focused on the development of inhaled products. this includes inhaled reformulations of medicines normally delivered by the oral or injectable route, including biologics. our wide range of delivery devices also allows us to easily combine different molecules together in combination products. strategic report spotlighting our capabilities case study: breelib ™ meets iloprost — a modern nebuliser for an established drug what is breelib™? this reduction in treatment time, along with an improved cleaning regime, saves a typical patient over one hour per day. faster delivery and an improved cleaning regime save the typical patient over one hour a day. breelib™ is an alternative delivery mechanism for bayer’s ventavis ® (iloprost) to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah)

along with our co-collaborator ucb, we will also seek to partner vr942, a dry powder inhaled biologic that successfully completed phase i during 2017. in january 2018, we confirmed that our partner mundipharma had informed us of its decision to stop the development of the pmdi triple therapy for asthma and copd (vr2076), which was in an early formulation phase. given the early stage of this asset, we do not expect this change to have a material impact on the group’s revenues in 2018. stopping earl y-stage novel investment stopping vectura investment in early-stage novel molecule clinical

inhaled maintenance classes data suggests c.$23bn in 2017 us inhalants market estimated to be worth refocused r&d investment and pipeline 1 evaluate pharma 2017. 39 annual report and accounts 2017 vectura group plc strategic report a complex development process with multiple variables and challenges given the inherent complexity associated with developing inhaled generics, we believe that there are only a handful of companies which have the necessary capabilities to successfully develop these programmes. the approval of a generic is litigious, particularly for inhaled therapies where multiple overlapping patents are typical. however, one issue remained outstanding regarding the clinical endpoint (cep) study and hikma, supported by vectura, progressed a dispute resolution process. significant patient need for accessible lower priced medicines remains and, in 2017, us sales of advair ® were $2.1bn 1 . this remains a significant market opportunity and we do not believe that there will be a large number of new entrants into this space; therefore, those who can successfully cross the regulatory line stand to win significant and valuable future market share. the strategic case for investment in vectura enhanced therapies • ability to target niche patient population and speciality disease areas with high unmet medical needs • low development risk associated with proof of enhanced delivery for molecules with a known safety profile • strong rationale of an improved efficacy profile with enhanced and targeted pulmonary delivery • simpler development programmes with lower development costs than those involving novel chemical entities or mass market inhaled generics • opportunity to partner and achieve attractive upfront milestones and royalties and/or to build out portfolio of specialist assets for potential future self-commercialisation • focus on areas that are less competitive yet have the potential for premium prices our akita ® jet nebuliser incorporates our proprietary flow and volume regulated inhalation technology (favorite tm ) inhalation technology. both these programmes use our akit a ® smart nebuliser, improving the delivery of budesonide to achieve differentiated outcomes for asthma patients. patients whose asthma is uncontrolled while on short-term reliever therapies commence a low dose of inhaled corticosteroids (treatment step 2), with the dose of inhaled corticosteroids increasing in a stepwise fashion until their asthma symptoms are controlled. the vr647 (us) product uses a smart nebuliser device, which is specifically optimised for use with children. recent phase i data in adults has demonstrated the potential of vr647 to reduce treatment time. these promising patient benefits offer the opportunity to capture a sizable market share at brand-level prices. availability of sufficient liquidity is important in funding the vectura’s strategy and r&d investment. each year we set ourselves stringent targets relating to completion of key milestones across our development pipeline. we monitor our employee engagement to ensure that adverse trends or issues can be addressed in a timely manner. 84% of employees participated in the survey, which was administered by an independent third party enabling us to compare our results with external benchmarks. it is recognised, however, that no risk management process can provide absolute assurance against loss. as such the group believes these products are well placed to capture value in an attractive niche market where relatively few competitors have relevant assets. vectura has dedicated, experienced personnel responsible for marketing assets to, and negotiating with, potential partners. • supply chain disruption involving single point of failure for which vectura has high dependency and limited resilience. the agreement continues to 2020 and will be automatically renewed biannually unless terminated by either party within 24 months’ notice. vectura has strong working relationships with its suppliers; we have established due diligence processes to ensure that our stringent quality standards are maintained and we have put in place appropriate systems that will provide an early warning of potential issues. typically, for collaborations, a joint steering committee (jsc) is established involving both vectura and partner personnel. this provides vectura with a mechanism to ensure that any joint project activity is managed appropriately. even if products are approved, they may still face subsequent difficulties resulting in financial loss and reputational damage. our business strategy includes investment in generic products which support government initiatives to reduce cost. pipeline failures or delays could materially impact the future revenues, profitability and prospects of vectura. operational excellence initiatives within the r&d function have been established to increase productive capacity. change since last report risk decreasing as a result of vectura’s revised investment strategy which seeks to reduce overall pipeline delivery risk with increased focus on enhanced delivery of existing medicines and extending our inhaled generics portfolio. vectura relies upon a number of key qualified management, scientific, technical, marketing and support personnel. our multiple locations provide flexibility for potential employees and an ability to target talent pools across a wide geography. this period therefore provides the board with an appropriate degree of confidence while still providing a suitable longer-term outlook. in making their assessment, the directors have undertaken a sensitivity analysis of its forecast cash flows and liquidity. underlying financial information is calculated using the 2017 reported results and proforma 2016 twelve-month financial information, excluding certain non-underlying items: (i) revenue from non-recurring sources comprising royalties and share of sales which have discontinued in either period (for example, due to patent expiry or legal dispute), milestones and development services summary reported revenue of £148.0m, in line with expectations; underlying revenues grew 4.0% driven by the group’s key inhaled products. novartis has reported that this annual growth rate was impacted by short-term normalisation of stocking effects in certain territories. in the future, us sales will generate a further contribution to vectura’s royalty base and underlying revenues. total in-market net sales of flutiform ® were €206.2m in 2017, 11.8% higher than 2016 on a constant currency basis 2 . intangible assets recognised from the skyepharma and activaero combinations will continue to be amortised over their remaining useful lives. it

other distribution. no person has any special rights of control over the company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. there is a risk that the carrying amount of the inhaled in- market assets, smart nebuliser technology and non-inhaled in-market assets may become impaired if financial performance or other events, such as regulatory approvals, are not in line with initial expectations. the group’s estimated future cash flows for each asset are used to support their recoverability. there is a risk that the carrying amount of investments may become impaired if forecast financial performance or other events, such as regulatory approvals, are not in line with expectations. based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the other information. irregularities – ability to detect we identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our sector experience, through discussion with the directors and other management (as required by auditing standards). these consolidated financial statements also comply with ifrs as issued by the international accounting standards board. exceptional items are presented whenever significant expenses are incurred or income is received as a result of events considered to be outside the normal course of business, where the unusual nature and expected infrequency merits separate presentation to assist comparisons with previous periods. application of ias 19 involves estimates about uncertain future events based on independent actuarial valuation reports. revenues are recognised when the group’s obligations related to the revenues have been discharged and their collection is reasonably assured as follows: 2.3.1 royalty income royalty income is recognised on an accruals basis and represents income earned as a percentage of partner product sales in accordance with the terms of each agreement, net of amounts payable to other licensees. uel assumptions do not exceed eight years and amortisation is applied on a straight-line basis. the carrying values of all other non-current assets are reviewed for impairment, either on a standalone basis or as part of a larger cash-generating unit, when there is an indication that the assets might be impaired. net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less any further costs expected to complete the sale of goods. in instances where the financial assets meets neither category, they are measured at fair value through profit and loss (“fvtpl”). it is not expected that ifrs 15 will result in a material impact on underlying core revenue streams (royalties, product supply and share of net sales). it is therefore expected that a significantly higher proportion of signing milestones will be recognised immediately on entering into new collaborative arrangements. however, it is not possible to assess how this new guidance

have global large pharmaceutical partners, operations and/or customers in each other’s territory, share access to short-term funding through the revolving credit facility (“rcf”), it is considered that the same discount rate should be applied to each cgu. these intangible assets are being amortised over a period of between two and seven years with reference to average applicable patent lives in the group’s main territories. as an acquired programme from the skyepharma merger, vr2076 had a book value of £8.7m, which accordingly has been fully impaired. 136 vectura group plc annual report and

reaching market from 74% to 60% would not trigger any impairment. board authorisation is required for all significant agreements that may affect the group risk structure. a 10% weakening would have an equal but opposite effect on loss before taxation and other comprehensive income. any vested shares granted to the main board member and executive leadership team must be held for two years after

they were disposed of for nil consideration, and as these entities only contained intercompany positions, thereby already fully eliminated out upon consolidation, there was no impact on the group’s results. unless otherwise stated the share capital disclosed comprises ordinary shares which are indirectly held by vectura group plc. as a result of these factors, prospective investors are cautioned not to rely on any forward-looking statements.
