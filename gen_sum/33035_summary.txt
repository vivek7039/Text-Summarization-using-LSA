A separate annual review and summary ﬁnancial statement for the year ended 31 March 2003 has been issued to all shareholders. We said 12 months ago that, in a turbulent market, your company had taken the hard decisions and necessary actions early. Sir Christopher Bland Chairman 21 May 2003 Key events and achievements June 2002 Launch of Openzone, BT’s public wireless LAN hotspot service September 2002 The UK’s most intensive TV campaign stimulates demand for broadband November 2002 BT wins e1 billion contract to manage and develop Unilever’s global communications infrastructure January 2003 Sale of stake in Cegetel for £2.6 billion April 2003 BT announces that it has connected more than 800,000 broadband customers Chief Executive’s statement Ben Verwaayen, Chief Executive, explains that BT will create value for shareholders by its passion for customer service, its focus on proﬁtable growth and its commitment to broadband. By concentrating on these three priorities we can continue to reward shareholders, drive down debt and invest in the business – where it matters. It sparks off tremendous demand and is growing at a rapid rate – connections having increased almost fourfold in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. In this network, we are creating a new engine for growth; simultaneously offering lower operating costs and higher performance. Although in most areas customer satisfaction is well ahead of our competitors, we will strive to make further signiﬁcant improvements. Demerger of mmO 2 On 19 November 2001, we completed the demerger of mmO 2 , comprising what were BT’s wholly-owned mobile assets in Europe: O 2 UK (formerly known as BT Cellnet), O 2 Communications (Ireland) (formerly known as Esat Digifone), Telfort Mobiel, Viag Interkom, Manx Telecom and Genie. We retained direct ownership of approximately 220 properties – including certain telephone exchanges, computer centres and high radio towers – totalling some 800,000 square metres. & The deregulation of inbound 0800 numbers means that we can offer bespoke pricing to our largest call centre customers. & CRM developments included a strategic alliance with Eckoh Technologies, to provide speech recognition technology and the ﬁrst ‘‘pay as you go’’ contact centre service. & By March 2003, we were converting business customers to broadband at the rate of one line every minute (based on a 40 hour working week). Against this background, BT Openworld’s strategy is to create a proﬁtable business and drive the growing broadband market. BT Openworld’s strategy is to increase its proﬁt from this area, while simultaneously migrating narrowband customers onto broadband access services. & During the ﬁnancial year, we embarked on a programme to transform and expand our online relationships with customers. Under this scheme, people in areas where the local exchange has not been upgraded for broadband ADSL can register their interest via a service provider. In April 2003, BT Wholesale announced that it would be proceeding with the full implementation of Exchange Activate from July 2003. 21st century network At the heart of BT Wholesale’s strategic intent to be the UK’s number one in broadband and data is our commitment to create a world-leading, commercially- focused, market-driven UK network, which fulﬁls customer requirements today and anticipates their future needs. Efﬁciency BT Wholesale’s cost base strategy includes improved processes, better inventory control, and a relentless focus on productivity. & In April 2003, we signed a three-year contract with high street bank HBOS plc to manage its voice and data services. NVP Brightstar, which began operations in April 2003, has the exclusive rights to create new, start-up businesses with BT Exact, using our extensive and developing intellectual property portfolio. One example of this is the My Customer programme, targeted at 50,000 people in BT Retail, to reinforce their engagement skills with customers. Under the Licence, we must allow other licensed operators to interconnect with our telecommunications systems on cost-oriented, transparent and non- discriminatory terms. We must publish audited ﬁnancial statements for the regulated ‘‘businesses’’ and ‘‘activities’’, in order to support the linkage of costs with interconnect prices and with a view to providing demonstrable evidence that we are neither behaving in a discriminatory fashion nor unfairly subsidising our activities. Individual licences will be replaced by a general authorisation applying automatically to all providers of electronic communications networks and services. A new network charge control period began on 1 October 2001 and will last for four years from that date. Some additional obligations are proposed, such as guidelines that refer to a minimum data rate of 28.8 kbit/s which will have adverse cost implications for BT if implemented. The company has concluded that it is not appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such potential claim. We also employ a number of CSR experts who investigate long-term societal trends, identify potential issues that might affect the business and support BT’s commercial activities. However, we have identiﬁed the issue of supply chain working conditions as posing a potential risk to our reputation. By 31 March 2003, 16 key suppliers (79% of those targeted) had signed an agreement with BT giving their written support concerning ethical trading. In addition, our mm215 Videophone has improved communications for people who rely on non-verbal communication, such as British Sign Language. The focus of our community programmes is on big issues where better communication can make a real difference to society. For example, more than 8,300 schools and around two million young people engagements with the BT Education Programme – a drama-based campaign helping children to improve their communication skills – have taken place. We are working with ChildLine on a major new campaign to help ensure that all young people can be heard. In total, these effects reduced group operating proﬁts by over £400 million, although this was compensated for at the proﬁt before tax level by a corresponding improvement in our share of the operating proﬁts of associates and joint ventures and net interest payable. External turnover is derived from providing wholesale products and solutions to other operators interconnecting with BT’s UK ﬁxed network, including mmO 2 since the demerger. In the 2002 ﬁnancial year BT Global Services’ turnover was £4,472 million representing an increase of 29% driven mainly by Solutions, European operations and UK IP revenues. BT completed the sale of its 18% interest in Airtel, a major Spanish wireless operator, to Vodafone for £1,084 million on 29 June 2001. We also received the second tranche of BSkyB shares with a similar value in November 2002, and they were sold at that time. The 2002 ﬁnancial year included Financial review 40 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 gains on disposals from discontinued activities of £4,368 million. BT remains committed to a progressive dividend policy, reﬂecting growth in earnings per share and an improving balance sheet. The group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with UK Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No. Regulation and prices BT has been operating under a revised retail price control from 1 August 2002, under which a cap of RPI minus RPI (therefore price cannot increase) applies to the services used by the lowest 80% of BT’s residential customers by bill size. Environment When removing old analogue exchange equipment from buildings, BT recycles the metal content and takes special care to properly dispose of any hazardous materials. He joined Lucent in September 1997 as executive vice president international and became chief operating ofﬁcer the following month. Prior to his retirement in May 2001, Clayton Brendish was executive Deputy Chairman of CMG having joined the Board when it acquired Admiral. A conﬁdential helpline and e-mail facility are also available to employees who have questions about the application of these principles. As a result, it covers activities which form part of normal relationships between BT and the political machinery. The pension schemes’ funds can only be used in accordance with their respective rules and for no other purpose. Further details of their appointment arrangements are set out on page 53 in the section dealing with corporate governance issues.

The entitlement shown above is after taking account of this increase, which was allowed for in last year’s accounts. Turnover from classiﬁed directories, mainly comprising advertising revenue, is recognised in the group proﬁt and loss account upon completion of delivery. Goodwill is amortised on a straight line basis from the time of acquisition over its useful economic life. h On 5 January 2000, BT and AT&T formed their global venture named Concert for the two companies’ trans-border communications activities. d In connection with outstanding share options at the date of demerger, 57 million British Telecommunications plc ordinary shares were issued on 14 November 2001 to a special purpose trust.
