the results from continuing activities before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items. we said 12 months ago that, in a turbulent market, your company had taken the hard decisions and necessary actions early. this compares to £1 billion at the last formal valuation in 1999. bt has agreed it will make good this deﬁcit with additional annual payments of £232 million, compared to the £200 million additional annual payments that bt has been making. sir christopher bland chairman 21 may 2003 key events and achievements june 2002 launch of openzone, bt’s public wireless lan hotspot service september 2002 the uk’s most intensive tv campaign stimulates demand for broadband november 2002 bt wins e1 billion contract to manage and develop unilever’s global communications infrastructure january 2003 sale of stake in cegetel for £2.6 billion april 2003 bt announces that it has connected more than 800,000 broadband customers chief executive’s statement ben verwaayen, chief executive, explains that bt will create value for shareholders by its passion for customer service, its focus on proﬁtable growth and its commitment to broadband. by concentrating on these three priorities we can continue to reward shareholders, drive down debt and invest in the business – where it matters. this means getting ever closer to customers, understanding their lifestyles and businesses, establishing long-term relationships with them. for example: & consumers and businesses are now more satisﬁed with the way we provide and repair their services, as shown by our satisfaction surveys & packages such as bt together, which has ten million residential customers, have been a major success story. it sparks off tremendous demand and is growing at a rapid rate – connections having increased almost fourfold in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. in this network, we are creating a new engine for growth; simultaneously offering lower operating costs and higher performance. all areas of the business improved satisfaction levels, with particularly signiﬁcant improvement among our international and wholesale customers. although in most areas customer satisfaction is well ahead of our competitors, we will strive to make further signiﬁcant improvements. a programme has been put in place that focuses on key areas of customer dissatisfaction. as at 16 may 2003, we had 936,000 adsl (asymmetric digital subscriber line) connections and are on track to meet our target of one million connections by summer 2003. the speed at which this is happening is generating economies of scale that will help us continue to reduce costs and progress beyond the one million ﬁgure. demerger of mmo 2 on 19 november 2001, we completed the demerger of mmo 2 , comprising what were bt’s wholly-owned mobile assets in europe: o 2 uk (formerly known as bt cellnet), o 2 communications (ireland) (formerly known as esat digifone), telfort mobiel, viag interkom, manx telecom and genie. under these arrangements, telereal is responsible for providing accommodation and estate management services to bt. we retained direct ownership of approximately 220 properties – including certain telephone exchanges, computer centres and high radio towers – totalling some 800,000 square metres. as a result of the unwind, we have largely taken back into our ownership those parts of concert originally contributed by us to the joint venture, while at&t has taken back into its ownership those parts it originally contributed. as a result, bt no longer has any obligations in relation to at&t canada. we remain committed to retaining payphones in locations, such as rural communities, where there is no suitable alternative. this assists in pinpointing areas of inefﬁciency, identifying unnecessary calls at premium or peak rates and combating fraud. a consulting service is being introduced which uses this information to construct more efﬁcient customer networks. & the deregulation of inbound 0800 numbers means that we can offer bespoke pricing to our largest call centre customers. & in january 2003, bt became the ﬁrst uk telecommunications company to cap the cost of business calls by launching bt business plan which sets a ceiling of 10 pence on local and national calls – provided only that they last less than an hour. there was also signiﬁcant revenue growth from bt broadband, managed desktop solutions and crm (customer relationship management) activity. & crm developments included a strategic alliance with eckoh technologies, to provide speech recognition technology and the ﬁrst ‘‘pay as you go’’ contact centre service. & closer collaboration with strategic partner siebel systems inc, on solutions for local government, should now make it possible for citizens to deal with their local authority using a range of media – post, e-mail, internet, telephone or text message. & by march 2003, we were converting business customers to broadband at the rate of one line every minute (based on a 40 hour working week). & the launch of mobile worker in august 2002 was bt retail’s ﬁrst offering as a service provider. against this background, bt openworld’s strategy is to create a proﬁtable business and drive the growing broadband market. bt openworld’s strategy is to increase its proﬁt from this area, while simultaneously migrating narrowband customers onto broadband access services. this strategy is designed to increase revenues and provide customers with a superior internet experience. & during the ﬁnancial year, we embarked on a programme to transform and expand our online relationships with customers. at 31 march 2003, we had a total of almost four million online relationships, and over 300,000 customers receiving e-bills. we continued to extend the range of online services, particularly those made possible by broadband and mobile access. this programme made a signiﬁcant contribution to our cost reduction achievements in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. & our integrated multi-channel transformation programme aims to change the way bt retail serves major business customers. the fact that all uk network capital expenditure decisions are now made by one team has enabled bt wholesale to reduce the capital expenditure it controls by realising synergies through more efﬁcient network planning and responding quickly to worsening market conditions. under this scheme, people in areas where the local exchange has not been upgraded for broadband adsl can register their interest via a service provider. in april 2003, bt wholesale announced that it would be proceeding with the full implementation of exchange activate from july 2003. 21st century network at the heart of bt wholesale’s strategic intent to be the uk’s number one in broadband and data is our commitment to create a world-leading, commercially- focused, market-driven uk network, which fulﬁls customer requirements today and anticipates their future needs. the21stcenturynetworkaimstodeliverlong-term, structural cost reduction, as we progressively migrate ontoasimpler,lower-costnetworkarchitecture.theaim is that the new network will be reliable and hands-off, with self-diagnostic and self-healing capabilities, which means that investment now should lead to signiﬁcantly lower operational costs in the future. efﬁciency bt wholesale’s cost base strategy includes improved processes, better inventory control, and a relentless focus on productivity. almost 50% of bt global services’ people are employed outside the uk, ensuring a local understanding and approach. we deliver global account and service management to our major corporate customers around the world. & in april 2003, we signed a three-year contract with high street bank hbos plc to manage its voice and data services. nvp brightstar, which began operations in april 2003, has the exclusive rights to create new, start-up businesses with bt exact, using our extensive and developing intellectual property portfolio. one example of this is the my customer programme, targeted at 50,000 people in bt retail, to reinforce their engagement skills with customers. share options are normally exercisable on completion of a three- or ﬁve-year save- as-you-earn contract. under the licence, we must allow other licensed operators to interconnect with our telecommunications systems on cost-oriented, transparent and non- discriminatory terms. we must publish audited ﬁnancial statements for the regulated ‘‘businesses’’ and ‘‘activities’’, in order to support the linkage of costs with interconnect prices and with a view to providing demonstrable evidence that we are neither behaving in a discriminatory fashion nor unfairly subsidising our activities. in either case, the telecommunications act requires public consultation before a licence can be modiﬁed. licences may also be modiﬁed in order to implement european union directives into uk law. individual licences will be replaced by a general authorisation applying automatically to all providers of electronic communications networks and services. the communications data protection directive, which is not part of the main electronic communication directives, was adopted in june 2002 and must come into force in member states by 30 october 2003. this directive may have cost implications for industry. as a result, the uk government and oftel have indicated their expectation that it will be appropriate to move away from sector- speciﬁc (including licence-based) regulation to greater reliance on the competition act as individual markets become sufﬁciently competitive. theprovisionsoftheactarelargelycomplementary tothose ofthe competitionact 1998, which willremain in force with some minor amendments – but it also contains new provisions criminalising cartels and allowing for the disqualiﬁcation, in appropriate cases, of company directors where companies commit breaches of competition law. & for those services covered by the previous control, bt’s prices to the lowest spending 80% of its customers would be pegged at their current level and not allowed to rise with inﬂation, using an rpi minus rpi price control. a new network charge control period began on 1 october 2001 and will last for four years from that date. it requires us to set reasonable charges based on long-run incremental costs for our standard interconnection services. the effect was to set charges for, and bring under regulatory control, bt’s ﬁxed portability services. some additional obligations are proposed, such as guidelines that refer to a minimum data rate of 28.8 kbit/s which will have adverse cost implications for bt if implemented. if the proceedings are successful, bt could be held liable, with others, for any damages. the company has concluded that it is not appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such potential claim. we also won the queen’s award for enterprise in recognition of our contribution to sustainable development. in addition, social, ethical and environmental matters have been incorporated into the directors’ induction programme. we have important relationships with a wide range of different stakeholders, including employees, customers and suppliers. we also employ a number of csr experts who investigate long-term societal trends, identify potential issues that might affect the business and support bt’s commercial activities. however, we have identiﬁed the issue of supply chain working conditions as posing a potential risk to our reputation. by 31 march 2003, 16 key suppliers (79% of those targeted) had signed an agreement with bt giving their written support concerning ethical trading. in addition, our mm215 videophone has improved communications for people who rely on non-verbal communication, such as british sign language. the focus of our community programmes is on big issues where better communication can make a real difference to society. for example, more than 8,300 schools and around two million young people engagements with the bt education programme – a drama-based campaign helping children to improve their communication skills – have taken place. this activity is supported by our volunteering programme which, at 31 march 2003, had 4,000 registered volunteers working with schools. we are working with childline on a major new campaign to help ensure that all young people can be heard. signiﬁcant acquisitions were also made for a total consideration of £11.9 billion, including viag interkom and telfort. in total, these effects reduced group operating proﬁts by over £400 million, although this was compensated for at the proﬁt before tax level by a corresponding improvement in our share of the operating proﬁts of associates and joint ventures and net interest payable. ebitda before exceptional items is considered to be a good measure of the operating performance because it reﬂects the underlying operating cash costs, by eliminating depreciation and amortisation, and excludes non-recurring exceptional items that are predominantly related to corporate transactions. these improvements have enabled bt retail to contribute an operating free cash ﬂow (ebitda less capital expenditure) before exceptional items of £1,519 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year and £1,047 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year, representing improvements of 45% and 48%, respectively. external turnover is derived from providing wholesale products and solutions to other operators interconnecting with bt’s uk ﬁxed network, including mmo 2 since the demerger. in the 2002 ﬁnancial year, operating costs, excluding depreciation and exceptional items, rose by 9% to £8,355 million. in the 2002 ﬁnancial year bt global services’ turnover was £4,472 million representing an increase of 29% driven mainly by solutions, european operations and uk ip revenues. goodwill amortisation in respect of subsidiaries and businesses acquired since 1 april 1998, when bt adopted financial reporting standard no. financial review bt annual report and form 20-f 2003 37 exceptional items within the operating proﬁts from joint ventures and associates are as follows: 2003 £m 2002 £m 2001 £m impairment of concert – 806 – concert unwind costs – 81 – impairment of investments and charge (release) of related exit costs (150) 234 – goodwill impairment – 173 200 subscriber acquisition costs – –96 total attributable to continuing activities (150) 1,294 296 total attributable to discontinued activities – –36 total exceptional operating costs (credits) (150) 1,294 332 in the 2003 ﬁnancial year bt completed the exit from its investment in blu on more favourable terms than anticipated and accordingly exit cost provisions of £150 million were released. at&t has taken full ownership of bt’s interest in the canadian joint venture and in at&t canada, and has now assumed full responsibility for all future obligations of the joint venture. bt is entitled to receive additional payments from an earn- out arrangement based on e-peopleserve’s revenues from customers other than bt and accenture over the ﬁve years to 2007. these additional earn-out payments will total between £27 million and approximately £167 million. the 2002 ﬁnancial year included financial review 40 bt annual report and form 20-f 2003 gains on disposals from discontinued activities of £4,368 million. the effective rate was 21.8% of proﬁt from continuing activities before taxation, goodwill amortisation and exceptional items. this year’s dividend is covered 2.2 times by the proﬁt before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items. bt remains committed to a progressive dividend policy, reﬂecting growth in earnings per share and an improving balance sheet. these proceeds included £2,380 million from the property sale and leaseback transaction completed in december 2001, described above. the group’s foreign currency borrowings, which totalled £12.3 billion at 31 march 2003, are used to ﬁnance its operations. under our newstart programme launched during the fourth quarter of the 2001 ﬁnancial year, bt employees will be expected to leave with a leaving payment in place of a redundancy payment, and incremental pension beneﬁts have been scaled down. this should reduce the level of early leaver costs, which have been signiﬁcant in recent years. regulation and prices bt has been operating under a revised retail price control from 1 august 2002, under which a cap of rpi minus rpi (therefore price cannot increase) applies to the services used by the lowest 80% of bt’s residential customers by bill size. most of bt’s interconnect (network) charges to other uk operators are based on long-run incremental costs. until 30 september 2001, there were annual reductions in these charges based on a rpi minus 8 price cap. this diversion may intensify now that bt’s ﬁxed line customers are able to pre-select their carrier. this amendment took effect as a result of an eu regulation which came into force on 1 january 2001. for its operations as a whole, bt expects the competitive pressure to persist and it will continue to defend its market share vigorously and fairly. environment when removing old analogue exchange equipment from buildings, bt recycles the metal content and takes special care to properly dispose of any hazardous materials. bt believes that the total cost of dealing with these hazardous materials will not be signiﬁcant. the most sensitive estimates affecting our ﬁnancial statements are in the areas of assessing the level of interconnect income with and payments to other telecommunications operators, providing for doubtful debts, establishing ﬁxed asset lives for depreciation purposes, making appropriate long-term assumptions in calculating pension liabilities and costs, making appropriate medium-term assumptions on asset impairment reviews and calculating current tax liabilities on our proﬁts. in certain instances we rely on other operators to measure the trafﬁc ﬂows interconnecting with our networks. cash ﬂow

van den bergh b,c,d,f maarten van den bergh was appointed to the board on 1 september 2000. he chairs the pension scheme performance review group.heis chairman of lloyds tsb group and a non-executive director of royal dutch petroleum company and british airways. additionally, it meets on an ad hoc basis to consider matters which are time critical. it is bt’s policy that the board will comprise a majority of independent non-executive directors. the longest serving non- executive director has been in ofﬁce for nearly three and a half years. the board also takes account of signiﬁcant social, environmental and ethical matters that relate to bt’s businesses. in practice, these documents are being sent to shareholders more than 20 working days before the agm. a conﬁdential helpline and e-mail facility are also available to employees who have questions about the application of these principles. as a result, it covers activities which form part of normal relationships between bt and the political machinery. these activities are not designed to support any political party or to inﬂuence public support for a particular party and would not be thought of as political donations in the everyday sense of these words. the pension schemes’ funds can only be used in accordance with their respective rules and for no other purpose. generally, awards vest and options become exercisable only if a predetermined performance target has been achieved. options granted will be exercisable in three years only if a performance target has been met. an option was granted to sir christopher
