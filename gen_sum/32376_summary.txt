The project delivered significant profit and cash improvements plus several other benefits including: • Further improved ROCE at the Industrial Business Unit, through increased equipment utilisation • No industrial relations or Health and Safety issues at the Swiss facility • Minimal disruption to our customers during the transition phase • Strategic range reviews and use of tactical product rationalisation CASE STUDY: CLOSURE OF OUR SWISS FACILITY LEADS TO AN ANNUALISED PROFIT IMPROVEMENT OF £2.0M BUSINESS REVIEW: INDUSTRIAL CONTINUED 26 SECTION TITLE: PAGE REF 26 STRATEGIC REPORT FOCUSED COMMERCIAL STRATEGY SEGREGATE INDUSTRIAL ASSETS CREATE COATING HUBS CREATE CONVERTING SPOKES ACQUISITION STRATEGY ROADMAP TO INDUSTRY AVERAGE MARGINS > Market focus > Customer segmentation > Pricing optimisation > Product range > BU based structure > Separate operational infrastructure > Decentralised corporate structure > Evolve to separate legal entity > Create coating technology hubs > Use existing assets and transfer products > Optimise marginal proﬁt to load existing assets > Customer centric > Mobile > Flexible > Lower investment > Improve productivity and cost > Enable footprint optimisation > Mitigate capital investment > Provide on-boarding opportunity Our strategy is to continue improving ROCE through a business model where we continually review our asset base and expense structure.

SUMMARY OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH Key risks The key risks that we identified in the current year were: • Inventory valuation • Retirement benefits • Carrying value of goodwill, intangible and certain tangible fixed assets and investments in subsidiaries • Acquisition accounting. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 75 74 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Component materiality range £0.08m to £0.67m Group materiality £1m Audit and Risk Committee reporting threshold £0.05m £22.5m Adjusted PBT Group materiality We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £50,000 (2016: £10,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. Thus they continue to adopt a going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. The Group has an interest in Scapa Scottish Limited Partnership, whose head office is located at 13 Queens Road, Aberdeen, AB15 4YL. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments (see below). Where the recoverable amount of assets (other than goodwill) subsequently materially increases, impairment losses recognised in previous periods will be reversed. They are included in current assets or liabilities, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the Balance Sheet date. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. Where the effect is material, provisions are discounted in line with IAS 37 using a pre-tax nominal discount rate. Accounting for retirement benefit schemes under IAS 19 (revised) requires an assessment of the future benefits payable in accordance with actuarial assumptions. Accounting for retirement benefit schemes under IAS 19 (revised) requires an assessment of the future benefits payable in accordance with actuarial assumptions. These estimates remain our best estimate and no additional provisions have been made in the year. RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED Set out below are the key financial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under IAS 19. Sharesave The Scapa Group 2011 Sharesave Scheme is an Inland Revenue approved Save-As-You-Earn (SAYE) share option scheme pursuant to which eligible employees (including Executive Directors) in the United Kingdom who have worked a minimum six-month qualifying period and agree to save a fixed amount for three or five years under an approved savings contract are granted options to subscribe for shares in the Company at a discounted exercise price. All leases are on fixed repayment terms and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
