the group has an interest in scapa scottish limited partnership, whose head office is located at 13 queens road, aberdeen, ab15 4yl. subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments (see below). where the recoverable amount of assets (other than goodwill) subsequently materially increases, impairment losses recognised in previous periods will be reversed. they are included in current assets or liabilities, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. a defined benefit plan
