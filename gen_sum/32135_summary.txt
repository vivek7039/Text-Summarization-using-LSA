While every Fuller’s beer and pub does stand proudly on its own – each an achievement in its own right – the Fuller’s name tells you they have all been crafted with the same passion, care and attention to detail that we bring to everything we do. With more flavour coming in and a new piece of kit to play with, our brewers are experimenting even more than ever and that’s already resulted in a Black IPA, which was part of the seasonal calendar for the spring. It will be a long term process, but I look forward to updating you on progress in the coming months and years. And supporting it all are our incredible people who make us really stand out from the competition. 1.5m Our Brewer Street coffee continues to prove popular and we sold 1.5 million hot beverages during the year. This has proved successful and we have provided permanent jobs for all those who completed the apprenticeship programme. Craft beers also continued to perform well across the Managed estate, with sales increasing of both Fuller’s own range and those from other brewers. In addition, our Managed Pubs now have access to an even wider range of brands through Nectar. We have upgraded over 100 of our pub websites with fully responsive, mobile optimised sites where photography is at the heart. It is truly wonderful to see this grand old lady of Herne Hill once again proudly dominating the local scene. Since acquiring The Stable just three years ago, it has trebled in size, and now stands at 17 sites. Brewer Street is available Only at Fuller’s and we support those Tenants that take it on by helping with a promotional starter kit. It still has a full flavour and is served colder, which appeals to today’s craft beer drinker. Meanwhile, #whenitrainsitpours, a combined Twitter and Periscope activation featuring weatherman Michael Fish, received over four million views. We have made a number of other improvements that have resulted in a positive impact on our efficiency, such as new electric forklift trucks with lower carbon emissions and changes to our loading bank to create more space and easier stock movement. In addition, we have added Cornish Orchards Blush, with a hint of fresh raspberry, to our draught portfolio. Four years has been considered an appropriate period for assessment as that is the time horizon for which the Board analyses and reviews detailed strategic plans and is considered to be a good balance between providing a medium term horizon whilst not becoming speculative. Any significant loss of data could lead to a considerable interruption for the business and reputational damage. THE PERFECT DELIVERY 29 We have a fleet of 29 branded delivery vehicles based in Chiswick and Horndean, Hampshire F U L L E R ’ S C R A F T “ IT’S THE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE WITH OUR CUSTOMERS THAT SETS US APART. This is where our corporate social responsibility starts and those communities do not just revolve around geographical locations. Shooting Star Chase is an amazing charity that helps improve the lives of children with life-limiting illnesses, both at home and in its two hospices. Take Sheringhams for instance, working with British farmers to get the best seasonal produce at its peak. At the Brewery, we have installed solar panels and converted to electric forklift trucks, which will reduce our carbon footprint. To complete nature’s circle, we buy these animals from the butcher for sale in our pubs. THE PERFECT SERVICE 147 There are 147 service coaches working in our Managed Pubs and Hotels F U L L E R ’ S C R A F T “ WE MIGHT BE LIVING IN A DIGITAL WORLD, BUT YOU CAN NEVER REPLACE THE HUMAN TOUCH. And some of them have progressed even further up the Fuller’s career ladder – with at least six former service coaches now managing their own pubs. Joined in 1996 from Bass plc where he held a variety of senior operational and strategic planning roles. Taken together, these communications have allowed the Group to engage successfully with all our employees, wherever they are employed. The Group also has an equal opportunities policy which is designed to ensure that all employees are treated equally in terms of training, career development and promotion.

Alastair Kerr Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 8 June 2017 67 Governance Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. Our assessment of risk In arriving at our opinions set out in this report, we highlight the following risks that, in our judgement, had the greatest effect on our audit: Audit risk How we responded to the risk Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets As more fully explained in note 11, the Directors are required to make an impairment assessment for property, plant and equipment when there is an indication that an asset may be impaired and for goodwill annually. We therefore identified the presentation of separately disclosed items as a significant risk requiring special audit consideration. We also determined a lower level of specific materiality for certain areas such as Directors’ remuneration and related party transactions. 72 Group Income Statement for the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2017 53 weeks ended 1 April 2017 52 weeks ended 26 March 2016 Note Before separately disclosed items £m Separately disclosed items £m Total £m Before separately disclosed items £m Separately disclosed items £m Total £m Revenue 3 392.0 – 392.0 350.5 – 350.5 Operating costs 4,5 (342.5) (3.1) (345.6) (303.6) (3.9) (307.5) Operating profit 49.5 (3.1) 46.4 46.9 (3.9) 43.0 Profit on disposal of properties 5 – 0.9 0.9 – 2.9 2.9 Finance costs 5,6 (6.6) (0.8) (7.4) (6.0) (0.7) (6.7) Profit before tax 42.9 (3.0) 39.9 40.9 (1.7) 39.2 Taxation 5,7 (9.1) 1.7 (7.4) (8.4) 2.2 (6.2) Profit for the year 33.8 (1.3) 32.5 32.5 0.5 33.0 Attributable to: Equity shareholders of the Parent Company 33.9 (1.2) 32.7 32.3 0.5 32.8 Non-controlling interest (0.1) (0.1) (0.2) 0.2 – 0.2 Earnings per share per 40p ‘A’ and ‘C’ ordinary share Pence Pence Pence Pence Basic 8 59.21 59.25 Diluted 8 58.54 58.45 Adjusted 8 61.39 58.35 Diluted adjusted 8 60.69 57.56 Earnings per share per 4p ‘B’ ordinary share Basic 8 5.92 5.93 Diluted 8 5.85 5.85 Adjusted 8 6.14 5.84 Diluted adjusted 8 6.07 5.76 The results and earnings per share measures above are all in respect of continuing operations of the Group.
