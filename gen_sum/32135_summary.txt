while every fuller’s beer and pub does stand proudly on its own – each an achievement in its own right – the fuller’s name tells you they have all been crafted with the same passion, care and attention to detail that we bring to everything we do. with more flavour coming in and a new piece of kit to play with, our brewers are experimenting even more than ever and that’s already resulted in a black ipa, which was part of the seasonal calendar for the spring. one of the key measures for shareholders, adjusted earnings per share (eps), has risen by 5% to 61.39p (2016: 58.35p), reflecting a continuous upward trend, and i am delighted to announce a rise in the full year dividend of 5%. the tenanted inns division has had a year of consolidation while we reviewed our strategy. it will be a long term process, but i look forward to updating you on progress in the coming months and years. and supporting it all are our incredible people who make us really stand out from the competition.

scrambled eggs or in eggs royale for a delicious breakfast, it is also the hero of our salad nicoise, just one of the lighter dishes we have added to our menus. this has proved successful and we have provided permanent jobs for all those who completed the apprenticeship programme. craft beers also continued to perform well across the managed estate, with sales increasing of both fuller’s own range and those from other brewers. in addition, our managed pubs now have access to an even wider range of brands through nectar. we have upgraded over 100 of our pub websites with fully responsive, mobile optimised sites where photography is at the heart. it is truly wonderful to see this grand old lady of herne hill once again proudly dominating the local scene. since acquiring the stable just three years ago, it has trebled in size, and now stands at 17 sites. it is early days, but we are delighted that among our first turnover agreement signatories are a former fuller’s managed pub manager and head chef – completing the career path from front line team member to business owner. finally, we now have 92% of our estate on substantive agreements, up from 85% a year ago. brewer street is available only at fuller’s and we support those tenants that take it on by helping with a promotional starter kit. it still has a full flavour and is served colder, which appeals to today’s craft beer drinker. meanwhile, #whenitrainsitpours, a combined twitter and periscope activation featuring weatherman michael fish, received over four million views. we have made a number of other improvements that have resulted in a positive impact on our efficiency, such as new electric forklift trucks with lower carbon emissions and changes to our loading bank to create more space and easier stock movement. in addition, we have added cornish orchards blush, with a hint of fresh raspberry, to our draught portfolio. all the fruit is then pressed at westnorth manor farm and we never, ever use concentrate. we participate in industry initiatives aimed at the responsible promotion and retailing of alcohol. we continually monitor fire safety and invest in capital projects to reduce the risk of failure. any significant loss of data could lead to a considerable interruption for the business and reputational damage. there is a risk that recruitment will become increasingly competitive and that staffing shortages within the hospitality industry could drive wage inflation, especially if restrictions to free movement of eu nationals are imposed as a result of brexit. we have established a strategy which will ensure we continue to attract and retain highly trained, quality staff in all of our divisions and have invested in internal development as part of our chefs’ guild scholarship programme. the perfect delivery 29 we have a fleet of 29 branded delivery vehicles based in chiswick and horndean, hampshire f u l l e r ’ s c r a f t “ it’s the personal relationship we have with our customers that sets us apart. this is where our corporate social responsibility starts and those communities do not just revolve around geographical locations. shooting star chase is an amazing charity that helps improve the lives of children with life-limiting illnesses, both at home and in its two hospices. this year, we have contributed just under £80,000 to shooting star chase via these two initiatives. pound when they pay using a chip and pin machine, with the rounding going to charity. we will be encouraging team members to open their own charities aid foundation accounts and we will also match fund any regular donations employees make under this method, up to £2,000 per person per year. we have joined the anaphylaxis campaign and we have rolled out a comprehensive training programme to ensure that all of our managed house team members check before taking an order whether any diner has allergy requirements. take sheringhams for instance, working with british farmers to get the best seasonal produce at its peak. an all-round success – with only one puncture and a slap-up bbq at the end. this has been well received and nearly 200 team members have either applied or expressed an interest. at the brewery, we have installed solar panels and converted to electric forklift trucks, which will reduce our carbon footprint. in addition, we have moved our main printers to a follow me printing system. to complete nature’s circle, we buy these animals from the butcher for sale in our pubs. simon emeny chief executive james douglas finance director carbon reporting fuel

touch. being a service coach also forms part of the career structure for our pub teams. and some of them have progressed even further up the fuller’s career ladder – with at least six former service coaches now managing their own pubs. taken together, these communications have allowed the group to engage successfully with all our employees, wherever they are employed. the group also has an equal opportunities policy which is designed to ensure that all employees are treated equally in terms of training, career development and promotion. where employees develop a disability during their employment by the group, every effort is made to continue their employment and arrange for appropriate training, career development and promotion as far as is reasonably practicable. substantial

and significant variances would only be expected where there had been a significant change in an individual’s responsibilities or a market review had been conducted which suggested that an individual’s salary was no longer competitive, or where the committee wanted to take account of an individual’s performance or experience. it would not expect any new director to receive salary or any

report, we highlight the following risks that, in our judgement, had the greatest effect on our audit: audit risk how we responded to the risk impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as more fully explained in note 11, the directors are required to make an impairment assessment for property, plant and equipment when there is an indication that an asset may be impaired and for goodwill annually. we therefore identified the presentation of separately disclosed items as a significant risk requiring special audit consideration. we also determined a lower level of specific materiality for certain areas such as directors’ remuneration and related party transactions. 72 group income statement for the 53 weeks ended 1 april 2017 53 weeks ended 1 april 2017 52

are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained. management assess fair values, particularly for property, plant and equipment, with reference to current market prices. an intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. after initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment, at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. any contingent considerations recognised on business combinations are measured at fair value using level 3 valuation techniques. the fair value of interest rate swap and cap contracts are determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. own shares shares to be awarded under employee incentive plans and those that have been awarded but have yet to vest unconditionally are held at cost by an employee share ownership trust and shown as a deduction from equity in the balance sheet. these shares are occasionally but not exclusively used to satisfy awards under various share option schemes. treasury shares are held at cost and shown as a deduction from total equity in the balance sheet. the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. as segment assets and liabilities are not regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker, the group has elected, as provided under ifrs 8 operating segments (amended), not to disclose a measure of segment assets and liabilities. 53 weeks ended 1 april 2017 managed pubs and hotels £m tenanted inns £m the fuller’s beer company £m unallocated 1 £m total £m revenue segment
