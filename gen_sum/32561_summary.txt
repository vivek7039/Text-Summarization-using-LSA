new independent non-executive directors, david atkins and deanna oppenheimer joined the board on 1 january 2017. david is the chief executive of hammerson plc, a major uk property business with

8.2% to ¬£3.1 billion and underlying basic earnings per share increasing by 6.0%, demonstrating the strength of our core brands. china remains an exciting platform of growth for costa and we have a clear plan to enhance our business. we have made good progress this year in areas such as procurement, supplier consolidation and labour scheduling, which has helped maintain margins. i reported this time last year that dominic paul would be joining the team as managing director, costa coffee. dominic has hit the ground running, injecting energy and putting his personal stamp on our strategy for costa. simon jones was promoted to managing director of both premier inn & restaurants and joined the executive committee. i want to take this opportunity to thank everyone who makes whitbread the company it is for their effort and commitment throughout the year and i am confident that we will work together to deliver on our strategic objectives in the years ahead and that we will do so in a way that will make us all proud. ‚Ä¢ we will create an efficient and productive infrastructure, building capability to support our long-term growth. coffee has recently overtaken tea as the uk‚Äôs

potential beyond 2020 and our advantaged business models leave us best able to capture this market opportunity. we achieve over 13% returns across the premier inn & restaurants portfolio, which is substantially above our cost of capital. we open around 4,000 uk rooms per year, which roughly translates to three new hotels every month. we remain on track for our 2020 milestone and have identified a growth runway beyond 100,000 uk rooms. during the year we conducted an extensive strategic review of costa uk, and there remains considerable headroom for growth. our network plan shows opportunity for at least 3,000 stores in the uk compared to just over 2,200 today. uk network strength 40% more sites than closest competitor 9/10 sites have tripadvisor certificate of excellence strong return on

focus on our strengths to grow internationally costa express represents a significant international growth opportunity china costa has the potential to establish a number 2 position in the chinese market germany the premier inn in frankfurt is enjoying excellent customer feedback i‚Äôm here strategic report whitbread annual report and accounts 2016/17 12 strategic report strategy continued outlined in the previous pages is a multi-faceted growth plan, with multiple brands operating in multiple territories and ambitious plans to develop our key propositions. we have identified four themes under this heading: property to grow at around 4,000 or more rooms and continue the significant growth in our coffee shop estate, it is essential that we can efficiently access both freehold and leasehold site opportunities at a good return on capital. culturally speaking, we need dynamic leadership with clear executive accountability, and relentless customer focus supported by agile decision making. the uk consumer sector is facing a mixture of macroeconomic uncertainty and mandated cost inflation. strong returns are a non-negotiable part of the whitbread story, so we have commenced an overarching efficiency programme. we will develop scalable platforms, create a centre of digital excellence and embed data insight across the business. ‚Ä¢ our balanced portfolio creates strong operating cash flows and protection in the downturn via lower fixed costs. ‚Ä¢ finally, we continuously achieve freehold value creation through development profits, extensions and other asset opportunities. valuations are dependent on a number of factors, including the location type, trading outlook, rent cover and lease terms. we have also used an initial net yield of 4.5% to 5.5% based on individual sale and leaseback transactions. sites were assessed individually based on available local benchmarks for rental values and their trading performance. all support centres, each business and the group as a whole have their own wincard. whitbread‚Äôs business model, which can be found on pages 14 and 15 shows how we create value for our stakeholders. like for like sales growth while we are investing in the organic growth of our hotels, restaurants and coffee shops, it is important that we closely watch how the mature parts of our business are performing. electricity consumption companies have a responsibility to reduce their impact on the environment, which we fully endorse. there are also clear economic benefits in reducing electricity consumption, primarily through reduced energy bills. like for like sales growth while we are investing in the organic growth of our hotels, restaurants and coffee shops, it is important that we closely watch how the mature parts of our

electricity consumption, primarily through reduced energy bills. focus has also been placed on strengthening our commercial capability, from category management through to specialised procurement. in addition, our focus on creating a ‚Äòno limits to ambition‚Äô environment has seen us continue to drive leadership awareness on the importance of diversity and promoting respect and inclusion in teams where everyone can achieve their potential. overall whitbread maintained its engagement score of 78% which, despite positioning us favourably against external comparisons, did not quite meet our 79% target and highlights further opportunities to improve. we strongly believe that such initiatives are encouraging team members to stay and develop their careers with whitbread and, as a result, we have seen increases in the number of our employees who have more than 12 months‚Äô service. this programme is enabling us to attract, retain and develop exceptional talent across our commercial functions. whitbread‚Äôs commitment to apprenticeships was recognised through being ‚Äòhighly commended‚Äô at the 2016 national apprenticeship awards. as an equal opportunities employer, not only do we value, grow and celebrate people who have diverse perspectives whatever their age, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, disability or religious belief, we believe it gives us greater connectivity with our customers and a commercial advantage. we are proud to have celebrated a member of our costa leadership team being recognised in the outstanding & financial times leading lgbt+ ally executives list. the wise programme enabled paige to experience premier inn before enrolling on our advanced apprenticeship in hospitality management, earning while learning at work. paige valued the structured programme, support system of regular reviews and feedback about her performance at leeds premier inn. our graduates have acquired function-specific experience, technical training and support for the professional qualifications they wish to work towards. in costa poland, focus is centred on developing internal talent pipelines, introducing efficiency driven pay, benefits for baristas and development of leadership skills. these employees now form the internal talent pipeline for future leadership roles within our store teams. these surveys show that our teams are already doing a great job serving our customers, with nine out of ten premier inn guests saying they will definitely consider staying again and 87% of costa customers saying they are likely to revisit but, of course, we recognise there is always more we can do to deliver even better experiences for our customers, as evidenced by the targets that we set ourselves. following a successful 13 store trial, the costa pronto format will be rolled out more widely in 2017/18. the new food range includes freshly made sandwiches and premium desserts whilst costa‚Äôs coffee credentials are brought to the fore with new

director‚Äôs review continued net finance costs the underlying net finance cost for the year was higher than last year at ¬£27.2 million (2015/16: ¬£22.5 million) due to an increase in average net debt, as a result of our continued capital investments detailed below. costa cash capital expenditure is expected to be a similar level to 2016/17 at around ¬£140 million, with around 60% being expansionary capital, which will include larger stores such as drive thrus, and the remainder comprising refurbishments, systems, product improvement and innovation. these loan notes were issued in two series with a ten year maturity fixed at c.2.6%. in particular, it should be noted that the group is currently spending a substantial part of its cash from operations on discretionary growth capital (c.30% on average) which allows the group considerable flexibility to manage cash flows and would provide significant mitigation if required. we have a series of it security controls in place, including up-to-date antivirus software across the estate, network/system monitoring and regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities. to help ensure the successful delivery of these change projects, we have significantly enhanced our internal project delivery expertise and capability and put in place a robust assurance management framework coupled with regular reporting to the executive committee for all major projects. there is a rigorous business planning process in place which considers many scenarios with responses to these. these are supported by sensitivity analysis and a robust investment appraisal process to help deliver good levels of return. we have also embarked on an efficiency programme that aims to deliver ¬£150 million of savings over five years. the executive team also hold regular crisis management exercises to ensure we are prepared for such events. the group offers key employees appropriate levels of reward and recognition in order to retain them. it is

is an outsourced operation. for reasons of materiality, small, one man, offices in australasia and the far east have been excluded. where possible we have reported billed or amr data which now represents 88% of our total global emissions. for those operations which are currently beyond our reporting capabilities, such as costa shanghai, we have used an estimation approach using known sales data and local conversion factors. in coming to this conclusion the audit committee gave full consideration to any non‚Äìaudit work carried out by deloitte llp, and has concluded that certain services will not be carried out by deloitte llp, as outlined in the committee‚Äôs terms of reference. information published on the group‚Äôs website is accessible in many countries with different legal requirements. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. nicola mitchell fca (senior statutory auditor) for and on behalf of deloitte llp chartered accountants and statutory auditor london 24 april 2017 governance whitbread annual report and

the consolidated financial statements at 2 march 2017 1 authorisation of consolidated financial statements the consolidated financial statements of whitbread plc for the year ended 2 march 2017 were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 24 april 2017. whitbread plc is a public limited company incorporated and fully domiciled in england and wales. an intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside of goodwill if the asset is separable, or arises from contractual or other legal rights, and its fair value can be measured reliably. the carrying values are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable. the adjustments made to reported profit in the consolidated income statement, in order to derive our underlying results, may include: ‚Ä¢ profit or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, property reversions and onerous leases. after initial recognition, investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method. subsequent measurement is also at fair value, with changes recognised through finance revenue or costs in the income statement. provisions may be made for uncertain exposures or recoveries, which can have an impact on both deferred and current tax. the new standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018, subject to eu adoption. it replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance under current ifrs and becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018, subject to eu adoption. the group has undertaken an initial impact assessment which indicates that the adoption of ifrs 15 will not have a material impact on its consolidated result and financial position, but is likely to result in additional disclosure requirements. the following tables present revenue and profit information and certain asset and liability information regarding business operating segments
