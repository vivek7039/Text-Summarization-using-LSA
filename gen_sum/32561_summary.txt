We create value for all our stakeholders through our Customer Heartbeat model: is the UKâ€™s leading hospitality company We have built two of the UKâ€™s most successful hospitality brands, Premier Inn and Costa, through consistent operational excellence and providing a great customer experience. China remains an exciting platform of growth for Costa and we have a clear plan to enhance our business. We have made good progress this year in areas such as procurement, supplier consolidation and labour scheduling, which has helped maintain margins. I reported this time last year that Dominic Paul would be joining the team as Managing Director, Costa Coffee. Dominic has hit the ground running, injecting energy and putting his personal stamp on our strategy for Costa. Coffee has recently overtaken tea as the UKâ€™s beverage of choice and international comparisons show a lot more headroom for growth. During the year we conducted an extensive strategic review of Costa UK, and there remains considerable headroom for growth. UK Network strength 40% more sites than closest competitor 9/10 sites have TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence Strong return on capital Above hurdle returns for both freehold and leasehold providing a substantial premium to cost of capital Continued growth On track for 85,000 rooms by 2020 and growth runway beyond 100,000 rooms identified, with strong network planning disciplines Digital direct 94% of bookings made direct via our digital channels Value for money Premier Inn is rated No. However, we are given confidence by the fact that, outside a tail of underperforming stores, site performance is credible. We have identified four themes under this heading: Property To grow at around 4,000 or more rooms and continue the significant growth in our coffee shop estate, it is essential that we can efficiently access both freehold and leasehold site opportunities at a good return on capital. Culturally speaking, we need dynamic leadership with clear executive accountability, and relentless customer focus supported by agile decision making. Valuations are dependent on a number of factors, including the location type, trading outlook, rent cover and lease terms. Whitbreadâ€™s business model, which can be found on pages 14 and 15 shows how we create value for our stakeholders. Overall Whitbread maintained its engagement score of 78% which, despite positioning us favourably against external comparisons, did not quite meet our 79% target and highlights further opportunities to improve. We are proud to have celebrated a member of our Costa leadership team being recognised in the OUTstanding & Financial Times Leading LGBT+ Ally Executives list. The WISE programme enabled Paige to experience Premier Inn before enrolling on our Advanced Apprenticeship in Hospitality Management, earning while learning at work. Paige valued the structured programme, support system of regular reviews and feedback about her performance at Leeds Premier Inn. Our graduates have acquired function-specific experience, technical training and support for the professional qualifications they wish to work towards. In Costa Poland, focus is centred on developing internal talent pipelines, introducing efficiency driven pay, benefits for baristas and development of leadership skills. These surveys show that our teams are already doing a great job serving our customers, with nine out of ten Premier Inn guests saying they will definitely consider staying again and 87% of Costa customers saying they are likely to revisit but, of course, we recognise there is always more we can do to deliver even better experiences for our customers, as evidenced by the targets that we set ourselves. 2015â€“2017; TNS One Costa Tracker, Market Monitor, 2,000 Nat Rep respondents per quarter * Source: Allegra Project Cafe 2017 -               Marriott Holiday Inn Hilton Holiday Inn Express Ibis AirBnb Travelodge Value score Quality score UKâ€™s favourite coffee shop* â€“ 7th year in a row Brand Preference: Costa is the UKâ€™s favourite The only brand to deliver on quality and value YouGov Â® BrandIndex Costa Starbucks N e ro Premier Inn is the only brand to deliver on both quality and value, securing wider market appeal* * Note: Scores are net (i.e. positive % minus negative %). customer selects from the chiller cabinet, which is then lovingly blended and prepared in front of them by their barista.

Our new contemporary city centre restaurant format, Bar + Block, is trading well and receiving very high customer satisfaction scores. We continue to see strong growth in our profitable franchise business with a total of 731 stores across 23 countries. Going forward we will select target markets with the highest potential for us to grow profitably and win market share. We were delighted in November 2016 to announce that the fundraising total had been achieved one year earlier than anticipated. We also ran our first collaborative partnership with Allegraâ€™s Project Waterfall as part of the UK Coffee Week. In 2016 over 12,000 hours were volunteered by team members across Costa to good causes where they live and work. This was the second year that Costa has acted as a principal retail sponsor for KBTâ€™s national anti-litter campaigns. This year, we are very proud to have achieved the Chain of Custody Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification. Both projects demonstrate that sustainable buildings and efficient new space are at the core of our environmental strategy. Costa Express delivered a strong performance with 1,585 net coffee machines installed taking the total to 6,801, of which 740 are overseas. Our policy on underlying performance measures that defines what items may be classified as non-underlying is set out in note 2. We have a series of IT security controls in place, including up-to-date antivirus software across the estate, network/system monitoring and regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities. These are supported by sensitivity analysis and a robust investment appraisal process to help deliver good levels of return. We have also embarked on an efficiency programme that aims to deliver Â£150 million of savings over five years. He previously worked at Dixons Retail PLC, in a variety of management roles, including Chief Financial Officer from 2008 to 2011. Whilst progress has been made on risk management, the latest evaluation shows that further action is required to address this point. A table showing these changes is set out below, using Alison Brittainâ€™s strategic objectives as an example. The Committee will normally set appropriate performance conditions and vesting would generally be over a similar timeframe to awards forfeited. Approximately 45 executives receive between 15% and 20% of basic salary from the Company, which can be allocated to pension or taken as cash. No LTIP grants will be made within the last 12 months of employment to any employee who has requested, and been granted, â€˜good leaverâ€™ status. As a result, the awards to be made based on WINcard and leadership succession measures are as follows: Director % of salary in cash % of salary in deferred shares Total % of salary Alison Brittain 15.0 3.8 18.8 2015/16 12.0 3.0 15.0 Nicholas Cadbury 13.4 3.4 16.8 2015/16 12.0 3.0 15.0 Christopher Rogers 18.8 4.7 23.5 2015/16 12.8 3.2 16.0 Louise Smalley 13.4 3.4 16.8 2015/16 12.0 3.0 15.0 Total awards The split between cash and deferred shares is as follows: Director Cash award Â£â€™000 Cash value of deferred shares award Â£â€™000 Total Â£â€™000 Alison Brittain 290 348 638 2015/16 96 117 214 Nicholas Cadbury 188 234 422 2015/16 144 176 320 Christopher Rogers 62 64 126 2015/16 172 211 384 Louise Smalley 124 155 279 2015/16 101 123 224 Governance Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 90 Governance Annual report on remuneration continued The deferred shares will, under normal circumstances, vest on 1 March 2020, subject to continued employment within the Group. Keeping our team and customers safe is not an incentive lever but a core responsibility that earns the right to earn further incentivised rewards. In 2017/18, half of the total incentive available will be based on performance against a Group underlying profit before tax target. Each of the Groupâ€™s operating businesses maintains employee relations and consults employees as appropriate to its own particular needs. In addition, our employee opinion survey, â€˜Your Sayâ€™, is conducted twice a year to provide insight into the views of employees. It also includes CO 2 e from owned vehicles which include company cars but excludes logistics as this is an outsourced operation. For those operations which are currently beyond our reporting capabilities, such as Costa Shanghai, we have used an estimation approach using known sales data and local conversion factors. In coming to this conclusion the Audit Committee gave full consideration to any nonâ€“audit work carried out by Deloitte LLP, and has concluded that certain services will not be carried out by Deloitte LLP, as outlined in the Committeeâ€™s terms of reference.

authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 24 April 2017. The carrying values are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable. Subsequent measurement is also at fair value, with changes recognised through finance revenue or costs in the income statement.
