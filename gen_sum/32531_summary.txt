systems project that has been stopped as the group focuses and directs resources so as to accelerate key projects. accordingly, the group accounts for these derivative financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss. accounting standards require an impairment test to be carried out by determining the recoverable amount of each cgu which contains goodwill. value in use is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows and in particular (except as noted below) board-approved five year cash flow forecasts, prepared by the management of each cgu, are used together with 3% per annum growth for the subsequent 20 years. these rates are considered to be at or below long-term market trends for the group’s businesses. sensitivity analysis has been carried out by reference to both of these assumptions and demonstrated that large headroom remained across the businesses even after significant changes to both the discount rate and forecast growth rate assumptions. 19
