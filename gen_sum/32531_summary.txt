We have also made good progress in developing and implementing the new Horizon strategy to reposition our Group for long‑term sustainable growth. Summary • Horizon strategy underway, repositioning the Group for long‑term growth • Continued strength and improved profitability across NanoTechnology Tools sector • Steady performance in Industrial Products • Increased demand for services related to our own products 01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017 07 New operational model Within Horizon, we will actively manage our portfolio of businesses and products, selecting those markets with long‑term growth drivers where we can maintain or grow leading positions. Find out more on page 13 08 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017 Chief Executive’s Review continued Results Looking back over the previous financial year, the Group delivered a stable performance, supported by stronger second‑half trading in line with our expectations and currency tailwinds. Orders in NanoTechnology Tools increased by 7.9% but were marginally down on the previous year at constant currency. Asylum Research underperformed against the previous year having been disproportionally impacted by reduced academic funding levels and a delay in launching new products. X-Max for particle analysis, which is helping hard disk manufacturers identify where in the supply chain a fault occurred. Business Model Fundamental research Applied R&D Commercial markets Evolving to become a leading provider of high technology solutions, information and support. Within academic research, funding is increasingly being targeted towards nanotechnology applications that are building on the initial foundations of convergence. These are markets where we can maintain or grow into leadership positions by providing customers with high technology solutions, information and support. Healthcare where growth is driven by demand for improvements in disease detection and the understanding of fundamental mechanisms. Operational Excellence: We will target improvements in cost, time and defects to deliver a world class experience for Oxford Instruments’ customers. Innovation and Product Development Customer Support Market Intimacy Operational Excellence Customer Horizon will change the way by which we operate and will embed clearly defined core capabilities across our businesses in the following areas: Operations Review NanoTechnology Tools An Andor Technology technician working under contamination-controlled conditions in a cleanroom. Imaris will deliver smooth handling of extremely large data sets, which are a core requirement for the growing brain imaging market sector. Demand for our specialist magnet systems remains strong, including installations into leading institutes across China, Europe and the US. This is being addressed by more focused investment to address product gaps and a continued focus on driving operational efficiencies. The business reinforced its market position through a number of key product launches across our Optical Emission Spectroscopy and Hand Held Analyser portfolio. For example, our recently launched Vulcan handheld laser induced breakdown spectroscopy analyser, offers portable analysis at lower cost and without ionising radiation. 20 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017 Operations Review continued Service MRI scanner inside a mobile imaging unit from our Healthcare business. We are taking the necessary steps to improve sustainable profitability, including driving operational efficiencies and improving management capabilities in specific areas of focus. Risk Possible impact Control mechanisms Mitigation • Supply chain disruption in particular for single source components leading to production delays and potentially lost revenue. Risk Possible impact Control mechanisms Mitigation • Key employees leave and effective replacements are not recruited on a timely basis. • Principal sites have detailed BCPs which include plans to restore or relocate production in the event of a major incident. We have also made a small impairment of acquired intellectual property in Industrial Products and written down inefficient capitalised development costs on the Group’s new ERP system. Summary • Reported revenue up 9.0%, down 3.7% at constant currency • Adjusted profit before tax up 7.1%, in line with our expectations • Adjusted operating margin down 70 basis points, reflecting lower returns in Service and higher returns in NanoTechnology Tools • Dividend maintained at 13.0p for the full year 01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017 29 Continuing adjusted basic earnings per share grew by 5.5% to 47.8 pence (2016: 45.3 pence). Within our Industrial Analysis division we have impaired acquired intellectual property valued at £1.1 million that has been superseded by new product development. The increase in inventories primarily reflects a build up of refurbished imaging system inventory prior to sale or rental. By their very nature, these statements depend upon circumstances and relate to events that may occur in the future thereby involving a degree of uncertainty. To improve the quality, speed and predictability of our people‑related decisions, we are investing in a leading cloud‑based Human Resources Information System. Our Talent Framework outlines the behaviours and skills that employees should have to be successful at Oxford Instruments. Our flagship Management Development Programme (“MDP”) covers many of the skills needed to be a successful manager in Oxford Instruments. It is also vitally important to us that we play a role in encouraging the next generation of scientists and engineers. We perform regular due diligence on our agents, distributors and suppliers to minimise the risk of any unethical behaviour. Each Group site has a nominated Health, Safety and Environment manager or representative responsible for ensuring that day‑to‑day activities are carried out safely.

Refer to page 84 (accounting policy) and pages 97 to 99 (financial disclosures) 2017/2018 sales: There is a risk that revenue is recognised on sales of individual products produced by the Group’s NanoTechnology Tools segment before the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed. For the remaining components, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these. The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group Financial Statements. Key assumptions surrounding estimation uncertainty relate to future warranty costs of the Group’s products, which are based on historical return rates and any known product quality issue; as well as estimating potential royalty or profit sharing rates surrounding any product-related intellectual property claims. Then, on initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets are recognised at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The difference of £0.2m between contingent consideration provided at acquisition and that paid in May 2016 was due to foreign currency movements. Accounting standards require an impairment test to be carried out by determining the recoverable amount of each CGU which contains goodwill. Value in use is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows and in particular (except as noted below) Board-approved five year cash flow forecasts, prepared by the management of each CGU, are used together with 3% per annum growth for the subsequent 20 years. 19 Inventories 2017 2016 £m £m Raw materials and consumables 19.5 19.7 Work in progress 14.5 20.6 Finished goods 19.9 20.8 53.9 61.1 The amount of inventory recognised as an expense was £147.1m (2016: £143.6m). 01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information 119 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017 Defined benefit scheme – UK A full actuarial valuation of the UK plan was carried out as at 31 March 2015 and has been updated to 31 March 2017 by a qualified independent actuary.
