ensuring best-in-class cyber protection for our own defence platforms, products and services. we use these capabilities primarily in the defence sector but, where appropriate, extend our reach into related and adjacent commercial market areas. additional dry dock capacity at our san diego shipyard became operational in february 2017 and accepted its first ship during the year. we see continued support for increased defence spending in the president’s recently-released fiscal year 2019 budget request. this innovative, mobile, multiple-object tracking radar uses commercial off-the-shelf solutions to provide military test and evaluation ranges with a higher degree of accuracy in tracking the time, space and position information for several objects in flight compared with current radars. the imotr ™ solution, developed over two years with group-funded research and development expenditure, features enhanced capabilities that offer more precise flight path tracking for objects travelling close to the ground and allow tracking information to be shared in real time with other radars or data collection sensors. these provide support services to the royal saudi air force and

scheme, with 76 bae systems engineers starting the programme in january 2018. training and development we want every employee to reach their full potential and feel rewarded for what they do. the uk government has introduced gender pay gap reporting regulations for companies with more than 250 employees. this trend is not unusual for companies like ours which employ large numbers of people with qualifications in stem-related fields. we scan emerging technologies from around the world to assess their potential for application in defence and security. we develop embryonic technology before selecting technologies to mature for use in our products and services. we also work with potential overseas partners as part of our international campaigns and this can be a major discriminator in some markets. an example of this is our participation, for the first time, in a technology symposium with singapore’s defence science and technology agency (dsta) in 2017. our hope is that this will be the first step in working with dsta to identify and prioritise areas of technology that we can jointly explore for future collaboration. advances in sensor technology, robotics design and machine learning will increasingly enable humans to work safely alongside machines without stopping the production line. 2017 includes a £384m impairment in respect of the applied intelligence business, which
