strategy has come a long way since we first started thinking about spain in 2012. we chose spain because it offers a great investment opportunity with possibilities for growth: good infrastructure, an economy moving out of recession, sophisticated retailers and consumers. most of all, its prime regional shopping centre market has fragmented ownership and offers great opportunities for an imaginative owner to shake it up. since 2009, a key driver for growth in value within the uk real estate market has been exposure to central london properties. david fischel also holds another external appointment as a non-executive director of marlowe investments (kent) limited, a uk private company which relates to his family affairs and does not require any significant time commitment

of his position as deputy chairman and non-executive director . the company does not have any agreements with any executive director or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover except that provisions of the company share schemes may cause options and awards outstanding under such schemes to vest on a takeover . we also considered the reasonableness of other assumptions that are not so readily comparable to published benchmarks, such as estimated rental value, void rates and rent free periods. for share options an option pricing model is used applying assumptions around expected yields, forfeiture rates, exercise price and volatility. group as lessor investment properties are leased to tenants under operating leases, with

evidence available at the date of valuation and does not assume future increases in market rent. the summarised income statements are presented for the period from acquisition or becoming a joint
