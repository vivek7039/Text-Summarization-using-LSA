At Intu, we see the rise of multichannel retail – online, in-store, click and collect – as an opportunity rather than a threat. It took a year , but all of these units are now relet to top-quality brands, such as Hugo Boss, White Stuff , Superdry and Footasylum, at rents in line with the previous passing rent. Our online presence is growing rapidly with nearly three million visits to intu.co.uk in December 2014, a year- on-year increase of almost 40 per cent. By testing several tools at different centres, we could see which ones resonated with customers and were natural for intu staff to deliver .

We work with our suppliers, retailers and associated companies to ensure they meet acceptable standards of human dignity in their own sourcing policies. Operations and intu Retail Services Each shopping centre is led by a dedicated general manager working within regional structures. Our focus this year has been on recruitment, induction and training to ensure staff have the right skills. This new standard requires that all joint ventures, which the Group previously chose to account for on a proportional consolidation basis, are equity accounted. Since the year end we have confirmed that no cash outflows will be required in respect of these breaks. The Group’s ratio of total costs to income, as calculated in accordance with EPRA guidelines, remains low at 19 per cent. Our scale and single management means champions can ensure the best energy-saving ideas are replicated across intu centres.

Intu Properties plc – Annual Report 2014 intugroup.co.uk Governance 70 O ur Spanish strategy has come a long way since we first started thinking about Spain in 2012. We chose Spain because it offers a great investment opportunity with possibilities for growth: good infrastructure, an economy moving out of recession, sophisticated retailers and consumers. Most of all, its prime regional shopping centre market has fragmented ownership and offers great opportunities for an imaginative owner to shake it up. Our timing has been good – Spain is out of recession, with workplace reforms in place, unemployment falling, consumer confidence strengthening and household debt reducing.

David Fischel also holds another external appointment as a Non-Executive Director of Marlowe Investments (Kent) Limited, a UK private company which relates to his family affairs and does not require any significant time commitment and does not conflict in any way with his role as Chief Executive of Intu. All Non-Executive Directors have been appointed on fixed terms of two or three years, subject to renewal thereafter . The Company does not have any agreements with any Executive Director or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover except that provisions of the Company share schemes may cause options and awards outstanding under such schemes to vest on a takeover . We also considered the reasonableness of other assumptions that are not so readily comparable to published benchmarks, such as Estimated Rental Value, void rates and rent free periods. This change in accounting policy has had no impact on net assets or profit for the year ended 31 December 201 3. For share options an option pricing model is used applying assumptions around expected yields, forfeiture rates, exercise price and volatility. Lease payments are allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant financing rate. Group as lessor Investment properties are leased to tenants under operating leases, with rental income being recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. At each balance sheet date the Group reviews whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised in previous periods may have decreased. The valuers use this and other inputs including market transactions for similar properties to produce valuations (see valuation methodology below). This is based on evidence available at the date of valuation and does not assume future increases in market rent.
