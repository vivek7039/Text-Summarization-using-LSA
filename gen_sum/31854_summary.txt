successful roll out of vision and values throughout the group. 3 finsbury food group annual report & accounts 2017 chairman’s statement achieving our objectives " we will continue to work hard to run our existing businesses as efficiently and effectively as possible whilst investing for the future..." peter baker non-executive chairman 4 finsbury food group annual report & accounts 2017 we continue to make good progress in line with our stated aim of becoming a leading speciality bakery group in the uk. this has led to an upswing in the discounter’s market share and online gains. this outcome has not been easy to achieve and has only been possible because of our board’s long-term focus on driving efficiency and managing costs, as well as the hard work of finsbury’s committed team. in the same way, our new product development is increasingly directed towards providing healthier and more convenient products. development of the foodservice channel is also an ongoing target for growth alongside any business acquisitions that meet our criteria. finally, on behalf of the board i would like to thank everyone who works at finsbury for delivering another successful year. john duffy chief executive officer achieving e ffi ci e n cy 6 finsbury food group annual report & accounts 2017 since joining the company in 2009, our team has been keenly focused on creating strong foundations and a competitive cost base to ensure that we are in a solid position to weather industry-wide challenges. sterling’s structural decline amplified typically cyclical commodity input cost increases for uk manufacturers importing many of their ingredients. this trend looks set to continue for some time with high profile butter price hikes, driven by increased demand and a supply shortfall, the most significant example in recent months. this market transition has seen us work proactively with our brand partners and customers to revise our product, pricing and promotional portfolio to strike the right sustainable balance of providing value for consumers whilst delivering on margin requirements. this has seen the installation of a new automated whole cake line in an upgraded bakery at our cardiff site. both of these will enable future growth aligned to changing consumer demand for premium, healthy and authentic product ranges across different market channels. however, none were successful in the year as valuations remained unrealistic given known market headwinds. more challenging market conditions may provide new acquisition opportunities in the year ahead and we remain patient. meanwhile there are ample opportunities identified to further strengthen and optimise our current group businesses. the annual retail bread and morning goods market has a value of £4.0 billion (source: kantar worldpanel 52 weeks to 16 july 2017). the uk foodservice bread and morning goods bakery sector is worth approximately £836 million per annum. • johnstone’s food service ltd is based in east kilbride and produces bite style cake products, including its renowned caramel shortcake. successful licences for the group this year have included batman v’s superman, minions, star wars and emoji which have been linked to big movie releases, together with well established evergreen properties such as me to you, peppa pig and paw patrol. the full product range extends to loaf, sharing and celebration cakes which have all been developed in partnership with mary berry's original recipes. baked using specific baking processes that produces a loaf with great flavour through its fermentation process is made without any additives such as emulsifiers and enzymes. broad consumer trends better for you on the go indulgence artisan ongoing work in cake to meet sugar reduction targets and also butter (fat) mitigation, evidenced by the group’s work on a reduced sugar disney range of cakes. a formal review of these risks is carried out by the group on an annual basis. product standards will need to be observed by uk companies when trading with the eu. this decrease is driven by continued focus on overhead control, operational improvements and efficiencies from record levels of capital investment. the team also cultivates strong relationships with major suppliers to ensure continuity of supply at competitive prices. a £3.0 million swap fixed at 1.65% expired on 22 may 2017 and a £6.0 million swap fixed at 1.89% expired on 2 june 2017. financial covenants the board reviews the group’s cash flow forecasts and key covenants on a regular basis to ensure that it has adequate facilities to cover its trading and banking requirements with an appropriate level of headroom. 19 finsbury food group annual report & accounts 2017 strategic report environmental matters as part of the environmental activities, site wide led replacement programs are ongoing along with continued focus on energy usage such as oven burner efficiencies and insulated traywash facilities. dialogue with shareholders the board maintains a general policy of keeping all interested parties informed by regular announcements and update statements. john has non-executive experience in both start-up and established businesses including denby the household pottery manufacturer. he also provides mentoring services to aspiring and existing finance directors via the institute of chartered accountants. directors’ report 24 finsbury food group annual report & accounts 2017 financial instruments the group’s financial instruments

trade creditors. it is the group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken. liquidity risk short-term flexibility is available through existing bank facilities and the netting off of surplus funds. we are keen to engage our employees by providing an environment where they can contribute their own ideas and challenge those of others. for continued alignment with shareholders, the vested awards are subject to a further two year holding period. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. for a sample of debit notes and bank payments we evaluated whether these represented unrecognised deductions against in year revenue. we conducted specified procedures over financial information (including enquiry) at a further one non financially significant component. based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the other information. 40 finsbury food group annual report & accounts 2017 consolidated statement of changes in equity for the 52 weeks ended 1 july 2017 and 53 weeks ended
