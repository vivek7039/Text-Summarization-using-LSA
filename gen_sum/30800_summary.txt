ability to create value post‑acquisition contourglobal’s exceptional operating team has consistently reduced costs at projects, while improving operating efficiency and maintaining an excellent health and safety record. our team has also demonstrated the ability to increase contracted revenue through: (i) expansion opportunities, where marginal economics are even more accretive due to the utilization of existing infrastructure; (ii) repowering opportunities where technology has improved dramatically; and (iii) contract extensions that extract additional profitability from assets when their useful lives extend beyond the original contracted period. we have significant demand from financial investment partners seeking to make passive, minority investments in some of our assets on attractive terms for contourglobal. following ruth’s appointment, our board (excluding me as chairman) comprises a majority of independent directors, and we are confident that it has the right balance of skills and experience to support the executive team. the board is pleased to propose a final dividend of 2.6 cents (us dollar) per ordinary share. craig a. huff chairman overview i am excited to introduce contourglobal’s 2017 annual report, our first as a public company. as this is my first chairman’s letter, i would like to highlight two important aspects of our business approach. this capability allows us to focus exclusively on the most attractive risk-adjusted growth projects, without narrowing our scope by technology or geography. in december, we signed commercial agreements with the government of kosovo for a 500 mw development project. missing target zero in its inaugural year taught us much – to inspect all vehicles and vehicle histories when acquiring a business. and with just a bit of luck, enable us to achieve target zero in 2018. we also had a very strong operating year with better than target availabilities in our thermal fleet and most of our renewable fleet. in our thermal business, we are paid mainly to be available with virtually no volume risk. as a result, equivalent availability factor (“eaf”) is the kpi that tells us how well we are operating and maintaining our thermal plants. 2017 was a very good year in all thermal technology clusters, namely reciprocating engines, combined cycle gas turbines, coal-fired plants and our solutions’ quad-gen facilities. the effort required to prepare a company to enter successfully the public markets requires an intensity and focus that is singularly disruptive of normal corporate life, yet requires that core business objectives be met as promised. despite this record setting achievement, we failed to achieve “target zero,” our health and safety goal adopted at the end of december 2016 2 . 1 “ltir” measures recordable lost time incident (“lti”) rates on the basis of 200,000 working hours 2 meridith armstrong whitney, charles j. bennett, “driving toward “0”: best practices in corporate safety and health, the conference board research report r‑1334‑03‑rr (2003) 3 “lti” is an employment related incident that results in serious injury or illness which results in one or more days away from work 4 “trir” measures amount of the total number of all work‑related cases (restricted work days, medical treatment, and lost time incidents) 10 annual report 2017 contourglobal plc annual report 2017 contourglobal plc 11 outlook it is early days. by design, contourglobal’s financial results do not depend upon any one geography, technology or weather resource. we believe that this resilience creates a higher quality risk adjusted cash flow for shareholders. financial results were strong in all areas: revenue topped $1bn for the first time ever, an increase of 13% year-on- year. many corporations are increasingly procuring electricity with such structures and have grown significantly in the past three years. a decade ago, our contourglobal solutions business was an early pioneer of the corporate ppa market. working with coca-cola hbc (“cchbc”), we first used thermal fuels and then renewable generation technologies. later we worked with cchbc to install substantial solar “fields” in italy on the large rooftops housing their production and storage facilities, installing approximately 4.5 mw in five locations, using what today would be known as a “corporate ppa”. with such a market backdrop we are very selective about new investment in this region. these two projects offer a startling illustration of the dramatic improvements that have been achieved in wind turbine technology in the thirteen years that have passed since these wind farms first entered operations. finally, after many years of effort and close cooperation with the government of kosovo and international stakeholders, we achieved the critical milestone of “commercial close” for the kosovo e re power plant, a critically needed infrastructure project for a country that suffers with europe’s worst pollution from two old lignite fueled power generation facilities. kosovo is europe’s poorest country and its current installed electricity generation base is europe’s largest single source of pollution including dust, other particulate matter, no x, so x and co 2. contourglobal has always viewed itself as an investor first – allocating capital to attractive opportunities in the contracted wholesale power generation space. cap des biches, senegal chapadas, brazil 12 annual report 2017 contourglobal plc annual report 2017 contourglobal plc 13 2015 2016 2017 brazil bulgaria

achieved since we started recording data. we are committed to setting and meeting the same industry‑leading standards across all our operations wherever they may be. we tackle this by developing a risk matrix and tailoring our transition program to address any deficiencies identified in the existing structure. 1 level 2 inspections are those safety inspections conducted in our operating sites by operations and maintenance personnel 2017 health and safety highlights ― all our operating sites achieved their targets for leading indicators – see kpis below ― we achieved our lowest ever lti (lost time incident) rate, a 50% reduction from 2016 ― trir (total recordable incident rate) well below the target representing the historical low incidence achieved for the company ― we carried out a total of 11 internal health & safety audits in 2017 ― we undertook three safety interventions, with positive results ― all sites implemented the power for hse excellence program. this provides each site with a high quality list of safety hazards that may exist in the work environment. corrective and preventive actions our final leading indicator, capa (corrective and preventive actions) closure ratio, ensures that each site is committed to the process of not only recognizing hazards but also correcting them to remove the risk. solutions nogara, italy 24 annual report 2017 contourglobal plc

on its 2016 health and safety performance, our vorotan plant won our “best turnaround performance” award. in july 2017, the entire vorotan complex was re-audited for health and safety, with outstanding results. this lack of affordable and reliable energy is a notable disadvantage for the overall economic development. at that time the official negotiation had been stopped until a new government was in place. there is a significant opportunity to create value by enhancing operational performance, achieving fixed cost savings and optimizing the capital structure. together with man

to hurricane irma. three months later and saint martin was still slowly working to get back on its feet. the daunting task of clearing debris and rebuilding what was lost will likely take a long time to complete. this included filling a 20-feet shipping container with water, non-perishable food, diapers, tarpaulins, holiday gifts for the kids and many other essential items. this is another significant milestone for the company as we pursue our objective of continuous growth. the growth in thermal was also driven by organic growth (+$17.6m) including revenue related to so 2 and no x environmental investments in maritsa and the impact of a bad debt recovery following a positive second instance judgment on french caribbean assets (+$6.4m). adjusted ebitda is defined as combined profit from continuing operations for all controlled assets before income taxes, net finance costs, depreciation and amortization, acquisition-related expenses and specific items which have been

behaviors to generate the best outcomes for customers, partners and employees. in particular, the group’s financial performance has been assessed as relatively predictable given more than 90% of revenue and related cash flows are fully contracted with no material contracts expiring during this period. he graduated magna cum laude from abilene christian university with a bs in engineering physics. additionally, he has been instrumental in the formation and development of several investment firms seeded by reservoir capital. from 2000 to 2006, he served as the chief executive officer for iskenderun enerji üretim ve tic. isken is the project company of a $1.5bn coal-fired power plant investment where he was responsible for construction and later operations. certain matters are specifically reserved for decision by the board and documented in a written schedule which will be reviewed annually. he is also available to shareholders if they have concerns which contact through the normal channels of the chief executive officer or chairman has failed to resolve or for which such contact may not be appropriate. in addition, the non- executive directors are expected to commit appropriate preparation time ahead of each meeting. a full, formal and tailored induction program will be developed for new directors joining the board. the board has a procedure by which directors are briefed on their duty to avoid conflicts of interests and required to immediately notify the company secretary when a conflict or potential conflict does arise in order that board authorization can be sought. the company’s first annual general meeting since admission will take place on 25th may 2018 at 1 silk street, london ec2y 8hq. in town-hall meetings and in-person training, our senior management regularly reinforce the message to our employees and third parties that corruption or other unethical conduct will not be tolerated even where it could facilitate the company’s immediate business objectives. these sessions were supplemented by an online anti- corruption course that employees are required to take upon joining the company and periodically thereafter. moreover, we distribute the guide to targeted third parties and require that they too sign it as part of our risk-based due diligence process. we do so according to our policy for engaging suppliers and third party service providers, which requires that all third parties, with the exception of certain low-risk suppliers, receive risk-based due diligence through the compliance third-party intake portal. using the portal, our compliance team can conduct routine auditing, monitor third party engagements and update due diligence when required. in 2017, we re-reviewed and conducted refreshed due diligence on approximately 645 legacy third parties engaged by the company. the audit and risk committee will normally meet no fewer than three times a year. pricewaterhousecoopers is required to rotate the lead audit partner every five years for a listed client. whistleblowing the company maintains a web and telephone-based reporting hotline for employees and third parties to report potential violations of company policy or the law, including related to matters of financial reporting or controls. in line with this objective, a significant proportion of executive remuneration is tied to company performance through an annual bonus and long-term incentive plan (“ltip”). the incentive plans also include recovery and withholding provisions to ensure no rewards for failure. any reasonable business related expenses (including tax thereon) incurred in connection with the role may be reimbursed. there is no formal maximum limit as benefit costs can fluctuate depending on changes in provider cost and individual circumstances not performance related. 66 annual report 2017 contourglobal plc annual report 2017 contourglobal plc 67 executive directors purpose and link to strategy

performance conditions and continued service. when reviewing fee levels, account is taken of market movements in non-executive director fees, board committee responsibilities, ongoing time commitments and the general economic environment. for the avoidance of doubt, all outstanding historical awards that were granted in connection with, or prior to, listing including those made by contourglobal lp under the pip remain eligible to vest based on their original or modified terms. 70 annual report 2017 contourglobal plc annual report 2017 contourglobal plc 71 service contracts and termination policy in accordance with long-established policy, executive directors have rolling service agreements which may be terminated in accordance with the terms of these agreements. executive directors’ service agreements are available for inspection at the company’s registered office during normal business hours. his service contract also states that any pilon would be payable in a lump sum. any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims in connection with a termination (including, at the discretion of the committee, reimbursement for legal advice and provision of outplacement services) would be paid as necessary. in any event, each appointment is terminable by either party on one month’s written notice. the remuneration of employees that are not senior managers generally include market based salary, benefits, and discretionary bonuses. this means that there is no historical voting to disclose on the company’s executive remuneration. the notice of annual general meeting specifies deadlines for exercising voting rights and appointing a proxy or proxies. no shareholder holds securities carrying any special rights or control over the company’s share capital. in july 2016, cg power holdings issued an additional €50.0m aggregate principal amount of its 5.125% senior secured notes due 2021. in february 2017, cg power holdings issued an additional €100.0m aggregate principal amount, which formed a single series with the initial euro bonds. once the basis of accounting has been initially determined, this does not change over time. the group’s reporting components vary significantly in size and we identified ten components that, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information due to specific risk criteria and/or their size and contribution to the group. in the event that an impairment trigger is identified, the recoverable value of assets is assessed by either a value in use calculation (which is based on future cash flow forecasts and related valuation assumptions), or by reference to expected sale proceeds less costs to sell (where a decision has been taken to sell the related asset). no impairment triggers other than those already noted by management were identified from our assessment. ― amendments to ias 12 “income tax”– recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealized losses these amendments clarify how an entity should evaluate whether there will be sufficient taxable profits against which it can utilize a deductible temporary difference. its implementation is not expected to have a significant impact on the group’s consolidated financial statements. this interpretation is applicable for financial years beginning on 1st january 2019, subject to its adoption by the european union and subject to retrospective application, with or without comparative information restatement for the first year of application. the group capitalizes certain direct preconstruction costs associated with its power plant project development activities when it has been determined that it is more likely than not that the opportunity will result in an operating asset. 2. summary of significant accounting policies continued impairment of non-financial assets assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable. site decommissioning, maintenance and environmental provisions are recognized based on management’s assessment of future costs which would need to be incurred in accordance with existing legislation or contractual obligations to restore the sites or make good any environmental damage. judgment is applied in determining whether an impairment trigger has occurred, based on both internal and external sources. external sources may include: market value declines, negative changes in technology, markets, economy, or laws. the fair value is based on input assumptions such as budgets and cash flow forecasts. provisions are re-measured at each statement of financial position date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. however, deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income tax is not recognized if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. critical accounting estimates recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment where an impairment trigger has been identified (see critical accounting judgments section), the group makes significant judgments in its impairment evaluations of long-lived assets. these assumptions are consistent with the group’s internal budgets and forecasts for such valuations. thermal energy for power generating plants operating from coal, lignite, natural gas, fuel
