We have significant demand from  financial investment partners seeking to  make passive, minority investments in  some of our assets on attractive terms  for ContourGlobal. Craig A. Huff  Chairman Overview  I am excited to introduce  ContourGlobal’s 2017 Annual Report,  our first as a public company. As this is my first Chairman’s letter,  I would like to highlight two important  aspects of our business approach. This capability allows us to  focus exclusively on the most attractive  risk-adjusted growth projects, without  narrowing our scope by technology  or geography. Missing Target Zero in its inaugural year  taught us much – to inspect all vehicles  and vehicle histories when acquiring  a business. As a result, Equivalent  Availability Factor (“EAF”) is the KPI  that tells us how well we are operating  and maintaining our thermal plants. 2017 was a very good year in all  thermal technology clusters, namely  reciprocating engines, Combined  Cycle Gas Turbines, Coal-fired plants  and our Solutions’ quad-gen facilities. Despite this record setting achievement,  we failed to achieve “Target Zero,” our  health and safety goal adopted at the  end of December 2016 2 . 1 “LTIR” measures recordable lost time incident (“LTI”) rates on the basis of 200,000 working hours 2 Meridith Armstrong Whitney, Charles J. Bennett, “Driving Toward “0”: Best Practices in Corporate  Safety and Health, The Conference Board Research Report R‑1334‑03‑RR (2003) 3 “LTI” is an employment related incident that results in serious injury or illness which results in one or more days away from work 4 “TRIR” measures amount of the total number of all work‑related cases (restricted work days, medical treatment, and lost time incidents) 10 Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc 11 Outlook It is early days. Financial results were strong in all  areas: revenue topped $1bn for the first  time ever, an increase of 13% year-on- year. Many corporations are increasingly  procuring electricity with such  structures and have grown  significantly in the past three years. ContourGlobal has always viewed  itself as an investor first – allocating  capital to attractive opportunities in  the contracted wholesale power  generation space.

This is  done either through long-term power purchase  agreements (PPAs), which typically have higher  margins than market platforms, or prices are set  under a regulatory regime. Our position in the electricity value chain GENERATION  thermal/renewable   centralised/distributed TRANSMISSION  high voltage grid DISTRIBUTION  low voltage grid WHOLESALE/  RETAIL According to the International Energy  Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook  2017, global electricity demand will  increase by approximately 45%  between 2015 and 2040, from  23.4 TWh to 34.0 TWh, at an  annual growth rate of 1.5%.

The  power plant is expected to start  operations in 2023 and will have  a life expectancy of four decades. Involves similar, customized  contractual risk profiles to our development assets but have  the benefit of an operating history. These are in  regions where there is need for reliable power infrastructure  but insufficient capital and expertize. Consistent strong downwards trend  of forced outages rate in the last three  years, reflecting improving operational  performance results. We are committed to setting and  meeting the same industry‑leading standards  across all our operations wherever they may  be. We tackle this by  developing a risk matrix and tailoring  our transition program to address any  deficiencies identified in the existing  structure. 1 Level 2 inspections are those safety  inspections conducted in our operating sites  by operations and maintenance personnel 2017 Health and Safety Highlights  ― All our operating sites achieved  their targets for leading indicators  – see KPIs below  ― We achieved our lowest ever  LTI (Lost Time Incident) rate,  a 50% reduction from 2016  ― TRIR (Total Recordable Incident  Rate) well below the target  representing the historical  low incidence achieved for  the Company  ― We carried out a total of 11 Internal  Health & Safety Audits in 2017  ― We undertook three  Safety Interventions,  with positive results  ― All sites implemented the  Power for HSE Excellence  program. This provides  each site with a high quality list of  safety hazards that may exist in the  work environment.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as  combined profit from continuing  operations for all controlled assets  before income taxes, net finance  costs, depreciation and amortization,  acquisition-related expenses and  specific items which have been  identified and adjusted by virtue of  their size, nature or incidence, less  ContourGlobal’s share of profit from  unconsolidated entities accounted  for on the equity method, plus  ContourGlobal’s pro rata portion of  Adjusted EBITDA for such entities. We closely monitor residual  risks related to governmental  regulations and changes in market  conditions through the risk  management framework. This can  have a negative impact on information  systems as well as electronic control  systems used at the generating plants, and  can disrupt business operations, result in  loss of service to customers, and expense  to repair security breaches or system  damage. In particular,  the Group’s financial performance has been assessed as relatively predictable given more than 90% of revenue and  related cash flows are fully contracted with no material contracts expiring during this period. Additionally, he has been  instrumental in the formation and  development of several investment  firms seeded by Reservoir Capital. Isken is the project company of a  $1.5bn coal-fired power plant  investment where he was responsible  for construction and later operations. Certain matters are specifically  reserved for decision by the Board  and documented in a written schedule  which will be reviewed annually.
