equally, and more importantly, it is already clear that the years ahead present significant upside opportunities. we still enjoy significant organic growth in our core markets and have a strong balance sheet. despite delivering revenue growth of almost £35.4m (up 17 per cent), adjusted* ebit went backwards to £27 .5m from £39.7m in the prior year. the strong cyber security theme (or “golden thread”) that runs through the assurance division represents a unique set of competencies and capabilities that we can leverage to deliver greater customer value in a highly complex and fragmented market. the group will then benefit from further organic growth with foundations built on scalable products and business processes. last year we noted our intention to strengthen the team further with an additional independent non-executive director. ncc group plc annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 may 2017 3 ncc ar2017 - proof 8-front.indd 3 09/08/2017 16:03:44 25546.04 9 august 2017

to stay ahead in the cyber-arms race, our global corporate culture is aligned with this rapid and constant change. we have created boutique ways of working with cultural values that encourage individuals to fulfil their full creative potential. threat intelligence is one of the most important tools in an organisation’s armoury to help prevent and mitigate cyber-attack. particularly through the fox business, we offer some very high-end products to customers that combine hardware and software in one package. both products are sufficiently differentiated that they can attract better margins than third party product reselling. currently, ncc group undertakes more than three million web page tests per day for clients worldwide. the maximum price that will be paid is $18.75m in cash

assurance core capabilities in today’s threat landscape, understanding the risks that organisations and their customers are exposed to is more important than ever. further, we provide registry data escrow services (a regulatory requirement) for all registrars and registries of domains. the ip address of each domain registered within a tld is safely secured along with registrar data escrow. the smart meter in your house has been through ncc group’s government approved hardware testing laboratories. 12:30pm buy lunch ncc group’s threat intelligence tipped off the point-of-sale operator that their systems were breached. this allowed the organisation to respond and minimise impact on their customers while ensuring commerce can occur with confidence. companies’ buying decisions are more about technical expertise and value for money than a simple price basis. the threat of being hacked or having valuable data stolen continues to evolve rapidly and at a seemingly unstoppable pace. these attacks often cause significant operational disruption whose economic consequences can vastly outweigh any cost of remediation or prevention. management estimate that ncc group is one of the largest “pure play” cyber security companies focusing on services as opposed to products but yet has relatively low market shares in most segments and geographies. we must find the right balance of “blue sky” thinking and ideas that can be rapidly commercialised. our new target operating model is designed to ensure that these remain a core feature of the business. the business only rated less strongly compared to large systems integrators, defence contractors or product-based cyber companies. in many cases the overlay of our business processes on those organisational design features creates a “spaghetti wiring diagram” that is complex, delivers unclear accountabilities and is undoubtedly inefficient at delivering business processes and services to customers. our historical go- to-market model was identified by customers as being too transactional in many cases. to avoid unnecessary cost increases or duplication of roles, there will be some “double-hatting” in smaller businesses as they grow. our unique offering sees us work with a full spectrum of clients from cyber security transformation to assessing the technology in autonomous next generation vehicles. for our commercial customers, we provide a world-class service in cyber incident response from situation management through to technical analysis and remediation. our dns, dhcp and ip address management (ddi) guard product help safeguard the network infrastructure of clients ranging from national telecommunications providers to international financial services firms. as investment increases with regard to cyber security, senior management are increasingly looking for key performance indicators which can be quantified. defending: data diode, ddos protect, ctmp, signify we have a broad range of defence products and services. ncc group has leveraged its 24/7 socs to provide a number of new services this financial year, including providing a cyber support line to over 750,000 small and medium enterprises in the uk and various emergency response lines for cyber insurers. by focusing on higher value added services we will avoid growth for its own sake while simultaneously protecting our margins. we will implement a new and clear operating model that delivers better customer service at an improving gross margin. they often rely on manual activity and disparate information systems that can lead to a lack of clarity in decision-making. by focusing on higher value added services we will avoid growth for its own sake while simultaneously protecting our margins. we will implement a new

failure to scale business process with our growing capabilities. our new tom is designed to ensure that these remain a core feature of the business. marketing spend rose £1.3m as the group sought to raise its profile in a number of areas. the current year charge was then offset by a £1.2m profit on disposal of open registry (also treated as an adjusting item). nearly one-third (30 per cent) of all nhs trusts were affected, with staff being forced to turn patients away and cancel appointments. victims in other countries include us delivery service fedex, french car maker renault and russia’s interior ministry. how our business model enables this in these crisis situations, ncc group’s 24/7 security operations centres and managed services capability demonstrate their worth. over the course of the wannacry attack, our security operations centres carried out the following activities: z provided expert analysis of the threat and offered pragmatic advice to all our soc customers z developed and then enhanced advanced siem correlation logic to monitor for attacks on customer networks, using ioc information provided from the threat intelligence (ti) research by ncc group analysts z used ncc group’s threat sensors to proactively monitor for iocs z ensured commercial intrusion protection systems (ips) signature sets were up-to-date and monitored for the latest threats z delivered 24/7 security monitoring, proactively watching for attacks and infection z updated our soc customers on a regular basis, including direct telephone calls to ensure that they were aware of the attack and to give them reassurance and assurance how we will leverage this moving forward as large-scale cyber attacks continue to occur on an ever-more frequent basis, it is important that your organisation is protected by utilising ncc group’s 24/7 security operations centres and range of protective monitoring managed services. 15% assurance revenue by service type p rof essional services 45% managed

our assurance revenue streams based on currently available information. the assurance business will typically see one or two major unplanned contract wins in any particular year. in one specific case, a large-scale software testing project (referenced above) was already underway with staff deployed on the ground. ncc group understands that organisations are using an increased number of suppliers, and on-site audits for the whole supply chain is not financially or operationally feasible. ncc group has therefore developed a risk based approach to help organisations gain assurance that information security risks and requirements such as gdpr are managed effectively for their suppliers. as such, we have made a significant investment in people, processes and technology associated with this. lessons learnt from all remediation activities will be passed throughout the client organisation and its supply chain. how our business model enables resilient finance ncc group’s dutch based subsidiary, fox-it, has tracked criminal threat groups ever since the first attacks on online banking, giving us unique insight into criminal organisations, their modus operandi and the tools that they use. they provide valuable information about the attacker’s means, motives and technical indicators of successful attacks. lastly, any information about the attackers is used by our threat analysts as a starting point for further investigation into that attacker. for red teaming in the financial sector, as singapore, hong kong, the european central bank and other regulators implement robust resilience programmes, ncc group’s experience, global reach, scale and technical investment means we are well placed to capitalise on market opportunities. how threat intelligence, fraud

multiple network technologies and segments, connecting a range of different embedded computers from many different suppliers to sensors, actuators and display interfaces. many of the embedded computers present within vehicles have been connected to each other for years in closed on-board vehicle networks. how our business model enables this ncc group has been providing cyber security advice and guidance to the automotive industry since 2012. our dedicated transport assurance practice constantly updates assessment methodologies, tools and techniques through a research-led approach to consultancy. while there was never any question of not delivering the service, and in many cases payment was received in advance, this revised approach is deemed to be a more appropriate application of the group’s unchanged policy on revenue recognition. the system was also designed for use on multiple channels including websites, retail shops and call centres. how we will leverage this going forward most businesses rely on it applications to run important and critical functions within their organisation. key delivery points and objectives are below: — previous expertise in sector and project type — ability to scale with the exact skills at speed — flexible on-site / off-site model (but all on-shore) — develop a strategy that would be agreeable by the board for budget

performance review for 2017 our performance earnings per share the adjusted basic earnings per share from operations was 6.7p (2016: 1 1.8p). while dividend cover is negative (2016: 2.4 times based on basic adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations) the board is confident that the group’s new strategic plan will be a source of long-term sustainable growth in earnings, cash flow and shareholder value. an administrative non-compliance issue has been identified with respect to distributable reserves and the payment of previous dividends. discretionary spend includes a number of new office locations that have either been acquired or moved into in the year ending 31 may 2017 . the group’s primary banking covenants are: z leverage limit of 2.5 times and this is calculated as adjusted ebitda / net debt. however, the group’s risk management programme can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that principal risks are managed to an acceptable level. as the business grows in scale and complexity, it is important that we evolve our risk management processes. 3 information technology the group is heavily reliant on continued and uninterrupted access to its it systems. conduct risk can arise from a number of areas such as failing to meet customer expectations on project delivery, testing assignments or source code handling or from employees who could maliciously disrupt the business and steal customer information. 6 cyber risk this is the risk that is faced by many of our customers, that external agents will successfully access and harm ncc group data and operating systems, inspired by either the pursuit of financial gain or malice. if such rights are not sufficiently protected, the group could potentially no longer be able to offer a particular service in some or all countries. furthermore, as the group’s international footprint expands, there is an inherent risk of adverse foreign exchange movements affecting profitability. part of their role is to support the cfo in developing a treasury strategy and overseeing its implementation. the group does not believe that brexit will have a significant impact on its operations as currently structured. the rapid changes occurring in our marketplaces mean that a longer period would not have an acceptable level of forecasting accuracy. the three-year time frame also takes account of the group’s core banking facilities which have an expiry date in november 2020 and that are likely to be renewed ahead of that date, in line with market practice. the term modern slavery includes

preparation ncc group plc (“the company”) is a company incorporated in the uk. the accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these group financial statements. z ifrs 9 financial instruments – recognition and measurement will be effective from the year ending 31 may 2019 onwards. in respect of acquisitions prior to 1 june 2004, goodwill is included at its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under uk gaap at 31 may 2004 which was broadly comparable, save that only separable intangibles were recognised and goodwill was amortised. intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. provisions are made for any losses on uncompleted contracts expected to be incurred after the balance sheet date. an operating segment is a component of the group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the group’s other components. however, while we can manage and disclose some aspects of those as individual operating segments, they are all managed under the escrow division’s senior executive team. however, similar to escrow, the different activities came together under an assurance management team for strategic and resource allocation decision-making. for share based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes. ncc group plc annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 may 2017 133 ncc ar2017 proof 8- back.indd 133
