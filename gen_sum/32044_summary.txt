Despite delivering revenue growth of almost £35.4m (up 17 per cent), adjusted* EBIT went backwards to £27 .5m from £39.7m in the prior year. To stay ahead in the cyber-arms race, our global corporate culture is aligned with this rapid and constant change. We have created boutique ways of working with cultural values that encourage individuals to fulfil their full creative potential. Threat intelligence is one of the most important tools in an organisation’s armoury to help prevent and mitigate cyber-attack. Particularly through the Fox business, we offer some very high-end products to customers that combine hardware and software in one package. The maximum price that will be paid is $18.75m in cash ($15.0m up front and $3.75m contingent on performance over two years). The maximum price that will be paid is $6.0m in cash ($4.0m up front and $2.0m contingent on performance over two years). ASSURANCE ACQUISITIONS NCC Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 May 2017 9 NCC AR2017 - proof 8-Front.indd 9 09/08/2017 16:03:56 25546.04 9 August 2017 3:58 PM Proof Six Group at a glance ASSURANCE CORE CAPABILITIES In today’s threat landscape, understanding the risks that organisations and their customers are exposed to is more important than ever. This allowed the organisation to respond and minimise impact on their customers while ensuring commerce can occur with confidence. The threat of being hacked or having valuable data stolen continues to evolve rapidly and at a seemingly unstoppable pace. These attacks often cause significant operational disruption whose economic consequences can vastly outweigh any cost of remediation or prevention. Management estimate that NCC Group is one of the largest “pure play” cyber security companies focusing on services as opposed to products but yet has relatively low market shares in most segments and geographies. To avoid unnecessary cost increases or duplication of roles, there will be some “double-hatting” in smaller businesses as they grow. Our unique offering sees us work with a full spectrum of clients from cyber security transformation to assessing the technology in autonomous next generation vehicles. For our commercial customers, we provide a world-class service in cyber incident response from situation management through to technical analysis and remediation. Our DNS, DHCP and IP Address Management (DDI) Guard product help safeguard the network infrastructure of clients ranging from national telecommunications providers to international financial services firms. As investment increases with regard to cyber security, senior management are increasingly looking for key performance indicators which can be quantified. By focusing on higher value added services we will avoid growth for its own sake while simultaneously protecting our margins. We will implement a new and clear operating model that delivers better customer service at an improving gross margin. They often rely on manual activity and disparate information systems that can lead to a lack of clarity in decision-making.

The current year charge was then offset by a £1.2m profit on disposal of Open Registry (also treated as an adjusting item). Nearly one-third (30 per cent) of all NHS Trusts were affected, with staff being forced to turn patients away and cancel appointments. How our business model enables this In these crisis situations, NCC Group’s 24/7 Security Operations Centres and managed services capability demonstrate their worth. In one specific case, a large-scale Software Testing project (referenced above) was already underway with staff deployed on the ground. NCC Group understands that organisations are using an increased number of suppliers, and on-site audits for the whole supply chain is not financially or operationally feasible. NCC Group has therefore developed a risk based approach to help organisations gain assurance that information security risks and requirements such as GDPR are managed effectively for their suppliers. Lastly, any information about the attackers is used by our threat analysts as a starting point for further investigation into that attacker. Many of the embedded computers present within vehicles have been connected to each other for years in closed on-board vehicle networks. How our business model enables this NCC Group has been providing cyber security advice and guidance to the automotive industry since 2012. How we will leverage this going forward Most businesses rely on IT applications to run important and critical functions within their organisation. In MSS we are also shifting focus away from one part of the business that previously concentrated on simply reselling third party products often without value added after sales services. While we do see longer term value in this business, some of the revenue generating intangible assets have been slower than originally anticipated to generate revenues and a retained customer base. Discretionary spend includes a number of new office locations that have either been acquired or moved into in the year ending 31 May 2017 . The Group’s primary banking covenants are: z Leverage limit of 2.5 times and this is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA / net debt. However, the Group’s risk management programme can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that principal risks are managed to an acceptable level. If such rights are not sufficiently protected, the Group could potentially no longer be able to offer a particular service in some or all countries. Furthermore, as the Group’s international footprint expands, there is an inherent risk of adverse foreign exchange movements affecting profitability. The rapid changes occurring in our marketplaces mean that a longer period would not have an acceptable level of forecasting accuracy. z All materials specified for the building had a reduced life cycle impact in terms of their CO 2 emissions and environmental degradation potential. Prior to joining NCC Group Brian held a number of senior finance positions with both publicly listed and private multinational companies. The Directors who held office during FY 2017 were as follows: Director Role Details Chris Stone Executive Chairman Appointed April 2017 . As noted previously, the Board consciously chose a new Non- Executive Director with specific digital market experience in order to meet an identified gap. There is a regular dialogue with institutional investors including presentations after the Company’s year-end and half year results announcements. Areas assessed as requiring a “high” level of judgement tend to rely more heavily on management estimates and historical trends than extensive independent third party evidence. Intangible assets carrying value (Including acquired intangibles, software and capitalised development costs) (recurring item: see Note 1 1 to the financial statements). It has consulted on its proposals with major shareholders and shareholder advisory groups and has decided that no changes are proposed to the structure of remuneration or the quantum of incentives but that it will make some changes to ensure we reflect most recent best practice. 35 per cent of any bonus payment is invested in nominal cost share options and deferred for a two year period. Tax equalisation may also be considered if an Executive is adversely affected by taxation due to their employment with the Company. The Committee’s policy is to offer service contracts for Executive Directors with notice periods of between six and twelve months exercisable by either party. Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise. Although Rob Cotton’s Service Agreement provides for a 12 month notice period, it was mutually agreed that this would be reduced to a period of eight months’ garden leave, during which he would receive payment by monthly instalments equating to eight months’ salary, pension and car allowance (total of £399,600). It was also agreed that he would continue to receive other benefits as usual during this garden leave period. All eligible employees, including Executive Directors, may be invited to participate on similar terms for a fixed period of three years. 1 16,714 shares were transferred out of treasury in order to satisfy options exercised under the Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan for Executive Directors and senior management. All shareholders will be notified by post or email, at their request, when the documents have been made available. We conducted reviews of financial information (including enquiry) at a further five (2016: seven) non- significant components as these components were not individually financially significant enough to require an audit for Group reporting purposes but a review was performed to provide further coverage over the Group’s results. For the remaining five components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these. The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. However, while we can manage and disclose some aspects of those as individual operating segments, they are all managed under the Escrow division’s senior executive team. However, similar to Escrow, the different activities came together under an Assurance management team for strategic and resource allocation decision-making. Acquisition costs relating to professional fees totalling £0.4m were incurred and are recognised as individually significant items in the income statement (note 3). The Group’s consolidated income statement includes eight months’ post acquisition trading, with PSC Inc contributing £5.9m revenue and £1.2m operating profit. Acquisition costs relating to professional fees totalling £0.2m were incurred and are recognised as individually significant items in the income statement (note 3). Acquisition costs relating to professional fees totalling £1.9m were incurred and are recognised as individually significant items in the income statement account (note 3). The Group’s prior year consolidated income statement includes six months’ post acquisition trading, with Fox-IT contributing £14.0m revenue and £1.3m operating profit.
