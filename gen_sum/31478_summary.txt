Constant renovation of the circuit takes place, and new sites are developed to maximise Cinema City’s potential. It has been a pleasure working with both Nisan and Dean during 2017 as they took on their new roles. Our on-site concessions aim to be best in class, providing a variety of food, drink and snack options. Three new VIP locations were opened during the year in Zichron (Israel), Chodov (Czech Republic) and Wroclaw (Poland). There is a strong movie slate for 2018, which includes “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom”, “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald“, “Avengers: Infinity War”, “Incredibles 2”, “Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again”, “Solo: A Star Wars Story”, “Deadpool 2”, “Fifty Shades Freed”, “Mary Poppins Returns” and many more. Where there are site closures, especially of older sites in the UK, this also provides further opportunities for new investments. Visiting the cinema remains a convenient, affordable out-of-home activity, especially when compared with other leisure activities such as concerts and sporting events.

They are focused on ensuring that our customers feel more from the very start of their cinema experience.

In the UK we also cater for different consumer tastes with our combination of modern multiplexes and arthouse cinemas. 15 Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance Admissions m +3.5% 93.6 100.3 103.8 2015 2016 2017 Strategy and Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) The right strategy to grow our business Measuring our progress Measuring our progress Provide the best cinema experience Expand and enhance our estate Number of new screens 125 2016: 142 Total number of screens 2,217 2016: 2,115 Number of major refurbishments completed 6 2016: 9 ...to give our customers a choice of how to watch a movie, with a range of retail offerings, all underpinned by the best customer service ...to provide consistent, high quality, modern cinemas When selecting new sites for development or sites for refurbishment we consider the location, accessibility, competition, and other local economic factors. This is on the basis that we do not trade across borders but within territories, we are an attractive place to work and therefore have many applications for roles, and the nature of our business has a proven consumer appeal throughout all economic cycles. This allows us to capitalise on specific local area demand for type and content of movies shown. Although we have not experienced any breaches from these, cyber risk has been a Board focus throughout the year. Retail spend may also decrease due to changes in customer preferences, decreased disposable income or other economic and cultural factors. If the Group loses key people this could have an impact on its ability to deliver business objectives. Mitigation activity Æ Æ We receive communications from relevant government authorities and law enforcement agencies which keep us informed and allow us, when needed, to monitor any potential impact external events could have on the security of our cinema estate. The Group actively encourages our future film-going audience by specifically tailoring film schedules to attract families and young people.

We focus on ensuring that they have a positive experience every time to increase the likelihood of repeat visits.

Customer surveys and mystery shopper visits also take place to ensure customers are receiving the optimum viewer experience. The LTIP will continue to measure performance against stretching EPS growth targets over a three year period. Awards may vest after three years, subject to continuing employment and the achievement of stretching three-year EPS growth performance conditions.

In addition, the Company regularly carries out engagement surveys which enable employees to share their views with management. PwC has no other connections with Cineworld except as providing internal audit support to the Company’s Risk and Assurance team.

Company pension contributions/allowances for the period were: £000 Moshe Greidinger 114 Israel Greidinger 78 Nisan Cohen 42 Other Benefits (audited information) Benefits in kind for Executive Directors comprised the provision of a company car or car allowance, private mileage, life insurance, permanent health insurance and private medical cover.

Therefore, from a carbon management perspective, minimal significance should be placed on fluctuations to this figure, which represents 1% of total emissions. Forecast-based valuation The carrying value of property, plant and equipment balances at an individual cinema level may not be recoverable through future cash flows as national and local factors, such as movie slates or increased competition, can materially affect site performance. 75 Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance Independent Auditor’s Report continued We continue to perform procedures over onerous lease provisions £3.6m (2016: £2.4m) but have not assessed it as one of the most significant risks in our current year audit as fewer leased cinemas are trading at a loss than in the past and as a result, the potential for a material error in this area has diminished. The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all years presented in these Group financial statements. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each Balance Sheet date. On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to the Statement of Profit or Loss. For goodwill assets that have an indefinite useful economic life, the recoverable amount is estimated at each Balance Sheet date. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss. The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. Accounting Policies continued Operating Segments An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. At 31 December 2017 the Group had unrecognised potential tax assets relating to the following temporary differences: • UK capital losses of £7.5m with no expiry date • Overseas tax losses of £0.5m with no expiry date It is not considered probable that future taxable profit will be available against which these deductible temporary differences can be utilised. For established sites, expected future cash flows are based on financial budgets approved by the Board of Directors covering a one year period. Given the short term admissions trends and ticket price inflation, sensitivities applied are believed to reflect a potential downside scenario. As such EBITDAR has been reduced to reflect an 18% reduction in mature admissions and related cash flows. The recoverable amounts of UK and Cinema City CGU Groups have been determined based on a value in use calculation. That calculation uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period. The calculations are based on the following assumptions: • Discount at 31 December 2017 2.08% • Expected returns on plan assets at 31 December 2017 1.73% The net provision for accrued employee rights upon retirement comprises: 31 December 2017 £m 31 December 2016 £m Present value of unfunded obligation 4.2 3.3 Less: Fair value of plan assets (1.9) (1.5) 2.3 1.8 Movements in the provision for accrued employee rights upon retirement: Gross amount £m Amount deposited £m Net amount £m At start of period 3.3 (1.5) 1.8 Payments made upon retirement (0.1) (0.6) (0.7) Net movement in provision – charged to net profit 0.9 0.2 1.1 Foreign exchange movements 0.1 0 0.1 4.2 (1.9) 2.3 111 Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance 18.
