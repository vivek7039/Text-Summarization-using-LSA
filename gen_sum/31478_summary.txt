cineworld group plc was founded. constant renovation of the circuit takes place, and new sites are developed to maximise cinema city’s potential. the picturehouse membership scheme includes discounts on tickets, access to exclusive previews and special events. the cinemas show a range of popular films from both international and local producers. adjusted profit before tax is used an internal measure by management, as they believe it better reflects the underlying performance of the group and therefore a more meaningful comparison of performance from period to period. constant currency movements have been calculated by applying the 2017 average exchange rates to 2016 performance. it has been a pleasure working with both nisan and dean during 2017 as they took on their new roles. we will have an excellent geographically diversified estate, and the movie release slate looks strong. our on-site concessions aim to be best in class, providing a variety of food, drink and snack options. three new vip locations were opened during the year in zichron (israel), chodov (czech republic) and wroclaw (poland). the schemes also bring operational benefits by encouraging repeat visits, often at off-peak times. these focus on us having an energy and passion for all aspects of our business. we have a further 75 screens scheduled to open in 2018. new sites will be opened across both the uk and row. there is a strong movie slate for 2018, which includes “jurassic world: fallen kingdom”, “fantastic beasts: the crimes of grindelwald“, “avengers: infinity war”, “incredibles 2”, “mamma mia! here we go again”, “solo: a star wars story”, “deadpool 2”, “fifty shades freed”, “mary poppins returns” and many more. where there are site closures, especially of older sites in the uk, this also provides further opportunities for new investments. although online streaming and downloading of films at home is increasingly popular, an outing to the cinema provides a unique experience which cannot be replicated at home, especially with superior experiences offered by technologies such as imax and 4dx. visiting the cinema remains a convenient, affordable out-of-home activity, especially when compared with other leisure activities such as concerts and sporting events. where there are site closures, especially of older sites in the uk, this also provides further

innovation we are always striving to bring the latest innovation to our cinemas – not only through technology but through the design of our new and refurbished sites and retail offerings. for the second year we have partnered with bbc’s children in need, raising £450,000. we have six different formats in which our customers can watch a movie: regular screens, 3d, 4dx, imax, superscreen and vip auditoriums. in the uk we also cater for different consumer tastes with our combination of modern multiplexes and arthouse cinemas. 15 cineworld group plc annual report and accounts 2017 strategic

management supporting growth through effective risk management principal risks and uncertainties operating as a cinema chain that is now in ten different territories presents a number of risks and uncertainties that continue to be the focus of the board’s ongoing attention. this is on the basis that we do not trade across borders but within territories, we are an attractive place to work and therefore have many applications for roles, and the nature of our business has a proven consumer appeal throughout all economic cycles. this allows us to capitalise on specific local area demand for type and content of movies shown. although we have not experienced any breaches from these, cyber risk has been a board focus throughout the year. impact retail/concession sales generally fluctuate in line with admissions and the genre of film on show. retail spend may also decrease due to changes in customer preferences, decreased disposable income or other economic and cultural factors. 20

objectives. mitigation activity æ æ a structure is in place to support effective strategy development, as well as ongoing reporting and monitoring of business performance on a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual basis. æ æ one focus in the year has been on working towards compliance with gdpr that will be mandatory from may 2018. a combination of data audits and data mapping exercises have been undertaken across the group to help prioritise key areas for improvement. mitigation activity æ æ we receive communications from relevant government authorities and law enforcement agencies which keep us informed and allow us, when needed, to monitor any potential impact external events could have on the security of our cinema estate. this scheme was successfully extended to poland at the end of 2015. we also have a number of other membership schemes across the uk and other territories which offer discounts and allow us to interact frequently with our customer base. the group actively encourages our future film-going audience by specifically tailoring film schedules to attract families and young people. concessionary rates are offered for senior citizens and students at certain times of the day. in some of our territories, there are no classification guidelines, and in such cases we provide information to customers about films so they can make informed choices about the type of film being shown. we also ensure that all trailers are complementary in terms of suitability to the main feature. i was promoted to a cinema manager – i firmly believe the apprenticeship was successful in helping forge my cineworld career.” ranjeet nanrah 25 cineworld group plc annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report financial statements corporate governance chief financial officer’s review delivering strong growth “ the group adjusted ebitda increased by 12.7% to £198.2m” office revenues of 6.4%. constant currency movements have been calculated by applying the 2017 average exchange rates to 2016 performance. the uk and ireland adjusted ebitda margin of 19.0% represented a 0.7 percentage point decline from 2016, largely as a result of no virtual print fee (“vpf”) income during the year and increases in business rates. as the group operates in nine territories, it is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. wherever possible, cash income and expenditure are settled in local currency to mitigate exchange losses. good governance is a discipline that is particularly important during times of growth and, as we embark on this exciting new chapter for the group, following the successful acquisition of regal, it will remain a key focus going forward. dean moore, who had been interim cfo, was appointed as an independent non-executive director. both nisan and dean bring extensive experience to the board, something we have already seen in action since their appointments. further details of the work of the remuneration committee in this area may be found

previously reported as significant accounting judgements or sources of estimation uncertainty have been removed in the 2017 annual report, and for other areas further clarity has been provided to

loss of office to directors can only be made if they are consistent with this policy or otherwise approved by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders. to determine the elements and level of remuneration appropriate for each executive director, the committee considers, when appropriate, benchmark remuneration data for selected comparable companies and seeks to ensure that an appropriately significant proportion of potential pay is performance-related, and that total pay opportunity is consistent with appropriate superior levels of pay for superior performance. the weighting of measures for this element is circa 80% budgeted adjusted ebitda and 20% personal performance. n/a 52 cineworld group plc annual report and accounts 2017 policy table executive directors’ remuneration currently

financial statements corporate governance 1. accounting policies basis of preparation cineworld group plc (the “company”) is a company incorporated in the uk. the revolving credit facility is subject to springing covenants which are triggered above 35% utilisation. the group’s investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. adjusted profit before tax is calculated by adding back amortisation of intangible assets (excluding acquired movie distribution rights), and certain non cash items and foreign exchange as set out in note 5. adjusted profit before tax is an internal measure used by management, as they believe it better reflects the underlying performance of the group and therefore a more meaningful comparison of performance from period to period. foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. subsequently they are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses. depreciation methods, residual values and the useful lives of all assets are reassessed annually. intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. on initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to the statement of profit or loss. for goodwill assets that have an indefinite useful economic life, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date. net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. the fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 88 cineworld group plc annual report and accounts 2017 1. accounting

from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the group’s other components. such developments would then further inform our best estimate in line with the approach above. 91 cineworld group plc annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report financial statements corporate governance 1. accounting policies continued new standards and interpretations the accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year. on adoption of ifrs 9 this is not expected to have a material impact on the group’s current accounting in respect of financial instruments; however, it is expected there will be changes in the disclosure requirements. at 31 december 2017 the group had unrecognised potential tax assets relating to the following temporary differences: • uk capital losses of £7.5m with no expiry date • overseas tax losses of £0.5m with no expiry date it is not considered probable that future taxable profit will be available against which these deductible temporary differences can be utilised. a table summarising the rates used, which are derived from externally benchmarked data, is set out below: year ended 31 december 2017 £m year ended 31 december 2016 £m united kingdom 9.9% 9.2% poland 12.4% 12.7% israel 11.9% (1) 12.7% (1) hungary 10.7% 13.0% romania 11.4% 11.8% czech

£13.06%) was used to reflect the specific risks related to those cgus. for established sites, expected future cash flows are based on financial budgets approved by the board of directors covering a one year period. given the short term admissions trends and ticket price inflation, sensitivities applied are believed to reflect a potential downside scenario. as such ebitdar has been reduced to reflect an 18% reduction in mature admissions and related cash flows. the recoverable amounts of uk and cinema city cgu groups have been determined based on a value in use calculation. that calculation uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period. the cinema city cgu groups have discounted forecast cash flows using a pre-tax discount rates relevant to the operating territory of each cgu group (see note 9), being a market participant’s discount rate. where leases include options to extend beyond the existing contracted term this was taken into consideration. this provisional fair value will be reviewed as further information on the assets acquired becomes available. 31 december 2017 £m 31 december 2016 £m
