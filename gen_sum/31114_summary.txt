fourthquarter highlights centralnic group plc annual report 2017 1 “ ” financial highlights for 2017 revenue £24.3m fy 2016: £22.1m i am pleased to report on another year of growth at centralnic, as the group took further steps in its strategy to build a diversiﬁed internet services business of size and scale, through an acquisitive roll-up programme which delivers high-levels of recurring revenues, quality of earnings and strong cash generation. • don baladasan joined the board on 24 july 2017 as chief financial officer, bringing significant m&a and integration experience. • exclusive wholesaler contract with xyz.com, owner of the .xyz top-level domain (“tld”), renegotiated for a term running until may 2032. it sells domain names and website products to every type of internet user in over 250 countries. centralnic’s registry backend continues to maintain an uptime which consistently exceeds the required standards set by industry regulator icann. with 60 locations distributed around the world, centralnic’s dns handles over 1 billion queries per day. the division retails domain names to customers in over 250 countries globally through its 24 online retail brands and websites. the division’s various brands address demand from many customer segments including: retail customers – that purchase domain names and associated products for non-business related websites. target customers typically require “trade” pricing and sophisticated tools for managing large domain name portfolios on behalf of third parties. unlike trade marks, this new form of ip can be operated by a company exclusively, globally and in perpetuity. the acquisition was funded by the company’s own cash reserves and a term loan and revolving credit facility totalling £18 million provided by silicon valley bank, which also provides a £3 million overdraft facility. in line with the group’s strategy, whilst premium domain name trading is a profitable activity, premium domain name sales will be a decreasing proportion of revenues and contribution going forward as the company focuses on building recurring revenue based business activities. this represents an opportunity to create a group with advanced technology platforms delivering significant recurring revenues for every major customer type within the industry. mike turner chairman 30 may 2018 centralnic group plc annual report 2017 9 chief executive’s report overview centralnic continued to develop as an internet services business of substantial scale that is highly cash generative and built around a recurring revenue model. enterprise revenues from centralnic’s enterprise division decreased slightly in 2017, down to £4.1 million (2016: £4.6 million), reflecting the group’s strategy to decrease the proportion of its overall revenues obtained through one-off premium domain name sales. with centralnic’s assistance, a number of corporate clients completed the icann delegation process in 2017 and have begun to prepare their “dotbrand” top level domains for use. acquisitions: progressing centralnic’s strategy moving forward, centralnic will continue to identify acquisitions that will add scale and new market leading technology platforms to serve its customers as well as creating opportunities for savings by eliminating duplication in costs. in july, don baladasan joined the board as chief financial officer, bringing significant public company acquisition and integration experience. centralnic also continued winning new clients, including the .ooo tld, owned by billion-dollar mumbai-listed tech company, infibeam. this helps underpin its strategy, with a group-wide passion for entering and competing proﬁtably in new markets. this includes recruiting a highly-experienced management team with complementary skill-sets and significant staff resources able to support customers around the world. these platforms are presented to the buyers through a number of retail websites focused on different market segments and geographies. centralnic’s registrars take advantage of these opportunities in the markets they serve, often delivering strong results. for country code market extensions, centralnic works with the local providers to develop marketing, distribution and policy initiatives. for example, the country code for lao pdr (.la) has been repurposed to address the alternative geographies of centralnic group plc annual report 2017 13 centralnic’s strategy for continuing its growth is to increase its scale and scope of operations by developing and operating scalable software platforms to serve global markets with domain names and related services. strategic report continued los angeles and latin america, while successfully retaining its country’s national internet identity. these include sales, marketing, policy and technical development resources on a fee-for-service or revenue share model. in either case, the group’s revenues could reduce below expectations with an impact on proﬁtability. the group has created a resilient network infrastructure and domain name system server constellation, with failover secondary systems to ensure critical registry functions are maintained. the wholesale business has been certiﬁed under iso 27001/2013 for data security, thereby mitigating risk by adherence to international best practice. fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect the group’s reported proﬁts and make its overseas contracts relatively less valuable. aim and corporate overheads, which have not been allocated by division, were consistent with the prior year at £1.0m (2016: £1.0m). the group has held reserves in each of these currencies to meet trading obligations as required. benjamin crawford chief executive officer (aged 52) ben is

£170,000). where considered appropriate performance materiality may be reduced to a lower level, such as, for related party transactions and directors’ remuneration. errors below that threshold would
