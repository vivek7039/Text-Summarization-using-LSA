introduction having taken over as chief executive of brooks macdonald in april 2017 , i am delighted to present my first report covering a year when we have continued to deliver strong underlying group performance, although statutory profit has fallen principally as a result of the previously announced provision for legacy matters . as a result of the hard work and dedication of all our staff under chris macdonald’s prior leadership, i have joined a business that is well positioned in the market and i intend to build on this strong foundation . i have been particularly impressed by our culture with its strong emphasis on client relationships and service . growth in funds under management and underlying profit a conducive market environment for risk assets continued through the year

above-benchmark returns according to asset risk consultants (arc) private client indices over one, three and five year periods . in november we were, for the second consecutive year, awarded the prestigious industry gold standard award for service in discretionary fund management and we were once again proud to receive five star ratings from defaqto for each of the main discretionary offerings: our bespoke portfolio service (“bps”), direct managed portfolio service (“mps”) and our platform mps . we were successful at the citywire regional star awards in 2017 , with professional advisers voting for our leamington spa and tunbridge wells offices as winners of their respective geographical categories . our uk mps, consisting of ten portfolios with distinct risk profiles and objectives, is available to those investing smaller amounts and allows our investment management capabilities to be accessed by a wider range of individuals through their financial advisers . in the

the former spearpoint business as announced in july, following a detailed review, we decided to deal proactively with certain legacy matters arising from the former spearpoint business which we acquired in 2012 . we anticipate that this action will cost £6 .5m and have made a provision for it accordingly . some further post migration work remains, which will complete by the calendar year end . accordingly, as more fully explained in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, there was a fair value reduction of £2 . group performance brooks macdonald group plc | annual report and

deferred in shares for 2 years . • robust malus and clawback provisions will apply to any bonus earned, including the deferred element . first-line supervision teams carry out monitoring of business

approaches are reasonable . • we read correspondence with legal advisors, consultants and regulators, as well as the group’s press releases, for any matters which we were not previously made aware of and which could indicate that the provision may not be complete . the fees are calculated by applying each client’s fee rate to their fum . 1% of net assets is a commonly used industry benchmark for holding entities such as the company . however, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s and company’s ability to continue as a going concern . the directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
