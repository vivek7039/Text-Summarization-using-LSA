Caroline brings more than 20 years’ experience in the financial services industry, most recently as Head of UK Premier and Wealth at HSBC. Richard Spencer and Simon Wombwell are not seeking re-election to the board at this year’s AGM, although both will continue as key members of the Group Executive Committee, as Chief Investment Officer and Head of UK Distribution respectively. Nevertheless, the Group is well-positioned to weather any turbulence, with a strong balance sheet (net cash £32.2m (2016: £19.5m)). As a result of the hard work and dedication of all our staff under Chris Macdonald’s prior leadership, I have joined a business that is well positioned in the market and I intend to build on this strong foundation . I have been particularly impressed by our culture with its strong emphasis on client relationships and service . We have maintained strong new business flows, largely driven by our close relationships with advisers . We continue to add value through our centralised investment process, with portfolios across all risk mandates achieving above-benchmark returns according to Asset Risk Consultants (ARC) private client indices over one, three and five year periods . In November we were, for the second consecutive year, awarded the prestigious industry Gold Standard Award for service in discretionary fund management and we were once again proud to receive five star ratings from Defaqto for each of the main discretionary offerings: our Bespoke Portfolio Service (“BPS”), direct Managed Portfolio Service (“MPS”) and our platform MPS . We were successful at the Citywire Regional Star Awards in 2017 , with professional advisers voting for our Leamington Spa and Tunbridge Wells offices as winners of their respective geographical categories . Our UK MPS, consisting of ten portfolios with distinct risk profiles and objectives, is available to those investing smaller amounts and allows our investment management capabilities to be accessed by a wider range of individuals through their financial advisers . Our International business based in the Channel Islands delivered good growth, with discretionary FUM increasing by 13 . Sale of our Property Management business We recently completed a review of Braemar Estates and have taken the decision to sell the business, enabling us to focus more closely on our core offerings . Legacy matters arising from the former Spearpoint business As announced in July, following a detailed review, we decided to deal proactively with certain legacy matters arising from the former Spearpoint business which we acquired in 2012 . We anticipate that this action will cost £6 .5m and have made a provision for it accordingly . Some further post migration work remains, which will complete by the calendar year end . Accordingly, as more fully explained in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, there was a fair value reduction of £2 . The Property Management business had another improved year with an increase in revenue of 16 . As well as these issues consuming management time, the Group was incurring associated costs, so in order to treat our clients fairly and to protect their best interests we have made a provision during the year of £6 .5m in order to resolve these matters, resulting in a statutory loss before tax for the year of £6 .

The committee consulted with major shareholders on a new remuneration structure and policy for these senior executive directors . The scheme will be aligned with the board’s appetite for risk and aims to be fair for both employee and Company with due regard to market competitiveness, whilst retaining some element of discretion . • Robust malus and clawback provisions will apply to any bonus earned, including the deferred element . The Group represents a target for hackers and is at significant risk of attack . Mitigation The Group’s systems employ firewalls and other technological security features to prevent unauthorised access . Regular technological security checks are undertaken to validate the access rights of existing users . There are further risks in the on-boarding of outsourcing partners and ongoing support from them . The Group’s most significant outsourcing risk relates to its IT network infrastructure, which is provided by an outsourced service provider . The Group operates a graduate training scheme in respect of its trainee investment fund managers and financial planning consultants . All members of staff have the option to take an interest free annual season ticket loan . Long serving employees are entitled to additional annual leave dependent on their length of service . Our audit approach Overview • Overall group materiality: £727 ,000 (2016: £778,000), based on 5% of profit before tax, adjusted by the provision for resolving legacy matters . Based on the work performed above, management’s impairment review and deferred consideration valuation approaches are reasonable . • We read correspondence with legal advisors, consultants and regulators, as well as the group’s press releases, for any matters which we were not previously made aware of and which could indicate that the provision may not be complete . The fees are calculated by applying each client’s fee rate to their FUM . 1% of net assets is a commonly used industry benchmark for holding entities such as the company .

In addition, the classification criteria for allocating financial assets between categories are different under IFRS 9 . Other available for sale assets comprise preference share holdings and these will likely be classified as FVOCI as the Group’s intention is to collect all contractual cash flows, being solely payments of principal and interest . Deferred consideration is recognised at its fair value, being an estimate of the amount that will ultimately be payable in future periods . k) Fiduciary activities The Group commonly acts as trustee and in other fiduciary capacities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals, trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions . On acquisition, any goodwill acquired is allocated to cash generating units for the purposes of impairment testing . Otherwise, they are presented as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position . Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received (net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects) is included within equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders . The Group’s other activity, offering nominee and custody services to clients, is included within Investment management .

Payments made to acquire such contracts are stated at cost and amortised on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of five years . The fund was launched in February 2014 and offers investors liquid exposure to global real estate markets . Deferred consideration Deferred consideration is split between non-current liabilities (see below) and provisions within current liabilities (note 24) to the extent that it is due for payment within one year of the reporting date . Deferred consideration is measured at its fair value based on discounted expected future cash flows . Amounts falling due after more than one year from the reporting date are presented in non-current liabilities as shown below: 2017 £’000 2016 £’000 At 1 July 5,290 9,442 Finance cost of deferred consideration 263 498 Fair value adjustments (2,230) (3,343) Transfer to current liabilities (1,603) (1,307) At 30 June 1,720 5,290 During the year, no deferred consideration was recognised on acquisitions .
