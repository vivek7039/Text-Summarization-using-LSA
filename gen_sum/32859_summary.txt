measurement requirements of ifrs 9. it expects to continue measuring at fair value all financial assets currently held at fair value. consequently, under ifrs 15 the group will continue to recognise revenue from its lump-sum engineering, procurement and construction project execution services contracts over time rather than at a point of time • contract modifications, e.g. variation orders, will be accounted for as part of the existing contract, with a cumulative catch up adjustment to revenue. tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those monetary items are also

effective interest rate (eir) method, less accumulated impairment charges. for earlier awards 50% of the total award is subject to achieving between 0.0% and 7 .5% earnings per share (eps) growth
