as a non-executive director. we also chose to re-base our dividend in may 2017 and this prudent approach was broadly welcomed by investors. from an operational perspective, our approach will continue to be characterised by these three themes: flawless execution, reduced capital intensity, and organic growth. even so, there is no room for complacency and we must continue to retain our focus in this area. having led the remuneration committee since 2010, thomas made a particularly strong contribution, for which i thank him. during 2017 we were reassured that there is a strong pipeline of talent coming through at all levels. i know that, with rené médori succeeding me, the board will remain in safe hands. as a result of rené’s change in role, matthias bichsel will assume the role of senior

and, in 2017 , were awarded a us$2 billion contract from duqm refinery and petrochemical industries llc where we are a 50/50 joint venture partner with samsung engineering. we are confident that, by replicating this approach, we can achieve similar success in downstream markets, such as petrochemicals, and win a share of the substantial capital investments that are planned in this sector. we have also driven further significant reductions in capital spending, and are bringing increased visibility to our cash management. we completed more than 239 million man-hours across the group, handing over several projects to our clients. meanwhile, the events of 2017 forced a refresh of the senior leadership teams, with several internal promotions and a few external appointments, including john

culture and employee engagement. most recently, he was regional managing director, e&c with responsibility for all petrofac’s onshore operations in kuwait, iraq and oman. in this role, he ensures that petrofac identifies and implements opportunities for incremental enhancements to its operational capabilities. we operate in a challenging environment and understand that risks are an inherent part of our business. safety, compliance, operational, commercial and finance matters are now petrofac operates in a challenging environment. viability statement 28 / petrofac annual report and accounts 2017 risk management continued principal risks are those risks that, given the group’s current position, could materially threaten the business model, future performance, prospects, solvency, liquidity, reputation, or prevent us from delivering our strategic objectives. recent global economic conditions have had a significant impact on countries whose economies are exposed to the downturn in commodities, placing greater pressure on governments to find alternative means of raising revenues and increasing the risk of social and labour unrest. cost or schedule overruns on any of these projects could negatively impact the group’s profitability, cash flows and relationships with key stakeholders. there are several factors that could impact our ability to operate safely, ethically and effectively. we continued our focus on crisis management training with exercises being held at the group and project levels. we introduced a global cash management tool and increased our focus on working capital management during 2017. the risk of financial or commercial exposure if counterparties (such as key financial institutions, clients, partners, subcontractors or vendors) default on

tie-in works to existing brownfield infrastructure, and will have the capacity to produce around 120,000 barrels of oil per day together with associated water, gas and condensate. with early engineering work already underway, the project will support sakhalin energy in maintaining its export gas capacity. net margin was stable at 6.5% (2016: 6.4%), with improved project profitability largely offset by lower overhead recovery and deferred tax charges. by sharing learnings between the two projects we’ve created more certainty on delivery and nurtured a culture of continual learning. in our core middle eastern markets, clients often favour the lump-sum turnkey solution, but there are some who prefer more integration and control. we have been operating in mexico since 2012 through a series of production enhancement contracts (pecs). it was recognised by both parties that a simplified ownership structure would best position the pánuco pec for migration. shareholders can elect by close of business on the record date to change their dividend currency election. for further details of amounts comprising exceptional items and certain re-measurements, see note 5 to the consolidated

compared to an industry average of 0.21 (iogp , 2016 figures).some of the more significant achievements include: – britannia and kittiwake uk offshore assets achieved 14 and 12 year lti-free milestones respectively – eight years lti-free at the jasmine fpso in the gulf of thailand – zadco uz750 project in the uae reached more than 58 million man-hours lti-free – kuwait oil company presented a safety award for achieving 50 million safe man-hours – 53 million man-hours without an lti at the sohar refinery improvement programme in oman – in malaysia we received two awards from petronas for excellence in safety, health & environment and for integrated operational & asset integrity assurance. • implementing an offshore structures survey programme – following the recent pipeline surveys and tank surveys, we performed a systematic review of all petrofac-operated offshore structures, established a better understanding of risks, and developed improvement programmes. developments in 2017 included: • launched new security focal point training – to ensure consistency of approach and reporting, we launched a new one-day training course for senior personnel at any sites where the threat does not warrant a dedicated project security manager. they are based in each of our key locations, use common tools, follow consistent processes, and deliver against a business-focused hr strategy. our petrovoices survey enables us to monitor employee engagement, build on strengths and address concerns. as evidence of this, we saw a continued reduction in our headcount, which fell by around 7 .5% to reach 12,500. this was as a result of further efficiency gains and our formal exit from various operations. 12,500 headcount at 31 december 2017 (7.5% overall

chief executive ayman asfari met personally with 125 of our most senior people to update them on the company strategy and understand their career goals. the focus groups continue to meet periodically, and our next petrovoices survey is scheduled for 2018. building an engaged workforce with a sense of ownership we actively encourage employee share ownership, believing that it builds commitment to the company’s goals. in 2018 we will be launching an online cv tool to assist internal recruitment and development across the organisation. across the company, we also encourage a culture of active community engagement, and support many related initiatives. • strategic corporate giving – across the group, we support community-based initiatives, with a particular focus on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (stem) education. for example, our community engagement approach and credentials play an increasingly prominent role in the bidding process. in both delhi and chennai, we support the bharat lok shiksha parishad (blsp) welfare programme, which funds 200 one-teacher schools, known as ekal vidyalayas. highlights from 2017 include: in the uae around us$300,000 was contributed to various charities and initiatives. this was a considerable increase on 2016, thanks largely to our employees’ involvement in the relay for life event organised by friends of cancer patients (focp). in malaysia at the end of 2016, to commemorate achieving a 50 million man-hours lti-free milestone, our e&c division donated us$50,000 split across 10 countries. the total amount was donated to a number of local and national uk charities nominated by our employees. to keep standards high, the petrofac-built onsite accommodation that houses 1,800 workers and supervisors is

annual report and accounts 2017 / 61 corporate responsibility continued as an oil field services company that designs, develops and operates large-scale facilities, petrofac’s business is directly linked to environmental considerations. we conduct comprehensive environmental risk assessments and reviews in all stages of our new projects. we also follow a systematic approach to environmental management, even in places where this is not required by local regulations. furthermore, for all of our business lines, we aim to achieve a 2% year-on-year reduction in greenhouse gas emission intensity over the baseline year of 2015, with a 20% reduction by 2030. these targets are supported by strategies and actions to optimise energy consumption, implement technical solutions, and encourage employee-led initiatives. in doing so, they consider the entire life cycle of a project, and are often able to propose solutions that can have significant long-term environmental benefits. mexico our mexican teams initiated a bio-remediation project to treat soil that has been contaminated with spilt hydrocarbons. johnson controls, who provide a range of building services at our two sharjah office towers, awarded the team their 2017 energy management award. the risks associated with non-compliance with laws and regulations can be significant and the board is therefore committed to ensuring that robust internal controls are in place to mitigate threats that may be encountered. the petrofac board, made up of six different nationalities, with both male and female members, is already diverse, but we will continue to keep this matter under review. key strengths extensive background in a variety of functional roles, including sales, finance, procurement and logistics. after

offshore training (bosiet) at the petrofac training facility in aberdeen, which allowed them, along with rijnhard van tets and other senior management, to visit the fpf-1 floating production facility, operated by us for ithaca. both our executive directors have rolling service contracts, containing a notice period provision of 12 months’ by either party. it is felt these presentations also enable directors to deepen their understanding of petrofac at both a local and functional level, while gaining an awareness of specific nuances which may not always be obvious within written reports. we believe this gives directors the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of our operations, and to recognise some of the challenges being faced on a day-to-day basis by our employees, in what can sometimes be difficult and remote locations. accordingly, led by rené médori as sid, an evaluation of rijnhard van tets was carried out. develop a roadmap for the future in terms of both business direction and geographical focus. individually tailored induction programmes are prepared for each new appointee, which is considered to be the optimal approach. detailed briefings are also provided in order that they may quickly gain a deeper understanding of petrofac at an operational level. as set out in our nominations committee report on pages 80 and 81, sara akbar joined the board on 1 january 2018. a detailed programme is being arranged for her to be completed during the course of 2018. dealing with potential conflicts of interest processes and procedures are in place in the event that any potential conflict arises during a term of appointment. all directors have a duty to update the whole board of any changes in personal circumstances. petrofac’s security function presented plans to continue ensuring the safest possible travel and workplace for our staff. as a result, the potential for fines, penalties or other consequences, including reputational damage and an exclusion from bidding on certain contracts, cannot currently be assessed. our investor relations team acts as a focal point for contact with investors throughout the year and brokers’ research notes are regularly circulated to all directors. a formal broker’s report is circulated to directors in advance of each board meeting. accordingly, financial reports and shareholder documents, regulatory market announcements, together with recorded interviews, are all available on our website, which we believe allows shareholders to become more informed investors. this ensures a highly competent board that is effective and efficient to support petrofac’s future plans. having notified the committee of my intentions, a process was initiated to consider candidates with appropriate capabilities, knowledge, and experience. an e-learning training module on this policy was rolled out across the group during 2016 to ensure full understanding and consistent application. it is felt this will ensure that future growth can be supported by a developed and embedded risk management culture, which promotes sound business practices, even in tougher external environments. 2 rené médori is considered to have recent and relevant financial experience in compliance with the uk code. recognising the need for a systematic approach to be taken for managing risk, additional reports are also provided by senior management, including financial counterparty risk assessments, controls improvement plans, health and safety processes, security, and information technology. this sfmr policy is monitored on a monthly basis by the treasury management committee, which considers a number of risk exposures, including interest rate, foreign exchange rate, commodity pricing and counterparties, that could impact the group. claim scenario workshops continued during 2017 , which resulted in the incorporation of further wording enhancements into our existing programme. these workshops remain an integral part of the global insurance programme and greatly assist with gaining important insight into policy coverage and understanding how insurers are likely to respond to claims, based on hypothetical, but nonetheless realistic loss scenarios. impairment tests are often sensitive to minor changes in assumptions, for instance production profiles, forward oil and gas prices and capital expenditure plans, which have a consequent impact on whether an impairment charge is recognised or not in the consolidated financial statements. the committee was satisfied that group tax issues were being effectively monitored and dealt with appropriately. this policy was amended at the end of 2016 and became applicable with effect from 1 january 2017 . historically, ey have provided advice and in-country tax compliance services as it was felt that, given ey’s knowledge of the group and their presence in our core regions, they were the most appropriate provider of this work. we therefore propose to continue to operate in line with the uk reporting regulations and, accordingly, will be submitting our annual report on remuneration for an advisory shareholder vote at the 2018 annual general meeting (agm). by emphasising project delivery as its core competence and by maintaining cost competitiveness through operational excellence, petrofac was able to deliver a set of solid financial results while taking continued steps to reduce capital intensity and strengthening our balance sheet.

this report, no executive director holds an externally paid non-executive appointment. availability of documentation service contracts and letters of appointment for all directors are available for inspection by any person at our registered office in jersey and at our corporate services office in london. however, if there is any inconsistency between the company’s policy report (as approved by shareholders) and any contractual entitlement or other right of a director, the company may be obliged to honour that existing entitlement or right. • although both current uk-based executive directors have opted to receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension provision, this position is kept under review. • where executive directors are required to relocate, the committee may offer additional expatriate benefits, if considered appropriate. • the company accrues an amount each year in order to satisfy this indemnity when it falls due. minor amendments the committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment. the financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and ifrs. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. judgement is applied in recognising variation orders, project costs-to-complete, cost contingencies and provisions for liquidated damages. we performed full and specific scope audit procedures over this risk area in 5 locations, which covered 96% of total revenue. we concluded that the impairments and fair value charges on ies assets were appropriately determined. we identified tax exposures estimated by management, including those arising on business combinations, and gained an understanding of the risk analysis associated with these exposures along with claims or assessments made by tax authorities to date. for these components, we performed other procedures, including assessing and testing management’s group wide controls. 114 / petrofac annual report and accounts 2017 independent auditor’s report to the members of petrofac limited continued notes business performance 1 us$m

34 form part of these consolidated financial statements. ifrs 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018, with early application permitted. classification and measurement the group does not expect a significant impact on its consolidated statement of financial position on applying the classification and measurement requirements of ifrs 9. it expects to continue measuring at fair value all financial assets currently held at fair value. 120 / petrofac annual report and accounts 2017 notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2017 ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers ifrs 15 establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers. lump-sum engineering, procurement and construction project execution services the group currently accounts for lump-sum engineering, procurement and construction project execution services contracts as a single performance obligation and recognises revenue by reference to the stage of completion method (output method), based on surveys of work performed once the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably. consequently, under ifrs 15 the group will continue to recognise revenue from its lump-sum engineering, procurement and construction project execution services contracts over time rather than at a point of time • contract modifications, e.g. variation orders, will be accounted for as part of the existing contract, with a cumulative catch up adjustment to revenue. therefore, the group has concluded that there is not a significant financing component within such contracts. therefore, for short-term advances, the group will not account for a financing component even if it is a significant amount • the group has concluded that it operates as principal in all its reimbursable engineering and production services contracts. in addition, as required by ifrs 15, the group will disaggregate revenue recognised from contracts with customers into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. ifrs 16 leases ifrs 16 was issued in january 2016 and it replaces ias 17 leases, ifric 4 determining whether an arrangement contains a lease, sic-15 operating leases-incentives and sic-27 evaluating the substance of transactions involving the legal form of a lease. tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those monetary items are also recorded in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income. see note 28 • onerous operating lease provision: the group provides for future costs on its non-cancellable operating leases where it is considered probable that the leasehold office buildings will remain vacant in future years due to reduced business activity. when necessary, fair value less costs of disposal is estimated, for example, by reference to quoted market values, similar arm’s length transactions involving these assets or risk adjusted discounted cash flow models. for the following specific assets, certain assumptions and estimates have been made in determining recoverable amounts. as a result, actual costs could differ from estimated cost estimates used to provide for decommissioning obligations. intangible assets – non oil and gas assets intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially measured at cost being their fair values at the date of acquisition and are recognised separately from goodwill where the asset is separable or arises from a contractual or other legal right and its fair value can be measured reliably. intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. fair value related disclosures for financial instruments are disclosed in note 18. fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. after initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (eir) method, less accumulated impairment charges. gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the consolidated income statement. the group has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit or loss. after initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the eir method. the fair value of oil price collar contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. where awards include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied. unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each statement of financial position date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. fair value less costs of disposal is determined by discounting the post-tax cash flows expected to be generated from oil and gas production net of disposal costs taking into account assumptions that market participants would typically use in estimating fair values. post-tax cash flows are derived from projected production profiles for each asset taking into account forward market commodity prices over the relevant period and, where external forward prices are not available, the group’s board-approved five-year business planning assumptions were used. petrofac annual report and accounts 2017 / 143 financial statements 12
