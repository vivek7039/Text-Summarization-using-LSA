Building on our success in Iraq, securing several new contract awards and extensions which, together, are worth more than US$300 million. We also chose to re-base our dividend in May 2017 and this prudent approach was broadly welcomed by investors. From an operational perspective, our approach will continue to be characterised by these three themes: flawless execution, reduced capital intensity, and organic growth. Even so, there is no room for complacency and we must continue to retain our focus in this area. Finally, I want to thank all our employees for their continued commitment during a challenging year, and throughout my tenure on the Board.

We have also driven further significant reductions in capital spending, and are bringing increased visibility to our cash management. Measurement ROCE is calculated as EBITA (earnings before interest, tax and amortisation, calculated as EBITDA less depreciation per note 3 to the consolidated financial statements) divided by average capital employed (being total equity and non-current liabilities per the consolidated statement of financial position adjusted for gross up of finance lease creditors). 22 / Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 8% Description Provides an indication of the Group’s service capacity. Experience Joined Petrofac in 2016 from BG Group plc, where his responsibilities included corporate finance, M&A, strategy and business development. This includes developing a business-focused people strategy, including succession planning, talent management, leadership development, compensation, key hires, performance culture and employee engagement. Most recently, he was Regional Managing Director, E&C with responsibility for all Petrofac’s onshore operations in Kuwait, Iraq and Oman. In this role, he ensures that Petrofac identifies and implements opportunities for incremental enhancements to its operational capabilities. Cost or schedule overruns on any of these projects could negatively impact the Group’s profitability, cash flows and relationships with key stakeholders.

With early engineering work already underway, the project will support Sakhalin Energy in maintaining its export gas capacity. Net margin was stable at 6.5% (2016: 6.4%), with improved project profitability largely offset by lower overhead recovery and deferred tax charges. By sharing learnings between the two projects we’ve created more certainty on delivery and nurtured a culture of continual learning. In our core Middle Eastern markets, clients often favour the lump-sum turnkey solution, but there are some who prefer more integration and control. It was recognised by both parties that a simplified ownership structure would best position the Pánuco PEC for migration. For further details of amounts comprising exceptional items and certain re-measurements, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. They are based in each of our key locations, use common tools, follow consistent processes, and deliver against a business-focused HR strategy. In response, Group Chief Executive Ayman Asfari met personally with 125 of our most senior people to update them on the Company strategy and understand their career goals. In 2018 we will be launching an online CV tool to assist internal recruitment and development across the organisation. • Strategic corporate giving – across the Group, we support community-based initiatives, with a particular focus on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. In both Delhi and Chennai, we support the Bharat Lok Shiksha Parishad (BLSP) welfare programme, which funds 200 one-teacher schools, known as Ekal Vidyalayas. This was a considerable increase on 2016, thanks largely to our employees’ involvement in the Relay for Life event organised by Friends of Cancer Patients (FoCP). In Malaysia At the end of 2016, to commemorate achieving a 50 million man-hours LTI-free milestone, our E&C division donated US$50,000 split across 10 countries. The total amount was donated to a number of local and national UK charities nominated by our employees. To keep standards high, the Petrofac-built onsite accommodation that houses 1,800 workers and supervisors is independently audited on a regular basis. A grievance management procedure has also been implemented, to ensure that workers’ concerns can be aired and addressed. Working with local suppliers In 2017 , just taking into account the key projects listed on page 37 , we purchased more than US$1.2 billion worth of goods and services. This will help to deliver a steady stream of job-ready graduates, and can also upskill existing field personnel. As our Country Manager, Ray Richardson says: “A few years ago the contracting community had little choice but to look outside of Oman for goods, services and skills. 235 Scope 1 12 Scope 2 77.0 000 tCO 2 e per million boe production 0.23 000 tCO 2 e per million man-hours worked 52 Barrels spilled 2 Spills Strategic report Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 / 61 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED As an oil field services company that designs, develops and operates large-scale facilities, Petrofac’s business is directly linked to environmental considerations. We also follow a systematic approach to environmental management, even in places where this is not required by local regulations. In doing so, they consider the entire life cycle of a project, and are often able to propose solutions that can have significant long-term environmental benefits. Johnson Controls, who provide a range of building services at our two Sharjah office towers, awarded the team their 2017 Energy Management Award. The Petrofac Board, made up of six different nationalities, with both male and female members, is already diverse, but we will continue to keep this matter under review. As part of this trip, Andrea Abt and Alastair Cochran completed their Basic Offshore Training (BOSIET) at the Petrofac Training facility in Aberdeen, which allowed them, along with Rijnhard van Tets and other senior management, to visit the FPF-1 floating production facility, operated by us for Ithaca. Both our Executive Directors have rolling service contracts, containing a notice period provision of 12 months’ by either party. Detailed briefings are also provided in order that they may quickly gain a deeper understanding of Petrofac at an operational level. Petrofac’s Security function presented plans to continue ensuring the safest possible travel and workplace for our staff. As a result, the potential for fines, penalties or other consequences, including reputational damage and an exclusion from bidding on certain contracts, cannot currently be assessed. Our Investor Relations team acts as a focal point for contact with investors throughout the year and brokers’ research notes are regularly circulated to all Directors. Accordingly, financial reports and shareholder documents, regulatory market announcements, together with recorded interviews, are all available on our website, which we believe allows shareholders to become more informed investors. Having notified the Committee of my intentions, a process was initiated to consider candidates with appropriate capabilities, knowledge, and experience. An e-learning training module on this policy was rolled out across the Group during 2016 to ensure full understanding and consistent application. Periodic updates have been provided through our internal employee communication channels and plans are in place to conduct a further survey during 2018. It is felt this will ensure that future growth can be supported by a developed and embedded risk management culture, which promotes sound business practices, even in tougher external environments. Claim scenario workshops continued during 2017 , which resulted in the incorporation of further wording enhancements into our existing programme. It has been agreed that there will be no further increase in these fees for the next three years. (d) Post-employment benefit – all non-UAE national employees, including Directors working in the UAE, are required by local statute to receive an end of service indemnity payment.

It has been agreed that there will be no further increase in these fees for the next three years. • Although both current UK-based Executive Directors have opted to receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension provision, this position is kept under review. We performed full and specific scope audit procedures over this risk area in 5 locations, which covered 96% of total revenue. We reported that revenue and margin recognition on long term contracts has been correctly accounted for under IAS 11. Information on the Group’s subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements is contained in note 34 to these consolidated financial statements. Consequently, under IFRS 15 the Group will continue to recognise revenue from its lump-sum engineering, procurement and construction project execution services contracts over time rather than at a point of time • Contract modifications, e.g. variation orders, will be accounted for as part of the existing contract, with a cumulative catch up adjustment to revenue. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those monetary items are also recorded in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income. When necessary, fair value less costs of disposal is estimated, for example, by reference to quoted market values, similar arm’s length transactions involving these assets or risk adjusted discounted cash flow models. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method, less accumulated impairment charges. The fair value of oil price collar contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. If this were to occur then an additional impairment charge would be recognised in the consolidated income statement. For earlier awards 50% of the total award is subject to achieving between 0.0% and 7 .5% earnings per share (EPS) growth targets over a three-year period.
