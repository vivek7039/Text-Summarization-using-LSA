been another strong year. this is evidenced by today’s results with another profitable period for our own growth at accesso. over the past years, we have evolved our offering to include a range of complementary technologies designed to meet a wide range of client needs, and we engage with existing and prospective customers on this basis. this review of our 2017 results reflects that evolution in our thinking, and lays out how accesso technology is helping operators in each of these three areas meet the challenges that mean the most to them. tom burnet executive chairman accesso technology group plc 6 chief executive’s statement operational review accesso has once again made significant strides in 2017. we continue to win a range of business across the group and geographic expansion continues at a good pace. new clients of varying size have deployed accesso technology for this first time this year, while on a geographic view, deployments have also gone live for the first time in india, singapore, thailand, ireland, portugal and new zealand. with the majority of the initial investment required to deliver on that project now behind us, we are well placed to begin benefiting from the longer-term international expansion opportunities that we always envisaged would be available as a result of enhancing our global technology offering, establishing regional support networks and integrating with local payment and regulatory systems. we are excited about the opportunities that this should present to enhance revenue within our existing estate. this accesso technology group plc 7 chief executive’s statement (continued) represented a joint win with accesso passport, which also is now used by the nfl experience in times square, new york and the cnn studio tour in atlanta, georgia. we also rolled out our complete solution for toluca fc and its new 31,000 seat football stadium. greenfield opportunities last year’s acquisitions of ingresso and te2 have brought a range of new capability to accesso and, in addition to supporting our product offerings in our existing verticals, have enabled the group to make its first steps into a new set of entirely greenfield areas including london’s west end theatre market and the healthcare space. this acquisition has also helped us reach further into london’s fragmented west end theatre market and will, over time, allow accesso to exploit the significant inefficiencies that exist within the travel and leisure industry. we see broader future opportunity with the focus we have made on integrating with our other accesso offerings and facilitating access to the wide range of third-party distribution channels that are important to our customers. we expect to see tangible signs of progress on this combined offering later in 2018. after the period end we also announced a significant win for te2 with the henry ford health system (hfhs), a six-hospital system in detroit, michigan. the business continues to focus increasing levels of resource and technology on initiatives to ensure data minimization, more robust monitoring of our applications, enhanced response capabilities and increased staff training across the whole business. accesso tracks a number of specific operational metrics that influence group revenue as follows: • total transactional ticket sales, including ingresso distribution, increased 20.2%, with like for like increasing 14.8% • total ticket volumes, processed via our hosted solutions, increased 30.9%, exceeding 100m for the first time. on a like for like basis the increase was 28.0% • north america now accounts for 70% of ecommerce ticket volume (2016: 89%), with europe accelerating to 25% (2016: 9%) • 42% of ecommerce volume now takes place via a mobile device (2016: 35%) • accesso loqueue like for like attendance data was broadly flat the gross profit margin in 2017 was 55.0%, compared to 54.0% in 2016, reflecting the improvement in our mix of revenue towards higher margin offerings and a higher level of non-recurring services revenues than in the comparative period. to allow for sufficient headroom, the group extended its borrowing facility with lloyds bank plc. the group has for a number of years focused on tax planning that lowers its effective rate. prior to joining accesso, john spent 4 years as european controller and interim finance director of private equity backed palletways group limited, supporting the continental european development of europe’s largest and fastest growing palletized freight network business. john was appointed chief financial officer of the company in august 2009. steve brown, president, chief executive officer steve brown brings a strong operations and finance background to the accesso team with extensive experience in ticketing, pricing strategy, ecommerce and revenue management. prior to joining accesso, steve served as the corporate vice president of ticket strategy and sales for six flags. she was responsible for sales of all hewlett packard’s products, services and software to business customers globally. non-audit/tax advisory services are benchmarked by management to ensure value for money, auditor objectivity and independence of advice. once employed, a career plan will be developed so as to ensure suitable opportunities for each disabled person. executive directors are entitled to be considered for the grant of awards under a long-term incentive plan (“ltip”). the remuneration committee will make ltip awards at a level they believe is consistent with its underlying objective to attract and retain high calibre executives. the specific performance conditions related to each award that has been made are set out within this report. the target cagr for full vesting of ltips issued in 2014 was 15% per year over 3 years. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. the components for which we performed an audit of account balances in 2016 were not individually financially significant enough to require an audit for group reporting purposes in the prior year, but did present specific individual risks that needed to be addressed. for the residual components, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these. accesso technology group plc 27 consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the financial

standards that have been adopted during the period • annual improvements to ifrss • ias 16 and 38: amendments to clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation • ias 27: amendments related to equity method in separate financial statements • ias 11: amendments relating to acquisitions of interest in joint operations • ias 7: amendments related to sale or contribution

standards and interpretations not yet adopted a number of new standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations are not effective for 2017, and therefore have not been applied in preparing these accounts. accordingly, commissions will become an asset on the consolidated statement of financial position and tested annually for impairment. net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less additional costs to completion and disposal. the amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate valuation techniques (see note 13). for development expenditure, this is capitalised as an internally generated intangible asset, only if it meets criteria noted above. accesso technology group plc 40 notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) for the financial year ended 31 december 2017 significant accounting policies (continued) intellectual property rights and patents intellectual property rights comprise assets acquired, being external costs, relating to know how, patents, and licences. the group's accounting policy for each category is as follows: • trade and loan receivables: trade receivables are initially recognised by the group and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible or impaired amounts. see note 2 for the useful lives and amortisation policies regarding intangible assets acquired in business combinations. other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. internal procedures take into account a customer’s financial position, their reputation in the industry, and past trading experience. at the period end, group companies held monetary assets in currencies other than their local currency. in common with many international groups operating across multiple jurisdictions, certain tax positions taken by the group are based on industry practice and external tax advice, or are based on assumptions and involve a significant degree of judgement. the group has recognised provisions where it is not probable that tax positions taken will be accepted, totalling 0.6 million in relation to transfer pricing risks and 0.4 million in relation to availability of tax losses and international r&d claims. 2017 2016 profit attributable to ordinary shareholders (000) 9,901
