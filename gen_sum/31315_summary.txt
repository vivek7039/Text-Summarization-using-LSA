This is evidenced by today’s results with another profitable period for our own growth at Accesso. Two important strategic acquisitions present us with many more opportunities, and we are excited about the new markets they open up for us as well as how they can support our existing customer base. Over the past years, we have evolved our offering to include a range of complementary technologies designed to meet a wide range of client needs, and we engage with existing and prospective customers on this basis. This review of our 2017 results reflects that evolution in our thinking, and lays out how accesso technology is helping operators in each of these three areas meet the challenges that mean the most to them. New clients of varying size have deployed accesso technology for this first time this year, while on a geographic view, deployments have also gone live for the first time in India, Singapore, Thailand, Ireland, Portugal and New Zealand. With the majority of the initial investment required to deliver on that project now behind us, we are well placed to begin benefiting from the longer-term international expansion opportunities that we always envisaged would be available as a result of enhancing our global technology offering, establishing regional support networks and integrating with local payment and regulatory systems. We are excited about the opportunities that this should present to enhance revenue within our existing estate. Supported by accesso Passport, their ability to utilise monthly payment plans accelerated the trend. Wins like these are particularly important as we seek to broaden our reach in the Asia-Pacific region, which is now supported by offices and technology infrastructure in the region and provides a good example of our ability to add incremental new business on the back of global investments undertaken in recent years. This accesso Technology Group plc 7 Chief Executive’s Statement (continued) represented a joint win with accesso Passport, which also is now used by the NFL Experience in Times Square, New York and The CNN Studio Tour in Atlanta, Georgia. Within accesso ShoWare we continue to make good progress in the live event ticketing space, supporting concerts given by Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars, John Mayer, Green Day and Jack Johnson among others during the period. We also rolled out our complete solution for Toluca FC and its new 31,000 seat football stadium. Greenfield Opportunities Last year’s acquisitions of Ingresso and TE2 have brought a range of new capability to accesso and, in addition to supporting our product offerings in our existing verticals, have enabled the Group to make its first steps into a new set of entirely greenfield areas including London’s West End Theatre market and the Healthcare space. This acquisition has also helped us reach further into London’s fragmented West End Theatre market and will, over time, allow accesso to exploit the significant inefficiencies that exist within the travel and leisure industry. Ingresso delivered calendar year-on-year growth of 67%, achieved with a strong showing across all its major channels and we continue to invest in their distribution technology paying particular attention to its high-volume, high-speed sale capabilities. Whilst our distribution partner, Amazon, announced post-period end that they are discontinuing their ticketing distribution business, we have been delighted to welcome major customer wins from Ticketmaster UK and Superbreak.com, a major UK tour operator. We see broader future opportunity with the focus we have made on integrating with our other accesso offerings and facilitating access to the wide range of third-party distribution channels that are important to our customers. We expect to see tangible signs of progress on this combined offering later in 2018. Through a new booking portal, we also now offer service management of date and time-based tickets helping to mitigate risk for whose operations may be impacted by cancellations due to weather or other external factors. The business continues to focus increasing levels of resource and technology on initiatives to ensure data minimization, more robust monitoring of our applications, enhanced response capabilities and increased staff training across the whole business. accesso tracks a number of specific operational metrics that influence Group revenue as follows: • Total transactional ticket sales, including Ingresso distribution, increased 20.2%, with like for like increasing 14.8% • Total ticket volumes, processed via our hosted solutions, increased 30.9%, exceeding 100m for the first time. On a like for like basis the increase was 28.0% • North America now accounts for 70% of eCommerce ticket volume (2016: 89%), with Europe accelerating to 25% (2016: 9%) • 42% of eCommerce volume now takes place via a mobile device (2016: 35%) • accesso LoQueue like for like attendance data was broadly flat The gross profit margin in 2017 was 55.0%, compared to 54.0% in 2016, reflecting the improvement in our mix of revenue towards higher margin offerings and a higher level of non-recurring services revenues than in the comparative period. We estimate that for the full year 81% (2016: 91%) of Group revenue is repeatable in nature. To allow for sufficient headroom, the Group extended its borrowing facility with Lloyds Bank plc. The Group has for a number of years focused on tax planning that lowers its effective rate. After joining the accesso Board in 2012, I will formally step down in April and hand the baton to Paul Noland who I have known, trusted and worked with for more than 20 years. In his current position as Executive Chairman, he leads accesso’s medium and long-term growth plans. Prior to joining accesso, John spent 4 years as European Controller and Interim Finance Director of private equity backed Palletways Group Limited, supporting the Continental European development of Europe’s largest and fastest growing palletized freight network business. Prior to joining accesso, Steve served as the corporate Vice President of Ticket Strategy and Sales for Six Flags. She was responsible for sales of all Hewlett Packard’s products, services and software to business customers globally.

Non-audit/tax advisory services are benchmarked by management to ensure value for money, auditor objectivity and independence of advice. Once employed, a career plan will be developed so as to ensure suitable opportunities for each disabled person. Executive Directors are entitled to be considered for the grant of awards under a Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). The Remuneration Committee will make LTIP awards at a level they believe is consistent with its underlying objective to attract and retain high calibre Executives. The specific performance conditions related to each award that has been made are set out within this report. The target CAGR for full vesting of LTIPs issued in 2014 was 15% per year over 3 years. This target has been substantially exceeded and, therefore, 100% of the options granted have vested. Cash reserves of the Group will not be impacted when this is realised. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The components for which we performed an audit of account balances in 2016 were not individually financially significant enough to require an audit for group reporting purposes in the prior year, but did present specific individual risks that needed to be addressed. For the residual components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these. accesso Technology Group plc 27 Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 2017 2016 Notes $000 $000 Revenue 6 133,429 102,511 Cost of sales (59,984) (47,186) Gross profit 73,445 55,325 Administrative expenses (including credit of $3,228 ($’000) (2016: $nil) related to reversal of Ingresso earn out liability – see note 13) (64,204) (44,813) Operating profit 9,241 10,512 Finance expense 9 (2,099) (414) Finance income 9 24 4 Profit before tax 7,166 10,102 Income tax benefit / (expense) 10 2,735 (2,576) Profit for the period 9,901 7,526 Other comprehensive income Items that will be reclassified to income statement Exchange differences on translating foreign operations 166 (1,579) Total comprehensive income 10,067 5,947 All profit and comprehensive income is attributable to the owners of the parent Earnings per share expressed in cents per share: Basic 12 40.83 33.95 Diluted 12 38.70 32.02 All activities of the company are classified as continuing The accompanying notes on pages 34 to 65 form part of these consolidated financial statements accesso Technology Group plc 28 Consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2017 Registered Number: 03959429 Registered address: Unit 5, The Pavilions, Ruscombe Park, Twyford, Berkshire RG10 9NN 31 December 2017 31 December 2016 Notes $000 $000 Assets Non-current assets Intangible assets 13 198,298 81,612 Property, plant and equipment 14 3,400 3,494 Deferred tax assets 10 8,937 6,008 210,635 91,114 Current assets Inventories 16 506 491 Trade and other receivables 17 19,761 10,232 Income tax receivable -

Accordingly, commissions will become an asset on the consolidated statement of financial position and tested annually for impairment. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less additional costs to completion and disposal. Direct costs of acquisition are recognised immediately in the income statement as an expense. The amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate valuation techniques (see note 13). For development expenditure, this is capitalised as an internally generated intangible asset, only if it meets criteria noted above. accesso Technology Group plc 40 Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 Significant accounting policies (continued) Intellectual property rights and patents Intellectual property rights comprise assets acquired, being external costs, relating to know how, patents, and licences. These assets have been capitalised at the fair value of the assets acquired and are amortised within administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic life of 5 to 9 years. The Group's accounting policy for each category is as follows: • Trade and loan receivables: Trade receivables are initially recognised by the Group and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible or impaired amounts. See note 2 for the useful lives and amortisation policies regarding intangible assets acquired in business combinations. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Internal procedures take into account a customer’s financial position, their reputation in the industry, and past trading experience. The main operating currencies of its operations are in sterling, US dollars, and euros. At the period end, Group companies held monetary assets in currencies other than their local currency. Allocation of resources is driven by customer needs across the Group as a whole. Transactional revenue is repeatable revenue earned as either a fixed amount per sale of an item by the customer or as a percent of the total sale (e.g. eCommerce income, ticket sales).
