report and accounts 2017 17 overview strategic report our governance our results shareholders’ information overview strategic report our governance our results shareholders’ information ao world plc annual report and accounts 2017 17 dear stakeholders, last month, i received a letter from a customer, moira, with the subject title: “love your company!” it’s quite long, but i’ve copied it opposite in full because it really gets to the heart of what i want to say in this letter. we have an amazing team of over 2,500 people in the business who live ao every day in a way that defines that difference; who understand our business from the customer’s point of view. it’s not one silver bullet, but a hundred different things we just care more about. your staff could not have been more helpful, knowledgeable or “human” for want of a better word! peter could not have been more helpful in investigating the concern and, upon agreeing the email wording was not right, advised me that “ao will probably have this template email corrected in a couple of hours so no further customers are confused.” again, impressive. towards the end of the conversation with peter i told him how impressed i had been with all my contacts with ao and he told me how very much he enjoyed working for ao, that it is a great company and how he and his colleagues are treated as “human beings”, i think was the expression. this is the first time i’m reporting as ceo but, fundamentally, our approach has not changed and nor do i expect it or want it to: we remain relentless in pursuing our goal to be the best electrical retailer in europe and, through focusing on our 4cs strategy, we are confident we can deliver against that objective. when the time is right, we will replicate this approach in new geographies and categories. steve caunce chief executive officer steve caunce chief executive officer ao world plc annual report and accounts 2017 20 ao world plc annual report and accounts 2017 20

customer is defined as an individual customer who has purchased from us. ao has historically been known for selling white goods and so, during the year, we have focused on educating our customers that ao is a multi-category electrical retailer, building momentum as we add more categories and products to our range. ao’s customer base is now a huge asset to the business as we approach four million uk customers (defined as an individual customer who has purchased from us) giving us a fantastic foundation from which to leverage our growth. this maximises efficiency and is part of our developing self‑service strategy, should customers choose to shop that way. the way in which consumers shop is ever evolving and we must work hard to keep up with changing preferences. europe as planned, we limited our promotional activity during our period of consolidation with no tv exposure from april to october 2016. in the second half of the year we resumed limited activity such as joint tv advertising campaigns with manufacturers alongside some print media advertising and continued use of ao branded fleet, but beyond that advertising has been limited. our european team has also been restructured and during the year we were pleased to welcome a new european retail director into the team who is already making a difference to both culture and performance. our premier fleet has grown significantly as we respond to increasing demand for more complex installation services. this vertical integration ensures further end-to-end control of our reverse supply chain with the associated environmental benefits. our brand new regional distribution centre (rdc) in bergheim, serving germany and the netherlands, became fully operational in september 2016. with 35,000m 2 of warehouse space, the rdc allows us to improve product availability for our customers and promote brand awareness. priorities next year our research into further countries continues and we will pursue this strategy through continued careful assessment of the european electricals market, being selective of which opportunities to progress or put on hold, to ensure that we deliver the best possible proposition for our customers and maximise value in the long term for our stakeholders. we have also expanded the audio offering this year adding ultra-hd blu-ray and turntables into our range. our aim; to create a new way of shopping that results in happy customers and manufacturers. training we trained all our staff to be experts in the new category, helping customers make decisions. we believe this type of environment really fosters the entrepreneurial spirit, creating a can-do attitude for all our people. these programmes are aimed at enabling technical capability and behavioural development aligned to the business’ goals. our investment in emerging talent has seen an increased focus on apprenticeships across the business. disabled persons have equal opportunities when applying for positions at ao and we ensure they are treated fairly. over the year we have continued to encourage colleagues to have a positive impact within their local communities with our focus this year driven by the “gift of time” and specifically our “make a difference” days and volunteering. we offer a collection and recycling service to our customers for their old appliances (for a small transportation charge) or, alternatively, we accept any weee free of charge which is delivered directly to our warehouse. during the year we completed the build of our recycling facility at telford giving us a state-of-the-art recycling plant which ensures weee is safely and properly disposed and that re-use is optimised giving rise to a number of environmental benefits. in order to drive energy efficiencies: – our home delivery fleet comprises 3.5 tonne “hi‑cube” trucks– these trucks are lighter and have a greater space and weight capacity; – we have opened two new outbases in the uk during the year to service demand and improve the efficiency of our fleet; and – we also try to maximise our fuel efficiency by, for example, employing double-decker trunking so that we can deliver more products in one go to our outbases. any changes in factors between the current and prior year reporting periods are considered minimal. since 2014, all newer fridges in the uk which contain pentane gases have been classed as hazardous waste. ao plans to deliver a “step change” in the way fridges are recycled at end of life. the new recycling facility in telford was built and will be able to recycle more than 700,000 fridges a year. to put this in context, about 3.5 million fridges are thrown away every year – so ao recycling could be processing nearly one fifth of these. step 2 the motor is then removed with some giant, heavy duty cutters and sent away for recycling. t o do this oxygen is removed and replaced with nitrogen to prevent anything igniting. step 4 the fridge is then dropped into a big shredder, where heavy duty chains spin around at 500 rpm. old fridges and large domestic appliances will arrive at the site for recycling having been collected from ao customers when they purchase a new machine. packaging from ao customers’ new appliances will also be brought to the telford facility for recycling. it’s safe, clean, efficient and more environmentally friendly than any other facility in the uk. step 6 at this point nitrogen is used to condense the gases into liquid so they can be safely sent away for disposal elsewhere. amazing customer service innovative

business or the wider corporate landscape may impact them. internal audit plan assurance framework corporate risk register/risk management committee the board/ audit committee whilst our risk management processes work well, the programme can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurance that key risks are managed at an acceptable level. we recognise that it is not possible or necessarily desirable to eliminate some of the risks inherent in our activities. the table overleaf summarises our assessment of these risks and how we seek to mitigate them. failure in these territories would limit our long-term growth and negatively impact the group’s finances. – expansion into new territories is only undertaken after extensive research – expansion leverages ao’s existing uk online retailing expertise and experience that has been built up over many years – capital requirements are relatively low and investment is managed in stages – specific targets are in place for new territories to enable focus on objectives and measurement of performance risk decrease our german business is now approaching three years old and our business in the netherlands is just over year old.

for ongoing operations. the loss of sensitive information relating to strategic direction or business performance may compromise our future strategies or the loss of data relating to individuals may result in an ico complaint and negative publicity. – customer proposition remains strong and continued migration to online shopping should soften macro-economic impacts – robust relationships with

plc annual report and accounts 2017 44 ao world plc annual report and accounts 2017 44 how we manage our risks continued i am pleased to present the financial review for the group for the year to 31 march 2017. we maintained our focus on delivering value for all our stakeholders through our 4cs strategy and have made good progress against all these objectives. sterling deflation in our market saw cost prices increase by 10‑15% through 2016. despite these factors and the impact of lower trading days against the prior year (due to 2016 being a leap year), we achieved a 17.0% increase in group revenue to £701.2m. over the next few years we will continue to apply our uk learnings in europe and undertake initiatives to continue to improve product margins to a mature state, make supply chain and cost-to- deliver efficiencies and utilise our uk assets where possible, leveraging our cost base through growth, as we set out at the capital markets day in february 2017. in march 2017 we announced that we had raised £50m of gross proceeds via a placing of new shares in the company from both new and existing investors. whilst our mda sales do correlate to the performance of the housing market, we are in part insulated from any downturn as we believe a substantial proportion of mda sales are “distressed” purchases. online migration continues throughout europe, as can be shown from the chart below presenting a significant opportunity for ao. our brand offering is increasing every month as we become more established in the market and gain share. this contract has now expired and going forward we would expect to see revenue from third-party logistics services fall. in addition, our individual costs of delivery have improved following (i) internal efficiency drives (ii) a full year’s trading in the netherlands which leverages our german infrastructure cost base (iii) increasing order levels which improved our drop densities and (iv) the use of a third‑party logistics delivery model in areas with very low population density. this has enabled us to further invest in tv and other advertising costs to accelerate our brand awareness strategy, which has continued into the new financial year with the sponsorship of britain’s got talent. europe advertising and marketing expenses have been held in line with the prior year at £6.2m (2016: £6.2m). uk trade and other receivables (both non-current and current) were £76.9m as at 31 march 2017 (2016: £59.3m) reflecting an increase in accrued income in respect of commissions due on product protection plans as a result of the higher retail volumes. mark higgins chief financial officer 5 june 2017 the company’s strategic report is set out on pages 16 to 51. approved by the board on 5 june 2017 and signed on its

on the board as founder, executive director. since this change was a natural evolution of our executive team, the transition has been seamless, as expected, with no disruption to the business and with both steve and john now comfortably executing their roles. what impressed me most it’s a fantastic operation which we can leverage for future growth. 6. chris hopkinson non-executive director appointment to the board 12 december 2005 relevant skills & experience – former city financial analyst – significant industry experience – holds a masters degree in logistics significant external appointments executive director of better business support ltd and clifton trade bathrooms ltd independent no. the senior independent director (“sid”) is brian mcbride, who is available to shareholders if they have concerns that the normal channels of chairman or chief executive officer have failed to resolve, or for which such channels of communication are inappropriate. however, we do not consider that it is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders to set prescriptive targets for gender on the board and we will continue to make appointments based on merit, against objective criteria to ensure we appoint the best individual for each role whilst maintaining an overall objective to have a board of mixed gender and background that has an instinctive feel for our customers and people. specific business-related presentations are given by members of the group executive t eam when appropriate, and going forward it is also intended that external speakers will attend board meetings to present on relevant topics. each director’s individual experience and background are taken into account in developing a programme tailored to his or her own requirements. as outlined above these areas are being addressed and progress will be made over the coming year. our people and culture (including succession planning) will continue to be a key area of consideration in the year ahead. the system of internal controls is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. audit committee meetings are generally scheduled to take place in advance of a company board meeting. significant financial accounting matters commercial income arrangements the group has a number of contracts with its suppliers where additional discounts can be applied based on purchase levels. in particular, the company will regularly seek advice from an independent third party on tax matters. ao world plc annual report and accounts 2017 66 corporate governance statement continued report of the remuneration committee our remuneration policy was last approved by shareholders at the 2014 agm when it received a positive vote in favour of 99.6%. the year’s annual bonus scheme consisted mainly of financial targets, addressing both top-line growth and profit. we also agreed that, going forward, john’s remuneration should not contain any variable elements. the overall effect of these changes will mean shareholders see an extremely dedicated and ambitious executive team, playing to their respective strengths, but with total on target remuneration costs of c.£427,000 less per annum (see charts on page 73 for the executive remuneration opportunities at target which equate to £2.758m in aggregate compared to the prior year on target remuneration total of £3.185m). approach to remuneration for 2017/18 executives as discussed above, for the year ahead base salaries have been reviewed and, following his promotion to ceo, steve caunce will receive a salary commensurate with that of the previous ceo, an increase of 15% on his previous salary as coo. steve, ceo, will be entitled to participate in our long-term incentive plan as last year with an award level unchanged at 150% of salary. for mark, cfo, we

statements and statement of compliance with ifrss ao world plc is a public limited company and is incorporated in the united kingdom under the companies act. the new standard will replace ias 17 “leases” and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2019 unless adopted early. revenue is recognised on orders received when the goods and related services have been delivered to customers. the estimated useful lives are as follows: asset class amortisation method and rate domain names 5 years straight-line computer software 3 to 5 years straight-line amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each statement of financial position date. any gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement within revenue. for share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes. ebitda is defined by the group as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and profit/loss on disposal. actual results could differ from these estimates and any subsequent changes are accounted for with an effect on income at the time such updated information becomes available. changes in estimates recognised as an increase or decrease to revenue may be made, where for example more reliable information is available, and any such changes are required to be recognised in the income statement. the use of this measure is also evidenced by executive management bonus targets and long term incentive schemes being measured in relation to adjusted ebitda, amongst other factors. year ended (£m) 31 march 2017 31
