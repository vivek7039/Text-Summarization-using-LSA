Your staff could not have been more helpful, knowledgeable or “human” for want of a better word! Peter could not have been more helpful in investigating the concern and, upon agreeing the email wording was not right, advised me that “AO will probably have this template email corrected in a couple of hours so no further customers are confused.” Again, impressive. We have a business model that differentiates us from our competitors, “The AO Way”, as set out on pages 36 and 37.

AO’s customer base is now a huge asset to the business as we approach four million UK customers (defined as an individual customer who has purchased from us) giving us a fantastic foundation from which to leverage our growth. This maximises efficiency and is part of our developing self‑service strategy, should customers choose to shop that way. The way in which consumers shop is ever evolving and we must work hard to keep up with changing preferences. Our premier fleet has grown significantly as we respond to increasing demand for more complex installation services. This vertical integration ensures further end-to-end control of our reverse supply chain with the associated environmental benefits. Europe We are enjoying good customer feedback in both territories with NPS scores remaining outstanding at over 85. With 35,000m 2 of warehouse space, the RDC allows us to improve product availability for our customers and promote brand awareness. We have also expanded the audio offering this year adding ultra-HD Blu-ray and turntables into our range. Training We trained all our staff to be experts in the new category, helping customers make decisions. We believe this type of environment really fosters the entrepreneurial spirit, creating a can-do attitude for all our people. Specific actions resulting from this survey have seen us place more emphasis on development programmes for all our employees. Disabled persons have equal opportunities when applying for positions at AO and we ensure they are treated fairly. During the year we completed the build of our recycling facility at Telford giving us a state-of-the-art recycling plant which ensures WEEE is safely and properly disposed and that re-use is optimised giving rise to a number of environmental benefits. Since 2014, all newer fridges in the UK which contain pentane gases have been classed as hazardous waste. AO plans to deliver a “step change” in the way fridges are recycled at end of life. The new recycling facility in Telford was built and will be able to recycle more than 700,000 fridges a year. To put this in context, about 3.5 million fridges are thrown away every year – so AO Recycling could be processing nearly one fifth of these. Step 2 The motor is then removed with some giant, heavy duty cutters and sent away for recycling. Step 4 The fridge is then dropped into a big shredder, where heavy duty chains spin around at 500 rpm. Old fridges and large domestic appliances will arrive at the site for recycling having been collected from AO customers when they purchase a new machine. Step 6 At this point nitrogen is used to condense the gases into liquid so they can be safely sent away for disposal elsewhere.

Online migration continues throughout Europe, as can be shown from the chart below presenting a significant opportunity for AO. Our brand offering is increasing every month as we become more established in the market and gain share.

Chris Hopkinson Non-Executive Director Appointment to the Board 12 December 2005 Relevant skills & experience – Former City Financial Analyst – Significant industry experience – Holds a Masters degree in Logistics Significant external appointments Executive Director of Better Business Support Ltd and Clifton Trade Bathrooms Ltd Independent No. *** Rudi Lamprecht’s three-year term of appointment to the Board was not renewed with effect from 16 February 2017. The Senior Independent Director (“SID”) is Brian McBride, who is available to shareholders if they have concerns that the normal channels of Chairman or Chief Executive Officer have failed to resolve, or for which such channels of communication are inappropriate. Specific business-related presentations are given by members of the Group Executive T eam when appropriate, and going forward it is also intended that external speakers will attend Board meetings to present on relevant topics. Each Director’s individual experience and background are taken into account in developing a programme tailored to his or her own requirements. As outlined above these areas are being addressed and progress will be made over the coming year. Our people and culture (including succession planning) will continue to be a key area of consideration in the year ahead. Significant financial accounting matters Commercial income arrangements The Group has a number of contracts with its suppliers where additional discounts can be applied based on purchase levels. The year’s annual bonus scheme consisted mainly of financial targets, addressing both top-line growth and profit. Approach to Remuneration for 2017/18 Executives As discussed above, for the year ahead base salaries have been reviewed and, following his promotion to CEO, Steve Caunce will receive a salary commensurate with that of the previous CEO, an increase of 15% on his previous salary as COO. Steve, CEO, will be entitled to participate in our long-term incentive plan as last year with an award level unchanged at 150% of salary. For Mark, CFO, we believe it is appropriate to make one further award at the 300% level of salary. The PSP performance conditions will continue to comprise a relative TSR metric, Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth targets (see page 77 for further details). The Executive Directors will next be eligible for a salary review in early 2018, with any changes effective from 1 April 2018. The performance conditions proposed this year comprise a relative TSR metric together with Revenue and Group Adjusted EBITDA targets. For the benefits and bonus per employee, this is based on those employees eligible to participate in such schemes.

We performed a review of financial information (including enquiry) on 1 component which was not individually significant enough to require an audit for group reporting purposes but a review was performed in order to provide further coverage over relevant account balances. For the 3 remaining components, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these.

IFRS 15 introduces a five-step approach to the timing of revenue recognition based on performance obligations in customer contracts. The new standard will replace IAS 17 “Leases” and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 unless adopted early. Revenue is recognised on orders received when the goods and related services have been delivered to customers. Any gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement within revenue. Actual results could differ from these estimates and any subsequent changes are accounted for with an effect on income at the time such updated information becomes available. The use of this measure is also evidenced by executive management bonus targets and Long Term Incentive Schemes being measured in relation to adjusted EBITDA, amongst other factors.
