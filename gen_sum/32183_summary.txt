customer is defined as an individual customer who has purchased from us. this maximises efficiency and is part of our developing self‑service strategy, should customers choose to shop that way. the way in which consumers shop is ever evolving and we must work hard to keep up with changing preferences. training we trained all our staff to be experts in the new category, helping customers make decisions. we believe this type of environment really fosters the entrepreneurial spirit, creating a can-do attitude for all our people. disabled persons have equal opportunities when applying for positions at ao and we ensure they are treated fairly. during the year we completed the build of our recycling facility at telford giving us a state-of-the-art recycling plant which ensures weee is safely and properly disposed and that re-use is optimised giving rise to a number of environmental benefits. since 2014, all newer fridges in the uk which contain pentane gases have been classed as hazardous waste. the new recycling facility in telford was built and will be able to recycle more than 700,000 fridges a year. to put this in context, about 3.5 million fridges are thrown away every year – so ao recycling could be processing nearly one fifth of these. step 4 the fridge is then dropped into a big shredder, where heavy duty chains spin around at 500 rpm. old fridges and large domestic appliances will arrive at the site for recycling having been collected from ao customers when they purchase a new machine. step 6 at this point nitrogen is used to condense the gases into liquid so they can be safely sent away for disposal elsewhere. amazing customer service innovative online content not beaten on price first-in-class delivery model large available range amazing

appointment to the board 12 december 2005 relevant skills & experience – former city financial analyst – significant industry experience – holds a masters degree in logistics significant external appointments executive director of better business support ltd and clifton trade bathrooms ltd independent no. the senior independent director (“sid”) is brian mcbride, who is available to shareholders if they have concerns that the normal channels of chairman or chief executive officer have failed to resolve, or for which such channels of communication are inappropriate. specific business-related presentations are given by members of the group executive t eam when appropriate, and going forward it is also intended that external speakers will attend board meetings to present on relevant topics. each director’s individual experience and background are taken into account in developing a programme tailored to his or her own requirements. our people and culture (including succession planning) will continue to be a key area of consideration in the year ahead. significant financial accounting matters commercial income arrangements the group has a number of contracts with its suppliers where additional discounts can be applied based on purchase levels. the year’s annual bonus scheme consisted mainly of financial targets, addressing both top-line growth and profit. approach to remuneration for 2017/18 executives as discussed above, for the year ahead base salaries have been reviewed and, following his promotion to ceo, steve caunce will receive a salary commensurate with that of the previous ceo, an increase of 15% on his previous salary as coo. steve, ceo, will be entitled to participate in our long-term incentive plan as last year with an award level unchanged at 150% of salary. for mark, cfo, we believe it is appropriate to make one further award at the 300% level of salary. the psp performance conditions will continue to comprise a relative tsr metric, revenue and adjusted ebitda growth targets (see page 77 for further details). the performance conditions proposed this year comprise a relative tsr metric together with revenue and group adjusted ebitda targets. for the benefits and bonus per employee, this is based on those employees eligible to participate in such schemes. table 4 shares held beneficially 1 at 31 march
