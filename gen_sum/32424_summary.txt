annual general meeting. they also provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatements noted below. management have completed an assessment on each intangible at the year end which involved undertaking a review for indicators of impairments. classification of financial liabilities the basis of classification for financial liabilities under ifrs 9 remains unchanged from that under ias 39. the two categories are amortised cost or fvtpl (either designated as such, or held for trading). therefore, under ifrs 9, the group expects to classify all financial liabilities as amortised cost, with no material impact on measurement. net fee and commission income the group charges initial fees in relation to certain business activities. 59 financial statements walker crips group plc annual report and accounts 2017 1. general information continued ifrs 15 reinforces this view, stating that incremental costs of obtaining any contract with a customer shall be capitalised if the entity expects to recover those costs. cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. these costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives of 3 to 20 years. amortisation of intangible fixed assets is included within administrative expenses – other in the consolidated income statement. subsequent consideration received for the sale of treasury shares is also recognised in equity with any difference being taken to retained earnings. where shares are due to be issued within a year, the sum is included in current liabilities. operating expenses and other charges are provided for in full up to the statement of financial position date on an accruals basis. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. in addition, note 24 to the financial statements includes details of risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital. the group has healthy financial resources together with a long established, proven and tested business model. these assumptions have been stress-tested as described in note 15. the carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was £4.4m (2016: £4.4m) as shown in note 15. other intangible assets – judgement acquired client lists are capitalised based on current fair values. 64 financial statements walker crips group plc annual report and accounts 2017 5. segmental analysis continued 2017 investment management
