model the strength in our business model lies in its agility. through identifying opportunities, selecting acquisitions, securing planning permission and purchasing strategic sites with future potential, inland is able to expand its land portfolio. we sell some of our sites to housing associations and institutional landlords, with a construction contract for inland homes. • working with local authorities and communities to maximise the potential value of each site by securing a valuable planning permission. homeowners: • part or all of the site can be developed by inland homes; we are proud of the developments we plan and design, and are always looking to create an environment that is attractive for future residents. in contrast to a traditional self delivered site, these partnerships provide inland homes with earlier revenue, profit and cash flow that also reduces the group’s borrowing requirements. a planning application has recently been submitted for the wider redevelopment and prior to lodging this inland homes undertook a lengthy and extremely detailed consultation exercise to ensure that the requirements of numerous local stakeholders were met. inland homes has received significant support from the local authority to develop on this brownfield site. the client pays monthly valuations for work completed which enables early recognition of revenue and

beaumont works, st albans when inland homes acquired this grade ii listed building it was severely run down and in need of refurbishment. planning permission for 58 apartments and 8,000 sq ft of commercial space was received with some accolade from the local council. this process has resulted in recruitment at both head office and site level and, as expected, this investment has brought about a planned increase in overheads, with staff numbers having increased from 39 on 1 july 2016 to 74 at the year end. this figure excludes two land sales which have been shown as a gain on sale of subsidiary or joint venture, rather than flowing through revenue and gross margin. our associate company, troy homes limited, is in its second operating year and, as expected, further losses were

based on partnerships as opposed to a one sided arrangement. we are trying to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions through a number of initiatives, such as having eco-friendly site accommodation and ensuring that we are always using electricity from the main grid supply, rather than using a generator. we are facing this challenge through investing in elements such as a staff intranet to ensure that no-one feels isolated whilst working at inland homes. along with hiring new talent, we are dedicated to developing the skills of our existing employees. the experience i have gained since working at inland homes has been amazing, having received responsibility and ownership of projects early on in my career. the group’s auditor provides some non-audit services, but these are not considered to

adopted. given the group’s pipeline such contracts may form a greater proportion of total revenue in future years. further information can be found in note 3. unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its subsidiaries are eliminated. temporary differences include those associated with shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures unless reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. all equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the group income statement with a corresponding credit to retained earnings. loans and receivables are measured subsequent to initial recognition at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. the group uses its judgement to select a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing. therefore this entity has been classified as a joint venture and is accounted for using the equity method. 81 www.inlandhomes.co.uk financials 25624.01 – 11 october 2017 11:42 am – proof 2 notes to the group financial statements for the year ended
