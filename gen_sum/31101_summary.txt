We continue to implement our strategy by focusing on asset management, investment and managing the estate creatively. The business is well-positioned to support its future activities, navigate market uncertainties, while taking advantage of opportunities as they arise. Capco remains disciplined in its investment approach, with a weighting towards Covent Garden as we continue to expand our ownership on the estate. Our creative asset management strategy has driven positive leasing momentum with good demand for all uses across the estate. Cumulative proceeds of £125 million (Capco share) are expected to have been received on Phase 1 over the coming months. Cash proceeds were used initially to repay bank debt and will be deployed in Capco’s prime central London estates over time. All corporate decision making takes risk into account, in a measured way, while continuing to drive an entrepreneurial culture. Our creative asset management strategy has driven positive leasing momentum with good demand for all uses across the estate. 2017 was another active year for Covent Garden as the business continued to implement its leasing and investment strategy.

British men’s shoe brand Cheaney and outerwear clothing concept K-Way opened stores at the beginning of 2017. Australian eyewear brand, Bailey Nelson, opened its only UK store on Henrietta Street in September offering high quality opticals and sunglasses. A number of office lettings have been achieved successfully during the year and we continue to see strong interest from occupiers. Cumulative proceeds of £125 million (Capco share) are expected to have been received on Phase 1 over the coming months. Cash proceeds were used initially to repay bank debt and will be deployed in Capco’s prime central London estates over time. Corporate responsibility continued WE ENCOURAGE OUR EMPLOYEES TO SUPPORT OUR CR ACTIVITIES A number of Capco employees joined days arranged for families affected by the Grenfell Tower disaster www.capitalandcounties.com 49 Governance Financial statements Strategic report SUPPORTING THE LOCAL COMMUNITY Community events Capco continues to support a range of community events at Covent Garden and a number of employees volunteered to help run the events. Charitable work We will promote a volunteering programme with the Construction Youth Trust, Air Ambulance and Urban Land Institute. At Lillie Square, we introduced a series of new gardens, created by award-winning landscape designer Andy Sturgeon. We benchmark our development projects’ AFR against the Health and Safety Executive (“HSE”) Construction Industry Standard of 0.77. Situl is an experienced corporate financier, having led Deutsche Bank’s UK real estate investment banking team before joining Capco. As part of this process an updated Board diversity policy has been adopted, which is described in greater detail within the Nomination Committee Report. Andrew Strang, Henry Staunton and Graeme Gordon have each served on the Board for more than six years. The Board will maintain dialogue with our South African shareholders on this topic as we move into 2018. Each of these Directors has also confirmed that there is no reason why they should not continue to be considered independent. These are often combined with site visits and provide an opportunity for the Non-executive Directors to meet senior management. Conclusion We are proposing no changes to our policy, having received shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM held on 5 May 2017. Variable remuneration includes an annual bonus, half of which is deferred in shares, and awards under the Performance Share Plan (“PSP”). 50 per cent of any bonus earned is deferred in Capco shares or nil cost options for three years under the Performance Share Plan without further performance conditions but subject to risk of forfeiture should an Executive Director leave the Company in certain circumstances. Each year participants may be granted up to 350 per cent of salary in awards or nil cost options. N/A N/A None Executives’ performance is measured relative to challenging one-year targets in key financial, operational and strategic measures. Long-term incentives As mentioned above, the performance conditions for the PSP currently comprise two measures: ◦ Three-year relative Total Return (TR, growth in NAV per share plus dividends); and ◦ Three-year relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR, increase in price of an ordinary share plus dividends). The Committee believes that these two measures are currently the most appropriate measures of long-term success for Capco as long-term relative performance provides an appropriately objective and relevant measure of Capco’s success which is strongly aligned with shareholders’ interests. NAV is used as a performance measure by over half of FTSE350 property companies in their long-term incentive arrangements. The Company’s NAV is based on independent external valuations carried out in accordance with RICS Valuation Professional Standards.

All Group financial assets have been assessed for impairments under the 12 month and lifetime expected credit loss models considered by IFRS 9. Lease payments are allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant financing rate. Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over an asset’s estimated useful life. Unallocated expenses consist primarily of costs incurred centrally which are neither directly nor meaningfully attributable to individual segments. As at 31 December 2016 additional costs associated with the transaction were incurred resulting in a loss of £5.0 million. At each reporting date appropriately qualified employees of the Group verify all significant inputs and review computational outputs. The inputs underlying the valuations include market rent or business profitability, likely incentives offered to tenants, forecast growth rates, yields, EBITDA, discount rates, construction costs including any site specific costs (for example Section 106), professional fees, planning fees, developer’s profit including contingencies, planning and construction timelines, lease re-gear costs, planning risk and sales prices based on known market transactions for similar properties or properties similar to those contemplated for development. The joint venture will explore opportunities for future redevelopments on and around significant railway station sites in London. 2 In accordance with the initial recognition exemption provisions under IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’, no deferred tax is recognised o n goodwill. 4 Current amounts receivable from joint ventures comprise working capital funding advanced by the Group to LSJV and Innova.
