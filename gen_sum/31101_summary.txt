objectivity and independence. directors may also take independent advice at the company’s expense where they feel this is appropriate. conclusion we are proposing no changes to our policy, having received shareholder approval at the 2017 agm held on 5 may 2017. this year, we will only ask shareholders to approve the annual report on remuneration and this annual statement. variable remuneration includes an annual bonus, half of which is deferred in shares, and awards under the performance share plan (“psp”). the committee believes base salary for high-performing experienced executive directors should be at least median. executive directors may elect to be paid some or all of their entitlement in cash. 50 per cent of any bonus earned is deferred in capco shares or nil cost options for three years under the performance share plan without further performance conditions but subject to risk of forfeiture should an executive director leave the company in certain circumstances. executive directors appointed before the 2017 agm receive 24 per cent of base salary as a defined contribution. each year participants may be granted up to 350 per cent of salary in awards or nil cost options. n/a n/a none executives’ performance is measured relative to challenging one-year targets in key financial, operational and strategic measures. the vesting of awards is subject to continued employment and the company’s performance over a three-year performance period based: • 50 per cent on relative total return (net asset value growth plus dividends); and • 50 per cent on relative total shareholder return for both measures, performance is measured relative to a comparator group comprising the largest ftse350 property companies. long-term incentives as mentioned above, the performance conditions for the psp currently comprise two measures: ◦ three-year relative total return (tr, growth in nav per share plus dividends); and ◦ three-year relative total shareholder return (tsr, increase in price of an ordinary share plus dividends). the committee believes that these two measures are currently the most appropriate measures of long-term success for capco as long-term relative performance provides an appropriately objective and relevant measure of capco’s success which is strongly aligned with shareholders’ interests. nav is used as a performance measure by over half of ftse350 property companies in their long-term incentive arrangements. the company’s nav is based on independent external valuations carried out in accordance with rics valuation professional standards. fixed pay £’000 annual bonus long-term incentives 0 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 maximum threshold below threshold chief executive 100% 40% 23% 37% 20% 24% 56% salary for chief executive assumes

director, the committee may make use of any of the existing components of remuneration, as follows: element of remuneration policy on recruitment maximum opportunity salary based on scope and nature of responsibilities of the proposed role; the candidate’s experience; implications for total remuneration positioning vs. market pay levels for comparable roles; internal relativities; and the candidate’s current salary. the company may pay a director’s legal fees in relation to any settlement agreement. change of control immediately vesting will be pro-rated for time and remain subject to performance conditions. the chairman and non-executive director fees are reviewed on an annual basis, with any increase taking effect from 1 may. as capco has a relatively small workforce, the committee does not consult with employees when deciding remuneration policy, but it receives regular updates from the head of hr on salary increases, bonus and share awards made to group employees and is aware of how the remuneration of directors compares to that of other employees; for example, salary increases are generally in line with increases awarded to other employees, which are set with reference to market data. additionally, awards were made pursuant to the committee’s 2013 invitation to executive directors to invest up to 150 per cent of 2013 salary between 2013 and 2015 (subsequently extended to early 2016) when permitted by scheme headroom with an exceptional matching opportunity of 2:1. performance measures and outcomes for 2015 awards under the former psp and former msp performance measures and targets: the performance conditions for the former psp and former msp comprised two equally weighted measures: ◦ three-year relative total return (tr, growth in nav per share plus dividends) ◦ three-year relative total shareholder return (tsr, increase in price of an ordinary share plus dividends) where an exceptional award was made, the additional matching opportunity could only be earned for performance above the normal stretch targets. – for income statement line items that are deemed to be of particular relevance, we applied a lower materiality. key audit matters – valuation of investment and development property – taxation – disposal of the venues business – we determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the parent company to communicate in our report. we agreed with the audit committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £1.9 million (2016: £2.0 million) on balance sheet items as well as misstatements below that amount based on a proportionate value of the relevant materiality figures for income statement line items and other matters that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. www.capitalandcounties.com 97 consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 31 december 2017 www.capitalandcounties.com 97 note 2017 £m 2016 £m loss for the

share placing in may 2014 and previous share plac ements. an option pricing model is used applying assumptions around expected yields, forfeiture rates, exercise price and volatility. upon eventual exercise, a reserves transfer occurs with no further charge reflected in the income statement. the cost of development properties includes capitalised interest and other directly attributable outgoings, with the exception of properties and land where no development is imminent in which case no interest is included. investment and development properties cease to be recognised as investment and development property when they have been disposed of or when they cease to be held for the purpose of generating rental income or for capital appreciation. lease payments are allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant financing rate. depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over an asset’s estimated useful life. impairment losses are determined with reference to the investment’s fair value less estimated selling costs. the group designates certain derivatives as hedges of a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge). management information is reported to the chief operating decision makers on a group share basis. unallocated expenses consist primarily of costs incurred centrally which are neither directly nor meaningfully attributable to individual segments. as at 31 december 2016 additional costs associated with the transaction were incurred resulting in a loss of £5.0 million. after the repayment of debt, working capital adjustments and transaction related costs, net proceeds received were £230.2 million. financial statements strategic report governance capco annual report & accounts

on revaluation of £90.9 million (2016: loss £235.2 million) is recognised in the consolidated income statement within lo ss on revaluation and sale of investment and development property. at each reporting date appropriately qualified employees of the group verify all significant inputs and review computational outputs. the inputs underlying the valuations include market rent or business profitability, likely incentives offered to tenants, forecast growth rates, yields, ebitda, discount rates, construction costs including any site specific costs (for example section 106), professional fees, planning fees, developer’s profit including contingencies, planning and construction timelines, lease re-gear costs, planning risk and sales prices based on known market transactions for similar properties or properties similar to those contemplated for development. for properties valued under the income capitalisation method, if all other factors remained equal, an increase in estimated rental value of five per cent would result in an increased asset valuation of £119.5 million (2016: £111.8 million). trading property continues to be measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. the joint venture will explore opportunities for future redevelopments on and around significant railway station sites in london. 2 in accordance with the initial recognition exemption provisions under ias 12 ‘income taxes’, no deferred tax is recognised o n goodwill. www.capitalandcounties.com 123 www.capitalandcounties.com 123 19 derivative financial instruments derivative assets
