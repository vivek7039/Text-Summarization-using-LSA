Our franchisees are fully insured  members of professional bodies, supported  by specialist software, who know their   local rental market and manage all   properties locally. We  cater both for the majority of sellers who  prefer to instruct an agent operating from  high street premises and for the growing  segment of sellers who choose to use an  agent without a high street office. I’m delighted to report that this was matched  by an almost identical increase in our managed portfolio  through organic growth. The intention appears to be an outright ban, rather than  a cap, on landlords and their letting agents charging any  type of pre-tenancy fee. Overall, the website  project generated nearly 17,000 new business leads   at an average cost to our franchisees of £24 per lead. I am delighted to announce that the Board has  recommended an increased final dividend of 5.4p   per ordinary share for 2017. It is   a fully-functioning franchisor with its own proprietary  technology “EweReka” sitting on an industrial scale  platform. Its HQ staff are based in Cleckheaton,   Bradford and culturally, it is very different from our  traditional high street brands. Progress We have focused on the core activities, refining what worked and  creating operational efficiencies. Management are alive to the  possibility that there will be both opportunities for our  franchisees to act as consolidators at their local level,  buying up competitor’s letting portfolios, but there will  also be consolidation opportunities within the Group,  with strong and capable franchisees buying out their  weaker neighbours.

We have an internal audit team and conduct regular checks  on the financial practices of our franchisees. This involves us in training/coaching/mentoring our  franchisees to diversify their income streams, embrace digital  marketing, be available when customers want them, acquire  portfolios of managed lets, adopt the highest professional  standards and leverage the reputations and goodwill of our   brand stable. Indeed, one of our brands has been  selling houses for 168 years, evolving as the market and practices  have evolved. We  immediately transferred in 2 experienced development  managers, followed by a trainer and now run intensive  “boot” camps. EweMove showed us that you can generate leads  through pay per click (“PPC”) relatively cheaply and, of  course, we had access to their partner. Market pressures imply that there may be more  independent operators of lettings and sales businesses  looking to exit our sector. So we decided to increase  our efforts in this area at the start of 2017 including  incentivising franchisees with cash back and financial  support for office rebranding.

Decisions relating to strategy, major contracts, acquisitions, internal controls for example are taken at Board level. It met three times in 2017 and will continue to  meet at least twice a year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our  opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Due to the significant management  judgement in forecasting the cash flows and selecting an appropriate discount rate there is a high level of estimation uncertainty which  results in there being a significant risk associated with determining whether goodwill and/or other intangibles are impaired. Any changes to  recognition and measurement will be applied retrospectively by adjusting the opening balance sheet at that time. It applies to all contracts with customers,   except those in the scope of other standards. The  trade names CJ Hole, Parkers and Ellis & Co are assessed as having indefinite lives due to their long trading histories. Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets are stated at deemed cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges. At this juncture it’s estimated that 26.5% of the non-market based performance  condition will be met. As a consequence,  management annually assess whether the carrying value of these brands have been impaired. The after tax cash flows determined through this process were then discounted at 13.5% to determine a  value for each brand name. There has also been more development support required for franchisees without experience of the sector than was originally  expected. As a result an impairment of £0.5m has been  charged to the master franchise agreement’s carrying value. Thus, if the discount  rate increased by more than 14.5% to above 18.77%, an impairment change would result against goodwill, all other assumptions   remaining unchanged.
