directors’ remuneration compared with employees generally (unaudited) as a general rule, the same principles are applied to directors’ fixed remuneration, pension contributions and benefits as are applied to employees throughout the group. there are a number of different bonus schemes in operation throughout the group for brokers, senior management and other employees. under this plan, employees identified as senior managers had 20% of their discretionary 2017 bonus award deferred into equity for a three-year period. the remuneration committee does not believe that a formal capping of bonuses for senior management and brokers is consistent with the delivery of enhanced returns to shareholders and accordingly no caps have been introduced on senior management’s or brokers’ bonuses at this time. typically, brokers receive a fixed salary paid regularly throughout the year, with a significant portion of variable remuneration dependent on their revenue, conduct and performance, which is paid after the revenue has been fully received in cash. employees in such functions report through an organisation structure that is separate to and independent from the business units.

plc) is a company incorporated in england and wales under the companies act. fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. under ifrs 9, derivatives embedded in financial assets are not bifurcated but instead the whole hybrid contract is assessed for classification. under ifrs 9, financial assets can be designated as at fvtpl to mitigate an accounting mismatch. revenue comprises: (i) name passing brokerage, where counterparties to a transaction settle directly with each other. (b) business combinations acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest was disposed of. the results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements based on financial information made up to 31 december each year using the equity method of accounting, except when classified as held for sale. cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. the useful lives of these intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. amortisation charged on assets with a finite useful life is taken to the income statement through administrative expenses. intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. the group acts as an intermediary between its customers for collateralised stock lending transactions. other financial liabilities other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. (k) derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps, are entered into by the group in order to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations or as simultaneous back-to-back transactions with counterparties. settlement of such transactions are primarily on a delivery vs payment basis (‘dvp’) and typically take place within a few business days of the transaction date according to the relevant market rules and conventions. the group holds money, and occasionally financial instruments, on behalf of customers (client monies) in accordance with local regulatory rules. exchange differences arising are classified as other comprehensive income and transferred to the group’s translation reserve. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences may be utilised. (x) treasury shares where share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, net of any tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from equity. the defined benefit obligation represents the scheme’s future liabilities, which are valued using actuarial and other financial assumptions, discounted to a current value using a discount rate set by reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds. revenue arising in each geographic reportable segment is derived from four business divisions; global broking, energy & commodities, institutional services, and data & analytics. revenue for the year ended 31 december 2016 has been classified by business division having been previously reported by the former product groupings of energy & commodities, interest rate derivatives, fixed income, treasury products, equities, and information sales and risk management services. notes to the consolidated financial

ethical standard 2016. under both valuation approaches each cgu had a fvlcd in excess of its carrying value. the calculations have been subject to stress tests reflecting reasonably possible changes in key assumptions. all cgus are insensitive to reasonably possible changes in these assumptions except for americas and asia pacific. the impact on future cash flows resulting from falling growth rates does not reflect any management actions that would be taken under such circumstances. the market approach was based upon a price-earnings methodology using projected earnings for each unit. all associates are involved in broking activities and have either a 31 december or 31 march year end. 50% notes to the consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 december 2017 tp

instruments continued (i) fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position the following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: > level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; > level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and > level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). acquisition related share-based payments as part of the acquisition of pvm, certain former shareholders are eligible to receive additional payments after three years’ service provided they remain as employees and pvm achieves revenue performance targets over that period. intangible assets relating to customer relationships have been provisionally recognised at £3m together with £1m of associated deferred tax liabilities. in september and october 2014, five class actions were filed alleging injury due to purported manipulation of the usd isda fix rate. no subsidiary of the group is therefore currently named as a defendant in relation to this class action. the second amended complaint generally alleges that the companies conspired with certain bank customers to manipulate swiss franc libor and prices of swiss franc libor based derivatives by disseminating false pricing information in false run-throughs and false prices published on screens viewed by customers in violation of the sherman act (anti-trust) and rico . save as outlined above in respect of legal matters or disputes for which a provision has not been made, notwithstanding the uncertainties that are inherent in the outcome of such matters, there are no individual matters which are considered to pose a significant risk of material adverse financial impact on the group’s results or net assets. 34. operating lease commitments 2017 £m 2016 £m minimum operating lease payments recognised in the income
