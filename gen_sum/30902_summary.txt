Through the evolution of these  solutions, we continue to work hard to  provide our customers with more efficient  and effective ways of trading via multiple  protocols, such as Central Limit Order  Books (‘CLOB’), Volume Matching, Crossing  Solutions and Request for Quote (‘RFQ’). In 2017, we hired Eric Sinclair from the  Toronto Stock Exchange where he spent  16 years building out their data business. There are other office moves planned  including a new London office in early 2019. Business development Our business lines are organised into four  global divisions (Global Broking, Energy  & Commodities, Data & Analytics and  Institutional Services) and they all have  inherent growth opportunities in 2018. Our Group is more diverse in product   offering and client reach than  ever before.” To read our Financial  and operating  review see p18–35 www.tpicap.com 13 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements Chief Executive’s review  continued Average revenue per broker is the highest in  this division. In 2017 we continued  to innovate, rolling out new services and  products across a wide spectrum of asset  classes. Understanding employee  sentiment across a broad array of issues has  allowed us to prioritise actions and shape  our culture positively. For example,  employees are given two days paid  volunteering leave a year, and we make  funds available to support their personal  charitable fund-raising efforts. This long-established and  well-loved tradition sees us come together  across the globe to raise money for good  causes, while also having a great deal of  fun. The run saw  Case study tpMA TCH – a record  breaking performance  Link to our strategy 3   5   6   more than $2 trillion of USD forward rate  agreements (‘FRAs’) executed simultaneously  between almost 100 clients. Operating across several different asset  classes and currencies, our team of tpMATCH  product experts construct accurate mid- market curves at that moment in time,  while their Global Sales colleagues contact  clients and solicit portfolios of the asset  class or currency they would like to offset. 2017 represented a mixed year for market  activity in OTC financial markets marked by  ongoing low levels of volatility. This compulsory agenda had  to take priority over our IT integration plans  for both Tullett Prebon and ICAP .

Clients place their trust in our data, which  arms them with the intelligence they need  to make informed choices. In 2017 , we continued  to innovate, rolling out new services and  products across a wide spectrum of asset  classes. In Energy & Commodities we have added  the Liquid Natural Gas markets with data  driven by pricing from our desks.

As a global Company, we rely on several  thousand suppliers of products and services  from more than 31 countries. 2,300 This year we supported more than 100  charities globally, bringing the total number  for charities supported since 1993 to 2,300. www.tpicap.com 45 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements Resources, relationships and responsibilities moved to ‘CV-blind’ assessment centres and  away from historic reliance on the annual  campus recruitment rounds. Statistics relating to these are set out in the  Directors’ Report, on page 90, where we also  publish our annual carbon footprint figures. “Instilling and promoting  a culture rooted in our core values.” To read more about stakeholder  engagement see p59 www.tpicap.com 49 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements Board of Directors Roger Perkin  Independent Non-executive Director  A   N   Ri Angela Knight  Senior Independent Non-executive Director  A   N   Re John Phizackerley  Chief Executive Rupert Robson  Chairman N Rupert Robson was appointed to the  Board in January 2007 and to Non- executive Chairman in March 2013. Angela was appointed as a Non-executive  Director of Taylor Wimpey Plc on  1 November 2016 and Arbuthnot Latham  & Co Ltd in October 2016. All Directors receive written reports before  each meeting, helping them make informed  decisions on corporate and business issues. There was also a detailed review of potential  successors to the Executive Directors and  any leadership development requirements  identified for those individuals. Prior to their first meetings,  each was taken through a briefing with  external legal advisers on Directors’ duties,  roles and liabilities. This helps ensure that the  external auditor is able to operate  effectively and challenge management  sufficiently when required. Consequently, we are also pleased to  announce the appointment of Bernadine  Burnell as our new Chief Internal Auditor. I am pleased to say that the  organisation remained comfortably within  risk appetite throughout this period, and in  compliance with regulatory requirements. However, as reported elsewhere, the  necessary regulatory approvals were secured  and TP ICAP is successfully operating 11  compliant trading venues. We are pleased to report that this Policy was  approved by more than 89% of shareholders  at the 2017 AGM. At TP ICAP, Executive  Directors are eligible for the same level of  Company pension contributions as applies  to other employees. Prior to joining, Andrew Baddeley had a consultancy agreement with the Company through Ponos Consulting Ltd and received £16,800 in fees.

Other (audited) In addition, the Company made a payment to Andrew Baddeley’s legal advisers of £7,500 plus VAT. The business only holds financial instruments for identified buyers and sellers in matching trades which are generally settled  within one to three days. The Remuneration Committee may determine that Executive Directors should receive other  reasonable benefits if appropriate, taking into account typical market practice. The Remuneration Committee may determine that Executive Directors should receive other  reasonable benefits if appropriate, taking into account typical market practice. www.tpicap.com 85 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements Policy on Directors’ remuneration compared with employees generally (unaudited) As a general rule, the same principles are applied to Directors’ fixed remuneration, pension contributions and benefits as are applied to  employees throughout the Group. There are a number of different bonus schemes in operation throughout the Group for Brokers, Senior Management and other employees. Under this Plan,  employees identified as Senior Managers had 20% of their discretionary 2017 bonus award deferred into equity for a three-year period. The Remuneration Committee does not believe that a formal capping of bonuses for Senior Management and Brokers is consistent with the  delivery of enhanced returns to shareholders and accordingly no caps have been introduced on Senior Management’s or Brokers’ bonuses at  this time. Employees in such functions report through an organisation structure that is separate to and independent from the business  units. It is not currently intended that future service contracts for Executive Directors would contain terms differing  materially from those summarised in this report, including with respect to notice provisions. Share capital and control The Company has one class of ordinary shares, which carry no right to fixed income. No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. Key audit matter description As required by IAS 36, goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at   least annually.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid  to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market  participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that  price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation  technique. Under IFRS 9, derivatives  embedded in financial assets are not bifurcated but instead the  whole hybrid contract is assessed for classification. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been  allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently  when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. Amortisation charged on assets with a finite useful life is taken   to the income statement through administrative expenses. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for  impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the  asset may be impaired. Summary of significant accounting policies continued (i) Broker contract payments Payments made to brokers under employment contracts which are   in advance of the expected economic benefit due to the Group are  accounted for as prepayments and included within trade and other  receivables. Other financial liabilities  Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially  measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are subsequently  measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method,  with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. (k) Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency contracts  and interest rate swaps, are entered into by the Group in order   to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency  fluctuations or as simultaneous back-to-back transactions with  counterparties. The Group holds money, and occasionally financial instruments,   on behalf of customers (client monies) in accordance with local  regulatory rules. Revenue arising in each geographic reportable segment is derived from four business divisions; Global Broking, Energy & Commodities,  Institutional Services, and Data & Analytics. The impact on future cash flows resulting from falling  growth rates does not reflect any management actions that would be taken under such circumstances. Under this Plan, employees identified as Senior Managers have 20% of their annual discretionary bonus awarded in deferred shares. Intangible assets relating to customer relationships have been provisionally  recognised at £3m together with £1m of associated deferred tax liabilities. In September and October 2014, five class actions were filed alleging injury due to purported manipulation of the USD ISDA Fix  rate. No subsidiary of the Group is therefore currently named as a defendant  in relation to this class action.
