strength through independence our people are at the heart of what we do our operating model is focused on putting the employee first. whilst there are always lessons to be learned, i believe that management made appropriate decisions in this period of uncertainty and reduced demand. reaching our first year end as a public company i am proud to have overseen the smooth transition from private ownership. • we will work hard to remain the car buyer’s champion by, offering unrivalled choice, value and service. i am pleased that this has increased during fy17 from 72% to 77%, reflecting the continued hard work of our colleagues. we are leaders in people development and we are convinced this will maintain our differentiated style from the rest of the car retail industry, and be a major driver of our continued success. we are also better placed to retain our most talented employees and thereby reduce staff turnover. we are building our capability in stock, marketing and customer relationship management, with new initiatives underway to prepare for the next phase of growth. q3 q4 motorpoint group plc annual report and accounts 2017 11 in june 2017, our board of directors recommended motorpoint group plc’s first full year dividend, of 2.90 pence per share, which would take the total dividend for the year to 4.23 pence per share. current trading and outlook our recent openings have built up a considerable growth opportunity for the year ahead; by building volumes in this third of our estate that is under two years old, we will achieve a rapid cash return on these investments. economic and political uncertainty remains apparent in the near term, which may adversely impact customer confidence. in particular there has been impressive expansion within the premium market, not least from bmw, audi, mercedes-benz, jaguar and land rover. motorpoint’s sales and stock mix broadly represents the shape of the new car market, albeit with a modest delay, so we have seen a gradual movement in our sales mix along similar lines. motorpoint group plc annual report and accounts 2017 13 our strategy new sites and growth opportunity during the year we continued to deliver

interim dividend of 1.33 pence per share that was paid on 17 march 2017, this will deliver a total dividend for the year of 4.23 pence per share. to support the maiden motorpoint group plc annual report, four year trends for both revenue and gross profit are shown below, all reported under ifrs. adjusted operating profit adjusted operating profit is reported excluding costs related to the motorpoint group plc ipo but including £0.4m of charges incurred in association with share based compensation plans which have been put in place following ipo. this was most significantly as a result of the increased adjusted operating expenses, which rose from £37.1m to £45.3m. these shares vest after a three year period dependent only on remaining in motorpoint’s continued employment. there will be one further award made for those employees who were not part of the first award, but who joined the business on or before 4 october 2016 and become eligible on providing one year of continuous service. we were delighted that 49% of our employees chose to join the scheme and invest personally in motorpoint. further information on share based compensation schemes is included in note 29 to the consolidated financial statements. exceptional items in relation to the ipo of motorpoint group plc have been prudently treated as non-deductible for tax purposes. stocking finance facilities drawn at 31 march 2017 total £64.9m (2016: £51.0m), near full utilisation of the £65.0m (2016: £55.0m) facility that we have available. prepayments comprise amounts paid out by the business which have future benefits, predominantly rent and rates associated with retail premises but also include deferred costs in relation to extended guarantee products. from 1 december 2016, motorpoint ceased sale of the extended guarantee product as principal, replaced by the sale of a new extended warranty product which is fully underwritten with a third party insurer, with motorpoint now acting as sales agent. as such any product net income is commission and so recognised at the point of sale. cash outflows for pre ipo transactions and dividends totalled £5.2m which were all concluded prior to the listing of motorpoint group plc. we disclose those we believe are likely to have the greatest impact on our business at this moment in time and which have been the subjects of debate at recent board or audit committee meetings. availability and terms of customer finance vehicle sales volumes rely on our customers being able to access affordable credit lines. availability of supply given the absence of forward-purchase contracts with manufacturers or any other suppliers, there is a risk that future vehicle supply is insufficient to satisfy customer demand as the company continues to grow. regulation the company has various fca permissions to carry on a range of regulated insurance and consumer credit activities from which it derives income. we have a compliance committee which conducts regular reviews of the key regulatory risk areas, allocating control environment improvement objectives to relevant owners. all critical business systems have either third party maintenance contracts in place or dedicated internal resource. we utilise the services of an expert third party it company to ensure that any investments made in technology are fit for purpose. a testament to our commitment to growing our own talent is the middle management population, eight of whom have been with us since we opened in 1998 and 47 of whom have been internally promoted. more detail on our share schemes is set out in the financial review on page 18. talent management programme we offer a two year staff programme that will prepare our team to lead workshops to develop self management, self belief and

provide such services if their advice does not conﬂict with their statutory responsibilities and ethical guidance. variable annual bonus performance is measured with reference to an appropriate mix of
