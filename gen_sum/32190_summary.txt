We constantly innovate to deliver outstanding customer service; the foundation for our record levels of repeat customers. Modest capital investment in new sites and no requirement to pay for goodwill helps manage the overhead base. Whilst there are always lessons to be learned, I believe that management made appropriate decisions in this period of uncertainty and reduced demand. 8 Motorpoint Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report EMPLOYEES CUSTOMERS SHAREHOLDERS Your Board I am delighted to be working with our independent non-executives with each of Mary McNamara, Gordon Hurst and Steve Weller joining on our flotation in May 2016.

Q3 Q4 Motorpoint Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 11 In June 2017, our Board of Directors recommended Motorpoint Group Plc’s first full year dividend, of 2.90 pence per share, which would take the total dividend for the year to 4.23 pence per share. Current Trading and Outlook Our recent openings have built up a considerable growth opportunity for the year ahead; by building volumes in this third of our estate that is under two years old, we will achieve a rapid cash return on these investments. Economic and political uncertainty remains apparent in the near term, which may adversely impact customer confidence. In particular there has been impressive expansion within the premium market, not least from BMW, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar and Land Rover.

JAMES GILMOUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER Overview I am pleased to present our maiden full year Financial Review for Motorpoint Group Plc which was incorporated in April 2016 ahead of the Group’s admission to trading on the London Stock Exchange in May 2016. This will be tabled for approval at the forthcoming AGM on 26 July 2017, with an anticipated payment date during September 2017. To support the maiden Motorpoint Group Plc Annual Report, four year trends for both revenue and gross profit are shown below, all reported under IFRS. This was most significantly as a result of the increased adjusted operating expenses, which rose from £37.1m to £45.3m. These shares vest after a three year period dependent only on remaining in Motorpoint’s continued employment. We were delighted that 49% of our employees chose to join the scheme and invest personally in Motorpoint. Further information on Share Based Compensation schemes is included in note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The facility is available for a fixed term of five years from commencement, which was 10 May 2016. Exceptional items in relation to the IPO of Motorpoint Group Plc have been prudently treated as non-deductible for tax purposes. Stocking finance facilities drawn at 31 March 2017 total £64.9m (2016: £51.0m), near full utilisation of the £65.0m (2016: £55.0m) facility that we have available. Prepayments comprise amounts paid out by the business which have future benefits, predominantly rent and rates associated with retail premises but also include deferred costs in relation to extended guarantee products. From 1 December 2016, Motorpoint ceased sale of the extended guarantee product as principal, replaced by the sale of a new extended warranty product which is fully underwritten with a third party insurer, with Motorpoint now acting as sales agent. As such any product net income is commission and so recognised at the point of sale. Cash outflows for pre IPO transactions and dividends totalled £5.2m which were all concluded prior to the listing of Motorpoint Group Plc. Availability and terms of customer finance Vehicle sales volumes rely on our customers being able to access affordable credit lines.
