of occupiers. last year i commented that macro-economic and political risks had affected the ftse 100. shares in real estate have been significantly impacted by uncertainty. as the government’s minimum energy efficiency standards have the potential to affect property values, our award-winning efficiency programme has positioned our portfolio well and we have become a partner of re100, committed to using 100% electricity from renewable sources. this year, we will be launching a branded flexible workspace offer which enables us to capture incremental demand from the increasing number of small businesses taking space in london as well as meeting a growing need amongst our existing occupiers for flexible space for specific projects and teams. we let more space on better terms to a wider range of occupiers than in the previous year. consumer spending was resilient in the months following the eu referendum, but weaker sales chris grigg chief executive officer 6 british land annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report chief executive’s review data in recent months suggests that consumers are becoming more cautious with higher prices impacting disposable incomes. retailers are also anticipating a more challenging environment, with import cost inflation, higher business rates in some areas and the national living wage putting pressure on margins. these dynamics have increased retailers’ focus on space which allows them to trade profitably across a range of channels. looking further ahead, our medium term pipeline covers a range of uses, including office-led development in london and retail and mixed use development across the country, notably eden walk in kingston where we received planning permission for our 538,000 sq ft mixed use regeneration during the year. i was also particularly pleased to announce that we had updated our policy on shared parental pay to provide equal enhanced benefits for all parents, one example of how we are promoting the development of a diverse and inclusive team. london occupiers, particularly financial institutions, are making contingency plans but there is a wide range of possible outcomes here. this reflects the continuing execution of our strategy, providing space that responds to changing lifestyles and really fulfils customers’ needs. our priorities for the year ahead customer orientation – further develop customer insights – deliver technology driven innovations right places – deliver next steps of the broadgate masterplan – submit canada water planning – deliver flexible workspace offer capital efficiency – beat budget and achieve leasing targets – recycle capital to improve returns expert people – promote an inclusive, performance driven culture – create a more customer focused organisation 8 british land annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report chief executive’s review continued what makes british land different? we have a clear purpose at british land to create places people prefer and this drives the business. this ensures our properties reflect the changing way people live their lives and provide what businesses need to thrive. they are: do what is right, not what is easy work efficiently as one team make commercial decisions that create long term value make things happen for more on chris’ views see w w w.britishland.com/ceoblog our values our values underpin everything we do. we focus on multi-let retail across the uk and office-led campuses in london which are increasingly mixed use. the weaker currency translates to higher input costs for retailers, with consumers potentially facing lower disposable incomes as inflation increases. in offices, we survey office workers and engage with key decision makers from a range of businesses, providing important insight into how to improve our work spaces. our environments are designed to reflect people’s changing lifestyles, where the distinction between work and leisure time is increasingly blurred. at 100 liverpool street, we are targeting the well building standard which supports wellbeing innovations that help create healthier, more productive offices. today’s occupiers see their workspace as a tool to attract and retain key talent so our first area of focus was on what made a great place to work, with particular emphasis on ‘millennials’ who will be the principal users of our space over the coming decades. in retail we use our detailed understanding of local catchments, demographics, spending patterns and consumer preferences to effectively target new occupiers. this helps our occupiers meet the changing needs of today’s workforce and improve their overall wellbeing. our campus-based office portfolio positions us well to address this growing need, whether in respect of small and expanding businesses or larger companies requiring added flexibility. having a single organisation responsible for all assets enables us to rapidly capture and transfer best practice learnings across our portfolio. we will monitor this on an ongoing basis to assess our performance in meeting customer needs. we are active in disposing of single-let retail assets which don’t provide opportunities for us to deploy our placemaking expertise. we believe it will continue to benefit from population growth and urbanisation, driving long term demand for our places. we are active in selling those properties within our portfolio which do not meet these criteria. development and capital projects are the main ways that we can enhance our properties to better meet customers’ evolving demands and have been an our strategic focus offices lifestyle orientated mixed use offices campuses large, office-led mixed use lifestyle campuses retail multi-let lifestyle centres regional

water for example we launched our fourth public consultation in may this year ahead of submitting planning. attracting new brands our £60 million refurbishment of meadowhall is on track to complete by the end of 2017. the improvements have already helped attract new brands to meadowhall including neal’s yard, nespresso, hawes & curtis, flannels and ghost london. this includes brands attracted by the enhanced environment following our £15 million refurbishment such as smiggle and clas ohlson. we have transformed the dining offer with new brands including wagamama, wasabi, limeyard, turtle bay and chicken shop. often investments within the portfolio, or acquiring properties adjacent to our existing holdings, result in complementary benefits, enhancing returns. developments have delivered some of our strongest returns, but are inherently higher risk, particularly when pursued on a speculative basis. this means we do not adjust our approach to leverage based on changes in property market yields. ” recycling capital we sold debenhams’ flagship oxford street store for £400 million in july 2016 on terms agreed ahead of the referendum. this decision to sell reflected that the greatest value creation opportunities from development and leasing had been realised. 97 % of all electricity we purchase across our portfolio comes from renewable sources, working towards 100% as an re100 partner investing in partnership together with gic our joint venture partner, we are investing in broadgate to create a vibrant, world class, mixed use destination. in our experience, buildings with strong sustainability ratings are easier to rent and achieve higher occupancy levels. we have a formal annual appraisal process for each member of our team and empower all employees to progress their careers with personal development plans. this year we launched a wellbeing committee which will focus on mental health and personal wellbeing and we have updated our policy on shared parental pay to provide equal enhanced benefits for all parents following the birth or adoption of a child. we encourage the recruitment of underrepresented ethnic minorities through our support for initiatives such as pathways to property, budding brunels and urbanplan uk. these schemes all encourage young people from a wide range of backgrounds to consider careers in real estate. we are also a member of apres, an action programme on responsible and ethical sourcing across the construction industry. ” chloe simmonite, customer service assistant at meadowhall encouraging creativity we entered

growing share of activity in recent years, has held up well, and we are encouraged that a number of leading global companies have reaffirmed their commitment to london since the referendum. vacancy rates have risen from low levels to marginally above long term averages in both the city and west end following recent development completions. these factors will heighten their focus on the best space, where to date, demand has held up well. in recent years we have positioned our business to benefit from the long term trends driving demand for space, by providing places which reflect people’s

example of how our standalone office assets provide liquidity allowing us to develop and trade opportunistically. we are already seeing a good response from occupiers with 37 long term lettings and renewals signed here in the year. we also commenced a 66,000 sq ft leisure development at new mersey, speke which is largely pre-let and expect to complete the residential element of clarges, mayfair

(288,000 sq ft) and 135 bishopsgate (325,000 sq ft) at broadgate, in the coming months following receipt of planning and agreement with our joint venture partner. at blossom street, we have secured

and growing companies. this trend is driving a change in the type of space which is succeeding, with a growing emphasis on flexibility, co-working and wellbeing, as well as environments which are compatible with the way people’s work and leisure time overlap. at the portfolio level, this includes broadening the range of uses on our campuses with a higher allocation to retail and leisure, as well as delivering more flexible office space with floorplates which are easily divisible, enabling us to target a wider range of occupiers. at 4 kingdom street, paddington central, we were almost 80% under offer on the office space within a week of completion in april. this means that across our campuses, we are under offer or in advanced negotiations on over 700,000 sq ft of space with significant discussions ongoing across the london business with potential occupiers on a further 850,000 sq ft of space, which could trigger further development commitments. 37 british land annual report and accounts 2017 carbon reporting we actively manage greenhouse gas emissions across our business. our energy efficiency programme has saved occupiers £13 million gross over six years and we’re committed to using 100% electricity from renewable sources. we have used purchased energy consumption data, the ghg protocol corporate accounting and reporting standard (revised edition) and emission factors from the uk government’s ghg conversion factors for company reporting 2016. emission from combustion of fuels has increased by 1%, largely due to weather affecting gas use in offices. for consistency with previous years, carbon data in this report is calculated using the location based methodology. management also monitors epra nav as this provides a transparent and consistent basis to enable comparison between european property companies. 41 british land annual report and accounts 2017 net divestment including transactions completing after the year end increased to £1.1 billion. this means we do not adjust our approach to leverage based on changes in property market yields. british land’s committed bank facilities total £1.8 billion, of which £1.3 billion was undrawn at 31 march 2017. for more on managing our risks, including financial risks, see pages 46 to 53. managing interest rate exposure we manage our interest rate profile independently from our debt, considering the sensitivity of underlying earnings to movements in market rates of interest over a five year period. the interest rate management of joint ventures and funds is considered separately by each entity’s board, taking into account appropriate factors for its business. £1.8bn total revolving credit facilities maintain strong balance sheet metrics we use both debt and equity financing. our strategy, which is based on long term trends, endures; we had already positioned the business for a range of outcomes with modest development exposure, high occupancy and robust finances. however, we have a range of tactical levers to address the evolving political and economic uncertainties. also, several of our principal risks have evolved in nature; the regulatory environment is now recognised within a broader ‘political and regulatory outlook’ risk; and the ‘development strategy’ risk has been expanded to include development cost inflation. our risk assessment principal risks

note: the above illustrates principal risks which by their nature are those which have the potential to significantly impact the group’s strategic objectives, financial position or reputation. interest rates have remained low; but uk inflation is increasing, partly driven by the devaluation of sterling. prime yields have remained broadly stable, although market pricing is becoming increasingly polarised with some softening in demand for more secondary assets. these pressures mean that retailers are increasingly focusing on the most profitable stores, where they can grow sales with lower occupancy costs. we have seen vacancy rates rising in both the city and west end following recent development completions and expect this to apply downward pressure on market rents; however accelerating polarisation towards higher quality places will provide support for rents in the best locations. – we maintain a comprehensive crisis response plan across all business units as well as a

uncertain environment, we have moderated our current speculative development exposure to only 4% of the portfolio. as well as being well priced, our financing is robust with an average term of eight years on drawn debt and no requirement for the group to refinance until early 2021. our committed bank facilities total £1.8 billion of which £1.3 billion was undrawn at 31 march 2017. for more on our

differentiating our space by providing places which reflect people’s changing lifestyles. aubrey adams will have served as a non-executive director for almost nine years by the time of our 2017 agm. when a non-executive director’s tenure goes beyond nine years, their independence is carefully reviewed and monitored. in making this determination, the board has reviewed the nomination committee’s assessment of whether each director remains independent in character and judgement and whether there are relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, that judgement (b.1.1) . when running board meetings the chairman maintains a collaborative atmosphere and ensures that all directors contribute to debates. a number of policies and procedures have been adopted by the group to ensure that we not only meet our legal obligations, but also behave ethically, act with integrity and protect our assets from the unlawful activities of others. our website also provides a number of case studies for stakeholders’ information covering topics from asset profiles to sustainability activities. i would like to thank simon for his valuable contribution as a member of this committee. as committee chairman, i additionally hold regular meetings with the chief financial officer and other members of management. these reports have allowed the committee to scrutinise and ask questions where further clarification or discussion was required. other than the provision of recruitment consultancy services, zygos does not have any connection with british land

land is a real estate investment trust (reit) and does not pay tax on its property income or gains on property sales, provided that at least 90% of the group’s property income is distributed as a dividend to shareholders, which becomes taxable in their hands. the primary source of evidence for property valuations should be recent, comparable market transactions on an arms-length basis. ifrs diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive impact as ias 33 ignores this hurdle to conversion. copies of the valuation certificates of knight frank llp, cbre and jones lang lasalle can be found

value of these interest rate swaps by £131m (2015/16: £197m). for derivative financial instruments that settle on a net basis (e.g. interest rate swaps) the undiscounted net cash flows are shown and for derivatives that require gross settlement (e.g. cross currency swaps) the undiscounted gross cash flows are presented. trade creditors and amounts owed to joint ventures, which are repayable within one year, have been excluded from the analysis. this secure income profile is generated from upward only rent reviews, long leases and high occupancy rates. pid dividends are paid, as required by reit legislation, after deduction of withholding tax at the basic rate (currently 20%), where appropriate. details of outstanding share options and shares awarded to employees including executive
