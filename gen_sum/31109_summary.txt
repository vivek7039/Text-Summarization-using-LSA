READ ABOUT OUR PERFORMANCE ON PAGES 13 TO 25 *Underlying measures exclude non-underlying items as analysed in note 5. Our revenue from export sales has increased steadily in recent years and offers great potential for future growth. OUR MARKETS BY GEOGRAPHY The export business continued its strong growth in 2017 with sales improving 24% versus prior year. Animalcare Group now exports to 38 countries in Europe, Asia, Australasia, Africa and South America through 86 different distribution partners. Dinalgen sales were behind prior year but this was largely down to phasing of purchasing patterns in major markets. 06 26011 18/05/2018 Proof 4 Revenue Export: 9% Revenue own Country Organisation: 91% Market trends and what this means for Animalcare { Increase in demand for new treatments and medicines – extension of current vaccine development programme { Decrease in use of anti-infectives across Western Europe – is both a risk in some areas but an opportunity in others, such as increased use of vaccines { Unmet needs of small animals – incontinence and anxiety market is growing { Minor species – rabbits become important Market trends and what this means for Animalcare { More consolidation -our personal veterinary clinic approach becomes more appreciated { Product lines increase -resulting in a slight increase of working capital PHARMACEUTICALS WHOLESALE OUR HEAD OFFICE Animalcare Group plc Annual Report 2017 www.animalcaregroup.co.uk Stock Code: ANCR STRATEGIC REPORT OUR BUSINESS 07 26011 18/05/2018 Proof 4 OUR STRONGER BUSINESS MODEL OUR PEOPLE Our People are key to our continued growth RELATIONSHIPS We have strong relationships with distribution partners, strategic alliances, wholesalers, CMOs and distributors LICENCES Animalcare owns around 50 licensed drugs.

Basic Underlying Earnings per share (“EPS”) The measure of how successful we are in growing our business organically and by acquisition coupled with strong financial disciplines, including those related to tax and capital allocation, is captured in the Group’s underlying earnings per share. Underlying EPS is a key measure of our overall performance and the return we generate for shareholders before exceptional items. READ ABOUT OUR STRATEGY ON PAGES 10 AND 11 READ ABOUT OUR PERFORMANCE ON PAGES 13 TO 25 12 26011 18/05/2018 Proof 4 Introduction and Summary of the Group The key aim for our business is to create a cash-generative, growing pan-European animal health company and in July 2017 Animalcare Group plc completed the acquisition of Ecuphar NV (“Ecuphar”), an acquisition that constituted a reverse takeover. { Acquisitive growth potential: Our strong balance sheet and scale also opens opportunities for value-accretive acquisitions which would allow us to target direct sales in other geographical territories. Products are either owned by the Group or licensed on long-term distribution agreements with third parties. “ T h e key aim for our business is to create a cash- generative, growing pan- European animal health company” CHRIS CARDON CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW Animalcare Group plc Annual Report 2017 www.animalcaregroup.co.uk Stock Code: ANCR 13 STRATEGIC REPORT OUR PERFORMANCE 26011 18/05/2018 Proof 4 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW Following the acquisition this segment now includes the products that were previously categorised as Licensed Veterinary Medicines, Animal Welfare and Companion Animal Identification. Dinalgen (anti-inflammatory) sales were behind prior year but this was largely down to phasing of purchasing patterns in major markets. Whilst the impact of a changing sales mix and competitive pricing pressures are likely to persist over the rest of 2018 we expect to deliver at least double digit growth in underlying EBITDA in this division and to see further strong sales growth driven by a growing portfolio of products and a wider geographical sales reach for these products. Revenues increased by 9.7%, entirely through organic growth, to £23.9m (2016: £21.8m) with this division representing 28.6% of total Group sales. This division delivered underlying and reported EBITDA of £0.3m (2016: £0.5m) reflecting the investment made in sales staff to drive future growth. 14 26011 18/05/2018 Proof 4 A project rationalisation and prioritisation process for all projects across the Group has been undertaken. The Company is currently focused on 17 active new product development pipeline projects within Spain and UK. In addition, we announced at the end of April that Iain Menneer has stood down from his role as Chief Operating Officer. Le Vet has been a long-term partner of Animalcare and Ecuphar with distribution agreements in four territories. We are taking action now to mitigate against any material change which could adversely impact trading part way through 2019. Our strategy for growth includes: { Cross-selling opportunities across customers and distribution channels { More synergies delivered through further integration of the businesses { Enhancing geographic footprint and sales, marketing and distribution network { Developing network of partnerships / strategic alliances to increase exposure to new opportunities { Identifying selective value-accretive acquisitions { Diversifying the portfolio of products into additional therapeutic areas within companion animal as well as production animal and equine markets { Broadening the product development pipeline to include novel therapies We expect growth in revenues to be driven by the launch of new products from our development pipeline, additional regulatory approvals for our existing products in new territories and the distribution of new products for US or Asia based third parties across our European footprint. We also expect margin improvement to be seen as the opportunity to cross-sell products fully impacts as existing distribution agreements held by our UK business for Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Belgium are exited and replaced by our own direct sales network. We believe we are on track to deliver double digit profit growth during 2018 and enhancement to profit margins will be driven by further synergies and cross-selling opportunities, which will start to take effect late in 2018 as integration progresses, but will deliver a more meaningful impact on profit margins during 2019 as the full effect of these changes are felt. “ T h e reve r s e acquisition will provide a number of opportunities for growth and long-term value creation for our shareholders” CHRIS BREWSTER CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW Animalcare Group plc Annual Report 2017 www.animalcaregroup.co.uk Stock Code: ANCR 17 STRATEGIC REPORT OUR PERFORMANCE 26011 18/05/2018 Proof 4 CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW Overview of Underlying Results To assist with the understanding of our underlying financial results, the Group results presented below are split between continuing operations (Ecuphar NV) and acquisition, being Animalcare Group plc from 13 th July 2017. Ecuphar’s continuing business underlying EBITDA decreased by 5.6% to £8.4m primarily reflecting the lower gross margins, investments in our infrastructure and people to support future growth and the disposal of NutriScience which Ecuphar sold in October 2016 which contributed profits of approximately £0.2m. From a financial performance perspective, we have delivered strong revenue growth; however, this has not translated through to our operating profit as we have experienced competitive market pressures and changing sales mix, leading to margin decline in the second half of 2017.

Gross profit was flat at £8.7m largely reflecting the changing sales mix towards lower margin export business. Operating expenses excluding non-underlying items increased by £0.4m of which approximately half relates to higher central costs, including the enlarged Board. 3 4 5 6 Revenues and gross margins may be adversely affected should competitors launch competing generic or superior (novel) products. We monitor supplier performance and maintain adequate inventories, including safety stock held by our suppliers, based on risk assessments. Regular dialogue is maintained with relevant authorities in each country to ensure we maintain a thorough understanding of regulatory changes. Marc was appointed as a Non- Executive Director on 13 th July 2017 following the acquisition of Ecuphar NV. Committee membership By invitation Relevant skills and experience Chris founded Ecuphar NV as Chris Cardon NV in 2001 to capitalise on opportunities identified in the animal health industry and grew the company through a successful focus on product portfolio development. Chris graduated as a pharmacist from the University of Ghent in 1993 after which he took over his family’s pharmacy business. Committee membership By invitation Relevant skills and experience Chris has a broad range of experience gained during his ten years working across a number of functions at KPMG and through his role as Group Accounting Manager at Findus Group. Accountability The Company has in place a system of internal financial controls commensurate with its current size and activities, which is designed to ensure that the possibility of misstatement or loss is kept to a minimum. These procedures include the preparation of management accounts, forecast variance analysis and other ad hoc reports. This is closed to new members and no further options will be granted under the LTIP 2014. As a consequence, 918,896 new Ordinary Shares were issued to Iain Menneer and Chris Brewster on 12 th July 2017. Judgement is required when assessing the technical and commercial feasibility of New Product Development projects, including whether regulatory approval will be achieved.

Animalcare Group plc Annual Report 2017 www.animalcaregroup.co.uk Stock Code: ANCR OUR FINANCIALS 53 26011 18/05/2018 Proof 4 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill is recognised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated income statement. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost). Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to future cash flows projected after the fifth year. Bank overdrafts are shown within loans and borrowings in current liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position. Available-for-sale financial assets measured at fair value Available-for-sale financial assets relate to investments that are not initially acquired in view of a short-term sale (shares and securities) and that are not fully consolidated nor equity consolidated. Early application is permitted, but not before an entity applies IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. { Amendments to IFRS 9 Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation (applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 st January 2019, but not yet endorsed in the EU). { IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 st January 2021, but not yet endorsed in the EU). { IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration (applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 st January 2018, but not yet endorsed in the EU). { IFRIC 23 Uncertainty Over Income Tax Treatments (applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 st January 2019, but not yet endorsed in the EU). Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities for future periods.
