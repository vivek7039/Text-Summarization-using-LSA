strategic report our business 01 26011 18/05/2018 proof 4 chairman’s statement 2017 was a transformational year for animalcare group plc. the business has been trading for 25 years and is well established in this stable market. the group comprises direct sales and marketing operations in 7 european territories (see graphic on page 4). distribution to european and rest of world geographic territories is managed by our export team. the pharmaceutical licensing is managed through our in-house regulatory team or local consultants where necessary. our revenue from export sales has increased steadily in recent years and offers great potential for future growth. our markets by geography the export business continued its strong growth in 2017 with sales improving 24% versus prior year. animalcare group now exports to 38 countries in europe, asia, australasia, africa and south america through 86 different distribution partners. dinalgen sales were behind prior year but this was largely down to phasing of purchasing patterns in major markets. 06 26011 18/05/2018 proof 4 revenue export: 9% revenue own country organisation: 91% market trends and what this means for animalcare {

animal health company and in july 2017 animalcare group plc completed the acquisition of ecuphar nv (“ecuphar”), an acquisition that constituted a reverse takeover. { acquisitive growth potential: our strong balance sheet and scale also opens opportunities for value-accretive acquisitions which would allow us to target direct sales in other geographical territories. products are either owned by the group or licensed on long-term distribution agreements with third parties. “ t h e key aim for our business is to create a cash- generative, growing pan- european animal health company” chris cardon chief executive officer chief executive officer’s review animalcare group plc annual report 2017 www.animalcaregroup.co.uk stock code: ancr 13 strategic report our performance 26011 18/05/2018 proof 4 chief executive officer’s review following the acquisition this segment now includes the products that were previously categorised as licensed veterinary medicines, animal welfare and companion animal identification. dinalgen (anti-inflammatory) sales were behind prior year but this was largely down to phasing of purchasing patterns in major markets. whilst the impact of a changing sales mix and competitive pricing pressures are likely to persist over the rest of 2018 we expect to deliver at least double digit growth in underlying ebitda in this division and to see further strong sales growth driven by a growing portfolio of products and a wider geographical sales reach for these products. revenues increased by 9.7%, entirely through organic growth, to £23.9m (2016: £21.8m) with this division representing 28.6% of total group sales. this division delivered underlying and reported ebitda of £0.3m (2016: £0.5m) reflecting the investment made in sales staff to drive future growth. 14 26011 18/05/2018 proof 4 a project rationalisation and prioritisation process for all projects across the group has been undertaken. the company is currently focused on 17 active new product development pipeline projects within spain and uk. in addition, we announced at the end of april that iain menneer has stood down from his role as chief operating officer. le vet has been a long-term partner of animalcare and ecuphar with distribution agreements in four territories. we are taking action now to mitigate against any material change which could adversely impact trading part way through 2019. strategy and outlook the strategy of the business remains focused on building long- term shareholder value by creating a growing, profitable and highly cash generative pan-european animal health platform, capable of investing in a steady flow of new products and rewarding shareholders with dividend payments. our strategy for growth includes: { cross-selling opportunities across customers and distribution channels { more synergies delivered through further integration of the businesses { enhancing geographic footprint and sales, marketing and distribution network { developing network of partnerships / strategic alliances to increase exposure to new opportunities { identifying selective value-accretive acquisitions { diversifying the portfolio of products into additional therapeutic areas within companion animal as well as production animal and equine markets { broadening the product development pipeline to include novel therapies we expect growth in revenues to be driven by the launch of new products from our development pipeline, additional regulatory approvals for our existing products in new territories and the distribution of new products for us or asia based third parties across our european footprint. we also expect margin improvement to be seen as the opportunity to cross-sell products fully impacts as existing distribution agreements held by our uk business for germany, spain, portugal, italy and belgium are exited and replaced by our own direct sales network. we believe we are on track to deliver double digit profit growth during 2018 and enhancement to profit margins will be driven by further synergies and cross-selling opportunities, which will start to take effect late in 2018 as integration progresses, but will deliver a more meaningful impact on profit margins during 2019 as the full effect of these changes are felt. “ t h e reve r s e acquisition will provide a number of opportunities for growth and long-term value creation for our shareholders” chris brewster chief financial officer chief financial officer’s review animalcare group plc annual report 2017 www.animalcaregroup.co.uk stock code: ancr 17 strategic report our performance 26011 18/05/2018 proof 4 chief financial officer’s review overview of underlying results to assist with the understanding of our underlying financial results, the group results presented below are split between continuing operations (ecuphar nv) and acquisition, being animalcare group plc from 13 th july 2017. ecuphar’s continuing business underlying ebitda decreased by 5.6% to £8.4m primarily reflecting the lower gross margins, investments in our infrastructure and people to support future growth and the disposal of nutriscience which ecuphar sold in october 2016 which contributed profits of approximately £0.2m. this growth was primarily driven by very strong growth in production animals revenue which as an overall category increased by 25.2% versus prior year to £28.4m together with a strong contribution from the companion animals category. from a financial performance perspective, we have delivered strong revenue growth; however, this has not translated through to our operating profit as we have experienced competitive market pressures and changing sales mix, leading to margin decline in the second half of 2017. against this backdrop, our priorities for the current year are: { increasing sales of new products from our distribution network and expanding our geographic footprint { focusing on gross margin and ebitda development in order to deliver anticipated profit growth { improving operating cash generation, important in providing the business with the funds to continue the momentum in our product development pipeline together with dividend flow { delivering integration to unlock scale benefits and support ebitda we remain firm in our belief that the reverse acquisition will provide a number of opportunities for growth. we expect to see some benefits of the integration in the current year but a more meaningful impact on profit in 2019. once fully integrated, we believe this will provide a strong platform for long-term value creation for our shareholders. animalcare group plc annual report 2017 www.animalcaregroup.co.uk stock code: ancr 21 strategic report our performance 26011 18/05/2018 proof 4 chief financial officer’s review proforma consolidated financial information (unaudited) as noted previously, to help shareholders to assess the group, an unaudited proforma consolidated income statement has been produced, which reflects 12 months of trading from both entities as below. gross profit was flat at £8.7m largely reflecting the changing sales mix towards lower margin export business. operating expenses excluding non-underlying items increased by £0.4m of which approximately half relates to higher central costs, including the enlarged board. 3 4 5 6 revenues and gross margins may be adversely affected should competitors launch competing generic or superior (novel) products. we monitor supplier performance and maintain adequate inventories, including safety stock held by our suppliers, based on risk assessments. regular dialogue is maintained with relevant authorities in each country to ensure we maintain a thorough understanding of regulatory changes. marc was appointed as a non- executive director on 13 th july 2017 following the acquisition of ecuphar nv. committee membership by invitation relevant skills and experience chris founded ecuphar nv as chris cardon nv in 2001 to capitalise

made to provide continuing employment wherever possible. judgement is required when assessing the technical and commercial feasibility of new product development projects, including whether regulatory approval will be achieved. animalcare group plc annual report 2017 www.animalcaregroup.co.uk stock code: ancr our financials 43 26011 18/05/2018 proof 4 independent auditors’ report to the members of

limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. goodwill is recognised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated income statement. intangible assets acquired in a business combination intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost). other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. for longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to future cash flows projected after the fifth year. bank overdrafts are shown within loans and borrowings in current liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position. available-for-sale financial assets measured at fair value available-for-sale
