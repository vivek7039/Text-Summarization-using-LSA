We also examined management’s ongoing analysis of its financing arrangements and considered recent correspondence with the tax authorities.

Such unobservable inputs are based on management’s own assessment of market and other conditions currently prevailing or expected to prevail. Certain elements of the Group’s commodity contract portfolio also fall into this category, as their values include significant management-derived assumptions. At 31 March 2017, provisions included amounts for insurance claims payable by the Group’s reinsurance company, legal matters, employee termination and other restructuring costs. All material amounts relating to exceptional items in the Group’s financial statements are classified on a consistent basis across accounting periods. Value in use was calculated based on budgets and plans covering the next five years that have been approved by th e Board. Cash flows were projected during the five-year period based on budgeted operating profit and management’s expectations of market developments. Cash flows from 2018 onwards are expected to grow at a mid-single digit compound annual ra te over the subsequent four years. There are no other individually material elements of goodwill allocated to either the Speciality Food Ingredients or Bulk Ingre dients operating segments. The Group has assumed medical cost infl ation at 8.0% per annum (2016 – 6.0%), grading down to 5% by 2023, and used a discount rate of 3.9% (2016 – 3.6%).
