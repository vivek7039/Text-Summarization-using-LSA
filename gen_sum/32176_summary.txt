summary of exceptional items can be found in note 7. there was no tax credit on exceptional items (2016 – £21 million credit), although the group did recognise exceptional deferred tax credits totalling £65 million (2016 – £nil) following recent changes to the group’s internal financing structure, and a transfer of intellectual property assets related to splenda ® sucralose to align ownership with the underlying manufacturing base. firstly, as a result of recent changes in uk legislation arising from the oecd’s base erosion and profit shifting (beps) project and changes to the internal financing arrangements we use to fund our international businesses, we have recognised an exceptional deferred tax credit of £34 million arising from previously unrecognised tax losses in the uk, which, based on enacted legislation, are now expected to be utilised against future uk taxable profits. strategic report governance financial statements useful information www.tateandlyle.com 35 group financial results continued adjusted free cash flow (representing cash generated from continuing operations excluding the impact of exceptional items less net interest paid, income tax paid, and capital expenditure) was £174 million, £121 million higher than the prior year principally reflecting higher earnings (after adjusting for non-cash items) and lower capital expenditure. the outcome of this referendum is not expected to have a material near-term impact on our business. being unable to retain key people and adequately plan for succession could have a negative impact on our performance. failure to do any of these things could have a material adverse effect on our performance and reputation. • preventive maintenance programme across the plant network • ongoing programme

made decisions during the year, and summarises key points from the report, including performance and incentive plan outcomes, and committee activities. business performance context as you will read in the introductory statements in this annual report, we are pleased to report a year of strong performance with overall results reflecting delivery against our strategy and progress towards our 2020 ambition. both business divisions delivered profit growth in constant currency, with bulk ingredients (bi) delivering particularly strong results, driven by good commercial and manufacturing performance. 3. www.tateandlyle.com 75 strategic report governance financial statements useful information the committee formed this view thoughtfully, taking a number of factors into account, as described below. since the 2014 policy was adopted, we have continued to engage proactively with shareholders • we have engaged proactively with shareholders over successive years, and i am pleased to report that the level of shareholder support for our core remuneration framework remains strong (most recent policy and report resolutions enjoying support of 97.9% and 93.0% respectively) • we made specific changes to the long-term incentive (psp) framework last year, which were the subject of detailed consultation with shareholders, and which align well with our business strategy and long-term ambition for growth • we consulted ahead of the publication of this report with a broad group including many of our largest 30 shareholders, offering meetings with me, to explain our intended approach in reviewing the policy, and to capture any feedback. we have been responsive to prevailing investor and governance themes since the current policy was adopted, the committee has been attentive to governance developments and changes in shareholders’ expectations, and our practice has evolved over that time to adopt several governance-friendly features, for example: • we were early adopters of claw back and malus provisions • our personal shareholding requirements continue to be more demanding than typical (four times salary for the chief executive; three times salary for other executive directors and executive committee members) • we have introduced a holding period for psp awards, so a combination of a three-year vesting period and two-year holding period means that awards made since 2016 have a five-year time horizon • a ‘dividend underpin’ supplements the existing financial performance underpin, providing the committee discretion to reduce the vesting outcome in certain circumstances, and providing shareholders with additional comfort that psp awards will only vest if dividends over the period conform with our policy • we also remain committed to maintaining the quality of our remuneration-related disclosure (for example, disclosing bonus targets in full). in this way, we maintain a keen focus on delivering long-term growth and value for shareholders.

strategic report governance financial statements useful information incorporation of previously approved remuneration policy statements we intend that provisions consistent with previously disclosed directors’ remuneration policies and/or incentive plans previously approved by shareholders will continue to apply after shareholders have approved the resolution to adopt the remuneration policy set out in this report. the company chairman and non-executive directors receive a fee for their services, do not participate in the group’s incentive or pension schemes, do not receive any other benefits, and have no right to compensation if their appointment is terminated. depending on the circumstances, and any restrictions or requirements that may apply, the company may consult with key shareholders as part of this process and/or disclose terms on which a new appointment is made through a regulatory information service. the post-vesting holding period applicable to performance share plan awards will cease on termination of employment. similarly, additional consideration may be provided, if necessary, to secure specific agreements following separation (for example an enhanced non-compete provision) that protect the group’s interests. depending on the role and circumstances of departure, a director who has been relocated may be repatriated in accordance with previously agreed terms. these lines of communication ensure that emerging best practice principles are factored into the committee’s decision making. our approach to remuneration operates consistently across the group, recognising that we recruit talented individuals so that we may deliver superior operational performance and outstanding financial results • salary and benefits (including e.g. healthcare or retirement benefits, where appropriate) are competitive in the relevant local market • our pay for performance framework provides employees with opportunities for meaningful salary and career progression over time • remuneration arrangements provide a competitive reward opportunity to encourage the achievement of genuinely stretching short-term and long-term objectives • key individuals with specific accountabilities for driving annual and longer-term performance participate variously in our sales incentive plan, the annual bonus plan, and the performance share plan • all aspects of remuneration are designed to encourage a focus on long-term, sustained performance and risk management www.tateandlyle.com 85 strategic report governance financial statements useful information

senior executives and shareholders. our executive shareholding requirements are more demanding and extend to a greater number of senior executives in the group when compared with similar uk-listed companies. • other executive committee members are subject to the share ownership policy, with target holdings at three times salary. 1 notification was made over 12 months ago; as permitted under rule 5, shareholders are not required to notify us of subsequent changes within certain ranges. disclosure of information to auditors so far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditors are unaware; and he or she has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the group and company’s auditors are aware of that information. our other areas of focus have been further refined to reflect certain developments in the group during fy17. this percentage is calculated on an absolute basis, which aggregates component profits and losses, ignoring sign convention. where management had calculated values by reference to non-market observable data, we found that these were within acceptable ranges. in addition, certain financing arrangements that the group has entered into, while not uncommon or unduly aggressive, have been previously subject to enquiry by tax authorities. we also examined management’s ongoing analysis of its financing arrangements and considered recent correspondence with the tax authorities. we also performed an independent assessment of the asset valuations and concluded that they were appropriate. rationale for benchmark applied the group’s principal measure of earnings is adjusted profit before tax from continuing operations, which excludes exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and net retirement benefit interest from profit before tax. the group adjusts for exceptional items as it believes that doing so is necessary to provide an understanding of financial performance. strategic report governance financial statements useful information

accounting period the group’s annual financial statements are drawn up to 31 march. estimates are based on factors including historical experience and expectations of future events, corroborated with external information where possible. such unobservable inputs are based on management’s own assessment of market and other conditions currently prevailing or expected to prevail. certain elements of the group’s commodity contract portfolio also fall into this category, as their values include significant management-derived assumptions. the group uses financial instruments (mainly forward contracts) to manage price risk within its us business, by hedging the contracted amount of corn when either business division (bulk ingredients or speciality food ingredients) enters into a finished good sales contract. future cash flows therefore exclude benefits from major expansion projects requiring future capital expenditure where that expenditure has not been approved and committed on the dates the assets are tested (unless a fair value less costs of disposal model is used). gains from the expected disposal of assets are not taken into account in measuring restructuring provisions. all such actions are strenuously defended but provision is made for liabilities that are considered likely to arise on the basis of current information and legal advice and after taking into account the group’s insurance arrangements. whilst there is always uncertainty as to the outcome of any claim or litigation, it is not expected that claims and litigation existing at 31 march 2017 will have a material adverse effect on the group’s financial position. at 31 march 2017, provisions included amounts for insurance claims payable by the group’s reinsurance company, legal matters, employee termination and other restructuring costs. any shortfall, or negative goodwill, is recognised immediately as a gain in the income statement. all material amounts relating to exceptional items in the group’s financial statements are classified on a consistent basis across accounting periods. financial instruments (see notes 16, 17, 18, 24, 25, 28 and 29) a) trade receivables trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value, which is generally the same as the invoiced amount, and subsequently measured at amortised cost, or their recoverable amount. hedge accounting (see notes 28 and 29) as described in note 29, the grou p uses derivatives to mitigate risk. the group has concluded that the adoption of ifrs 9 will not ha ve a material impact on its consolidated results or financial position, and will continue to review its activities in these areas to ensure compliance with ifrs 9 upon adoption. the following tables present the calculation of these alternative measures: 31 march

tax asset of £34 million arising from previously unrecognised tax losses in th e uk, which are now expected to be utilised against future uk taxable profits. potentially dilutive ordinary shares arise from awa rds made under the group’s share-based incentive plans. the effective interest rate on short-term deposits at 31 march 2016 was 0.5%, with an average maturity of 19 days. value in use was calculated based on budgets and plans covering the next five years that have been approved by th e board. cash flows were projected during the five-year period based on budgeted operating profit and management’s expectations of market developments. cash flows from 2018 onwards are expected to grow at a mid-single digit compound annual ra te over the subsequent four years. there are no other
