uk’s leading income focused reit. following a period of significant growth and transactional activity these priorities underline our ongoing ambition to become the uk’s leading income focused reit. our initial earnings target of 2.7 to 2.8 pence per share has been achieved and in only six months we have made material progress in improving the quality of the portfolio so as to deliver long‑term sustainable income returns and enhanced growth prospects. however, these benefits will remain secondary to securing the right income focused investment opportunities for our shareholders. this acquisition clearly demonstrates our ambition to increase scale through investing in the right earnings enhancing opportunities. financial discipline in february 2017, we aligned underlying earnings to the epra measure, adjusted for limited company specific non‑cash adjustments. utilising this industry standard metric will provide a closer alignment of earnings to operating cash flow. progress against our medium‑term financial targets has been positive with key metrics largely on target or moving in the right direction. with growing global appetite for predictable income returns, we believe our income‑led strategy to deliver market leading shareholder distributions remains extremely attractive. significant progress has been made in strengthening our balance sheet and we will continue to target a lower leverage structure over time. in addition, we have a number of income‑led asset management initiatives planned and underway to support our growth targets. mike watters chief executive

integral part of our asset management process. our exposure to areas of london benefiting from large scale transport and infrastructure investment is well placed. as investors seek out acceptable yields, our ability to deliver sustainable asset backed income returns is compelling. capital values in most markets have performed well driven by both lower investment yields and rental growth. at 20 per cent by market value, uk shopping centres reflect a decreasing part of our portfolio. smartphones and social media remain the enabler for shopping centres, utilising apps to deliver greater

occupier demand and almost negligible available supply. annualised gross rental income increased 5.1 per cent supported by three positive lease events at charing cross generating £0.2 million and reflecting a 19.0 per cent increase on passing rent and the letting of 18,195 sqft (1,690 sqm) of vacant space across the regional office portfolio. given demand in the southbank area we are confident this space will be re‑let at attractive rents. within two years valuation growth and premiums achieved from disposals have delivered a 7.5% increase in acquisition capital values. in addition, the acquisition of a further four travelodge hotels provides exposure to long-dated inflation linked income. the ihl portfolio comprises nine good quality uk hotels which were last valued in february 2017 at £104.4 million. supported by our strategic partnerships, we expect to capitalise on the strong trading record and positive economic outlook. continuously improving our income focused portfolio quality: • our diversified portfolio provides us the ability to invest across sectors where we see the best growth prospects; • we will add nine well performing uk hotel assets to our portfolio; • four of the hotels, valued at £29.0 million, are let on long term leases to travelodge with an effective average unexpired lease term of over 20 years. berlin continues to see strong investment demand which bodes well for our portfolio, where 20 per cent is located. income statement year ended year ended 31 august 2017 31 august 2016 joint group joint group ifrs ventures total ifrs ventures total

several achievements, the most notable being: • the company’s participation in the gresb real estate assessment benefited from a continued increase in score, up 12 per cent on the prior year’s result; • a four per cent like‑ for‑ like (“lfl”) reduction in carbon (co 2 e) emissions based on 39 of our properties; • a six per cent lfl reduction in water consumption across 24 of our properties; • utilities and waste data within our 2017 csr report is now aligned to epra *sbpr core requirements; • over 500 energy performance certificates (“epcs”) have been either reviewed or renewed to ensure our 100 per cent ‘risk free epc strategy’ is achieved; • achieved outstanding q compliance health and safety scores across our uk shopping centres; and • inaugural gresb public disclosure rating of

with a handbook outlining the company’s key policies, which are designed to encourage a pleasant working environment, free from discrimination, undue stress or bullying. in order to support this objective, the available utilities data set has been expanded from 24 properties to 39, representing over a 60 per cent improvement in data collection and reporting across the two geographic locations where redefine international hold assets under management. the omnibus building in reigate was certified to environmental management systems international standard iso14001:2015, a great achievement. focused sustainability training was delivered to all employees based at the group’s head office and across its operational locations. performance we have continued to take important steps in the deployment of our resilient investment strategy. data capture has been significantly improved and a new reporting format is now presented in line with industry accepted environmental performance indicators. in 2017, redefine international celebrated its tenth anniversary since listing and to commemorate this milestone, the company undertook a community project called “ten for 10”. this entailed investing ten days into initiatives designed to support the communities in which we operate. significant progress was however made on the eight hotels under third party management, which given their relative size should make a material difference. the software captures, tracks and analyses hse compliance activity related to a set of predefined indicators. this has led to developments at southwark, derby, banbury and the west orchards in coventry undergoing scoping review. a minimum epc rating level of d will be sought for planned refurbishments and upgrade works to our portfolio

of assets under management. as per mandatory greenhouse gas disclosure, our organisational boundary for environmental disclosure is based on the principle of operational control, and therefore includes all property assets where we are responsible for the procurement of energy, water and waste services. we have provided data to cover 95 per cent of these assets for the current reporting period. only two assets (in germany) under our operational control are excluded from the disclosure, due to lack of reliable and accurate data. as our data management programme is continually evolving, we are not yet able to report the specific end use of procured energy and water. in celebration of redefine international’s tenth anniversary, staff across our property portfolio and our head office pledged to donate ten working days per location to local community groups and charities through the ten for 10 volunteering programme. birchwood shopping centre, warrington helped to remodel a sensory garden for their ‘charity of the year’, brainwave. this comprises all buildings with a floor space of 500m 2 or greater which the public access frequently such as supermarkets. a snapshot into this world here shows some legislative risks and redefine’s interpretation of responsible compliance activity. with each part of the legislative value enhancement (“lve”) process working actively with one another in equilibrium, redefine international is sure to maintain its lve process and broaden key areas of focus as and when required to maximise the opportunity presented by legislative compliance. location based emissions factors are sourced from the uk government (2016 & 2017) and international energy association (to cover german assets). we confirm that environmental

planning for the executives and committee chairs will be a focus area during 2018. redefine international p.l.c. the policy was amended following a strategic review to ensure closer alignment between

subsidiary when facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more elements of control. where the group obtains significant influence or joint control over an investment that was previously accounted for as a financial instrument under ias 39, the group’s previously held interest is re‑measured to fair value through profit or loss. amortisation of intangible assets is recognised in profit or loss on a straight‑line basis over their estimated useful life from the date that they are available for use. impairment reversals are recognised on a consistent basis as the original charge and do not exceed cost. loan receivables and payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. management information, as presented to the chief operating decision maker, is prepared on a proportionately consolidated basis. on a proportionate basis, and for segmental reporting purposes, the net performance fee of £1.6 million has been recognised in other income. the tables above present both segmental and market value investment property information prepared on a proportionately consoli dated basis. the group considers that all of its investment property falls within ‘level 3’, as defined by ifrs 13 (refer to note 31). sales disposal tenant net sales carrying gain on proceeds costs incentives proceeds value disposal 31 august

equity interest (1,938 shares) in the issued share capital. the transaction was not considered a business combination, having regard to associated processes acquired, and has therefore been recognised as an asset acquisition. the fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices or dealer price quotations. adjustments can be made for estimated and actual leavers who forfeit their awards during the vesting period. reference was made to the company’s lse listing in developing share price volatility, dividend yield, risk‑free rate and index correlation assumptions. in common with all other businesses, the group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. however, the group limits such exposure by investing in liquid deposits with material counterparties that have a credit rating of a, a2 or above from standard & poor’s or moody’s, except where specific exemptions are granted by the board. the group also makes a general provision of 25 per cent against all receivables 120 days or more past due that have not been specifically impaired. there is a risk that the group will encounter difficulties in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due. refer to note 22 for further details on the group’s interest rate swap and cap agreements. annual report 2017 150 other information epra property
