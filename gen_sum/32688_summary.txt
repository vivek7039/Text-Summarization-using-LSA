Following a period of significant growth and transactional activity these priorities underline our ongoing ambition to become the UK’s leading income focused REIT. Financial discipline In February 2017, we aligned underlying earnings to the EPRA measure, adjusted for limited Company specific non‑cash adjustments. Progress against our medium‑term financial targets has been positive with key metrics largely on target or moving in the right direction. With growing global appetite for predictable income returns, we believe our income‑led strategy to deliver market leading shareholder distributions remains extremely attractive. Significant progress has been made in strengthening our balance sheet and we will continue to target a lower leverage structure over time. Efficient capital structure Focused on further strengthening the balance sheet by mitigating refinancing risk and efficiently reducing leverage.

Rateable values In January 2016, the UK Valuation Office Agency published an updated rating list for England and Wales which has been adopted from 1 April 2017. Where asset values have been maximised through reconfiguration, refurbishment or leasing activity, these assets will be considered for sale. We are particularly pleased with The Arches Retail Park, Watford where competitive bidding resulted in indicative rental values of over £90 per sqft.

Our focus remains on multi-let industrial estates that benefit from a broad range of occupier demand and suitable to catering for growth in last mile distribution. Our largest exposure at Camino Park, Crawley benefits from the Crawley/Gatwick market which has both strong occupier demand and almost negligible available supply. Looking forward, 64.6 per cent of rental income at Camino Park, Crawley is subject to rent review in late 2017. Within two years valuation growth and premiums achieved from disposals have delivered a 7.5% increase in acquisition capital values. Supported by our strategic partnerships, we expect to capitalise on the strong trading record and positive economic outlook. Berlin continues to see strong investment demand which bodes well for our portfolio, where 20 per cent is located. Strong performers were St George’s Harrow and Banbury Cross, the only Retail Park currently included in like‑for‑like income, which has delivered well against expectations since acquisition. Key achievements in the year 4% 100% Green Energy switch made during 2017 A tenant satisfaction survey in May 2017 achieved a 90.2% response rate Sustainability training delivered to head office and operational locations and made available to all our employees We raised £13,070 for our charity of the year, The Children's Hospital Trust, and two other community causes Over 500 EPCs either reviewed or renewed to ensure 100% risk free EPC strategy achieved We donated 1,207 hours to local community initiatives and charities Our portfolio waste diversion from landfill maintained at 100% Water consumption Like-for-Like (LfL) reduction of 6% 90% HSE Q Compliance site scores consistently above 90% +12% Year-on-Year GRESB score increase of 12% surpassing the peer average increase of 8% Our Utilities and Waste data within the 2017 CSR Report is now aligned to EPRA *sBPR core requirements 8% Scope 2 CO 2 e reduction Like-for-Like (LfL) Redefine International P.L.C. During 2017, the Company has made several achievements, the most notable being: • the Company’s participation in the GRESB Real Estate Assessment benefited from a continued increase in score, up 12 per cent on the prior year’s result; • a four per cent like‑ for‑ like (“LfL”) reduction in carbon (CO 2 e) emissions based on 39 of our properties; • a six per cent LfL reduction in water consumption across 24 of our properties; • utilities and waste data within our 2017 CSR Report is now aligned to EPRA *sBPR core requirements; • over 500 Energy Performance Certificates (“EPCs”) have been either reviewed or renewed to ensure our 100 per cent ‘risk free EPC strategy’ is achieved; • achieved outstanding Q compliance Health and Safety scores across our UK Shopping centres; and • inaugural GRESB Public Disclosure rating of ‘B’ for Redefine International against an industry average ‘C’ rating. Focused sustainability training was delivered to all employees based at the Group’s head office and across its operational locations. Data capture has been significantly improved and a new reporting format is now presented in line with industry accepted environmental performance indicators. In 2017, Redefine International celebrated its tenth anniversary since listing and to commemorate this milestone, the Company undertook a community project called “Ten for 10”. Significant progress was however made on the eight hotels under third party management, which given their relative size should make a material difference. A minimum EPC rating level of D will be sought for planned refurbishments and upgrade works to our portfolio assets.

Only two assets (in Germany) under our operational control are excluded from the disclosure, due to lack of reliable and accurate data. As our data management programme is continually evolving, we are not yet able to report the specific end use of procured energy and water. This comprises all buildings with a floor space of 500m 2 or greater which the public access frequently such as supermarkets. A snapshot into this world here shows some legislative risks and Redefine’s interpretation of responsible compliance activity. With each part of the Legislative Value Enhancement (“LVE”) process working actively with one another in equilibrium, Redefine International is sure to maintain its LVE process and broaden key areas of focus as and when required to maximise the opportunity presented by legislative compliance. We confirm that environmental data published in this report provides a true representation of the Company’s current performance. We target 100 per cent compliance with Energy Performance Certifications (“EPCs”) ensuring all ‘F’ and ‘G’ ratings have ongoing action plans in place. Paying it back: 2016 was Redefine International’s tenth anniversary so to celebrate we implemented a community project called ‘Ten for 10’. The policy was amended following a strategic review to ensure closer alignment between remuneration, strategy and shareholder returns. Disappointingly, these are broadly the same points as raised at last year’s external evaluation, although action has already been taken to address many of these points: Long term strategic decision making Long term decision making is to be addressed with strategy days planned for next year.

Mike Watters served as a Non-executive Director of International Hotel Properties Limited during the year for which he received £1,299.96. An increased time commitment and prominence given to CSR matters, has resulted in the Company’s improved GRESB rating.

The Group reassesses whether it controls a subsidiary when facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more elements of control. Amortisation of intangible assets is recognised in profit or loss on a straight‑line basis over their estimated useful life from the date that they are available for use. On a proportionate basis, and for segmental reporting purposes, the net Performance Fee of £1.6 million has been recognised in other income. The tables above present both segmental and market value investment property information prepared on a proportionately consoli dated basis. The Group considers that all of its investment property falls within ‘Level 3’, as defined by IFRS 13 (refer to Note 31).

Under the amended agreements, both loans will now run to December 2022 and carry fixed interest rates of 1.59 – 1.62 per cent. This resulted in a fair value adjustment of £14.3 million as the refinanced debt was considered to have been negotiated on off‑market terms. At 31 August 2016, 4C Investments was a non‑controlling shareholder of RHHL, with an 11.43 per cent equity interest (1,938 shares) in the issued share capital. The transaction was not considered a business combination, having regard to associated processes acquired, and has therefore been recognised as an asset acquisition. The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices or dealer price quotations. Reference was made to the Company’s LSE listing in developing share price volatility, dividend yield, risk‑free rate and index correlation assumptions. In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. The Group also makes a general provision of 25 per cent against all receivables 120 days or more past due that have not been specifically impaired. There is a risk that the Group will encounter difficulties in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
