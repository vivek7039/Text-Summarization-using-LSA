HOW WE WILL MAXIMISE VALUE CREATION Our strategy: drive core services develop new service lines Grow non-n Hs o ffer clinical audit Radiographer reporting Reinvestment 12 Medica Group Plc Annu Al RepoR t And Accounts 2017 IN FOCUS CLINICAL QUALITY Focused on delivering quality results THE BENEFITS Highly experienced clinical governance structure > strong leadership from Medical director and c linical Advisory Group consisting of five members, including past presidents of the British Institute of Radiology (BIR). All Medica radiologists are required to: > be on the GMc s pecialist Register for clinical Radiology > have a minimum of two years in an n Hs consultant post. t his is in line with the Royal c ollege of Radiologists guidance on ‘l earning from discrepancies’. I am also involved in writing annual reports for Medica radiologists to present at their n Hs appraisals. I sit on the clinical governance committee which meets fortnightly to review all serious discrepancies, root cause analyses and any concerns about performance of radiologists or radiographers. In the nHs it is unusual to have regular audit of a radiologist’s work and most discrepancies are raised on an informal, ad hoc basis, often through discrepancy review meetings. In terms of clinical governance, all radiologists are provided with a monthly summary of their discrepancy rates but there is also a bespoke appraisal system for those radiologists that work outside the nHs for whom Medica is their designated body. Radiology is becoming increasingly sub-specialised and individual trusts may have difficulty providing an expert opinion, particularly at short notice. u rgent cases can be turned around in less than 24 minutes, which is clearly of benefit to patients.

Accelerating expansion into related areas Medica has developed specialist reporting lines including virtual colonoscopy and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (dXA) o steoporosis scanning. Most recently we have developed a c ardiac reporting service, which has launched in the first quarter of 2018 and there are other specialist services currently under development. t here has been downward pressure on prices for some time as volumes increase and this is expected to continue. Internal clinical audit costs which can be significant are not included within the individual service line gross profit figures above. If the Group’s costs increase, its results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Retention policy is based on providing a comprehensive support structure to Medica radiologists from all parts of the business. t he Group’s revenue from n Hs t rusts is not subject to any minimum purchase commitment and any reduction in demand for the Group’s services could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. t he Group focuses on providing a high quality, value for money service and maintains close communication with clients through its account management team. t he Group focuses on providing a high quality, value for money service and maintains close communication with clients through its account management team.
