what we do t eleradiology is the electronic transmission of radiological patient images, including plain film x-rays (pf), computerised tomography (ct ) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scans, from one location to another, for the purposes of diagnostic interpretation and reporting. t he group saw growth across its main teleradiology offerings with revenue increasing by 18% on last year. t hrough this approach, medica can continue to lead the growth of teleradiology in the u k. medica’s key focus is to support n hs t rusts at a time when they are dealing with increased demands for reporting against a backdrop of limited in-house capacity. s ee more on page 26 s ee more on page 12 a strong foundation for sustainable profitable growth investment case 7 medica group plc annu

institute of radiology (bir). all medica radiologists are required to: > be on the gmc s pecialist register for clinical radiology > have a minimum of two years in an n hs consultant post. t his is in line with the royal c ollege of radiologists guidance on ‘l earning from discrepancies’. n ighthawk services are embracing national initiatives in the areas of acute stroke and major trauma management. i am also involved in writing annual reports for medica radiologists to present at their n hs appraisals. i sit on the clinical governance committee which meets fortnightly to review all serious discrepancies, root cause analyses and any concerns about performance of radiologists or radiographers. in the nhs it is unusual to have regular audit of a radiologist’s work and most discrepancies are raised on an informal, ad hoc basis, often through discrepancy review meetings. in terms of clinical governance, all radiologists are provided with a monthly summary of their discrepancy rates but there is also a bespoke appraisal system for those radiologists that work outside the nhs for whom medica is their designated body. radiology is becoming increasingly sub-specialised and individual trusts may have difficulty providing an expert opinion, particularly at short notice. u rgent cases can be turned around in less than 24 minutes, which is clearly of benefit to patients. urgent cases can be turned around in less than 24 minutes, which is clearly of benefit to patients. jo hn graham chief executive 17 medica group plc annu al repor t and accounts 2017 strategic report governance financial statements o verview introduction i am delighted to present my c hief executive’s review statement for medica’s first year as a public company. t he high quality of medica’s clinical governance process has given clients more confidence in outsourcing. strategy t he directors have to date focused on building a platform that can deliver a high quality teleradiology service to the group’s core customer base of n hs hospitals, centred on its n ighthawk and routine offerings. t here are also further opportunities in the independent sector and internationally that can expand medica’s core business. accelerating expansion into related areas medica has developed specialist reporting lines including virtual colonoscopy and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) o steoporosis scanning. most recently we have developed a c ardiac reporting service, which has launched in the first quarter of 2018 and there are other specialist services currently under development. t here has been downward pressure on prices for some time as volumes increase and this is expected to continue. t he c ompany looks to achieve a similar gross margin across each of its service lines. internal clinical audit costs which can be significant are not included within the individual service line gross profit figures above. if the group’s costs increase, its results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. retention policy is based on providing a comprehensive support structure to medica radiologists from all parts of the business. t he group’s revenue from n hs t rusts is not subject to any minimum purchase commitment and any reduction in demand for the group’s services could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. t he group focuses on providing a high quality, value for money service and maintains close communication with clients through its account management team. t he group focuses on providing a high quality, value for money service and maintains close communication with clients through its account management team. environment medica actively

other than in exceptional circumstances. for e xecutive directors, it is expected that not more than 75% of any annual bonus will be payable in cash and the balance will be made in the form of an award over medica’s shares granted under the deferred bonus plan (‘dbp’), which will then vest after a period not expected to be less than two years, broadly subject to continued employment. base salaries will be reviewed by the c ommittee annually, and benchmarked periodically against relevant competitor companies. t he executive directors’ salary is positioned to reflect each individual’s professional experience and level of responsibility in their role. t he committee considers that base salaries for executive directors remain significantly below market levels, and this will be factored into future salary increases. executive directors may also be provided certain other benefits to take account of individual circumstances such as, but not limited to, payment of tax, financial, and/or legal adviser fees, relocation expenses and housing allowance (including associated interest, penalties or fees plus, in certain circumstances or where the c ommittee consider it appropriate, any tax incurred on such benefits). psp awards granted in 2018 will be based on a combination of eps growth and absolute t otal s hareholder return. awards granted under the csop will normally have a vesting period of not less than three years. executive directors are entitled to participate in medica’s all-employee saye plan on identical terms as other eligible employees. t he c ommittee considers these measures align executive incentives to medica’s strategy and shareholder interests. share ownership guidelines t he c ommittee recognises the importance of aligning executive directors’ and shareholders’ interests through significant shareholdings in medica. t he executive directors will have five years in which to build up the required ordinary shareholding after commencing employment. t he bonus is paid wholly in cash (i.e. not subject to deferral) unless the c ommittee determines otherwise. t he c ommittee may also make an award in respect of a new appointment to ‘buy out’ incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, i.e. over and above the maximum limits on incentive opportunities set out in the policy table. t he dates
