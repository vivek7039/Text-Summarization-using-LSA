institute of radiology (bir). all medica radiologists are required to: > be on the gmc s pecialist register for clinical radiology > have a minimum of two years in an n hs consultant post. i sit on the clinical governance committee which meets fortnightly to review all serious discrepancies, root cause analyses and any concerns about performance of radiologists or radiographers. in the nhs it is unusual to have regular audit of a radiologist’s work and most discrepancies are raised on an informal, ad hoc basis, often through discrepancy review meetings. radiology is becoming increasingly sub-specialised and individual trusts may have difficulty providing an expert opinion, particularly at short notice. u rgent cases can be turned around in less than 24 minutes, which is clearly of benefit to patients. t here are also further opportunities in the independent sector and internationally that can expand medica’s core business. accelerating expansion into related areas medica has developed specialist reporting lines including virtual colonoscopy and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) o steoporosis scanning. most recently we have developed a c ardiac reporting service, which has launched in the first quarter of 2018 and there are other specialist services currently under development. t here has been downward pressure on prices for some time as volumes increase and
