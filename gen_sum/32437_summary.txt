Whilst it is recognized that the Group is subject to a number of risks greater than this list, we include those that are of most concern and relevance to the business at this point in time. INFORMATIONANDSUPPORT The Board is supplied with information in a form that enables it to discharge its responsibilities effectively. The Non-Executive Directors make themselves available to meet shareholders on an ad hoc basis as necessary, and consider the Annual General Meeting a good opportunity to canvas opinion and hold discussions with individual shareholders. Any system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risks inherent in a fast-moving industry, and can therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against the possibility of material misstatement or loss. The Board also operates a whistleblowing policy which provides for all employees to raise concerns to the Audit Committee, in strict confidence about any unethical behaviors, suspected fraud, misconduct or wrongdoing without fear of recrimination. There were no whistleblowing reports throughout financial year 2017, and to the date of this report.

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS EXCLUDING GOODWILL Other intangible assets excluding goodwill are measured initially at purchase cost or at fair value if acquired as part of a business combination, and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, on the following bases: Tradenames, patents and trademarks 3–10 years Software licenses 3 years Purchased technology 3–5 years Relationships with publishers and customers 3–12 years IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS EXCLUDING GOODWILL At each balance sheet date, the Group will review the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. 52 RhythmOne plc AnnualReport andAccounts FY2017 Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognized and measured as provisions. Loans and receivables are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. RESTRICTED CASH Where required, the Group keeps amounts on deposit with financial institutions as a condition of certain property leases and purchase card facility requirements. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (Revised 2008) are recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:   deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognized and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;   liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payment awards are measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment; and   assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard. 55 RhythmOne plc AnnualReport andAccounts FY2017 The Group operates a global Internet business and its commercial activity is not generated from distinguishable geographic origins.
