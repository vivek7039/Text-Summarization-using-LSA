individual directors to report and record any potential or actual conflicts which arise. all appointments are terminable, without compensation, on between three and six months’ notice by either party and are subject to other early termination provisions without compensation, for example in the event a director is not re-elected at the annual general meeting. this year we are delighted to have recruited richard moross in the position of independent non-executive director. richard brings with him specialist skills in digital retailing which i believe will be invaluable to the board. the

performance against stretching group profit measures. targets are set by the remuneration committee prior to each grant and will be based on a sliding scale. 6 the company also operates share ownership guidelines requiring executive directors to acquire and hold a specified level of shareholding. as a result, our employment policies, remuneration and benefit packages for employees are regularly reviewed. details of any payments to former directors will be set out in the annual report on remuneration. in addition, executive directors are expected to mitigate their loss or, within existing contractual constraints, accept phased payments. furthermore, there are no special provisions providing for additional compensation on an executive director’s cessation of employment with the company. other than in certain ‘good leaver’ circumstances (including, but not limited to, redundancy, ill-health or retirement or on a change of control), no bonus would be payable unless the individual remains employed and is not under notice at the payment date. such awards would normally be made shortly following an appointment (assuming the company is not in a close period). fees for a new chairman or non-executive director will be set in line with the approved policy. the chairs of committee and senior independent director receive additional fees to reflect their extra responsibilities. they include five measures that focus on various aspects of the business and are assessed objectively against measurable results. % change from 2015/16 to 2016/17 salary benefits

requirements of ifrs 3 are amortised over their useful economic lives, which have been assessed as being five years. legally protected or otherwise separable trade names acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair value on acquisition. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. for such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity. in order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the group may enter into forward contracts and options (see below for details of the group’s accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments). exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the group’s translation reserve. profits and losses on financial instruments are recognised in the income statement as they arise. in accordance with its treasury policy, the group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. for share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes. net-interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. rebates are calculated annually based on agreements in place, which stipulate an agreed percentage of purchase be grated as a rebate. the group’s forecasts and projections, after sensitivity to take account of all reasonably foreseeable changes in trading performance, show that the group will have sufficient headroom within its current loan facilities of £405m – which are committed until august 2020 – and its £20m revolving credit facility. at this stage it is not possible to determine how the matter will be resolved. however within our year end vat debtor is an asset of £36.0m (2016: £21.7m) which has arisen as a result of
