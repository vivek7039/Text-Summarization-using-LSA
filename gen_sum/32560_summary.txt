Looking forward, we are on track to complete the final stages of our systems programme by Summer 2018, which will enable even faster growth. We extended the collection further for Spring Summer, and adopted a similarly assertive entry price strategy across our other brands. This allows brands access to a new, growing customer base at relatively low risk, and gives our customers an even greater choice of products. Received our highest ever customer satisfaction score and are now ranked number two across the UK retail sector. With people also becoming larger, as evidenced by rising obesity levels, our size and age inclusive approach are important differentiators which benefit from these population trends. Against this backdrop we work hard to grow loyalty and offer our customers a great choice of products.

By ensuring that our initial price points were compelling, we reduced the proportion of lines sold on discount significantly. We continued to increase our use of data analytics to make pricing and promotional decisions, for example we have implemented price elasticity algorithmic modelling for our end of season sales and will be rolling this out further in the coming year. We sent 19 million animated emails, 22% more than the year before, and these drove a 48% increase in email demand. We will focus on further growing market share through continued improvements to our products, everyday great value and efficient promotions. We will focus on further growing market share through continued improvements to our products, everyday great value and efficient promotions. Some customers are unlikely to ever migrate online; we estimate that these account for roughly half of the non-online proportion. This trend was even stronger for JD Williams, where smartphone sessions more than doubled compared to last year.

In September we launched ‘The New F Word’, a short film featuring nine inspirational women, all of whom have proved that 50 is an age to be celebrated. In February we staged a protest at London Fashion Week, together with five models all over the age of 45. We received almost 500 entrants and our shortlist of 20 men as judged by a panel including brand ambassador Freddie Flintoff. 1.3% Product revenue decrease to £134.2m Launch of new bespoke publications for customers Reinvested back into key product categories, such as jersey, knitwear and nightwear Improved cross-working across traditional titles, driving efficiencies and maximising profitability Our Traditional Segment recorded revenue of £134.2m, down 1.3% year on year. We also improved the product range, in particular reinvesting back into our jersey, knitwear and nightwear offerings. We saw particular success with our new Figleaves Curve range sold through both Simply Be and JD Williams. After funding capital expenditure, finance costs, taxation and dividends, net debt was broadly flat at £290.9m (FY16: £289.7m), in line with our expectations. By working together, we hope to create more responsible and sustainable products that our customers can enjoy with confidence. The Operating Board took part in a number of activities with its patrons, including decorating gingerbread men, games and bingo! For all suppliers there is an on boarding due diligence process and ongoing reviews to ensure factory compliance standards. In accordance with the GHG Protocol, we are now able to report our REGO backed electricity as zero carbon.

We almost achieved our relative emissions target and despite significant business growth, there has still been a reduction. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED 54 N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 • Gas oil: Fuel is used in stand by generators and onsite transport (forklifts etc). Data for onsite transport is calculated using actual fuel usage from invoices and internal records of gas oil deliveries. Where service records were not available for a very small number of shops, refrigeration losses have been estimated using DECC leakage tables. In addition, disclosures required by the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (rule 7 .2.6) regarding share capital can be found on page 61. Andrew spent over 20 years in executive retail roles, including positions with Laura Ashley Holdings, The Burton Group and Tesco. No person has any special rights over the Group’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. These Committees meet regularly and have formal written terms of reference which are available for inspection on the Company’s website. Procedures are in place at every meeting for individual Directors to report and record any potential or actual conflicts which arise. All appointments are terminable, without compensation, on between three and six months’ notice by either party and are subject to other early termination provisions without compensation, for example in the event a Director is not re-elected at the annual general meeting. Richard brings with him specialist skills in digital retailing which I believe will be invaluable to the Board. The Charter is designed to align with and implement our three CSR pillars of ‘All People, One Planet, Every Product’. A significant majority of the annual bonus will normally be determined by reference to performance against stretching Group profit measures. Targets are set by the Remuneration Committee prior to each grant and will be based on a sliding scale. 6 The Company also operates share ownership guidelines requiring Executive Directors to acquire and hold a specified level of shareholding. In addition, Executive Directors are expected to mitigate their loss or, within existing contractual constraints, accept phased payments. Furthermore, there are no special provisions providing for additional compensation on an Executive Director’s cessation of employment with the Company. Such awards would normally be made shortly following an appointment (assuming the Company is not in a close period). They include five measures that focus on various aspects of the business and are assessed objectively against measurable results. Assessing recoverability of these assets is based on forecasting and discounting future cash flows, which are themselves inherently highly judgemental. Given the level of judgements and estimates involved this is considered to be a key audit risk.

Legally protected or otherwise separable trade names acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair value on acquisition. For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Rebates are calculated annually based on agreements in place, which stipulate an agreed percentage of purchase be grated as a rebate. The Group’s forecasts and projections, after sensitivity to take account of all reasonably foreseeable changes in trading performance, show that the Group will have sufficient headroom within its current loan facilities of £405m – which are committed until August 2020 – and its £20m revolving credit facility. However within our year end VAT debtor is an asset of £36.0m (2016: £21.7m) which has arisen as a result of cash payments made under protective assessments raised by HMRC and the Group estimates that a further £10m could be paid under this assessment in the forthcoming year. A sensitivity analysis has been performed on each of these key assumptions with other variables held constant. A sensitivity analysis has been performed on each of these key assumptions with other variables held constant. The Group considers 56 days past due to be objective evidence of impairment for all accounts, not on renegotiated terms. Customer debtor balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for estimated irrecoverable amounts as detailed in note 17 . The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within agreed credit terms.
