Dividends Full year dividend cover has been maintained at more than two times headline earnings per share. It has been a challenging year as we have reviewed our operations and introduced new ways of working in many areas to position the Group for future success. With its three year TAG programme well underway, ITE is entering a period in the transformation that requires dynamic change. Complete a comprehensive review of the business in order to develop our future strategy and vision; 2. For example, we have introduced weekly trading meetings, weekly review of sales, monthly regional boards, event level strategy pre and post show, and new global communication channels to showcase event successes globally, helping staff to feel part of ‘One ITE’. Good quality events have become places to learn, network, discuss and debate; they act as an industry platform, bringing a business community together under one roof. Training, monitoring, managing performance and breeding a culture of success by rewarding achievement is the basis for strong sustainable organic growth. Priorities for 2018 The Group has achieved much in a short space of time since we announced our evolved strategy and TAG programme. In the year ahead, our main focus within TAG will be on lead generation, content and customer service. A fast pace has been set in the last year which we look forward to continuing into 2018 and beyond. On a like-for-like basis headline profit before tax has grown by 2%, reversing the trend reported in recent years. The significant increase is largely as a result of the onsite rebooking initiative, which has brought our cash inflows forward, and also from an increase in forward bookings for next year’s events attributable to an upturn in trading, particularly across our Core events. A detailed analysis of volumes and revenues is presented below: Square metres sold (000) Revenue £m Average yield £ per m 2 2016 All events 685 134.4 196 Biennial (41) (4.6) Timing (12) (4.5) Non-recurring (34) (4.9) Disposals – (0.5) 2016 Annually recurring 598 119.9 201 Acquisitions 49 6.0 Launches 18 3.2 FX translation – 11.6 TAG costs – – Like-for-like growth (2) 6.7 2017 Annually recurring 663 147.4 222 Timing 3 0.8 Biennial 14 4.4 2017 All events 680 152.6 224 Segmental results Revenue Headline profit before tax £m 2017 2016 2017 2016 Russia 71.4 51.6 26.3 19.8 Asia 23.8 17.1 6.9 5.5 Central Asia 21.7 22.0 6.5 7.0 Eastern & Southern Europe 17.0 19.3 4.8 5.6 Brands 18.7 24.4 5.4 11.0 Other income – – 0.7 0.6 Central costs – – (16.2) (11.9) Foreign exchange gain – – 0.3 2.0 Net finance costs – – (3.1) (3.1) Total 152.6 134.4 31.6 36.5 Refer to the ‘Divisional trading summary’ section for commentary on each operating segment. These include the Group’s corporate overheads and other central costs that are included within cost of sales. Revaluation of liabilities on completed acquisitions A number of the Group’s acquisitions completed in recent years have future earn- out commitments, either through deferred or contingent consideration payments or through equity option liabilities to increase our current shareholdings. Cash balances increased to £23.3m (2016: £15.5m) as a result of earlier cash collection following the onsite rebooking initiative, reduced expenditure on acquisitions compared to previous years and the strengthening of foreign currencies against Sterling which create unrealised gains when translated into Sterling on consolidation. A new loan facility agreement was entered into subsequent to the year end as mentioned previously. During 2017, £2.8m of costs were included within our statutory and headline results in relation to the TAG programme. WorldFood Moscow in September also grew volumes by 5% to 21,300m 2 (2016: 20,200m 2 ), as both domestic exhibitors and international suppliers increased their space requirements. The exhibitions market is supported by a strong business model that provides: High margins Excellent cash flow characteristics Resilient revenues Good growth prospects Global exhibition market value US$30bn Geographically, the industry is split between large mature markets and rapidly growing emerging markets. Andrew headed up the UK Publishing sector knowledge network and managed a portfolio of large media clients. Due consideration is given to risks arising from social, ethical and environmental issues as part of an ongoing risk review process. Results from similar offices have been extrapolated based on the number of employees to estimate total emissions. In Azerbaijan, the local office continued its close ties with Anglo-Azerbaijani Society by sponsoring a charity concert and dinner in aid of United Aid for Azerbaijan (UAFA), raising vital funds to maintain their work with children from the Saray and Shagan children’s homes. It is the Group’s aim to develop a global giving initiative linking charitable efforts across all offices in 2018. Board papers are delivered through an electronic platform, improving the efficiency of its communications and reducing paper usage. No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all shares are fully paid. A significant deterioration in trading from the major markets (notably Russia and Turkey) could impact on certain banking covenants. The Chief Financial Officer is invited to attend meetings, unless he has a conflict of interest. The Committee will, nevertheless, review on an annual basis whether a tender process should be conducted sooner. Economic weakness in certain Central Asian countries and Turkey has continued during 2017, reducing demand for exhibition space year-on-year. Subsequent to the year end, we have refinanced our debt facility, on improved terms, with greater headroom and more appropriate covenants. We carry business interruption insurance policies which protect profits on our largest fully-owned events against such an event in the short term. Competitor risk Competition has existed in ITE’s markets for some years and we face competitive pressures on a market-by-market basis. We have sought to build loyalty in our staff by ensuring remuneration is competitive and through a wide distribution of the Group’s long-term incentive plans. There will be no vesting as the challenging range of headline diluted EPS targets were not met. Overall, the Committee is comfortable that there has been a robust relationship between performance and reward. Bonus will be predominantly based on a challenging range of financial targets set in line with the Group’s KPIs (for example, revenue growth, cash conversion and profit). All Non-executive Directors are reimbursed for travel and related business expenses reasonably incurred in performing their duties. The range of metrics chosen provides a keen balance between incentivising operational success and delivering growth. Profit will be measured on a reported basis (i.e. using actual exchange rates) with revenue growth and cash conversion measured using budgeted exchange rates to provide a balance between shareholder alignment and incentivising management to deliver against internal plans (noting the international nature of ITE’s operations). Service contracts and exit payments policy In line with UK Corporate Governance Code Provision B.7.1, all Directors are subject to re-election annually at the Company’s AGM. Annual bonus awards may be subject to recovery and withholding provisions in line with the Company’s Remuneration Policy. 4 There was no vesting of long-term incentive awards in relation to performance periods concluding 30 September 2017 or 2016. 5 This is a pro-rated amount of Mark Shashoua’s annual salary as he was appointed to the Board on 1 September 2016. 6 This is a pro-rated amount of Andrew Beach’s annual salary as he was appointed to the Board on 17 October 2016.

The Group will also operate within a dilution limit of 5% in any rolling ten-year period for discretionary schemes. The metrics to apply include a challenging range of profit (50%), revenue growth (20%), cash conversion (15%) and individually tailored strategic targets (15%). In particular, we reviewed documentation prepared by management to support the Group’s global allocation of profits for transfer pricing purposes. Further based on our experience assessed of challenges typically raised by tax authorities we considered how they might apply to the Group. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether its financial assets are to be impaired. Derivative assets are classified as at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL), unless designated in hedged relationships. Fair values The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between informed and willing parties and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity. Consequently, any gain or loss on disposal will exclude translation differences that arose prior to 1 October 2004. The Group holds tax provisions in respect of potential challenge to historical arrangements, on which there are no current ongoing investigations.

This allowance is determined by reference to the specific circumstances of each show and past experience. The Group manages liquidity risk by ensuring continuity of funding for operational needs through cash deposits and debt facilities as appropriate. Neither is deferred tax recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold. Gains and losses arising on retranslation of monetary assets are included in profit or loss for the period. 8 Trade and other creditors 5 Fixed assets continued Notes to the Company Accounts continued For the year ended 30 September 2017 Financial statements Governance Strategic report 132 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 133 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Shareholder Information Shareholder profile as at 30 September 2017 Financial calendar Pre close announcement 2 October 2017 Preliminary results announcement 28 November 2017 Annual General Meeting 25 January 2018 Q1 IMS 25 January 2018 Interim results announcement 8 May 2018 Q3 IMS 10 July 2018 Range of holdings Number of shareholders Percentage of total shareholders Ordinary shares Percentage of issued share capital 1–100 215 19.44 5,822 0.00 101–1,000 276 24.95 141,836 0.05 1,001–10,000 372 33.63 1,139,609 0.42 10,001–100,000 125 11.30 4,335,988 1.61 100,001–1,000,000 75 6.78 24,994,177 9.28 1,000,001–highest 43 3.90 238,662,842 88.64 1,106 100.00 269,280,274 100.00 Category Number of shareholders Percentage of total shareholders Ordinary shares Percentage of issued share capital Private individuals 756 68.35 3,413,770 1.27 Nominee companies 264 23.87 244,273,293 90.71 Limited and Public Limited Companies 56 5.06 19,202,492 7.13 Other organisations and banks 30 2.72 2,390,719 0.89 1,106 100.00 269,280,274 100.00 Share price London Stock Exchange, pence per 1 pence shares Highest 187.25p Lowest 133.00p Dividend calendar Final dividend 2017 Ex-dividend date 4 January 2018 Record date 5 January 2018 Payment date 5 February 2018 Interim dividend 2018 Ex-dividend date 21 June 2018 Record date 22 June 2018 Payment date 2 August 2018 Dividend mandates Shareholders who wish dividends to be paid directly into a bank or building society account should contact the Registrar for a dividend mandate form.
