underway, ite is entering a period in the transformation that requires dynamic change. good quality events have become places to learn, network, discuss and debate; they act as an industry platform,

growth. priorities for 2018 the group has achieved much in a short space of time since we announced our evolved strategy and tag programme. a fast pace has been set in the last year which we look forward to continuing into 2018 and beyond. the significant increase is largely as a result of the onsite rebooking initiative, which has brought our cash inflows forward, and also from an increase in forward bookings for next year’s events attributable to an upturn in trading, particularly across our core events. a detailed analysis of volumes and revenues is presented below: square metres sold
