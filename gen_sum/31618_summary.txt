working in many areas to position the group for future success. with its three year tag programme well underway, ite is entering a period in the transformation that requires dynamic change. the outputs of this review, unveiled in may 2017 resulted in an headline profit before tax £31.6m mark shashoua chief executive officer tag one-off investment £20.0m evolved strategy and the introduction of a three year tag programme. for example, we have introduced weekly trading meetings, weekly review of sales, monthly regional boards, event level strategy pre and post show, and new global communication channels to showcase event successes globally, helping staff to feel part of ‘one ite’. good quality events have become places to learn, network, discuss and debate; they act as an industry platform, bringing a business community together under one roof. in order to focus on retention you need detailed customer insight and data analysis. training, monitoring, managing performance and breeding a culture of success by rewarding achievement is the basis for strong sustainable organic growth. priorities for 2018 the group has achieved much in a short space of time since we announced our evolved strategy and tag programme. in the year ahead, our main focus within tag will be on lead generation, content and customer service. a fast pace has been set in the last year which we look forward to continuing into 2018 and beyond. as a group we are focussed on improving the quality of the events we operate and are pursuing a product-led strategy, focussed on market-leading events, irrespective of geographic location or industry segment. our events act as an industry platform, bringing a business community together under one roof. on a like-for-like basis headline profit before tax has grown by 2%, reversing the trend reported in recent years. the significant increase is largely as a result of the onsite rebooking initiative, which has brought our cash inflows forward, and also from an increase in forward bookings for next year’s events attributable to an upturn in trading, particularly across our core events. a detailed analysis of volumes and

deferred or contingent consideration payments or through equity option liabilities to increase our current shareholdings. cash balances increased to £23.3m (2016: £15.5m) as a result of earlier cash collection following the onsite rebooking initiative, reduced expenditure on acquisitions compared to previous years and the strengthening of foreign currencies against sterling which create unrealised gains when translated into sterling on consolidation. a new loan facility agreement was entered into subsequent to the year end as mentioned previously. having invested £5.0m since may, we anticipate investing up to £10m over the coming financial year. during 2017, £2.8m of costs were included within our statutory and headline results in relation to the tag programme. andrew beach chief

the efficiency of its communications and reducing paper usage. a responsibility statement for each of those roles has been agreed and adopted by the board. in addition, the group’s website containing published information and press releases can be found at www.ite-exhibitions.com. the company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. no person has any special rights of control over the company’s share capital and all shares are fully paid. a significant deterioration in trading from the major markets (notably russia and turkey) could impact on certain banking covenants. however, the refinancing referred to on page 20 increases headroom and significantly reduces this risk. there are also a range of mitigating actions available and within the group’s control. however, the directors have a range of mitigating actions available and within their control. the chief financial officer is invited to attend meetings, unless he has a conflict of interest. a detailed audit plan is received from deloitte, which sets out the key risks identified. economic weakness in certain central asian countries and turkey has continued during 2017, reducing demand for exhibition space year-on-year. subsequent to the year end, we have refinanced our debt facility, on improved terms, with greater headroom and more appropriate covenants. risk potential impact mitigation change in probability and/or impact of risk vs prior year commercial relationships the group has key commercial relationships with venues which secure our rights to run our exhibitions in the future. we carry business interruption insurance policies which protect profits on our largest fully-owned events against such an event in the short term. competitor risk competition has existed in ite’s markets for some years and we face competitive pressures on a market-by-market basis. we have sought to build loyalty in our staff by ensuring remuneration is competitive and through a wide distribution of the group’s long-term incentive plans. however, the inclusion of deferral of annual bonus to operate with share ownership guidelines and a holding period on vested shares ensures that any short-term success retains a clear link to our long-term performance. overall, the committee is comfortable that there has been a robust relationship between performance and reward. deferred shares typically vest after three years and are normally subject to continued employment. bonus will be predominantly based on a challenging range of financial targets set in line with the group’s kpis (for example, revenue growth, cash conversion and profit). any use of such discretion would be detailed in the annual report on remuneration. the maximum award limit under the psp is capped at 150% of salary other than in exceptional circumstances (e.g. recruitment ‘buy-out’ to compensate for value forfeit from a previous employer) when awards may be granted up to 200% of salary. granted subject to challenging financial (e.g. eps) and total shareholder return performance targets tested over three years. all non-executive directors are reimbursed for travel and related business expenses reasonably incurred in performing their duties. the range of metrics chosen provides a keen balance between incentivising operational success and delivering growth. profit will be measured on a reported basis (i.e. using actual exchange rates) with revenue growth and cash conversion measured using budgeted exchange rates to provide a balance between shareholder alignment and incentivising management to deliver against internal plans (noting the international nature of ite’s operations). performance share plan (psp) psp awards are granted 70% based on adjusted eps and 30% on relative total shareholder return (tsr) versus a combination of the ftse small cap and ftse 250 index constituents (excluding investment trusts). in connection with recruitment, the committee may consider it appropriate to grant an award under a structure not included in the policy detailed above to ‘buy out’ incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer. service contracts and exit payments policy in line with uk corporate governance code provision b.7.1, all directors are subject to re-election annually at the company’s agm. annual bonus awards may be subject to recovery and withholding provisions in line with the company’s remuneration policy. 4 there was no vesting of long-term incentive awards in relation to performance periods concluding 30 september 2017 or 2016. 5

(50%), revenue growth (20%), cash conversion (15%) and individually tailored strategic targets (15%). with regards to individually tailored strategic targets, which include, for example, measurable objectives set against the development and execution of the company’s strategy, leadership, funding and stakeholder communication objectives, full details of the complete range of targets set and performance against them will be included in next year’s annual report on remuneration. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. in particular, we reviewed documentation prepared by management to support the group’s global allocation of profits for transfer pricing purposes. our audit procedures also included re-performing provision calculations based on different assumptions to measure the potential risk relating to tax authority challenge including the availability of unrecognised tax attributes in respect of any such challenges. further based on our experience assessed of challenges typically raised by tax authorities we considered

allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. at each balance sheet date, the group assesses whether its financial assets are to be impaired. derivative assets are classified as at fair value through profit or loss (fvtpl), unless designated in hedged relationships. where considered significant, the group’s written equity options are discounted to their appropriate value. fair values the fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between informed and willing parties and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value. income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. for such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity. exchange differences arising are classified as equity and transferred to the group’s translation reserve. the most significant area of estimation uncertainty relates to forecast cash flows at

and accounts 2017 financial statements interest rate swap contracts with effect from 30 april 2016, the group entered into two interest rate swap agreements to exchange the floating rate of interest paid on its bank borrowings for fixed rates on the first £40.0m of the group’s gbp debt, calculated on agreed notional principal amounts of £20.0m each. any overdue amounts, after the stage of payment due date, are reviewed and chased. it therefore includes receivables for events taking place in 2018. customers are typically due to settle the full contractual amount at least 30 days before an event. the group establishes an allowance for doubtful debts that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade receivables when there is objective evidence that the debt will not be collected in full. this allowance is determined by reference to the specific circumstances of each show and past experience. the group manages liquidity risk by ensuring continuity of funding for operational needs through cash deposits and debt facilities as appropriate. the company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. awards can be made to an employee over shares up to a maximum of 100% of base salary, or 150% for the chief executive officer and 120% for the chief financial officer, each year based on market value. neither is deferred tax recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold. gains and losses arising on retranslation of monetary assets are included in profit or loss for the period. guangzhou, china ordinary shares 70 ite ebseek exhibitions co ltd 13/f connaught harbourfront house, nos 35- 36,
