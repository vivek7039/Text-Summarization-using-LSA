colleague, colleagues will receive an increase in their pay of 25p per hour. colleagues embarking on a career in grooming now have the opportunity to follow our apprenticeship training. from the initial cohort of 12 apprentices we have offered ten permanent roles as stylists in our groom room salons. in fy2017 our learning academy delivered training to 547 colleagues and we will further expand this facility each year. these are free to attend and parents can book their children onto one of the workshops using our online booking platform. we recognise the contribution of our

believes in having a consistent approach to remuneration rather than designing alternative plans for our executive directors. all our reward arrangements are built around the common objectives and principles outlined below: • aligned incentives – a meaningful proportion of remuneration is based on performance. this includes an assessment of the awards which would be forfeited on leaving their current employer. on principle, it is the committee’s policy that there should be no element of reward for failure. a) within the first 24 months following admission • where an individual with a six month notice period voluntarily resigns less than 18 months following the date of admission, they will forfeit their invested shares and their matching awards. this period ended on 17 march 2016. b) between 24 months and 36 months following admission • where an individual with a six month notice period voluntarily resigns between 18 months and 30 months following the date of admission (and completes at least two years’ service by working his notice period or being put on garden leave, or would have done so but is given pilon), they will retain their invested shares and may retain a portion of their matching award subject to achievement of performance targets measured over the first two years of the performance period. this period ended on 17 march 2017. c) on or after 36 months following admission • where an individual with a six month notice period voluntarily resigns on or after 30 months following the date of admission (and completes at least three years’ service by working his notice period or being put on garden leave, or would have done so but is given pilon), they will retain their invested shares and, if a good leaver (defined as under the psp) also their vested matching award, unless the committee determines otherwise. any participant who is dismissed for reasons of fraud or negligence will forfeit their invested shares and matching awards in full. as such, the committee has regard to this group-wide annual review process when setting its remuneration policy for executive directors. (g) minor amendments the committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment. 3 mike iddon did not receive a co-investment plan award in 2014 as this was prior to his joining the company. as nicolas is
