Within our stores, well-trained colleagues provide detailed advice on areas such as pet nutrition and the set-up of home aquaria. In four simple steps, customers can check how much they could save by switching to our Wainwright’s and AVA private label foods. Vet services again delivered strong growth driven by our strategy of providing a quality service to clients across both first opinion and specialist referral centres. He has a wealth of experience in the retail sector having previously held senior finance positions at Tesco plc. As a consequence of Mike’s appointment, Mark Adams, who had been an excellent Interim Chief Financial Officer, left the Group in November 2016. Peter Pritchard, CEO of our Retail Division, will assume responsibility for Grooming, while pet insurance services transfers to Mike Iddon, CFO. The strong sales of dog accessories this year are continuing proof that our range innovation drives a positive customer response. We have also seen an increase in new shoppers, alongside the switching of existing customers from branded foods into our own labels. We now have over 100 mature practices that are on average delivering income to the Group of more than £160,000 per year. Priorities for 2018 Our aim is to expand further in the specialist referrals space, through organic development and bolt-on acquisitions. Priorities for 2018 Looking forward, we will continue to see support to our Group gross margin from Advanced Nutrition growth and services maturity, but this will be more than offset in the current financial year by the impact of a weaker sterling and our price investment activity. Growth in our Joint Venture (JV) veterinary practices was strong, generating total income of £47.1m (FY16: £37.8m ◊ ), up 24.6% ◊ compared with the prior year. Dick White Referrals (DWR), based in Cambridgeshire, is one of the UK’s largest small animal specialist referral centres. We believe this maintains appropriate flexibility for our business, operating in a resilient market with strong cash generation capabilities. Mike Iddon Group Chief Financial Officer 25 May 2017 33 Pets at Home Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Performance Revenue split Growth Food £395.1m +3.3% ◊ Accessories £321.6m +2.4% ◊ Revenue split (%) Operating review Merchandise Our merchandise segment comprises food and accessories for a wide range of popular pets. This model affords individual vets the opportunity to partner with us and create their own practice operating under our brand. Operating Board Has line responsibility for managing risks within their areas • Members review risk registers periodically with Internal Audit (three times per year). There has been some increase in the number of pure play online competitors but this is not expected to have a significant impact on our business. Outlook An increased proportion of our new stores will be located on newly developed retail parks and park extensions. Without adequate cash resources, the Group may be unable to deliver its growth plans, with a consequent impact on future financial performance. Mitigation This exposure to FX fluctuation is managed via forward foreign currency contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges. We have amalgamated the two existing compulsory steps into a single new training programme after which colleagues will ‘Step Up’ to Pet Colleague. Colleagues who stretch themselves further and develop an in-depth knowledge of pets can ‘Step Up’ to Pet Specialist once they have completed five years’ service. From the initial cohort of 12 apprentices we have offered ten permanent roles as stylists in our Groom Room salons. These are free to attend and parents can book their children onto one of the workshops using our online booking platform. We recognise the contribution of our colleagues in delivering these community-based initiatives and reward their achievement through an internal programme ‘My Pond League’. Many of our vet practices are already embedded within their local community, having strong links to animal charities and rehoming centres in the area. A dedicated field team is responsible for ensuring we implement the best possible standards consistently across all our stores and breeders. A confidential hotline is in place for colleagues to raise any concerns they may have directly with our Head of Pets. These regular ethical audits probe in detail the standards we require in relation to: • Hours of work • Wages • L a bo u r p r ac t i c e s • Working conditions • Onsite accommodation • Homeworkers and sub-contractors • Health & safety • Environmental compliance • Supply chain management We also work with our European suppliers to establish what audit information they hold for their factories, ensuring that our standards are being maintained.

Paul has been a Director of Pets at Home since 2014 and will be succeeded by Stanislas Laurent who was appointed on 25 May 2017. 3 Nick Wood resigned as an Executive Director with effect from 4 April 2016 and no meetings were held prior to this date. Procedures are in place at every meeting for individual Directors to report and record any potential or actual conflicts which arise. By knowing about any wrong doing or malpractice at an early stage, we stand a good chance of taking the necessary steps to stop it.

Pets at Home Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 88 Reflecting these priorities I am delighted with the progress that has been made in the past year: • We have delivered a major investment programme to upgrade store lighting to LED and install Building Energy Management technology across our store estate. We consulted in particular with shareholders on the performance underpin below which it would not be appropriate for awards to pay out. Q4 LFLs: Group 1.2%, Merchandise 0.5% & Services 7.1% when adjusted for the impact of Easter; • New openings in line with targets: 15 superstores, 50 vet practices and 50 grooming salons. The stretching free cash flow targets were not met and so no portion of this bonus will be paid. Shareholders • To deliver better value to shareholders for their reward spend by: – Improving perceived value; – Creating stronger alignment with shareholders; and – Increasing focus on long term sustainable value creation In summary, the objectives of our new Directors remuneration policy are: Remuneration principles Pets at Home Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 92 Not changing No changes to policy in respect of: • Salary • Annual bonus • Benefits • Pension contributions for current incumbents in FY18 • Recruitment or leaver provisions Proposed changes • Replace performance shares with a time-vested restricted stock plan • Reduce overall maximum package opportunity from 250% salary to 175% salary Expected value Expected value Awards made Policy max Policy max Overall incentive opportunity (% of base salary) LTI/RSP (as % of base salary) Bonus 50% 50% 100% 100% 100% 75% 75% 125% 150% 75% 125% 125% 225% 250% 175% Current Proposal Timing of vesting Increase vesting horizon to five years Award Illustrative vesting schedule 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Restricted stock (75%) 50% Vest 25% Vest 25% Vest Baseline underpin An absolute TSR baseline performance underpin would apply during the first three financial years below which no vesting of restricted stock awards would occur. It also aligns with a much wider programme of simplification across the Group as a whole, from how we operate our supply chain and stores, right through to our Support Offices and has the benefit of being based on intrinsic as opposed to extraneous performance factors. The Company believes in having a consistent approach to remuneration rather than designing alternative plans for our Executive Directors. All our reward arrangements are built around the common objectives and principles outlined below: • Aligned incentives – A meaningful proportion of remuneration is based on performance. Any participant who is dismissed for reasons of fraud or negligence will forfeit their Invested Shares and Matching Awards in full. As such, the Committee has regard to this Group-wide annual review process when setting its remuneration policy for Executive Directors. 3 Mike Iddon did not receive a Co-Investment Plan Award in 2014 as this was prior to his joining the Company. 4 Nick resigned as a Director on 4 April 2016, however, he remained with the Group in an advisory role until 1 July 2016. As Nicolas is representing KKR, it has been agreed that he will not receive any Directors’ fees in respect of his appointment. For the remaining component, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these components.
