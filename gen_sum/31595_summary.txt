business model focused on the customer journey our business model reflects the customer journey from dream to experience. this approach means we can focus on creating maximum value in the holidays to our directly-contracted own-brand and selected partner hotels. this has already been signed by seven major travel companies in a move that we believe will promote greater collaboration to achieve practical change for the benefit of all customers. over the last four years, and in a very competitive market, we’ve transformed it from four essentially separate airlines whose primary task was to transport our tour operator customers, to one airline group with an increasingly successful seat- only business, particularly on long-haul routes, and its own distribution channels. we have now formalised the work management has undertaken to create one group airline, by separating its reporting and legal structure. this approach is complemented by a series of partnerships which enable us to streamline our operations, while also tapping into opportunities for growth. new innovations for summer 2018 include the ability to pre-book a specific hotel room based on detailed floor plans and imagery. this includes developing rich, inspirational content that stands out in a crowded online marketplace and will grab customers’ attention to drive higher conversion. this focus on improved customer contact has increased direct distribution across the group by one percentage point to 68 per cent. second, we took the decision to refocus our store network into two key formats to make sure we’re offering our customers the best of a 21st century travel company; larger stores in higher footfall areas like shopping centres and retail parks, and smaller stores in traditional high street locations. we have a further 20 hotels in the pipeline to open between winter 2017 and summer 2019. this includes at least another two casa cooks. the rooms themselves were all created as private sanctuaries, focusing on stylish simplicity, many with their own or shared pools. next year we open our third casa cook in chania, crete – a pure family concept that is very different to what people might expect. this, together with our expanded route capacity, has meant we have grown seat-only sales by 16 per cent versus 2016. we are now benefiting from our new, group-wide commercial it system, which for the first time enables us to sell all ancillaries through industry global distribution systems and to take code-share bookings from third-party airline partners with the aim of driving significant revenue growth. both thomas cook and fosun remain fully committed to supporting the future growth of our joint venture business in china. the ambition is to make china a sizeable source market for thomas cook group, comparable, over time, with our more mature markets in europe. it is also the group’s most popular holiday destination, meaning we had a sizeable existing presence and infrastructure on which to build. underlying eps (iii) is defined as earnings before separately disclosed items after a national tax charge divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares. from that premise came a simple rule – if an animal attraction is found not to be fully compliant with the abta global welfare guidance for animals in tourism, thomas cook won’t sell it. seven key projects were selected, including a continued drive to reduce weight on board, improve flight planning processes and optimise routing. a key challenge is finding good-quality staff who are able to deliver high-quality service while promoting sustainability within our hotels. the new values and behaviours were introduced as criteria for our customer heroes recognition programme, which we continued this year. nominated by colleagues or managers, we identify customer heroes in each market and hold local recognition events to celebrate the finalists. building an efficient organisational structure is a key strategic objective and we are working across the group to better align structures. overview the comments below are based on underlying like-for-like comparisons unless otherwise stated, as management believes this provides a clearer view of group’s year-on-year progression. performance by geographical market as the group’s tour operator and airline activities are integrated to varying degrees in each of our source markets, we believe that it is helpful to provide supplementary information by geographic source market, consistent with how the group has reported in previous years. as previously announced, from november 2017, our belgian airline business transferred to brussels airlines such that it is no longer part of the group. a small portion of the group’s cash is restricted in overseas jurisdictions primarily due to legal or regulatory requirements. we are currently focused on enhancing our policies and procedures by finding best practice from each of the markets in order to define a common group standard. as such, bill’s appointment will ensure that we continue on our journey with a cfo who is perfectly positioned to keep driving the business forward in achieving its strategic goals. the group company secretary put in place an annual agenda plan and set aside more time for nominations committee meetings. as described on page 39, we are committed to creating an environment in which employees from all backgrounds can reach their full potential. remuneration committee chairman warren tucker other members dawn airey, annet aris, emre berkin (until 1 october 2017), paul edgecliffe-johnson (from 21 september 2017) and lesley knox. this means that all long-term incentive plans at thomas cook have a five-year time horizon in line with corporate governance guidelines and shareholder expectations. remuneration outcomes in fy17 short-term incentives progress has been made this year to deliver group underlying ebit growth, and strong cash flow management. for fy18, there will be full retrospective disclosure of targets and performance against these in next year’s directors’ remuneration report. any such payments may include but are not limited to paying any fees for outplacement assistance and/or the executive director’s legal and/ or professional advice fees in connection with their cessation of office or employment non-executive directors non-executive directors, including the chairman, are appointed pursuant to a letter of appointment. long-term incentive plan target disclosure (remuneration report resolution) some shareholders wanted to see eps targets under the psp disclosed prospectively. we performed full and specific scope audit procedures over this risk area in 28 locations, which covered 86% of the group’s revenue. separately disclosed items are not defined by ifrs and therefore considerable judgement is required in determining the appropriateness of such classification. changes to these assumptions or adverse performance could have a significant impact on the available headroom and any impairment that may be required. based on this understanding, we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identified in the paragraphs above. management identified several adjustments that, in their opinion should be applied to thomas cook’s financial statements for the year ended 30 september 2016. as a result these have been restated. the leasing standard is expected to have a material impact on net debt, gross assets, profit from operations and interest. average exchange rates are used to translate the results of all subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures that have a functional currency other than sterling. the group records revenue on a net basis after deducting trade discounts, volume rebates, value added tax and compensation vouchers granted to customers. cash flow forecasts for years beyond the four-year plan are extrapolated at an estimated average long-term nominal growth rate of 2%. the group’s current policy is that deposits and prepayments will normally be made for periods of up to two years in advance. the leverage covenant is a measure of pre-exceptional earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and aircraft operating lease rentals compared to net debt. equiniti share plan trustees limited hold
