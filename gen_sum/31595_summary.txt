from dream to experience. this approach means we can focus on creating maximum value in the holidays to our directly-contracted own-brand and selected partner hotels. group tour operator group airline

our opportunity for growth thomas cook group plc annual report and accounts 2017 9 strategic report chairman’s st a tement 2017 has been a year of considerable strategic progress at thomas cook. strong customer demand for our improved holiday offering helped increase revenues by 9 per cent in the year. most importantly, we know that customers’ experience of their holidays with thomas cook is getting better all the time. this will give customers an even greater choice of high-quality hotels to suit their needs, hotels that are unique to thomas cook, and achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction and earn better margins than the portfolio average. our focus on developing strong partnerships with big technology- led players in the chinese market, like alibaba, gives us access to a big customer base, while our tailored holiday offering means we can differentiate ourselves in a competitive environment. meanwhile, the launch of thomas cook money builds on our long heritage in financial services to offer customers across our source markets new and simpler ways to plan, save, borrow and spend their holiday money, all supported by innovative, easy-to-use technology. each of these developments represent an important step forward in delivering our strategy for profitable growth. this has already been signed by seven major travel companies in a move that we believe will promote greater collaboration to achieve practical change for the benefit of all customers. over the last four years, and in a very competitive market, we’ve transformed it from four essentially separate airlines whose primary task was to transport our tour operator customers, to one airline group with an increasingly successful seat- only business, particularly on long-haul routes, and its own distribution channels. in doing so, we have created europe’s third-largest airline to sun & beach destinations which competes wing-to-wing with the low-cost carriers, and europe’s sixth-largest long-haul carrier with an expanding range of destinations and a compelling customer offer. we have now formalised the work management has undertaken to create one group airline, by separating its reporting and legal structure. this approach is complemented by a series of partnerships which enable us to streamline our operations, while also tapping into opportunities for growth. our progress in 2017 we are now seeing evidence of the direct link between nps uplift and rebooking rate. our data demonstrates that the hotels which score highest in nps achieve not only a higher rebooking rate, but also attract more new customers to thomas cook, showing that customer advocacy is playing an increasingly important role in the growth of our business. the result is that customers come home happier, while we spend less on customer relations in our source markets. new innovations for summer 2018 include the ability to pre-book a specific hotel room based on detailed floor plans and imagery. this includes developing rich, inspirational content that stands out in a crowded online marketplace and will grab customers’ attention to drive higher conversion. this focus on improved customer contact has increased direct distribution across the group by one percentage point to 68 per cent. at the start of this financial year we took two important steps to meet those changing customer needs. second, we took the decision to refocus our store network into two key formats to make sure we’re offering our customers the best of a 21st century travel company; larger stores in higher footfall areas like shopping centres and retail parks, and smaller stores in traditional high street locations. despite closing 101 stores at a cost saving of £12 million, our retail sales have remained broadly flat. these are complemented by our selected partner hotels, contracted directly and developed in partnership with hoteliers. we have a further 20 hotels in the pipeline to open between winter 2017 and summer 2019. this includes at least another two casa cooks. we wanted casa cook to be an eclectic collection of stylish modern resorts with a low-key vibe, each with its own personality inspired as much by the local surroundings as our interpretations of global travel trends and tastes. the staff are attentive yet discreet, guided by a service culture that encourages guests to determine their own holiday rhythm. like rhodes, the hotel’s pool, beach bar and restaurant are designed to bring guests together. the rooms themselves were all created as private sanctuaries, focusing on stylish simplicity, many with their own or shared pools. next year we open our third casa cook in chania, crete – a pure family concept that is very different to what people might expect. this, together with our expanded route capacity, has meant we have grown seat-only sales by 16 per cent versus 2016. we are now benefiting from our new, group-wide commercial it system, which for the first time enables us to sell all ancillaries through industry global distribution systems and to take code-share bookings from third-party airline partners with the aim of driving significant revenue growth. thomas cook group plc annual report and accounts 2017 27 strategic report case study us long-haul growth we’ve transformed the choice we offer customers over long haul in recent years, expanding the fleet and opening up new routes. overall, we grew sales of ancillary services, such as seat reservations, extra luggage, meals on board, travel insurance and in-resort transfers and excursions, by 10 per cent, a total increase of 20 per cent in the two years since we created the group ancillaries team in 2015. the improvements we made to our websites this year in providing richer content have helped improve conversion of sales. this year also saw the launch of a new division which builds on our heritage in financial services to offer customers across our source markets new ways to plan, save, borrow, spend and protect their holiday money. increasing sales of holiday extras +10% +20% thomas cook group plc annual report and accounts 2017 29 strategic report progress against strategy partnerships this strategy is complemented by a series of partnerships which enable us to expand our offer to customers while at the same time streamlining our operations. another partnership where we have made good progress in 2017 is thomas cook china, our joint venture with fosun. it’s early days, but we took 20,000 customers on holiday in our first year of operations. our plan has always been simple – combine our brand heritage and travel expertise with fosun’s local market access and knowledge to tap in to the huge growth opportunity offered by the world’s largest source market for leisure travel. recent improvements in technology and newly established local distribution partnerships have made the business more scalable. both thomas cook and fosun remain fully committed to supporting the future growth of our joint venture business in china. the ambition is to make china a sizeable source market for thomas cook group, comparable, over time, with our more mature markets in europe. in addition, three of our tcab aircraft will operate under our new airline in palma from summer 2018. see our airline section on page 26 greater operational efficiencies £35m 101 thomas cook group plc annual report and accounts 2017 31 strategic report case study financial shared service centre in palma we knew there was an opportunity to bring our finance shared service centres together from across the group in a way which would not only significantly reduce cost but would also mean we can provide a greater consistency of quality to all parts of the business. we chose palma as a target location when we first set up the finance transformation project because of its central location within europe and an abundance of skilled professionals from universities in palma and mainland spain. it is also the group’s most popular holiday destination, meaning we had a sizeable existing presence and infrastructure on which to build. in 2014 we started to move finance functions from across our continental business source markets into palma. definition basic earnings per share (eps) represents profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders. underlying eps (iii) is defined as earnings before separately disclosed items after a national tax charge divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares. from that premise came a simple rule – if an animal attraction is found not to be fully compliant with the abta global welfare guidance for animals in tourism, thomas cook won’t sell it. seven key projects were selected, including a continued drive to reduce weight on board, improve flight planning processes and optimise routing. our upgraded aircraft continue to deliver greater comfort and a superior experience for passengers, whilst contributing toward improved efficiency. the scheme also ensures that staff in resort are employed fairly and local sourcing of products is promoted. over the last year we have taken strong steps to embed travelife within our hotels and resorts business. a key challenge is finding good-quality staff who are able to deliver high-quality service while promoting sustainability within our hotels. the new values and behaviours were introduced as criteria for our customer heroes recognition programme, which we continued this year. nominated by colleagues or managers, we identify customer heroes in each market and hold local recognition events to celebrate the finalists. our annual survey has shown that work to develop a more customer-focused culture is having an impact. building an efficient organisational structure is a key strategic objective and we are working across the group to better align structures. we welcomed two new members to the executive committee (previously general management council) in the year: ingo burmester as chief hotels officer, and anth mooney as our new chief financial services officer, leading thomas cook money. a further 45 leaders started the programme in october, with further programmes planned for 2018. in addition, leaders from across our in-destination teams attended a new leadership programme aimed at addressing the challenges of leading virtual teams and building high performance. action plans are reviewed closely by the executive committee to understand progress and ensure momentum is maintained. gender diversity across the

this includes all relevant principal risks that could threaten thomas cook’s business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. consequently, competition for travel services is increasing and thomas cook must differentiate itself by providing a high-quality holiday experience. inability to consistently meet customer expectations may have an adverse impact on thomas cook’s market share. this summer we opened 11 own-branded hotels across bulgaria, croatia, italy, turkey, spain, greece, cyprus, and the maldives. this allows us to focus our resources into developing a better experience

subsequent awards, granted from december 2015 onwards, the performance conditions are relative tsr and basic eps. the ssip was put in place to cater for exceptional circumstances that would warrant an alternative long term incentive plan. long-term incentive plan target disclosure (remuneration report resolution) some shareholders wanted to see eps targets under the psp disclosed prospectively. the need to provide shareholders with assurance that the psp is based on stretching targets that drive strong performance and have a direct positive impact on company performance, and thus an increase in shareholder value, is clear. however, following shareholder feedback, as described earlier in this report the committee has developed a new methodology for setting targets that is based on a number of other factors and does not directly link to the business plan. in december 2016, peter fankhauser, ceo was granted an award of 165% of salary under this provision to incentivise his continued leadership, drive and commitment he demonstrates and the profitable growth he is expected to deliver over the long-term. we performed full and specific scope audit procedures over this risk area in 28 locations, which covered 86% of the group’s revenue. we concluded an adjustment for credit risk that had been applied to the risk-free discount rate was not required. separately disclosed items are not defined by ifrs and therefore considerable judgement is required in determining the appropriateness of such classification. changes to these assumptions or adverse performance could have a significant impact on the available headroom and any impairment that may be required. we performed our own sensitivities on the group’s forecasts and determined whether adequate headroom remained. we agreed with management’s conclusion that no impairments were required, based on the results of our work. we have considered the recognition period over which deferred tax assets will be recovered and concluded they were reasonable. we determined materiality for the group to be £15m, which is 5% of underlying profit from operations. based on this understanding, we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identified in the paragraphs above. management identified several adjustments that, in their opinion should be applied to thomas cook’s financial statements for the year ended 30 september 2016. as a result these have been restated. new or amended standard and interpretations in issue but not yet effective or eu endorsed at the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the group has not applied the following new and revised ifrss that have been issued but are not yet effective or eu endorsed: ifrs 9 “financial

operations and interest. ifrs 17 “insurance contracts” is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2021 subject to endorsement by the eu. ifric 23 “uncertainty over income tax treatments” is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 january 2019 with early adoption permitted. entities which the group jointly controls with one or more other party under a contractual arrangement are joint ventures. average exchange rates are used to translate the results of all subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures that have a functional currency other than sterling. they
