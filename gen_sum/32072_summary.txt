With the dual challenges of weakening consumer confidence and growing competition, exceeding our customers’ expectations is more important than ever. Recent results – Greene King’s top four dishes outperform the non-Greene King brands surveyed in our mystery guest programme, averaging over 8/10 versus non-Greene King brands, which averaged 7.81/10 – Chef & Brewer’s burger scored the highest of all pubs surveyed – Chef & Brewer also scored highest for its chicken tikka masala and its chips – Flaming Grill scored highest for its hunter’s chicken – Greene King Locals (Mainstream) scored highest for its fish and chips – Our food development team was recently recognised at the Menu Innovation and Development Awards Pictured are two members of our food development team. This year we launched Craft Academy, a brewing venture led by apprentices and based at Greene King’s brewery in Bury St Edmunds. This comprised a positive contribution from Spirit synergies, offset by brand conversion costs and the more challenging cost environment. Competition for wet-led pubs comes predominantly from the off-trade, where we are seeing continued discounting being used to drive volume.

Our core market, UK pubs and restaurants, is estimated to have grown 1.5% 1 with LFL growth of 1.1% over the last 12 months 2 . Alongside this, our core markets have become increasingly dynamic and competitive, with more choice for consumers than ever before. This means we will try to redefine what our pubs offer their customers, ensuring they have a broader and more lasting appeal. The underlying net promoter score (NPS), which we use as a measure of service standards, increased by 0.5%pts to 58.4%.

DEFINITION Pub Company LFL sales include revenue from the sale of drink, food and accommodation but exclude machine income. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2017 30 STRATEGIC REPORT Financial review REVENUES REACHED A RECORD HIGH GROUP REVENUE INCREASED: 6.9% FREE CASH FLOW: £119.6m ROCE: 9.4% DIVIDEND: 33.2p Income statement Revenue was £2,216.5m, an increase of 6.9% compared to the prior year reflecting the benefit from LFL sales growth and a full year contribution from Spirit. Free cash flow benefited from favourable working capital timing, a small reduction in core capex as we focused on brand conversions and the utilisation of non-recurring Spirit tax losses. The group is at a relatively early stage in discussions with HMRC and will continue to defend its position robustly. To ensure continuous improvement across the business, progress of these risk implementation plans is monitored by senior management on a regular basis. Regular monitoring is undertaken of KPIs applicable to both third party suppliers and distributors, with issues flagged for resolution. We have also established a link between EHO ‘Scores on the Doors’ and remuneration incentives for relevant employees. Regular meetings are held with key suppliers to review issues and follow up on any corrective actions required. 76% OF LAST YEAR’S ACHIEVERS ARE STILL WITH US 5 AWARDS WON THIS YEAR OVER 9,000 TEAM MEMBERS HAVE WORKED TOWARDS AN APPRENTICESHIP SINCE 2011... ...

As a key part of the menu development process, we regularly review our menus to provide healthier options for customers. Food standards We are proud that out of the 1,614 pubs visited in 2016/17 by local authorities, 1,538 (95.29%) earned a four or five star rating. We are proud that a number of our venues across the UK achieved Best Bar None accreditations this year. We report on this weekly, which gives us the ability to track progress and ensure that energy reduction is in place by site. Initiatives during 2016 included improving the energy efficiency of lighting at our Bury St Edmunds bottling plant, aiming to save 200,000kWh per year. Better training for our drivers has also ensured vehicles are less likely to be left idle with the engine on, reducing fuel waste. Several other projects are ongoing, such as investigating the procurement of green CO 2 from local sources for use in our brewing and packaging operations. It also includes emissions from owned vehicles (including company cars) but excludes logistics where we outsource this to third parties.

It is expected that all directors attend board and relevant committee meetings, unless they are prevented from doing so by prior commitments. Particular emphasis is placed on ensuring that directors are aware of proposed legislative changes in areas such as corporate governance, financial reporting and sector-specific issues. All substantive items of business at shareholders’ meetings are dealt with under separate resolutions, including a resolution to adopt the report and accounts. The board is satisfied that Rob Rowley has recent and relevant financial experience, as a former finance director of Reuters Group plc. Base salaries are reviewed annually or when a change in responsibility occurs, to reflect the executive’s responsibilities, market value and sustained performance level.

The terms of his appointment as chief executive were agreed and set out in a letter dated 24 December 2004. Finally, a further 20% of his bonus will be based on personal targets relating to succession planning and values. He will have the two new strategic targets, with a maximum weighting of 15% each, relating to customer net promoter score in our Pub Company and employee engagement. Diversity We take pride in making sure all of our team members are given the same opportunities to achieve their full potential. We promote an environment in our pubs, restaurants, hotels, headquarters, pub company support centre and breweries that is free from discrimination. We also compared them to recent actual profit growth rates over the last five-year period and corroborated explanations for any anomalies. For food, liquor and accommodation sales in the Pub Company division we have focused our testing on manual journals posted to this revenue stream. We determined materiality for the group to be £13.7m (2016: £12.4m), which is set at approximately 5% (2016: 5%) of pre-tax profit before exceptional and non-underlying items. They are presented in pounds sterling, with values rounded to the nearest hundred thousand, except where otherwise indicated. A small number of minor changes have been made to reclassify exceptional and non-underlying items in the prior year. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability. An initial assessment indicates that the adoption of IFRS 9 will not have a material impact on its consolidated results and financial position. This standard replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance under current IFRS and becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, subject to EU adoption. Other standards and interpretations that are relevant to the group have been assessed as having no significant financial impact or additional disclosure requirements at this time. Provisions are also made for uncertain exposures which can have an impact on both deferred and current tax. A representative sample of properties was also valued by external valuers Gerald Eve Chartered Surveyors and Property Consultants, who confirmed that the values were consistent with their appraisal. Included in property, plant and equipment above are properties held under finance leases with a net book value of £21.4m (2016: £22.3m). Cash flow projections relating to individual CGUs have been made based on historic trends adjusted for management’s estimates of medium-term trading prospects. For leases where the current rentals are below market terms, an intangible asset has been recognised (see note 13). External qualified surveyors were engaged to provide a formal evaluation of current market rentals for the acquired leased pub assets. Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than 1 month. At 30 April 2017, there are £2.9m (2016: £5.7m) of interest swaps outstanding on cancelled floating rate notes which relate to the Spirit secured debt. For acquired leases where the current rentals are below market terms, an operating lease intangible asset has been recognised (see note 13). However, HMRC did not seek to recover the VAT refunded to the Spirit Pub Company of £17.9m and associated interest of £6.1m because it had accepted a guarantee that it would only repay this VAT if Rank’s litigation is finally determined in HMRC’s favour.
