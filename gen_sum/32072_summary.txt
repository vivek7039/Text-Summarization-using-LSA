business with an excellent track record which, following the spirit acquisition, was at an exciting time in its development. with the dual challenges of weakening consumer confidence and growing competition, exceeding our customers’ expectations is more important than ever. recent results – greene king’s top four dishes outperform the non-greene king brands surveyed in our mystery guest programme, averaging over 8/10 versus non-greene king brands, which averaged 7.81/10 – chef & brewer’s burger scored the highest of all pubs surveyed – chef & brewer also scored highest for its chicken tikka masala and its chips – flaming grill scored highest for its hunter’s chicken – greene king locals (mainstream) scored highest for its fish and chips – our food development team was recently recognised at the menu innovation and development awards pictured are two members of our food development team. this year we launched craft academy, a brewing venture led by apprentices and based at greene king’s brewery in bury st edmunds. this comprised a positive contribution from spirit synergies, offset by brand conversion costs and the more challenging cost environment. — annual report 2017 greene king plc 13 strategic report trading environment consumer confidence in the uk has softened over the last 12 months with nominal wage growth starting to fall behind rising levels of cost inflation leading to a squeeze on disposable household income. due in some degree to the cost pressures described above, competition for market share is intensifying and broadening. competition for wet-led pubs comes predominantly from the off-trade, where we are seeing continued discounting being used to drive volume. greene king plc annual report 2017 14 strategic report chief executive’s review continued integration following the acquisition of spirit in june 2015, we have managed to complete its integration in just two years, one year ahead of the original schedule. over 1,000 pubs have successfully changed their supply model with no impact on availability to menu items. the integration of supply chains will enable us to optimise our network and improve group efficiency. nine programmes were completed this year, with 103 young people taking part and 49 offers of permanent employment made. operational review page 26 operational review page 28 operational review page 24 >

2017 18 strategic report our markets overview our core markets are the uk eating out and uk drinking out markets. our core market, uk pubs and restaurants, is estimated to have grown 1.5% 1 with lfl growth of 1.1% over the last 12 months 2 . alongside this, our core markets have become increasingly dynamic and competitive, with more choice for consumers than ever before. despite this, uk real household spending grew by 2.8% in 2016. we remain cautious about the future economic environment as we have seen nominal wage growth start to fall behind rising inflation, creating a squeeze on the household disposable income available for discretionary spend. all these policy initiatives will impact on costs and margins within the hospitality industry going forward. following the removal of the beer duty escalator in 2013, beer duty has either been cut or frozen in successive budgets until march 2017 when it was increased by 3.9%, along with similar increases for wines, spirits and ciders. we will use our scale to deliver leading value propositions through the successful execution of known value item (kvi) and everyday low pricing (edlp) strategies to drive a sustainable mix of volume and spend per head growth. this means we will try to redefine what our pubs offer their customers, ensuring they have a broader and more lasting appeal. key progress in the last 12 months: – free cash

capital timing, a small reduction in core capex as we focused on brand conversions and the utilisation of non-recurring spirit tax losses. we have one remaining open historical position with hmrc,

financial officer 28 june 2017 annual report 2017 greene king plc 33 strategic report risks and uncertainties greene king is not alone in facing a range of risks and uncertainties in the course of its business. to ensure continuous improvement across the business, progress of these risk implementation plans is monitored by senior management on a regular basis. deliberate acts of cyber crime are on the increase, targeting all markets and heightening risk exposure. we have recently launched our new values programme, winning ways, to improve engagement across the business. regular monitoring is undertaken of kpis applicable to both third party suppliers and distributors, with issues flagged for resolution. we have also established a link between eho ‘scores on the doors’ and remuneration incentives for relevant employees. regular meetings are held with key suppliers to review issues and follow up on any corrective actions required. 1 4 5 covenant risks ↔ if we are unable to meet the covenant requirements of the group’s debenture, securitisation and other financing arrangements our ability to pay dividends or reinvest cash could be affected, which in turn would damage our reputation and ongoing creditworthiness. greene king plc annual report 2017 38 strategic report corporate responsibility making a positive contribution — we recently reached £3m of funds raised for macmillan cancer support since the launch of our corporate partnership with them in 2012. this is testament to the thousands of our people and customers who back our partnership and who have raised

the local communities we serve – support young people into work – drive the responsible retailing agenda – operate in a more sustainable way we are already working hard to achieve these aims, for example with our flagship partnership with macmillan cancer support and our get into hospitality programme with the prince’s trust. i’d highly recommend the programme to anyone looking into a career in the hospitality industry – it’s given me opportunities i never thought i’d be able to pursue.” apprenticeships our award-winning apprenticeship programme has now seen over 9,000 team members work towards an apprenticeship qualification since it began in 2011. this year we have also focused on introducing apprenticeships to other areas of our business outside of pub company. we are delighted to

edmunds bottling plant, aiming to save 200,000kwh per year. better training for our drivers has also ensured vehicles are less likely to be left idle with the engine on, reducing fuel waste. several

a strong and effective governance system. the relevant managing director or functional head attends such meetings to present and answer questions. it is expected that all directors attend board and relevant committee meetings, unless they are prevented from doing so by prior commitments. particular emphasis is placed on ensuring that directors are aware of proposed legislative changes in areas such as corporate governance, financial reporting and sector-specific issues. all substantive items of business at shareholders’ meetings are dealt with under separate resolutions, including a resolution to adopt the report and accounts. the board is satisfied that rob rowley has recent and relevant financial experience, as a former finance director of reuters group plc. this performance was achieved against a difficult backdrop of increased costs, weaker consumer confidence and stronger competition. annual report 2017 greene king plc 55 corporate governance we also believe that applying these kpis on a basis which is measured annually rather than over a three-year performance period is better as this gives the remuneration committee flexibility to set appropriate year-on-year growth targets. base salaries are reviewed annually or when a change in responsibility occurs, to reflect the executive’s responsibilities, market value and sustained performance level. bonuses are payable after the end of each financial year, based on performance against those targets. the shares so acquired must be held for at least one year or, if longer, until share ownership guideline levels are attained. all ltip awards will be subject to suitably stretching performance targets as selected by the committee. confirms that vested but unexercised awards can be credited (on an anticipated net of tax basis). for 2017/18 the ltip awards will be subject to three performance measures: – eps growth will be applied on the basis that it will reward the delivery of growth in profits and is a widely understood profit-based measure across the business; – roce will be applied as it ensures that management focuses on generating returns in excess of the cost of capital and because it clearly aligns with our strategy where capital needs to be applied appropriately in order to focus on developing our pub company and generating returns; and – free cash flow will be applied as it aligns with our strategy to maintain a strong balance sheet and flexible capital structure. 3,000 2,400 600 1,200 1,800 0 maximum on-target minimum 46% 30% 27% 35% 27% 35% 100% £838k £2,773k

before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional and non-underlying items. they are presented in pounds sterling, with values rounded to the nearest hundred thousand, except where otherwise indicated. a small number of minor changes have been made to reclassify exceptional and non-underlying items in the prior year. plant and equipment assets are depreciated over their estimated lives, which range from three to 20 years. an item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. identifiable intangible assets, meeting either the contractual-legal or separability criterion, are recognised separately from goodwill. contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised if the acquisition date fair value can be measured reliably. each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and cannot be larger than an operating segment before aggregation. the group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any individual trade loan is impaired. after initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability. greene king plc annual report 2017 88 financial statements 1 accounting policies continued significant accounting policies continued pensions and other post-employment benefits defined benefit pension schemes the group operates two defined benefit pension schemes which require contributions to be made into separately administered funds. unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. the new standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018, subject to eu adoption. an initial assessment indicates that the adoption of ifrs 9 will not have a material impact on its consolidated results and financial position. this standard replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance under current ifrs and becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018, subject to eu adoption. other standards and interpretations that are relevant to the group have been assessed as having no significant financial impact or additional disclosure requirements at this time. provisions are also made for uncertain exposures which can have an impact on both deferred and current tax. useful lives are reassessed annually which may lead to an increase or reduction in depreciation accordingly. no information about geographical regions has been provided as the group’s activities are predominantly domestic. during the prior period the group acquired as part of a business combination derivatives that are subsequently accounted for at fair value through profit and loss as opposed to existing derivatives which are designated in hedge relationships. greene king plc annual report 2017 98 financial statements 9 pensions continued defined benefit pension schemes and post-employment benefits the group maintains the following defined benefit schemes which are closed to new entrants and are closed to future accrual. current legislation allows all of the group’s tax losses to be carried forward for an unlimited period. a representative sample of properties was also valued by external valuers gerald eve chartered surveyors and property consultants, who confirmed that the values were consistent with their appraisal. included in property, plant and equipment above are properties held under finance leases with a net book value of £21.4m (2016: £22.3m). cash flow projections relating to individual cgus have been made based on historic trends adjusted for management’s estimates of medium-term trading prospects. as they use significant unobservable inputs they are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, as further explained in note 24. greene king plc annual report 2017 106 financial statements 14 property, plant and equipment continued impairment of property, plant and equipment continued the impairment charge recognised in relation to a small number of pubs was driven by changes in the local competitive and trading environment at their respective sites and decisions taken to exit some sites where current market values are lower than book values. for leases where the current rentals are below market terms, an intangible asset has been recognised (see note 13). external qualified surveyors were engaged to provide a formal evaluation of current market rentals for the acquired leased pub assets. whilst cash flow interest rate risk is largely eliminated, the use of fixed rate borrowings and derivative financial instruments exposes the group to fair value interest rate risk such that the group would not significantly benefit from falls in interest rates and would be exposed to unplanned costs, such as break costs, should debt or derivative financial instruments be restructured or repaid early. excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than 1 month. financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting (i) greene king secured financing vehicle at 30 april 2017 the group held 4 (2016: 4) interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of £500.7m (2016: £530.0m), which are designated cash flow hedges against £500.7m (2016: £530.0m) of variable rate bonds. the remainder of the fair value movement is recognised as a charge in exceptional finance costs amounting to £23.6m (2016: £39.1m) as it is considered to be more volatile and its inclusion in pre-exceptional profit would hinder year-on-year comparability of performance. at 30 april 2017, there are £2.9m (2016: £5.7m) of interest swaps outstanding on cancelled floating rate notes which relate to the spirit secured debt. during the periods ending 30 april 2017 and 1 may 2016 there were no transfers between levels 1, 2, or 3 fair value measurements. all covenants in relation to the securitisation vehicles and bank loans have been fully complied with. for acquired leases where the current rentals are below market terms, an operating lease intangible asset has been recognised (see note 13). however, hmrc did not seek to recover the vat refunded to the spirit pub company of £17.9m and associated interest of £6.1m because it had accepted a guarantee that it would only repay this vat if rank’s litigation is finally determined in hmrc’s favour. future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2017 £m 2016 £m within 1 year 80.5 81.9 between 1 and 5 years 304.6 315.2
