This is particularly relevant for our mid-tier customers who increasingly want an end-to-end solution. We have seen this momentum continue post year-end, as demonstrated by the two-year contract renewal with Asda, announced in July 2017. This first quarter has seen early benefits from the favourable renewal with Asda, John Lewis going live on the AIR platform within two months of contract signature and an increased number of transactions from our F&B clients due to exciting issuance partner relationships. I am very pleased to report that under Tim’s leadership the Company has excelled, with a clear strategy in place, accelerated growth, and in a strengthened position to capitalise on the sizeable market opportunity. In addition to the strengthened Board, the executive team has been joined by David Aylmer as Chief Operating Officer to provide particular focus on client delivery, security and scalability of our operational capabilities. STRATEGIC REPORT 08 Eagle Eye Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2017 09 Eagle Eye Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2017 For more information, please visit: www.eagleeye.com Win, T ransact, Deepen targeting, giving customers much more value and offering retailers the chance to truly understand their customers, rewarding them whilst they are still in store, thereby maximising engagement. To achieve this we aspire to be “Better, Bigger, Faster” by improving in three core areas of customer interaction: “Win” (bringing more customers onto the Eagle Eye AIR platform); “Transact” (driving higher redemption volumes through the platform); and “Deepen” (building relationships with customers as the breadth of our product portfolio becomes more developed). Both these UK contract announcements reinforce the clear competitive benefits our solutions deliver to leading retailers. In March 2017, the Company signed a strategic partnership with TCC, a world leader in creating retail marketing programmes and long-term loyalty schemes, allowing Eagle Eye to extend its digital promotions offer into the European loyalty market. This meaningful uplift in redemptions is proof that Eagle Eye can successfully drive higher redemption rates through the power of digital. As part of this campaign, Eagle Eye formed a new partnership with the life cycle social advertising company, Driftrock. Working with each brand and their media agency the Company has coordinated a number of promotions targeted by region using a combination of web landing pages, programmatic display, traditional advertising, game and dating apps plus social media lead ads. I had already spent a significant part of my career looking at how data can change consumer marketing, and immediately recognised the great potential for Eagle Eye to revolutionise the way that businesses engage with consumers. We have gained significant momentum, driven by our ambition to be “Better, Bigger, Faster.” We now have a clear vision and strategy in place and delivered results ahead of our expectations during the year. Traditional methods which give 1% discounts and a “rear view” perspective on purchase behaviour are being replaced by digital alternatives. Better , Bigger , Faster INTEGRITY Our values BY CREATING COOL TECH BY BEING TRUSTED BY BEING BRILLIANT EXCELLENCE Our beliefs TEAMWORK INNOVATION FUN PASSION STRATEGIC REPORT 10 Eagle Eye Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2017 11 Eagle Eye Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2017 For more information, please visit: www.eagleeye.com With extensive experience with system providers and clients, David has a thorough understanding of customer service and delivery. The Group will leverage his experience to ensure first class operations and delivery across Eagle Eye’s network of customers. We have introduced a new life skills training workshop based on the fundamental philosophy that people can benefit from understanding more about themselves, how they perform at their best and what triggers sub-optimal performance. Performance improvements were made to support our growing Tier 1 grocery volumes, while we extended reporting and relationship management capabilities for issuance partners. With the addition of supplier funding functionality, we have created the ability for brands to interact with retailers’ loyalty schemes through holding buckets of points or value for discount that can be used in targeted promotions to end consumers, all redeemable in store or online through direct integration with the point of sale.

This increase in value and share for implementation fees reflects the progress made in deepening the Group’s product offering within major accounts, particularly for our UK and international Tier 1 grocer clients where implementation fees were £2.8m (2016: £0.7m). The Board does not feel it appropriate at this time to commence paying dividends. Additionally, the Group is committed to developing products for its customers on a set timeline. In line with its ISO 27001 accredited procedures, the Group uses a third party security and data compliance service to monitor and mitigate against this risk in addition to client specific security testing. Financial review continued Principal risks and uncertainties Evolution of the market The Group operates in an evolving market and there is a possibility that the rate of growth in mobile commerce will not match independent predictions or that users of mobile devices will change their behaviour with respect to mobile commerce. No assurance can be given that the Group will develop further technologies or products which are patentable, that patents will be sufficiently broad in their scope to provide protection for the Group’s intellectual property rights against third parties, or that patents will have been granted in all new territories which the Group enters. Patents pending or future patent applications may not be granted and the lack of any such patents may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s ability to develop and market its proposed products. Even if the Group obtains patents, they may not be valid or enforceable against others. The Group ensures that employees are fully aware of financial and economic factors affecting its performance. In particular, it may impact the Group’s ability to recruit suitably skilled staff for its UK-based operations. There can be no assurance that the Group would be able to compensate or hedge against such adverse effects and therefore negative exchange rate movements could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects and financial performance.

Auditor RSM UK Audit LLP were appointed for the year ended 30 June 2017 and have indicated their willingness to continue in office. All Non-Executive Directors receive a fixed fee for their services, other than Bill Currie. The Audit Committee meets formally not less than three times every year and otherwise as required. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. There is a risk that revenue could be inappropriately recognised depending on the stage of service delivery. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all unadjusted differences in excess of £10,000, as well as differences below those thresholds that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.

The guidance in IAS 39 on impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting continues to apply. 1 January 2018 IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers The standard specifies how and when a company will recognise revenue as well as requiring such entities to provide users of financial statements with more informative, relevant disclosures. 1 January 2018 Annual improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 The 2016 Annual improvements cycle covered amendments to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, IAS 28 Investments in Associated and Joint Ventures and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities. Revenue is recognised when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, when it is probable that future economic benefits can flow to the Group and when specific criteria have been met for each of the activities as described below: Development and set up fees are recognised on a percentage of completion basis using estimates. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Service and non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of options expected to vest at each reporting date. Milestones and the Directors’ estimate of percentage completion may differ, which could impact operating results positively or negatively. Therefore the Group has only one operating segment and segmental information is not required to be disclosed. 2017 Cash-generating unit Carrying value of goodwill £000 Period over which cash flows have been projected Growth rate beyond management approved forecasts Discount rate for cash flow projections UK 2,664 5 years 2.5% 15% 2016 Cash-generating unit Carrying value of goodwill £000 Period over which cash flows have been projected Growth rate beyond management approved forecasts Discount rate for cash flow projections Messaging 2,664 5 years 2.5% 30% In the prior year the acquired 2ergo business was not fully integrated and therefore it was possible to identify a separate messaging cash-generating unit.
