We will continue to target our dividend cover at or above this level in the future. Graeme Craig is consequently stepping down from his role as a Director in September 2017 and will be leaving the business. Our tenanted business is high quality and robust after many years of investing to drive up standards.

OUR STRATEGY  |StrategicReport | Governance | Financial Statements | Other Information 9 www.shepherdneame.co.uk 8 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017 OUR PUBS TO DRIVE FOOTFALL TO 11 www.shepherdneame.co.uk 10 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017 This has been an exciting year of development for the Company, with good progress in all areas of the business, a strong underlying performance and some great acquisitions that add real value to the Company. Whilst the weather conditions have been favourable during this year with a long hot summer in 2016 and plenty of sunshine in the spring of 2017, market conditions have become progressively harder, as consumer spending is being squeezed by inflation. We have also developed our future brewing and brands strategy, namely to build our own brands, drive necessary cost reduction and streamline management roles where appropriate, as we exit the Asahi contract in the coming year. CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW “ Good progress in all areas of the business and a strong underlying performance. Since the year end, we have opened a new outlet in Chatham Maritime called Pier Five. Developing our offer to enhance the customer experience We aim to enhance the customer experience in our pubs by delivering great fresh food, providing accommodation of character and offering an interesting range of products. It is also encouraging that we seem able to attract and support innovative licensees with diverse offers. T otal divisional turnover in the tenanted and leased estate grew by +2.8% to £34.4m (2016: £33.5m) on 14 fewer outlets. As previously announced our licence to brew and sell Asahi Super Dry will terminate at the end of February 2018. Furthermore, we see considerable opportunity from our emerging portfolio as the consumer seeks premium British products. The Whitstable Bay Collection continues to enjoy great success with increasing distribution and brand awareness. To raise awareness of our new brands we opened a pop-up shop at Bluewater for the first time with considerable success. Our investments in recent years have helped to build a high-quality and sustainable platform for the future. We have good reason to be pleased with the strategic and financial performance this year. Our investments in recent years have helped to build a high-quality and sustainable platform for the future. Results Turnover for the 52 weeks ended 24 June 2017 increased by +11.7% (2016: +1.2%) to £156.2m (2016: £139.9m) and underlying operating profit was up +7.2% (2016: +3.5%) at £15.3m (2016: £14.2m). Turnover was up +2.8% with good growth in trading sites offset by the disposal of 15 pubs. As a result of these three factors the net cash inflow from operating activities increased by £1.8m to £22.1m (2016: £20.3m). In order to service the Company’s future obligations under employee incentive plans 124,514 shares were purchased (2016: 49,000) at an average market price of £13.22 (2016: £11.92). These swap contracts are revalued annually to fair value taking into account current prevailing long-term interest rates. Shareholders funds at 24 June 2017 were £191.1m (2016: £183.9m) meaning net assets per share showed an increase of +3.9% to £12.86 (2016: £12.38). There is a risk that unexpected events or incidents could damage the reputation of our brands. We rely on a number of key suppliers to service both the brewery site and our managed pubs. Failure to recruit or retain key staff could have a detrimental impact on the Company’s brand and reputation. We have a number of internal training and development programmes in place for employees across the organisation.

Non-financial assets An asset is impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after initial recognition, the estimated recoverable value of the asset has been reduced. Key source of estimation uncertainty – impairment of assets Financial and non-financial assets are subject to impairment reviews at the balance sheet date based on whether current or future events and circumstances suggest that their recoverable amount may be less than their carrying value.  |StrategicReport |Governance | Financial Statements |OtherInformation 51 www.shepherdneame.co.uk 6 Net finance costs 52 weeks ended 52 weeks ended 24 June 2017 25 June 2016 £’000 £’000 Interest payable: Bank loans and overdrafts 4,103 4,004 Interest payable: other 7 – Investment income: Income from fixed asset investments (6) (14) Other finance income: Unwinding of discounts on provisions (10) (92) Net finance costs 4,094 3,898 7 Non-GAAP reporting measures Certain items recognised in reported profit or loss before tax can vary significantly from year to year and therefore create volatility in reported earnings which does not reflect the underlying performance of the Group.
