16.9 earnings per share before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items* (pence) years ended 31 march *from continuing activities your company has continued to make good progress this year – delivering strong ﬁnancial results while continuing to transform the business. earnings per share, before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, grew by 19% to 16.9 pence – almost doubling in two years. this is demonstrated, for example, by our wide deployment of broadband technology throughout the uk, and by the bt education programme, which has enabled more than two million young people to participate in a drama-based campaign designed to help them improve their communications skills. a great customer experience – and cost savings – really can be two sides of the same coin. getting things right for customers the ﬁrst time keeps them loyal, contributes to cost effectiveness, and boosts our reputation. in april 2004, we announced a roll-out plan that will bring broadband to 99.6% of the uk’s homes and businesses. this year we’ve broken the £20 barrier, with an entry-level broadband product for just £19.99 a month. for our larger business customers we also offer convergence, managing their ﬁxed and mobile communications seamlessly. and bt local business is demonstrating that getting close to our customers can deliver signiﬁcant revenue beneﬁts. these three lines of business are focused on providing a simple and complete experience for our customers. this reduction was only partially offset by robust and continued turnover growth in new wave services. this growth has been achieved through broadband and the provision of tailored managed services to uk wholesale customers. for ﬁnancial reporting purposes, we continue to report by line of business (see financial review). as at 31 march 2004, we had 2.2 million broadband lines, which represents growth of 177% on the previous year, and our target is to reach ﬁve million by 2006. in march 2004, we were taking an average of 50,000 orders a week. the number of broadband lines increased to 2.45 million, 2,652 exchanges had been upgraded and total uk coverage reached 90%. this hugely successful scheme attracted more than 860,000 registrations, helping us match our investment to demand. in december 2003, for example, we launched a trial of wireless broadband at sites throughout the uk. bt ipstream home 1000 is a self-install product for residential customers who want greater bandwidth than the standard 512kbit/s available at present. immediate price cuts should ensure that there is sustainable demand prior to launch and help potential customers plan ahead with conﬁdence. this is twice the speed of ordinary broadband and up to 20 times faster than traditional dial-up internet. & during the ﬁnancial year, bt business broadband joined forces with a number of companies to enhance its networking and value-added services. & in may 2004, we announced plans to launch project bluephone – the ﬁrst step towards handset convergence. project bluephone removes the need to own more than one phone as customers will be able to use a single device that can switch seamlessly between ﬁxed and mobile networks, offering a better service with more guaranteed coverage and lower overall costs. mobility for business customers we are a service provider in the business mobile market and had over 103,000 business connections at 31 march 2004. bt provides a range of managed mobile services to uk and global customers who either outsource their mobile communications entirely or rely on bt to provide speciﬁc managed services, such as supplier management or managed billing for mobility. & during the year, we established our position as a major uk provider of public wireless broadband (wi-fi) services. remote monitoring enables the control of electronic devices over long distances, helping businesses to manage their assets and risks. transform our network for the twenty-ﬁrst century our uk network today in the uk, we have 873 local and trunk processor units, 121.7 million kilometres of copper wire and 7.3 million kilometres of optical ﬁbre. we expect to launch a range of new commercial broadband services over the next 12 months. achieve competitive advantage through cost leadership our focus on continued operational efﬁciencies helped reduce overall group operating costs before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items by £348 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. looking forward, we have identiﬁed additional efﬁciency savings of over £1 billion which we aim to achieve over the next three years by focusing on reducing the costs of failure, complexity and duplication and by working smarter. this new proposition combines bt’s extensive experience in the provision of corporate data networks and hosting with our professional services capability. this was driven by customers making use of alternatives such as mobile calls, e-mail, instant messaging, corporate ipvpns and voip. traditional services for consumers & the bt together pricing packages, which offer a range of competitive call prices and ﬁxed-fee pricing options, are an important part of our traditional revenue defence strategy, and had around nine million customers as at 31 march 2004. during the year, we announced we would abolish the standard rate on 1 july 2004 to give more value for money. we also continued to offer space in our payphone kiosks for mobile antennas, wi-fi hotspots and cctv (closed-circuit television). & our innovative bt local business initiative helped us gain traction in the sme market by building closer relationships with smaller business customers, who are often more comfortable dealing with other small companies rather than large corporations. our traditional uk wholesale business has been under pressure from several directions over the year. however, we achieved a 1% increase in our uk external revenues (excluding the impact of mobile termination rate cuts). we have further developed our product portfolio, launching products such as wholesale calls and isdn 30 service provider. in may 2004, we announced we will be introducing a new wholesale calls product for carrier pre-selection (cps) operators that will allow them to use bt directly for certain calls at a price such that their overall costs can be considerably reduced. shares and pensions since privatisation, we have been committed to providing our employees with a stake in the company. in addition, they can buy shares at a discount under our savings-related share option plans. this ensures that key messages are available for everyone, with additional information sourced on an ‘‘as needs’’ basis. brightstar – bt’s business ‘‘incubator’’ with the goal of commercialising our patent portfolio – was created in january 2000. in march 2003, bt exact teamed up with coller capital and new venture partners (nvp) to create a new, independent corporate venturing partnership – nvp brightstar. regulatory conditions under the new framework, based on 2003 eu directives, providers are no longer required to obtain licences before offering telecommunications services. instead, there is a general authorisation for anybody who wishes to provide electronic communications networks and services. in addition, a separate condition has been set regulating the provision of premium rate services. in some cases, additional obligations relating to, for example, price control and regulatory accounting have also been, or will be, imposed. this direction has been continued pending completion of the market review, and margin squeeze tests are likely to appear as regulatory remedies in the event that bt is found to have smp in broadband access. in addition, where companies infringe uk or ec competition law, company directors can be disqualiﬁed from acting as such for a maximum period of 15 years. retail price controls we are subject to two sets of uk retail price controls, one on certain public-switched telephony call charges 20 operating and financial review bt annual report and form 20-f 2004 price control formula (rpi-x) years commencing 1 august 1998 1999

access product being available from 29 march 2004. network charge control we operate under interconnection agreements with most other operators. the current network charge control period began on 1 october 2001 and will last for four years from that date. it requires us to set reasonable charges based on long-run incremental costs for our standard interconnection services. depending on the degree of competition for these services, charges are cap-controlled each year by rpi minus x (where x ranges from 7.5% to 13%) for services ofcom considers unlikely to become competitive in the near future; and safeguard cap controlled (ie no increases above rpi during any relevant year of the overall control period) for services likely to become competitive. this statement contained new obligations on bt to provide business isdn2 wholesale line rentals with cost-oriented prices. furthermore, the wholesale isdn2 business and isdn30 products have to be provided in accordance with a functional speciﬁcation deﬁned by ofcom. bt will not have universal service obligations outside the uk, although in certain member states we may be required to contribute towards an industry fund to pay for the cost of meeting universal service obligations in those countries. the availability of cost-oriented access products from regulated incumbents remains an important element of our strategy around the world and we continue to press these incumbents, their national regulatory authorities and at eu level for such access. however, payments to mobile operators have reduced by exactly the same amount, leaving a neutral effect on proﬁts. if the proceedings are successful, bt could be held liable, with others, for any damages. the company has concluded that it would not be appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such potential claim. however, this growth was more than offset by a 6% decline in turnover from the group’s traditional businesses. group turnover was maintained after excluding the £219 million impact of these regulatory reductions to mobile termination rates. business includes the external turnover of bt retail from smaller and medium sized enterprise (sme) customers. group turnover by customer segment 2004 £m 2003 £m 2002 £m consumer 5,974 6,067 5,916 business 2,600 2,716 2,748 major corporate 5,909 5,794 4,962 wholesale 4,002 4,110 4,433 other 34 40 388 18,519 18,727 18,447 consumer turnover in 2004 was 2% lower (1% excluding the impact of regulatory reductions in mobile termination rates) at £5,974 million when compared to the 2003 ﬁnancial year. this reﬂects the continued migration of traditional voice only services to managed ict contracts from which turnover grew by 19% to £2,564 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year conﬁrming bt’s status as a major ict provider in this market. in total, these effects reduced group operating proﬁts by over £400 million, although this was compensated for at the proﬁt before tax level by a corresponding improvement in our share of the operating proﬁts of associates and joint ventures and net interest payable. ebitda before exceptional items is considered to be a good measure of the operating performance because it reﬂects the underlying operating cash costs, by eliminating depreciation and amortisation, and excludes non-recurring exceptional items that are predominantly related to corporate transactions. as a result, bt group’s total originating measured call volumes declined by 2% in the 2004 ﬁnancial year (2003 – 13% increase). external turnover is derived from providing wholesale products and solutions to other operators interconnecting with bt’s uk ﬁxed network, including mmo 2 since the demerger. interconnect payments to other network operators remained broadly ﬂat in the 2004 ﬁnancial year at £3,165 million. operating proﬁt before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items at £1,681 million decreased by 4% in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. accordingly it is based on operating costs excluding payments to other network operators and depreciation, plus capital expenditure. the product portfolio covers a number of key ict related areas including ip infrastructure, customer relationship management (crm), outsourcing and system integration. all major european operations achieved their target of becoming ebitda positive during the 2003 ﬁnancial year. goodwill amortisation in respect of subsidiaries and businesses acquired since 1 april 1998, when bt adopted financial reporting standard no. at&t has taken full ownership of bt’s interest in the canadian joint venture and in at&t canada, and has now assumed full responsibility for all future obligations of the joint venture. bt is entitled to receive additional payments from an earn-out arrangement based on e-peopleserve’s revenues from customers other than bt and accenture over the ﬁve years to 2007. these additional earn-out payments will total between £27 million and approximately £167 million. under these arrangements, telereal is responsible for providing accommodation and estate management services to bt. this gave a full dividend for the year of 6.5 pence per share, amounting to £560 million. there will be offsetting higher interest payments in future years as a result of restructuring the swaps. these proceeds included £2,380 million from the property sale and leaseback transaction completed in december 2001, described above. the buyback programme will be funded from cash generated over and above that required to meet our net debt target of around £7 billion in the 2007 ﬁnancial year, after paying dividends and taking into account acquisitions or disposals. the group’s foreign currency borrowings, which totalled £9.4 billion at 31 march 2004, are used to ﬁnance its operations. in certain instances we rely on other operators to measure the trafﬁc ﬂows interconnecting with our networks. we regularly review these asset lives and change them when necessary to reﬂect current thinking on their remaining lives in light of technological change, prospective economic utilisation and physical condition of the assets concerned. we enter into long term customer contracts which can extend over a number of ﬁnancial years. cash ﬂow information under the us gaap presentation is also shown further in this document. in november 2002 the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on eitf 00-21 ‘‘revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables’’. we also hold the queen’s award for enterprise in recognition of our contribution to sustainable development. in addition, social, ethical and environmental matters have been incorporated into the directors’ induction programme. we have important relationships with a wide range of stakeholders, including employees, customers and suppliers. we also employ a number of csr experts who investigate long-term societal trends, identify potential issues that might affect the business and support bt’s commercial activities. a variety of new products and network services with mixed-ability appeal will be launched during the 2005 ﬁnancial year. the focus of our community programmes is on big issues where better communication can make a real difference to society. for example, more than 9,500 schools and over two million young people have taken part in the bt education programme – a drama-based campaign helping children to improve their communication skills. this activity is supported by our volunteering programme which, at 31 march 2004, had 3,000 registered volunteers working with schools. prior to his retirement in may 2001, clayton brendish was executive deputy chairman of cmg having joined the board when it acquired admiral. aged 56. carl g symon b,c carl symon was appointed to the board on 14 january 2002. he retired from ibm in may 2001 after a 32-year career, during which he held senior executive positions in the usa, canada, latin america, asia and europe, including chairman and chief executive ofﬁcer of ibm uk. a us national, he is aged 58. maarten van den bergh b,c,d,f maarten van den bergh was appointed to the board on 1 september 2000. he chairs the pension scheme performance review group.heis chairman of lloyds tsb group and a non-executive director of royal dutch petroleum company and british airways. at 14 may 2004, 0.2 million treasury shares had been transferred to meet the company’s obligations under its employee share plans. it is bt’s policy that the board will comprise a majority of independent non- executive directors. additionally, it meets on an ad hoc basis to consider matters which are time critical. guidelines are in place concerning the content, presentation and delivery of papers for each board meeting, so that the directors have enough information to be properly briefed sufﬁciently far ahead of each board meeting and at other appropriate times. each committee has written terms of reference, which are available on the company’s website. the other members are maarten van den bergh, clay brendish, lou hughes, john nelson and carl symon. as a result of regulatory or similar requirements, it may be necessary to employ the company’s external auditors for certain non-audit work. it reviews the arrangements for dealing, in conﬁdence, with complaints from employees about accounting or ﬁnancial management impropriety, fraud, poor business practices and other matters. in practice, these documents are being sent to shareholders more than 20 working days before the agm. a conﬁdential helpline and e-mail facility are also available to employees who have questions about the application of these principles. this policy continues and appropriate arrangements are in place to implement it throughout the group. as a result, it covers activities which form part of normal relationships between bt, individual politicians and the principal political parties. the pension funds’ assets can only be used in accordance with their respective rules and for no other purpose. there were no changes in bt’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting that occurred during the year ended 31 march 2004 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, bt’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting. towers perrin (hr consultants); ben verwaayen, chief executive; ian livingston, group finance director; alex wilson, group hr director and larry stone, company secretary, provided advice that materially assisted the committee in relation to the 2004 ﬁnancial year. awards for the senior management team are equivalent in value to 50% of gross annual bonus. generally, awards vest and options become exercisable only if a predetermined performance target has been achieved. options granted will be exercisable in three years, subject to the performance target being met. for these options to become exercisable, there must be a 35% compound annual growth in bt’s earnings per share over three years (equivalent to 22 pence per share at the end of the 2005 ﬁnancial year). performance will again be against earnings per share, free cash ﬂow and customer satisfaction measures. should the executive die in service, a lump sum equal to four times annual salary is payable together with a spouse’s pension of two-thirds of the executive’s anticipated pension at normal retirement age. additionally, a lump sum equal to four times annual salary is payable on death in service. pension provision for all executives is based on salary alone – bonuses, other elements of pay and long-term incentives are excluded. further details of appointment arrangements for non-executive directors are set out on page 53 in the section dealing with corporate governance issues. a green 19 november
