A separate annual review and summary ﬁnancial statement for the year ended 31 March 2004 has been issued to all shareholders. Earnings per share, before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, grew by 19% to 16.9 pence – almost doubling in two years. Getting things right for customers the ﬁrst time keeps them loyal, contributes to cost effectiveness, and boosts our reputation. In April 2004, we announced a roll-out plan that will bring broadband to 99.6% of the UK’s homes and businesses. This growth has been achieved through broadband and the provision of tailored managed services to UK wholesale customers. BT IPStream Home 1000 is a self-install product for residential customers who want greater bandwidth than the standard 512Kbit/s available at present. Immediate price cuts should ensure that there is sustainable demand prior to launch and help potential customers plan ahead with conﬁdence. & During the ﬁnancial year, BT Business Broadband joined forces with a number of companies to enhance its networking and value-added services. & During the year, we established our position as a major UK provider of public wireless broadband (Wi-Fi) services. Remote monitoring enables the control of electronic devices over long distances, helping businesses to manage their assets and risks. Achieve competitive advantage through cost leadership Our focus on continued operational efﬁciencies helped reduce overall group operating costs before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items by £348 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. This new proposition combines BT’s extensive experience in the provision of corporate data networks and hosting with our professional services capability. This was driven by customers making use of alternatives such as mobile calls, e-mail, instant messaging, corporate IPVPNs and VOIP. We also continued to offer space in our payphone kiosks for mobile antennas, Wi-Fi hotspots and CCTV (closed-circuit television). However, we achieved a 1% increase in our UK external revenues (excluding the impact of mobile termination rate cuts). Shares and pensions Since privatisation, we have been committed to providing our employees with a stake in the company. This ensures that key messages are available for everyone, with additional information sourced on an ‘‘as needs’’ basis. Regulatory conditions Under the new framework, based on 2003 EU Directives, providers are no longer required to obtain licences before offering telecommunications services. In some cases, additional obligations relating to, for example, price control and regulatory accounting have also been, or will be, imposed. In addition, where companies infringe UK or EC competition law, company directors can be disqualiﬁed from acting as such for a maximum period of 15 years. The current network charge control period began on 1 October 2001 and will last for four years from that date. Furthermore, the wholesale ISDN2 business and ISDN30 products have to be provided in accordance with a functional speciﬁcation deﬁned by Ofcom. However, payments to mobile operators have reduced by exactly the same amount, leaving a neutral effect on proﬁts. The company has concluded that it would not be appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such potential claim. However, this growth was more than offset by a 6% decline in turnover from the group’s traditional businesses. In total, these effects reduced group operating proﬁts by over £400 million, although this was compensated for at the proﬁt before tax level by a corresponding improvement in our share of the operating proﬁts of associates and joint ventures and net interest payable. As a result, BT Group’s total originating measured call volumes declined by 2% in the 2004 ﬁnancial year (2003 – 13% increase). External turnover is derived from providing wholesale products and solutions to other operators interconnecting with BT’s UK ﬁxed network, including mmO 2 since the demerger. Accordingly it is based on operating costs excluding payments to other network operators and depreciation, plus capital expenditure. The product portfolio covers a number of key ICT related areas including IP infrastructure, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), outsourcing and system integration. Goodwill amortisation in respect of subsidiaries and businesses acquired since 1 April 1998, when BT adopted Financial Reporting Standard No. BT completed the sale of its 18% interest in Airtel, a major Spanish wireless operator, to Vodafone for £1,084 million on 29 June 2001. We also received the second tranche of BSkyB shares with a similar value in November 2002, and they were sold at that time. The group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with UK Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No. We also employ a number of CSR experts who investigate long-term societal trends, identify potential issues that might affect the business and support BT’s commercial activities. A variety of new products and network services with mixed-ability appeal will be launched during the 2005 ﬁnancial year. The focus of our community programmes is on big issues where better communication can make a real difference to society. For example, more than 9,500 schools and over two million young people have taken part in the BT Education Programme – a drama-based campaign helping children to improve their communication skills. He joined Lucent in September 1997 as executive vice president international and became chief operating ofﬁcer the following month. Prior to his retirement in May 2001, Clayton Brendish was executive deputy chairman of CMG having joined the board when it acquired Admiral. At 14 May 2004, 0.2 million treasury shares had been transferred to meet the company’s obligations under its employee share plans. As a result of regulatory or similar requirements, it may be necessary to employ the company’s external auditors for certain non-audit work. It reviews the arrangements for dealing, in conﬁdence, with complaints from employees about accounting or ﬁnancial management impropriety, fraud, poor business practices and other matters. Risk assessment and evaluation takes place as an integral part of the group’s annual strategic planning cycle. A conﬁdential helpline and e-mail facility are also available to employees who have questions about the application of these principles. As a result, it covers activities which form part of normal relationships between BT, individual politicians and the principal political parties. The pension funds’ assets can only be used in accordance with their respective rules and for no other purpose. Pension provision for all executives is based on salary alone – bonuses, other elements of pay and long-term incentives are excluded. Further details of appointment arrangements for non-executive directors are set out on page 53 in the section dealing with corporate governance issues.

BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 126 United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (k) Deferred taxation Under UK GAAP, provision is made for deferred tax in so far as a liability or asset arose as a result of transactions that had occurred by the balance sheet date and give rise to an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future. US GAAP requires that an entity assess whether impairment has occurred based on the undiscounted future cash ﬂows. Securities classiﬁed as available-for-sale would be stated at fair values, with unrealised gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, reported in shareholders’ equity.
