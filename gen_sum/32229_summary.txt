financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. such assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheet. investments cease to be classified as held-for-sale when they are no longer controlled by the group. the fair values of such financial assets are derived from quoted market prices in active markets. consolidated funds represent seed capital investments where the group has held its position for a period greater than one year and/or its interest represents a controlling stake in the fund in accordance with ifrs 10. consolidated fund assets and liabilities are presented line by line after intercompany eliminations. such hedges are expected to be effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. 31 march 2017 £’000 31 march 2016 £’000 derivatives not designated as hedging instruments foreign exchange forward
