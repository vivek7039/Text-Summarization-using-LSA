We believe there is an alignment of interest between the investment managers we recruit, their focus on delivering superior returns and the interests of professional and institutional clients who are seeking differentiated investment products. In this context our reducing levels of net outflows provide grounds for encouragement. George Godber was able to join us in April and be reunited with Georgina as co-manager on the fund and momentum has continued to be strong with assets at the end of May over £256m. Strategic Report Polar Capital Holdings plc 06 Market Background ‘Markets climb a wall of worry’ goes the old adage and surely that has never been truer than last year. Earnings at many companies have thus proved remarkably resilient in the face of all the political drama and with many corporates awash with cash, corporate takeover activity has continued at a high level. I am looking forward to welcoming Gavin Rochussen on board as our new Chief Executive in July. Outlook Whilst political uncertainty and market-volatility appear to be our constant travelling companions these days, we enter the new fiscal year with a good degree of momentum in terms of fund performance, fund flows and asset growth. Tom Bartlam Chairman 26 June 2017 Strategic Report Polar Capital Holdings plc 08 Chief Executive’s Report For the year ended 31 March 2017 Tim Woolley Chief Executive Officer and Founder Our Chairman referred in his Statement to the fact that last year was a disappointing year for active managers and that indeed many of our funds failed to beat their benchmarks.

Whilst my involvement in the day-to-day operations of Polar is coming to an end I am very much looking forward to my continued association with the Company as non-executive Board member and major shareholder. This year there was an exceptional third material factor, the devaluation of Sterling. For the year ending 31 March 2017 bonuses amounting to £1.7m have been deferred over a period of 3 years. Further details are provided in the Remuneration Report on pages 27 to 33 and Note 3.5. As at 31 March 2017 three sets of preference shares have the ability to call for a conversion.

When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets, liabilities, third-party interest and other components of equity, while any resultant gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Net cashflows on initial consolidation or deconsolidation are presented as investing activities within the consolidated cashflow statement. All exchange differences are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss within operating costs. Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the accounting period. Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets at each reporting date is determined by reference to quoted market prices or dealer price quotation (bid price for long positions and ask price for short positions), without any deduction for transaction costs. 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value. The restatements have been made to each of the affected financial statement line items for prior periods, as follows: Impact on equity (increase/ (decrease) in equity): 31 March 2016 £’000 1 April 2015 £’000 Investment securities 10,065 8,211 Assets held for sale (6,835) (6,967) Trade and other receivables 41 33 Cash 100 229 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (3,249) (1,379) Accruals (22) (17) Net impact on equity 100 110 Impact on consolidated statement of profit or loss (increase/ (decrease) in profit): 31 March 2016 £’000 Revenue (70) Other income (481) Operating costs before share-based payments (65) Net impact on profit or loss (616) Attributable to: Equity holders of the parent (616) Third-party interests – Impact on consolidated statement of other comprehensive income (increase/ (decrease) in other comprehensive income): 31 March 2016 £’000 1 April 2015 £’000 Exchange differences on translation of foreign operations 605 581 Impact on earnings per share (EPS) (increase/(decrease) in EPS): 31 March 2016 pence Basic EPS (0.7)p Adjusted basic EPS (Non-GAAP measure) (1.7)p Diluted EPS (0.6)p Adjusted diluted EPS (Non-GAAP measure) (1.6)p Strategic Report Overview Governance Financial Statements 45 Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2017 Section 3: Detailed Information on Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive Income Items This section provides additional information about individual line items in the statement of profit or loss and statement of comprehensive income, including the relevant accounting policies.

At 31 March 2017 three sets of preference share have the right to call for conversion. (b) Group equity incentive plans As part of an ongoing program to retain and incentivise employees, the Group issues share options under the following schemes: (i) Save as you Earn scheme Share options in Polar Capital Holdings plc are granted to employees under a HMRC tax-advantaged Save as You Earn scheme. (ii) Company share option scheme Share options in Polar Capital Holdings plc are granted to employees under a HMRC tax-advantaged arrangement up to a value at the date of grant of £30,000. Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset over its expected useful economic life. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that the Group considers them to be recoverable; which is determined by reference to estimates that future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value (a) Seed capital investments The Group ordinarily provides seed capital in order to provide initial scale and facilitate marketing of new funds to third-party investors. Investments cease to be classified as held-for-sale when they are no longer controlled by the Group. The fair values of such financial assets are derived from quoted market prices in active markets. Consolidated funds represent seed capital investments where the Group has held its position for a period greater than one year and/or its interest represents a controlling stake in the fund in accordance with IFRS 10. Such hedges are expected to be effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. 31 March 2017 £’000 31 March 2016 £’000 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments Foreign exchange forward contracts 56 86 Securities – short positions and futures 348 1,982 Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges Foreign exchange forward contracts 946 898 Other financial liabilities 1,350 2,966 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments reflect the changes in fair values of foreign currency exchange forward contracts and short positions of securities that are not designated in hedge relationships, but are, nevertheless intended to reduce the level of foreign currency and price risk, respectively, on the Group’s seed investments as described in Note 4.3c. The maturity dates for all financial liabilities fall within either one year or are repayable on demand. The Group holds financial assets at fair value through profit or loss consisting of seed investments in funds that it manages as well as investment securities held by consolidated funds, which are sensitive to movements in market equity prices. The Group’s cash and short-term deposits earn nominal amounts of interest at a floating rate and any change in market interest rates would result in negligible change to profit before tax. The Group also holds assets at FVTPL consisting of investments in its own funds. These structured entities typically consist of unitised vehicles such as open-ended Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) funds, closed-ended investment trusts and alternative funds which entitle investors to a percentage of the vehicle’s net asset value.
