Sir David Howard Chairman 2017 has been another year of significant transformation for the Group and we have made good progress against our articulated strategy. He has led from the front and carried us all with him, embodying our theme of ‘One Charles Stanley’. This has been delivered without recourse to a restructuring charge and the precautionary capital raised from shareholders in April 2015 remains intact. A strong cost control culture was evident across all units and each of our four client-facing divisions delivered positive underlying momentum. Delivery will ensure that all our stakeholders are appropriately served and we look forward to the new financial year with growing confidence. Broadly defi ned, wealth management includes our core capability for private clients, Investment Management Services; Asset Management Services, where our investment specialists manage pooled vehicles and funds; Financial Planning, where clients are advised on how they should plan their fi nancial arrangements and deploy their investments; and Charles Stanley Direct, which gives clients the ability to access our execution-only services online without the need for direct personal contact.

Investments can be made online or with telephone support, in a wide range of funds, shares, gilts and bonds. Definition Reported operating profit or loss (as shown on page 20) divided by capital employed (total assets less current liabilities). Moreover, together they offer a set of complementary services which will support our vision to become the UK’s leading wealth manager by 2020. This premium service creates deep bonds of trust with clients and typically leads to discretionary mandates generating strong revenue yields. Intermediary sales The Retail Distribution Review in 2013 has meant many independent financial advisers are now semi-tied to an investment manager. New technology There has been a flurry of fintech start-ups launching highly-scalable automated-advice solutions, with established wealth management players also beginning to enter the market. We also believe the effect of our differentiated proposition will be a faster growth in funds versus other firms. This should in turn mean, that because we have a predominantly fixed cost base, our margins will increase. Firstly, our remuneration model has changed from one that was mostly revenue-based to be more centred on profit. Finally, we have integrated a Client Relationship Management system which allows us to analyse the success of our sales campaigns and allocate shareholder capital more effectively. Whilst we still have a long way to travel in terms of improving top line growth, productivity and operating efficiency, good progress has been achieved during 2017 across all divisions. Costs have also been addressed so this activity’s contribution is expected to increase significantly in the coming financial year. Looking forward, we see further opportunity to reduce Support Functions operating costs by reviewing process flows and increasing straight through processing. Conversely, we expect to see continued cost pressure in a number of areas including Market data, IT and regulation. To achieve our financial goals, a series of risk appetite limits have been set around operating margin, cash balances, regulatory capital and dividend cover. Charles Stanley does not undertake any proprietary trading other than that arising from incidental dealing errors and therefore takes minimal market risks. Careful monitoring of investment decision-making against the risk profile helps ensure that we achieve appropriate and suitable outcomes for our clients. All employees are able to benefit from life assurance, permanent health insurance and an above-market employer contribution towards their pension. Environment In 2016 the Group consolidated its London estate which comprised five properties into a single Head Office providing many opportunities to reduce environmental impact. David has extensive experience within the financial services sector, qualifying as an accountant at Coopers & Lybrand before joining Close Brothers Group plc in 1986. Prior to this he spent over five years as the Chief Executive of Evercore Pan Asset Capital Management, which was acquired by Charles Stanley in December 2013. A rolling three-year plan is maintained to ensure all critical areas of the business are covered over this period. It is recognised that, given their knowledge of the business, there are often advantages in using KPMG to provide certain non-audit services. These intangible assets are amortised over their useful life, generally a period of ten years, which the Committee considers appropriate. Please note that the section ‘Implementation of policy’ has been written to reflect current salaries and other relevant changes. For example, when determining any base salary increases for Executive Directors, the Committee reviews the average Group-wide increase, as well as remuneration within similar organisations (with specific note taken of businesses of similar size or complexity), using benchmark data provided by professional remuneration experts. Any base salary increases will normally take effect at the time of general workforce amendments, this is typically from 1 October. Any base salary increases will normally take effect at the time of general workforce amendments, this is typically from 1 October. Shareholding guidelines To encourage share ownership by the Executive Directors and ensure their interests are aligned with investors. Executive Directors are able to participate in all- employee share plans on the same terms as other Group employees. Free shares worth up to £3,000 (or such amount permitted by the HMRC approved limit) can also be granted each year. Shareholding guidelines To encourage share ownership by the Executive Directors and ensure their interests are aligned with investors. Executive Directors are able to participate in all- employee share plans on the same terms as other Group employees. Free shares worth up to £3,000 (or such amount permitted by the HMRC approved limit) can also be granted each year. Non-executive Directors The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts, but instead have detailed job descriptions covering each aspect of their role (for example, Committee Chairmanships or specific roles or duties) and Letters of Appointment for an initial three-year term, subject to annual re-election by the Company’s shareholders. Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the relevant report going forward as required by Regulations. For the Non-executive Directors amounts reported relate to expenses such as travel and accommodation expenditure incurred on Group business. In common with similar schemes, the exercise of options under this scheme is not subject to any performance conditions. Share capital As at 31 March 2017, 50,689,206 fully paid ordinary shares of 25 pence each were in issue and listed on the London Stock Exchange. Non-current assets held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 2.16 Property, plant and equipment Freehold premises are measured at fair value, based on periodic valuations by external independent valuers, less subsequent depreciation for buildings. The Group determines a CGU’s recoverable amount initially by estimating fair value less costs to sell, based on recent public transactions for similar businesses. It was concluded that no other impairments to the carrying value of goodwill or intangible assets are required. No new information has become available that would require a change in the valuation of any further unlisted investments. Options are awarded annually under the plan and vest over a period of three years based on specific performance targets. Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the options are not taken into account in measuring fair value. This is a separate, trustee-administered fund holding the Plan assets to meet long-term pension liabilities of its scheme members. This would detrimentally impact the balance sheet position and may give rise to increased charges in future income statements. A one-off additional amount of £1.4 million was included within 2016 wages and salaries from continuing operations in the above table. Deferred tax balances have therefore been calculated based on these reduced rates where timing differences are forecast to unwind in future years. The Group does not undertake any proprietary trading other than in respect of its own equity holdings and positions arising from incidental dealing errors. Equity price movements in respect of the Group’s client holdings have a direct impact on investment management fees received. Shares are only delivered free of payment to a client or their agent once settlement has been achieved and there is no outstanding debit balance on the account. On occasion, delivery of stock to a recognised professional counterparty may take place free of payment via an electronic settlement system, but only on prior confirmation from their custodian that the required funds in settlement will be transferred directly to the Group’s bank account. If one or more significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3. Recognised techniques are used to value the financial instruments grouped under Level 3, including discounted future cash flow and dividend yield valuation methods. Commitments At 31 March 2017, capital expenditure authorised and contracted for, but not included in the financial statements, amounted to £nil (2016: £nil).
