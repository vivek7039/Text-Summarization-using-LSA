report board changes david pusinelli has decided not to put his name forward for re-election as a non-executive director at the forthcoming annual general meeting. he has led from the front and carried us all with him, embodying our theme of ‘one charles stanley’. this has been delivered without recourse to a restructuring charge and the precautionary capital raised from shareholders in april 2015 remains intact. a strong cost control culture was evident across all units and each of our four client-facing divisions delivered positive underlying momentum. delivery will ensure that all our stakeholders are appropriately served and we look forward to the new financial year with growing confidence. broadly defi ned, wealth management includes our core capability for private clients, investment management services; asset management services, where our investment specialists manage pooled vehicles and funds; financial planning, where clients are advised on how they should plan their fi nancial arrangements and deploy their investments; and charles stanley direct, which gives clients the ability to access our execution-only services online without the need for direct

investment management services investment management services offers a comprehensive personalised service to direct private clients: managing discretionary portfolios, providing investment advice and

capital employed (%) definition reported profit after tax dvided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares. this will open up new growth opportunities for both our investment management services and financial planning divisions. this premium service creates deep bonds of trust with clients and typically leads to discretionary mandates generating strong revenue yields. intermediary sales the retail distribution review in 2013 has meant many independent financial advisers are now semi-tied to an investment manager. new technology there has been a flurry of fintech start-ups launching highly-scalable automated-advice solutions, with established wealth management players also beginning to enter the market. we also believe the effect of our differentiated proposition will be a faster growth in funds versus other firms. this should in turn mean, that because we have a predominantly fixed cost base, our margins will increase. • the second key decision is to build a holistic wealth offering around our core investment management business. firstly, our remuneration model has changed from one that was mostly revenue-based to be more centred on profit. finally, we have integrated a client relationship management system which allows us to analyse the success of our sales campaigns and allocate shareholder capital more effectively. while it already applies to new clients, existing clients are being phased on to the new rates, with a significant proportion expected to move in financial year 2018. implementation milestones achieved implementation milestones

efficiency. both of these will be supported by a greater online functionality where our clients want it. whilst we still have a long way to travel in terms of improving top line growth, productivity and operating efficiency, good progress has been achieved during 2017 across all divisions. these tables show the results of the core business, the held for sale activities (charles stanley securities and charles stanley financial solutions limited, both of which were disposed of by 1 april 2016, and ebs management plc, the sale of which was completed on 31 may 2017) and various adjusting items,

activities so as to report a more appropriate year-on-year comparison. outlook the twin challenges faced by the division are to increase revenues through fuma inflows, repricing and service upselling, whilst improving overall productivity levels which are below top industry standards, most notably in relation to fuma per cf30 and staff costs ratios. we will look to market the funds more widely as they gain in scale and traction. 29 9 22 40 investment account jisa (0%) isa charles stanley investment choices sipp 2016 (%) 33 1 10 17 38 2017 (%) investment account jisa isa charles stanley

white label trading services provided to the fidelity network which accounted for £0.9 million of revenue in that year. costs have also been addressed so this activity’s contribution is expected to increase significantly in the coming financial year. looking forward, we see further opportunity to reduce support functions operating costs by reviewing process flows and increasing straight through processing. conversely, we expect to see continued cost pressure in a number of areas including market data, it and regulation. this amortisation charge has been excluded from the core business profit since it is a significant non-cash item. to achieve our financial goals, a series of risk appetite limits have been set around operating margin, cash balances, regulatory capital and dividend cover. ➡ credit and counterparty risk the potential failure of clients or counterparties to fulfil their contractual obligations. charles stanley does not undertake any proprietary trading other than that arising from incidental dealing errors and therefore takes minimal market risks. limited foreign currency is held only to facilitate settlement and dealing activity on behalf of clients. ➡ liquidity risk the risk that the group, although solvent, either does not have available sufficient financial resources to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can only secure such resources at excessive cost. although charles stanley has not experienced any significant issues in relation to its own cyber security arrangements, the cyber security risk has increased due to the number of high profile attacks suffered by other firms in recent months. careful monitoring of investment decision-making against the risk profile helps ensure that we achieve appropriate and suitable outcomes for our clients. we review our approaches on a regular basis and adhere to high level principles for procurement. all employees are able to benefit from life assurance, permanent health insurance and an above-market employer contribution towards their pension. each week a group of london-based employees assists pupils at the school, by helping them with their reading. environment in 2016 the group consolidated its london estate which comprised five properties into a single head office providing many opportunities to reduce environmental impact. the new london office benefits from an innovative fit-out that includes energy-efficient measures such as led lighting. governance / board of directors and executive committee charles stanley annual report and accounts 2017 charles-stanley.co.uk 49

all critical areas of the business are covered over this period. the committee ensures that all management actions arising are tracked to completion on a timely basis. it is recognised that, given their knowledge of the business, there are often advantages in using kpmg to provide certain non-audit services. these intangible assets are amortised over their useful life, generally a period of ten years, which the committee considers appropriate. further detailed information, as required by the regulations, is set out immediately following this annual statement. please note that the section ‘implementation of policy’ has been written to reflect current salaries and other relevant changes. for example, when determining any base salary increases for executive directors, the committee

professional remuneration experts. any base salary increases will normally take effect at the time of general workforce amendments, this is typically from 1 october. gary teper was set a key objective

under constant review, responding to changing needs as they are identified. non-current assets held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. the customer relationships have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. computer software costs recognised as assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their useful lives (three years). 2.16 property, plant and equipment freehold premises are measured at fair value, based on periodic valuations by external independent valuers, less subsequent depreciation for buildings. loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. subsequent to initial recognition, these liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. the group determines a cgu’s recoverable amount initially by estimating fair value less costs to sell, based on recent public transactions for

through its normal operations the group is exposed to a number of risks. the group does not undertake any proprietary trading other than in respect of its own equity holdings and positions arising from incidental dealing errors. positions are held in a variety of currencies, principally the us dollar, to support clients’ dealing activities. equity price movements in respect of the group’s client holdings have a direct impact on investment management fees received. the group is exposed to currency risk for settlement of non-gbp trade suppliers and miscellaneous income streams. shares are only delivered free of payment to a client or their agent once settlement has been achieved and there is no outstanding debit balance on the account. on occasion, delivery of stock to a recognised professional counterparty may take place free of payment via an electronic settlement system, but only on prior confirmation from their custodian that the required funds in settlement will be transferred directly to the group’s bank account. if one or more significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. recognised techniques are used to value the financial instruments grouped under level 3, including discounted future cash flow and dividend yield valuation methods. the group’s objective is to generate fees from managing assets on behalf of third parties. 30. commitments at 31 march 2017, capital expenditure authorised and contracted for, but not included in the financial statements, amounted to £nil (2016: £nil). charles
