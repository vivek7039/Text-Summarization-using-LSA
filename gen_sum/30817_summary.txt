exchange contracts disclosed as fair value through profit and loss are substantially contracts not designated in a formal hedging relationship and are used to hedge foreign currency flows through the bba aviation plc company bank accounts to ensure that the group is not exposed to foreign exchange risk through the management of its international cash management structure. the fair value of derivative financial instruments is subsequently calculated using discounted cash flow techniques or other appropriate pricing models. all valuation techniques take into account assumptions based upon available market data at the balance sheet date. the maturity of derivative financial instruments is as follows: 2017 2016 asset fair value $m liability fair value $m asset fair value $m liability

aviation insurances (vermont) inc. these companies are wholly owned subsidiaries of the group and premiums paid are held to meet future claims. the group does not undertake speculative transactions for which there is no underlying financial exposure. this department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with group subsidiary companies. the group manages its transactional foreign currency risk by hedging significant currency exposures in accordance with foreign exchange policies that our subsidiaries have in place which have been pre-agreed between group treasury and the subsidiary. transaction currency risk is managed through the use of spot and forward foreign exchange contracts. all committed exposures are fully hedged 100% and where significant foreign currency exposures exist then generally a percentage of the projected foreign currency flows are covered, depending on the certainty of these cash flows. 132 consolidated financial statements
