Furthermore, condensate and LPG prices were also higher in 2017 by comparison with the previous year. The total number of safe man- hours now stands at over 1,444,850 man-hours without a Lost Time Incident. Work is also planned to upgrade the gas processing facilities, pipeline network and other infrastructure. These sands are of Tournasian age (“T-Sands”) and may offer additional gas potential. The Group also maintains a significant proportion of its cash holdings in international banks outside Ukraine. In addition, drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that commercially productive reservoirs will not be discovered. The Group may not be able to develop, find or acquire reserves at acceptable costs. The Group has established an ongoing relationship with such external technical consultants to ensure that technical management and planning is of a high quality in respect of all development activities on the Group’s fields. Financial risks Restrictions on cash flow and liquidity There is a risk that insufficient funds are available to meet the Group’s development obligations to commercialise the Group’s oil and gas assets. REGAL PETROLEUM PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 14 Regal Petroluem AR2017.indd 14 08/05/2018 16:38:06 26054.02 8 May 2018 2:57 PM Proof 5 RISK MITIGATION Ensuring appropriate business practices The Group operates in Ukraine, an emerging market, where certain inappropriate business practices may, from time to time occur, such as corrupt business practices, bribery, appropriation of property and fraud, all of which can lead to financial loss. In addition, office and site protection is maintained to protect the Group’s assets. A prolonged period of low gas, condensate and LPG prices may impact the Group’s ability to maintain its long-term investment programme with a consequent effect on growth rate, which in turn may impact the share price or any shareholder returns. During 2010, this manifested itself in the form of a Ministry Order instructing the Group to suspend all operations and production from its MEX-GOL and SV production licences, which was not resolved until mid-2011. In addition, these licences carry ongoing compliance obligations, which if not met, may lead to the loss of a licence. The Group ensures compliance with commitments and regulations relating to its production licences through Group procedures and controls or, where this is not immediately feasible for practical or logistical considerations, seeks to enter into dialogue with the relevant Government bodies with a view to agreeing a reasonable time frame for achieving compliance or an alternative, mutually agreeable course of action.

All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first opportunity following their appointment. The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. After considering internal and external factors, including results from recent drilling activity, current production levels and the macroeconomic environment in Ukraine, management concluded that there were no impairment triggers in respect of either of the Group’s cash generating units. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

The ongoing political and economic instability in Ukraine, which commenced in late 2013, has led to a deterioration of Ukrainian State finances, volatility of financial markets, illiquidity on capital markets, higher inflation and a depreciation of the national currency against major foreign currencies and has continued in 2017, though to a lesser extent as compared to 2014–2016. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. These improvements relate to the following areas:  Amendment to IAS 12, ‘Income taxes’, regarding recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses  Amendment to IAS 7, ‘Cash flow statements’, regarding the Disclosure initiative  Annual improvements 2014–2016 IFRS 12, ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’ The adoption of these amendments had no significant impact on these financial statements. The Group has decided not to adopt IFRS 9 until it becomes mandatory on 1 January 2018. 37 GOVERNANCE www.regalpetroleum.com STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIALS Regal Petroluem AR2017.indd 37 08/05/2018 16:38:13 26054.02 8 May 2018 2:57 PM Proof 5 NOTES forming part of the financial statements continued 2.

Some of the commitments may be covered by the exception for short-term and low-value leases and some commitments may relate to arrangements that will not qualify as leases under IFRS 16. There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions. The designation of inter-company monetary balances as part of the net investment in a foreign operation is reassessed when management’s expectations and intentions on settlement change due to a change in circumstances. When necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform with the Group’s accounting policies. All licence acquisition, exploration and evaluation costs are initially capitalised as intangible assets in cost centres by field or by exploration area, as appropriate, pending determination of commerciality of the relevant property. Net proceeds from any disposal of an exploration asset are initially credited against the previously capitalised costs. Net proceeds from any disposal of development/producing assets are credited against the previously capitalised cost. In certain circumstances, fields within a single development area may be combined for depletion purposes. Impairment At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of development and producing assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. This includes exploration and appraisal costs capitalised which are assessed for impairment in accordance with IFRS 6. The principal rates of exchange used for translating foreign currency balances at 31 December 2017 were $1:UAH28.1 (2016: $1:UAH27.2), $1:£0.7 (2016: $1:£0.8), $1:€0.8 (2016: $1:€0.9). Accounting Policies continued Pensions The Group contributes to a local government pension scheme in Ukraine and defined benefit plans. Defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. If collection is expected in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. (a) Recoverability of Development and Production Assets in Ukraine According to the Group’s accounting policies, costs capitalised as assets are assessed for impairment at each balance sheet date if impairment indicators exist. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions continued (b) Recoverability of inter-company loans receivable by the Company from a subsidiary The Company has certain inter-company loans receivable from a subsidiary, which are eliminated on consolidation. The segment results as presented represent operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and impairment of non-current assets. Smart Energy has oil and gas operations in Ukraine and is part of the PJSC Smart-Holding Group, which is ultimately controlled by Mr Vadim Novinskiy, who through an indirect 54% majority shareholding, ultimately controls the Group. Bruce Burrows was appointed as Non-Executive Director in August 2017, and is paid £45,000 per annum. Phil Frank was appointed as Non-Executive Director in October 2017, and is paid £45,000 per annum. Investments and loans to subsidiaries continued Subsidiary undertakings At 31 December 2017, the Company’s subsidiary undertakings, all of which are included in the consolidated financial statements, were: Registered address Country of incorporation Country of operation Principal activity % of shares held Regal Petroleum Corporation Limited 26 New Street, St Helier, Jersey, JE2 3RA Jersey Ukraine Oil & Natural Gas Extraction 100% Regal Petroleum Corporation (Ukraine) Limited 162 Shevchenko Str., Yakhnyky Village, Lokhvytsya District, Poltava Region, 37212 Ukraine Ukraine Service Company 100% Refin Limited 162 Shevchenko Str., Yakhnyky Village, Lokhvytsya District, Poltava Region, 37212 Ukraine Ukraine Service Company 100% LLC Prom-Enerho Produkt 3 Klemanska Str., Kiev, 02081 Ukraine Ukraine Oil & Natural Gas Extraction 100% Regal Petroleum (Jersey) Limited 26 New Street, St Helier, Jersey, JE2 3RA Jersey United Kingdom Holding Company 100% Regal Group Services Limited 16 Old Queen Street, London, SW1H 9HP United Kingdom United Kingdom Service Company 100% The Parent Company, Regal Petroleum plc, holds direct interests in 100% of the share capital of Regal Petroleum (Jersey) Limited and Regal Group Services Limited, with all other companies owned indirectly by the Parent Company. All trade receivables, except those provided for, are considered to be of high credit quality. The Directors consider it appropriate to recognise deferred tax assets resulting from accumulated tax losses at 31 December 2017 to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient future taxable profits. Losses accumulated in a Ukrainian subsidiary service company of UAH3,130,112,486 ($111,521,999) at 31 December 2017 and UAH2,448,430,023 ($90,046,074) at 31 December 2016 mainly originated as foreign exchange differences on inter- company loans and for which no deferred tax asset was recognised as this subsidiary is not expected to have taxable profits to utilise these losses in the future.
