for caledonia and gave us an overall return of three times the capital invested in 2013. caledonia’s strategy and business model we aim to grow our shareholders’ capital over the long term and to provide an increasing annual dividend, both in real terms. however, we are aware of the portfolio limitations and risks presented by only investing in private equity markets. we therefore currently have half our net assets in listed companies, focusing on long term international compounding equities and income stocks, together with quoted market funds, which give us the balanced exposure that we seek in terms of geography, sectors and liquidity. in particular, we gain access to the us and asian private equity markets via specialist funds operating there. valuations will fluctuate over time, but by being invested in companies that compound their earnings in this way and which are not at risk through excessive gearing, we are confident that our returns over the long term will be at least as good as the market, but with less risk. our ongoing charges ratio for the year was 1.07%, compared with 1.01% in 2016, reflecting slightly higher staff costs. they also provide an excellent way to take advantage of market downturns and ensure we have capital available for private equity fund drawdowns. value 2016 £m invest- ments £m realis- ations £m gains/ losses £m value 2017 £m income £m

accordance with the international private equity and venture capital valuation guidelines. the ongoing charges ratio is calculated on an industry standard basis, comprising published management expenses over monthly average net assets. publicly traded securities investments listed in an active market are valued at their bid price on the reporting date. unlisted companies unlisted company investments are valued by applying an appropriate valuation technique, which makes maximum use of market-based information, is consistent with models generally used by market participants and is applied consistently from period to period, except where a change would result in a better estimation of fair value. open-ended funds, including investment companies with variable capital, typically report regular net asset values, which usually provide a reliable basis to estimate fair value. strategic risks include the appropriate allocation of capital in relation to geographic, sector and

on its behalf by: will wyatt stephen king chief executive finance director the accounting policies and notes on pages 78 to 99 are an integral part of these financial statements. for other financial instruments, such as unlisted securities, valuation techniques are used to estimate fair value. fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on market conditions and information about the financial instrument. the company’s share of net income from limited partnerships is recognised as revenue when received. deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. investment trust companies that have approval as such under section 1159 of the corporation tax act 2010 are not liable for taxation on capital gains. unlisted investments are valued using recognised valuation methodologies, based on the international private equity and venture capital valuation guidelines, which reflect the amount for which an asset could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties on an arm’s length basis. 6919 caledonia ar2017 financials tp.indd 81 31/05/2017 09:59 job name: 68895z caledonia investments report 2017 pdf page: 6919 caledonia ar2017 tp.p81.pdf
