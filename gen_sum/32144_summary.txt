However, we are aware of the portfolio limitations and risks presented by only investing in private equity markets. We therefore currently have half our net assets in listed companies, focusing on long term international compounding equities and income stocks, together with quoted market funds, which give us the balanced exposure that we seek in terms of geography, sectors and liquidity. In particular, we gain access to the US and Asian private equity markets via specialist funds operating there. Valuations will fluctuate over time, but by being invested in companies that compound their earnings in this way and which are not at risk through excessive gearing, we are confident that our returns over the long term will be at least as good as the market, but with less risk. They also provide an excellent way to take advantage of market downturns and ensure we have capital available for private equity fund drawdowns. The Income pool is also below its target, though we do not feel under pressure to rectify this with markets at current high valuations. We will deploy capital into businesses which fit our strategy when they are available at acceptable valuation levels. We also sold our holding in Bowers & Wilkins and a number of smaller legacy assets during the year. The pricing environment remains tough, with local authorities under great pressure to cut spending however, despite this, new bed spaces are being filled at acceptable margins. The programme is anchored by several fund of funds relationships, especially in Asia, which has a nascent private equity market. Rod first came into contact with Caledonia in the early 1980s when British & Commonwealth (‘B&C’) was its largest investment. This proved prescient when B&C sadly went into administration in 1990 following the disastrous purchase of Atlantic Computers. Outlook The valuations of equities, bonds, property and non- conventional assets have been driven to high levels by unusually low interest rates. Markets look to be reaching the final leg of a sustained bull run with valuations now looking stretched. 2 5-40 % of net assets • We manage risk throughout the portfolio, paying particular attention to concentration, volatility, geographical exposure and liquidity. 25-40 % of net assets • We manage risk throughout the portfolio, paying particular attention to concentration, volatility, geographical exposure and liquidity. We have an unconstrained approach, which allows us to look across regions, sectors, size and time horizons.

Internal valuations of investments are conducted in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines. The ongoing charges ratio is calculated on an industry standard basis, comprising published management expenses over monthly average net assets. Publicly traded securities Investments listed in an active market are valued at their bid price on the reporting date. Unlisted companies Unlisted company investments are valued by applying an appropriate valuation technique, which makes maximum use of market-based information, is consistent with models generally used by market participants and is applied consistently from period to period, except where a change would result in a better estimation of fair value. Open-ended funds, including investment companies with variable capital, typically report regular net asset values, which usually provide a reliable basis to estimate fair value. Detailed cash forecasting for six months ahead is updated and reviewed weekly, including the expected drawdown of capital commitments. Caledonia operates across a number of jurisdictions and in an industry that has been subject to increasing regulation.

We take board seats in our unquoted investments and use these to maintain close relationships with managements of those companies.

Such provisions are therefore included in the 2017 directors’ remuneration policy, for which shareholder approval is being sought at this year’s annual general meeting. The directors are able to impose time limits or conditions when giving authorisations if they think this is appropriate. Each board meeting includes a standing agenda item on conflicts of interest to ensure that all directors disclose any new potential conflict situations. The Chairman and other non-executive directors are also available to attend some of these meetings, if requested. An external search consultancy was however used for Mr Stewart’s appointment as a non-executive director in 2015. Executive directors are also eligible to receive other minor benefits and expenses payments (again including payment of any tax thereon). Operation Caledonia operates a performance share scheme under which participants are awarded nil-cost options over the company’s shares.

Executive directors’ remuneration packages are however benchmarked with other senior investment executives, who participate in the same annual bonus and long term incentive plans.

For nil-cost options granted thereafter, shares that vest following the three or five year performance testing become immediately exercisable. Subsequent to his retirement, Mr Ingram exercised further share options at a pre-tax gain of £119,413 in the 2014 financial year. Caledonia’s staff were also awarded maximum bonuses, however their average per capital percentage change was lower due to a variety of factors, such as differing bonus scales and the fact that some members of staff received a higher percentage bonus than the Chief Executive in 2016. As in 2016, we continue to perform procedures over the carrying value of investments listed on recognised stock exchanges.
