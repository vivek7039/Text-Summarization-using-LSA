This powerful combination is important to customer focused businesses that require certainty in value, quality and critically, supply. Accordingly, we are creating development programmes for rising stars and have already put in place various incentive schemes that reward outperformance. This reflects: 1. the economies of scale from higher revenues; 2. an increased proportion of FOB sales (which is less overhead intensive), partially offset by increased sales via online platforms (which is more overhead intensive); and 3. a more efficient operating model as the focus on the Group’s brand portfolio, which has led to an increase in repeat sales and extended product life cycles. As noted above, revenue from online channels www.upgs.com 8 We have made solid operational progress across the business.

Brands The Group introduced its strategy to concentrate on offering branded, mass-market and value–led consumer goods in late 2013. Since then, the Group has seen its brands take an increasingly significant share of sales and this pattern continued in FY 17. Margins Gross margin was 160 bps lower than 2016, influenced by two key factors: firstly FOB sales, which typically generate lower gross margin but require lower overheads to serve, increased from 60.2 % of sales to 67.6 % and secondly, gross margin on landed sales, whilst partially protected by existing hedging contracts, were impacted by cost pressures from the fall in the US$ exchange rate with GBP after the Brexit referendum. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all risk and uncertainties that may arise. Loss of a key customer could have an adverse impact on the Group’s turnover and operating profit. In addition, in-store penetration of the Group‘s brands and products offer some commercial protection against customer loss. Failure to develop or acquire new brands could restrict growth, given the Group’s brand-led strategy. The risk of non-renewal is mitigated by maintaining strong revenues to and good working relationships with licensors. Stock is categorised between ‘free’ and (pre)‘sold’ to ensure that management focus on higher risk items. Legal and regulatory The Group may fail to comply with additional regulations arising as a result of its public status. In addition, the Group maintains a suitable level of credit insurance against its trade receivables book. www.upgs.com 22 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information UP Global Sourcing Holdings plc Area Risk Mitigation Financial risks continued ● liquidity risk; Cash flow requirements are monitored by short and long-term forecasts, with headroom against facility limits and banking covenants assessed regularly.
