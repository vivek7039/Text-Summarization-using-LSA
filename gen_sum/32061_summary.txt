We have many long‑standing relationships with major contractors, housebuilders and property developers, enabling us to capitalise on a range of growth opportunities nationwide. Across end markets… Delivered through our operating divisions… General Piling Offering a variety of ground engineering and foundation solutions on open sites. Highlights I am pleased that in our maiden results as a quoted company Van Elle has reported an 11.8% increase in revenue to £94.1m (2016: £84.2m) and an underlying operating profit of £11.6m (2016: £11.1m), representing a record year and continuing our impressive year‑on‑year profitable growth. Dividend As a quoted company, one of our key ongoing objectives is to create shareholder value. Michael, along with his wife, Joan, founded the business some 33 years ago and their contribution during that time has been invaluable. I would also like to thank Thomas Lindup, who left the Board as Executive Director in March 2017. As a board, we are committed to promoting the highest standards of corporate governance and ensuring effective communication with shareholders. People Van Elle has an outstanding group of employees and we continue to place great importance on their engagement. Our objective is to provide opportunities for development, personal growth and successful careers with the Company. This step is important for the Group as not only does it give us access to equity capital markets as we seek to grow the business, but it has also resulted in enhanced governance and improved discipline, which we implemented in preparation for our IPO. It expects that uncertainty created by the referendum result has potentially caused some projects in certain sectors to be put on hold.

Basis of consolidation Where the Company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. Depreciation on assets under construction does not commence until they are complete and available for use. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Group’s accounting policy for each category is as follows: Fair value through profit or loss The Group does not have any assets held for trading nor does it voluntarily classify any financial assets as being at fair value through profit or loss. Bank overdrafts are shown within loans and borrowings in current liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position. The Group’s accounting policy for each category is as follows: Fair value through profit or loss The Group does not have any liabilities held for trading nor has it designated any financial liabilities as being at fair value through profit or loss. Government grants Government grants are recognised at their fair value in the statement of financial position, within deferred income, when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will be complied with. Options with market-related performance conditions will vest based on total shareholder return against a selected group of quoted market comparators. Useful lives of property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful economic lives based on management’s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically reviewed for appropriateness. The value-in-use calculations described above, together with a sensitivity analysis using reasonable assumptions, indicate ample headroom and therefore do not give rise to impairment concerns. 2017 £’000 2016 £’000 Contract costs incurred plus recognised profits (less losses) to date 59,723 65,586 Retentions withheld by customers 148 126 Advances received 104 431 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 72 VAN ELLE HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 30 April 2017 19.
