• opened new 168,000 sq ft. manufacturing facility at leyland, lancashire, with two tissue converting lines commissioned and a third line expected in fy18. this, along with favourable parent reel pricing dynamics, enabled accrol to minimise the impact of foreign exchange rate volatility on its financial performance through fy17. accrol is well advanced in conversations with customers regarding inflation recovery but they are challenging and will take time to conclude. increasing product prices will also see further moves in sales from brands into own-label within the major multiples as they all seek to re-set their ranges and shopper offering. our relationship with booker, accrol’s largest customer, continues to be strong and we have recently signed a new supply agreement. increased input costs driven by exchange rates have prompted inflation recovery conversations and, subsequently, more tender processes across the industry. • blackburn manufacturing optimisation plan includes spend on machine enhancements, staff training and the introduction of a new rotating shift pattern from may 2017 onwards with commissioning on line 1 completed by april 2017 and line 2 by june 2017. leyland has space for a further 4 lines giving 6 in total. • supply chain optimisation review to ensure the solution takes into consideration future sales growth and exit existing leasehold warehouses where appropriate. • we have also invested further in our blackburn sites to enhance key lines, train staff and implement a new, employee friendly, rotating shift system. trade receivables have increased by £3.4m in line with the sales growth, showing our continued tight control of cash collection. • if prices rise above management expectations this could have a material adverse effect on the group’s ability to achieve strategic objectives. most recently, as chief executive officer at bright blue foods, he helped restructure, transition and re-finance the company with a new investor.
