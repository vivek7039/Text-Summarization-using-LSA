Accrol’s decision to focus on this sector in 2008, has delivered sales CAGR of 15.9% since 2013. Revenues are for current year ended 30 April 2017 but exclude bought in products of £4.4 million Accrol Group Holdings plc / Annual Report and Accounts 3 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report £18.2m investment over 3 years 17.7m products manufactured per week 17 converting lines in total Product range Accrol is able to manufacture toilet rolls, kitchen rolls, facial tissue and AFH products, providing a ‘one stop shop’ solution for customers. With Grocery inflation rising during the year, consumer footfall in the Discount Sector showed no signs of slowing down as shoppers continued to look for ways of offsetting rising household prices and switching to lower cost alternatives. We will continue to source reels from around the globe, taking advantage of new technology and spare capacity. The majority of Private Label retail shelf prices for soft tissue are still at pre-EU referendum levels.

This, along with favourable Parent Reel pricing dynamics, enabled Accrol to minimise the impact of foreign exchange rate volatility on its financial performance through FY17. Accrol is well advanced in conversations with customers regarding inflation recovery but they are challenging and will take time to conclude. Increasing product prices will also see further moves in sales from brands into Own-Label within the Major Multiples as they all seek to re-set their ranges and shopper offering. Our aim of gaining further Own- Label business with the Major Multiples therefore remains a key strategic objective. Our relationship with Booker, Accrol’s largest customer, continues to be strong and we have recently signed a new supply agreement. Increased input costs driven by exchange rates have prompted inflation recovery conversations and, subsequently, more tender processes across the industry. This includes staff training and a new rotating shift pattern that is more employee friendly.

Balance sheet Property, plant and equipment In the previous financial year, we acquired 2 further converting lines at a cost of £3.2m. Trade receivables have increased by £3.4m in line with the sales growth, showing our continued tight control of cash collection. Trade payables have increased £3.3m as we are choosing to take advantage of favourable credit terms on Parent Reels. • If prices rise above management expectations this could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s ability to achieve strategic objectives. • Disruption in critical IT systems could have a negative impact on production and important business processes. • Ensure Group have robust operational policies, procedures, risk assessments and contingencies around fire safety regulations.

IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ is a new standard that has been published and is effective from 1 January 2019 but has not been early adopted by the Group and could have a material impact on the Group financial information. Segment results are measured using adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, gain/(loss) on derivative financial instruments and exceptional items. Customer order books relate to orders for goods awaiting dispatch at the date of acquisition on 14 July 2014. Subsequent to initial recognition, these assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Material lease arrangements do not include any contingent rental conditions, options to purchase or escalation clauses. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within 1 year or less. The line was back up and running within one week with no disruption to customer orders. Amounts charged to the allowance account are generally written-off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash. The foreign currency swaps are designated as fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition.
