Regulation H&T is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct  Authority (FCA) for all consumer credit business. H&T’s listing on AIM provided the Group with access   to new sources of finance. I made an error with the address and they were able to  sort it without hassle. Will certainly be telling all of my friends to buy from these guys.” HandT.co.uk – “They were so helpful. All H&T’s jewellery is professionally cleaned, restored  and valued before being re-distributed for sale at  stores across the country. BUYBACK Increasingly, a younger generation of customers is  seeking the opportunity to raise cash from electronic  items such as phones, tablets, and game consoles. Customers can sell their electronic items to H&T   for cash and buy the item back within 31 days. This product is particularly popular with the younger  generation; 53% of our customers are aged under 35. We have streamlined a number  of key processes making it easier for both  our customers and staff to transact. We have also made significant progress  when developing our omni-channel  approach including improvements to all  customer journeys; simplifying online to  store processes and ensuring all customer  touch points are easily accessible  regardless of the customers browsing  preferences (desktop, tablet or mobile). A customer will be able to  apply for any product H&T offers online  and complete the transaction in store   (or vice versa). In 2017 we saw   a continuation of strong demand for  further borrowing from our existing  customer base. Product development We have made significant progress in  developing a range of loan products  which can help our customers return to  mainstream credit. In comparison,  during 2017 we experienced far more stability allowing us to  focus on developing our proposition. This investment will allow an expansion to the broker  and online channels in respect of pawnbroking during 2018. The Group has invested in store inventories with average  monthly balances being 12% higher during 2017 than 2016. This coupled with control over targeted discounts has resulted  in the significant improvements in gross profits despite margin  pressure as a result of increased cost of goods reflecting   the higher rates on both lending and purchasing activities. There are now more than 2000 high-quality   watches online together with a range of high quality jewellery. • <100% APR loans which are generally provided to customers  who have established a track record of repayment with H&T. We estimate that the weight of fine gold purchased in 2017  increased by approximately 2.1% from 2016 to 2017. Further work will be  completed in 2018 to fully integrate those systems and support  the clicks-to-bricks customer journey.

However, because   the number of shares held is small, there is no entitlement   to share options for non-executives, and there are no cross  directorships between executive and non-executive directors;  the non-executive directors are considered to be independent.

The existing facility with Lloyds Bank plc allowing  for maximum borrowings of £30.0m, subject to covenants,  expires in April 2020. This strong balance sheet position provides a high level  of confidence that the Group will be able to repay all liabilities  as they fall due during 2018 and Q1 2019. We believe that the current economic climate should have no  significant negative impact to our business model. Scoping We have performed a full audit scope on both H&T Group plc and its subsidiary   Harvey & Thompson Limited. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion  thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 34 | www.handt.co.uk Valuation of provisioning in relation to personal loan receivables Key audit matter  description Management apply a best estimate of the likely default on a personal loan based on historical analysis,  in order to determine the provision value. This estimate requires management to make significant  judgements regarding the level and timing of expected future cash flows. Profit before tax is a key measure used by  analysts in presenting business performance   to users of the financial statements. Both entities were subject to a full scope   audit with all work performed by the group engagement team.

GENERAL INFORMATION H& T Group plc is a company incorporated in England & Wales under the Companies Act. No decision has been made about whether to use any of the transitional options in IFRS 16. IFRS 16 distinguishes leases and service contracts on the basis of whether an identified asset is controlled by a customer. Furthermore, the classification of cash flows   will also be affected because operating lease payments under IAS 17 are presented as operating cash flows; whereas under the IFRS   16 model, the lease payments will be split into a principal and an interest portion which will be presented as financing and operating  cash flows respectively. Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is   an indication that the unit may be impaired. Depreciation Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value   of each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows:  Leasehold premises   Leasehold improvements Shorter of 7 years or life of lease   Computer equipment   Computer hardware 3 to 5 years  Fixtures and fittings 10 years   Motor vehicles 4 years The asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year end. For inventory acquired for retail sale the cost represents the  purchase price plus overheads directly related to bringing inventory to its present location and condition and is measured on a first in  first out basis. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred  tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary  differences can be utilised. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: • Pawnbroking, or Pawn Service Charge (PSC), comprises interest on pledge book loans, plus auction profit and loss, less any auction  commissions payable and less surplus payable to the customer. All revenue is recognised at the point of sale; • Pawnbroking scrap and gold purchasing comprises proceeds from gold scrap sales and is recognised on full receipt of sale proceeds; • Personal loans comprise income from the Group’s unsecured lending activities. Employee share incentive plans The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees (including directors). For impairment review purposes, we have used conservative growth assumptions after 2018, even in this  scenario there is still significant headroom on each CGU. Impairment of personal loans Impairment is calculated using models which use historical payment performance to generate the estimated amount and timing   of future cash flows from each arrears stage, more information is set out in Note 6 “Operating Segments” . Included in the above revenues are the following items of income and gains: 2017 £’000 2016 £’000 Income Interest earned on financial assets not designated at fair value Fees earned on financial assets not designated at fair value 38,727 5,213 33,684 4,715 6. There were no fees payable to the Company’s auditor and its associates in respect of associated pension schemes.

This does   not account for lost repeat business however, and as such the Group sees more value in retaining a high redemption ratio. Personal loans and other services receivables are disclosed net of provisions for bad and doubtful debts, an analysis of which is as follows: Personal  loans £’000 Other  services £’000 Total £’000 Balance at 1 January 2016 1,369 17 1,386 Net Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income charge  Written off 3,178 (2,351) 246 (247) 3,424 (2,598) Balance at 31 December 2016 2,196 16 2,212 Net Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income charge  Written off 5,950 (4,271) 223 (221) 6,173 (4,492) Balance at 31 December 2017 3,875 18 3,893 Trade receivables not overdue are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to past   default experience.
