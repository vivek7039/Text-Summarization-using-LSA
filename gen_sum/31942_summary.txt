SAWSense designs and develops Surface Acoustic Wave (or “SAW”) sensor devices that can be used to measure torque, pressure and/or temperature in harsh, restricted or demanding environments to very high accuracy. This world leading technology has a broad range of potential uses ranging from premium value custom applications through to high volume mass markets. Being wireless enables the sensor to be used in rotating components, other moving parts, or environments where electrical wiring would pose a safety risk. Transense Technologies plc Annual report and financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2017 6 Chairman’s statement (continued) As Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) seek ever more data on a real-time basis to optimise the performance of their products, accurate and frequent measurement becomes increasingly important. The world’s largest and most successful companies in these fields are recognising SAW as one of the enabling technologies in developing the “Internet of Things” in this arena, contributing to a vision by which machines are networked with embedded sensors to optimise performance using real time analytical tools, algorithms and interactive controls. This valuable data can be utilised to minimise truck down time, extend tyre life, and improve safety. During earlier stages of commercialisation, we were met with resistance to financing the outright purchase of equipment by mine operators under severely constrained capital budgets during what has been a cyclically challenging few years for the industry. Accordingly, we are now offering implementation of iTrack II on an operating lease financing model, which enables users to generate additional revenues and save costs, against which they are able to meet the ongoing operating costs associated with using the system at a net gain. The gestation period for widespread adoption, and the lead time to translate positive trial outcomes and orders into revenue, have been slower than we originally may have hoped, however we are confident that there are encouraging signs of commercial traction with a number of major global mining companies. Coupled with software developed in-house we also offer a Passenger Car Audit System (“PCAS”), which has recently received its first significant order. Beaufort have a large network of UK retail and High Net Worth investors and will provide retail tailored research on Transense as part of its ongoing services to the Company. In the prior year, pilot production had commenced of sensor kits to measure temperature, vibration and torque on a new range of industrial equipment recently launched by a large European OEM. Accordingly, there can be no certainty of future income from this source. Translogik iTrack Our iTrack products provide a range of features that allow mine operators to track their vehicles’ tyre temperature, pressure, speed, braking and location in real-time and receive early warning of potential problems, hazards or opportunities. In September 2016, we successfully launched the new iTrack II system, a combination of sensor and transmission technology which we believe offers unparalleled features and benefits to mine operators across the world. Transense Technologies plc Annual report and financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2017 9 Chief Executive’s report (continued) The market response to launch has been very encouraging and we have subsequently generated live trials on 14 sites covering 3 continents/territories. We are hopeful this initial order will lead to further sales in South Africa and elsewhere. Furthermore, as indicated above, order intake for probes has started to build momentum, and has already reached a level comparable with nearly 60% of the aggregate order intake for last year. Changing customer requirements and technological innovation will always present a challenge to developing market leading product. The Groups understanding of customer needs and expectations is greatly enhanced by working closely with customers on extensive product trials. Debtor Recoverability The Group has £59k (2016: £383k) of debtors that are payable greater than 12 months. The risk of default, whilst small, would still have an impact on our future results. However, we have reported on our Corporate Governance arrangements by drawing upon best practice available, including those aspects of the UK Corporate Governance Code we consider relevant to the Group and best practice. The Board is satisfied with the effectiveness of internal controls but, by their very nature, these procedures can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. These schemes potentially offer long term incentives to directors and key personnel. Each element of remuneration paid to all directors is shown in detail below. Details of all options granted to directors are shown on the next page. Details of share based payment options granted to directors are disclosed in the Remuneration Report on page 19. Who we are reporting to This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. • Key audit matters were identified as revenue recognition for the Group and parent. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: • Evaluating the Group’s accounting policies for recognition of revenue for appropriateness in accordance with the requirements of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 17 ‘Leases’. • Agreeing as to whether revenue has been recognised in accordance with these policies. • Agreeing, on a sample basis, amounts recognised in revenue in the financial statements for each revenue stream to source and supporting documents including proof of shipment documents to support the sampled transaction. Key Observations: Based on our audit work, we found the Group’s revenue recognition policy was consistently applied. Transense Technologies plc Annual report and financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2017 27 Materiality was determined as follows: Materiality Measure Group Parent Financial statements as a whole £60,000 which is 3% of the Group’s revenue. We performed full scope audit procedures on UK based operations (Transense Technologies plc). We performed specified audit procedures on the material balances of Transense Technologies Chile Spa. Matters on which we are required to report by exception We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: • adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or • the parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or • certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or • we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

The business revenues include royalties, engineering support and sale of product in relation to this technology. All new expenditure on research and development activities in the year has been capitalised. Intangible assets and goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Sterling upon consolidation. Where significant exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations these are reported as an item of other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve or non-controlling interest, as the case may be. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the remeasurement of monetary items denominated in foreign currency at year-end exchange rates are recognised in profit or loss. Share-based payment transactions The Company issues equity settled share based payments to certain employees. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation. Warranty provisions are made for specific product issues based on an estimate of the likely cost arising. It has been deemed prudent to provide for an amount based on historical information. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. No company pension contributions were made to a money purchase scheme on his behalf (2016: nil). The highest paid director did not exercise share options under long term incentive schemes and no shares were received or receivable by the director in respect of qualifying services under a long term incentive scheme (2016: nil). The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined from value-in-use calculations, which use budgeted cash flows for year one and cash flow projections for years 2 to 5, an average growth rate of 1% has been applied to these. The key assumptions forming inputs to cash flows are revenues and margins. The fair value of share options granted is recognised as an employee expense, within administrative expenses, with a corresponding increase in reserves. The risk- free interest rate adopted was 5% and an expected dividend yield of nil pence. The new Share Options granted on 27 October 2014 were in respect of an US employee.
