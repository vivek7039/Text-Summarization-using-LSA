this world leading technology has a broad range of potential uses ranging from premium value custom applications through to high volume mass markets. being wireless enables the sensor to be used in rotating components, other moving parts, or environments where electrical wiring would pose a safety risk. transense technologies plc annual report and financial statements for the year ended 30 june 2017 6 chairman’s statement (continued) as original equipment manufacturers (oems) seek ever more data on a real-time basis to optimise the performance of their products, accurate and frequent measurement becomes increasingly important. the world’s largest and most successful companies in these fields are recognising saw as one of the enabling technologies in developing the “internet of things” in this arena, contributing to a vision by which machines are networked with embedded sensors to optimise performance using real time analytical tools, algorithms and interactive controls. this valuable data can be utilised to minimise truck down time, extend tyre life, and improve safety. during earlier stages of commercialisation, we were met with resistance to financing the outright purchase of equipment by mine operators under severely constrained capital budgets during what has been a cyclically challenging few years for the industry. accordingly, we are now offering implementation of itrack ii on an operating lease financing model, which enables users to generate additional revenues and save costs, against which they are able to meet the ongoing operating costs associated with using the system at a net gain. the gestation period for widespread adoption, and the lead time to translate positive trial outcomes and orders into revenue, have been slower than we originally may have hoped, however we are confident that there are encouraging signs of commercial traction with a number of major global mining companies. coupled with software developed in-house we also offer a passenger car audit system (“pcas”), which has recently received its first significant order. translogik itrack our itrack products provide a range of features that allow mine operators to track their vehicles’ tyre temperature, pressure, speed, braking and location in real-time and receive early warning of potential problems, hazards or opportunities. transense technologies plc annual report and financial statements for the year ended 30 june 2017 9 chief executive’s report (continued) the market response to launch has been very encouraging and we have subsequently generated live trials on 14 sites covering 3 continents/territories. we are hopeful this initial order will lead to further sales in south africa and elsewhere. changing customer requirements and technological innovation will always present a challenge to developing market leading product. the groups understanding of customer needs and expectations is greatly enhanced by working closely with customers on extensive product trials. debtor recoverability the group has £59k (2016: £383k) of debtors that are payable greater than 12 months. the risk of default, whilst small, would still have an impact on our future results. however, we have reported on our corporate governance arrangements by drawing upon best practice available, including those aspects of the uk corporate governance code we consider
