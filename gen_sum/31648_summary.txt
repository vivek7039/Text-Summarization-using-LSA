acquisitions and two new strategic partnerships. acquisitions we continued our strong track record of successful m&a activity to help deliver our mission: • in november 2016, we acquired technicweb, one of the uk’s leading estate agency website design and hosting businesses. • in january 2017, we acquired hometrack, the uk’s leading provider of residential property market insights and analytics. • in march 2017, we acquired expertagent, one of the uk’s leading cloud-based estate agent software solutions. mike evans chairman “ it has been an exceptionally busy and exciting year for us. our moveit platform generated over £1 million in referrals fees for our partners and has become a net revenue generator for a number of agents who are able to earn an additional £1,000+ per transaction by offering additional relevant services to consumers including conveyancing, mortgages and energy switching. november 2016: t echnicweb is one of the uk’s leading estate agency website design and hosting businesses. january 2017: hometrack is the uk’s leading provider of residential property market insights and analytics. this acquisition has helped us to further differentiate our products for both consumers and partners and has also introduced a new set of partners to zpg including 18 of the top 25 mortgage lenders in the uk. march 2017: expertagent is a leading property software provider that provides essential systems for the day-to-day management of estate agent businesses. september 2017: ravensworth is the leading provider of integrated print solutions to over 4,500 uk estate agent branches. this deal further enhances zpg’s comprehensive product offering for its property partners which now includes portal, software, websites, on-demand print and data services. this figure includes a full 12 months of trading from property software group, which was acquired on 28 april 2016, as well as the post-acquisition trading of technicweb, hometrack, expertagent and ravensworth which were acquired during the period. as a backdrop to this year, we saw exceptionally strong switching volumes in both the energy and communications verticals in 2016 from our market-leading collective switches, energy supplier price cuts and strong competition amongst communications suppliers. 1 the total number of unique property partners has been restated to exclude 788 legacy software customers of property software group who are not paying for an active support contract and to include zoopla advertising and data partners. our london headquarters was recently named “one of the coolest offices in britain” by glassdoor. alex chesterman obe founder & ceo the energy vertical particularly benefited from returning switchers on fixed-term deals and supplier price rises, enabling us to reach a new milestone of over one million energy switches in a 12 month period. q: with almost 1,000 staff in multiple locations, how do you keep everyone up to date? www.zpg.co.uk 13 strategic

strategic report marketing key drivers: transaction volumes and print-to-digital shift total property commission earned by professionals (including both sales and lettings) is the main driver behind the total amount spent on property marketing. the hyper-local and highly competitive nature of estate agency underpins long-term demand for marketing services. demand for quality bank-grade data is rising as consumers and businesses want to be on the front-foot when negotiating deals and managing the risk associated with their largest assets such as their own home or property portfolio. however, despite increased supply-side competition and the average household savings of hundreds of pounds from switching, consumer engagement remains much lower than other more established switching verticals such as car insurance, creating a significant structural growth opportunity. banking is set to be one of the key growth areas as economic uncertainty drives increased comparison activity. t otal

continued our results were driven by strong underlying performance across both divisions together with the inclusion of in-year acquisitions. new homes revenue increased 12% to £13.1 million, driven by demand for additional products like area sponsorship and targeted email marketing campaigns. excluding hometrack, other property revenue, which is made up largely from third party advertising, increased by 7%. in addition to the traditional offerings, like matched pension contributions, birthday day off, subsidised health insurance, mental health support and season ticket loans, we offer some more creative benefits designed to relieve the stresses of everyday life, such as a day off when moving home and interest-free loans to help get a foot on the property ladder. in the last 12 months, more than 500 colleagues have received over 1,300 hours of learning through our in-house workshops across multiple offices. we are committed to giving back and doing the right thing charity support this year colleagues voted for the charity they would like to partner with most and cancer research uk (cruk) was chosen. we hold monthly “ask alex” sessions where all employees can get answers to any specific work-related queries they might have. and we encourage all colleagues to donate their valuable time by giving them a day off every year to volunteer for any charity of their choice, or do a good deed for any non-profit organisation, like schools and hospitals. zpg’s 2017 tough mudder team 1 www.zpg.co.uk 45 strategic report alfie traish – the apprentice just as zpg has grown from the fledgling business it was 10 years ago, we are keen for our people to grow with us too. but some of the most valuable learning is “on the job”, said alfie, now aged 20: “being immersed in an it environment with an incredibly supportive team, meeting people every day and being tasked with constantly improving users’ experience has given me a real sense of satisfaction. ” when asked what his apprenticeship highlights have been so far, alfie said: “passing my first module with ease”. we hope to replicate this event and host similar ones in all of our regional offices over the coming year. however, the greater proportion of men than women in senior and technical roles has created a gender pay gap at zpg. at zpg we will continue to focus on developing a more diverse talent pipeline and promoting flexible working practices. education we’ve set up internal training for our people managers, starting with lessons learned by market-leading peers, to ensure they fully understand the principles of diversity and inclusion and learn from their practices with the aim of making constant improvements. parental leave we have revisited our programmes and enhanced them, related to length of service. we believe this will encourage women and minorities to develop their careers at zpg in a supportive environment. we have recently established an eco committee, with members from all areas and working locations of the business. as an online property portal and home services switching platform, we naturally operate without intensive production processes, use of packaging or the need to print out substantial amounts of paper, a practice which we will continue to maintain. the company also operates a “bike-to-work” scheme, which offers our employees an incentive to travel to and from work in an environmentally friendly way and our head office includes secure storage for over 50 bikes. scope 1 emissions relate to the company’s fleet of vehicles, which are used by certain employees for business purposes. james offered himself up for election at the company’s annual general meeting (agm) on 2 february 2017, which took place shortly after his

officer andy botha chief financial officer duncan t atton-brown senior independent non-executive director sherry coutu cbe independent non-executive director appointment date mike became chairman of zpg in 2014. he is a qualified actuary with over 30 years’ experience in the financial services industry. he was formerly a non-executive director of esure group plc and chief operating officer at skandia uk limited. previously, alex co-founded lovefilm, europe’s leading online dvd rental service, which was successfully sold to amazon. companies he has backed at an early stage include zpg, lastminute.com, agent provocateur, lovefilm, wonga, secret escapes, fizzback, tweetdeck, graze, freeagent, skimlinks and moo. in addition to this, there are no ongoing relationships between grenville and the directors or senior employees of countrywide. grenville does not currently hold any shares in countrywide, however he is due to receive a minimal amount of deferred countrywide shares in 2018 as a result of his historic involvement with the company. the board does not deem this to be a determinative factor in considering his independence. there is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the board’s approval whilst it has delegated other specific responsibilities to its committees. prior to each scheduled board meeting, a pack of documents is circulated in respect of the corresponding financial period, which includes updates on corporate governance, investor relations, key performance targets, trading performance against the agreed budget and detailed financial data and analysis. furthermore, as part of its investor relations programme, the executive directors have maintained an active dialogue with key stakeholders, including institutional investors, to discuss issues relating to the performance of zpg including strategy and new developments. the principal area of focus within this division relates to software revenues deriving from contracts with multiple obligations. management performed an exercise during the period to demonstrate that any potential misallocation of fair value between installation and ongoing services could not be material. management performs a month-on-month analysis which demonstrates that the accuracy of accruals continues to improve over time. non-audit services provided by deloitte were reviewed and, as described below, are not considered to have affected the auditor’s independence. last year, the audit committee recommended to the board that it was not necessary to appoint a permanent internal audit function but, rather, there should be a focus on specific areas supplemented with ad hoc reviews. zpg’s internal control framework is aligned to the “three lines of defence” model as set out on page 31. the system of internal controls is designed to manage and diminish rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. examples include bribery, corruption, fraud, dishonesty and illegal practices which may endanger employees or third parties. the other members are alex chesterman, sherry coutu, robin klein, duncan tatton-brown and, from september onwards, grenville turner. the hampton-alexander review has now recommended a voluntary target of a minimum of 33% female representation on ftse 350 boards by 2020 and, although the board has not committed to any specific gender or diversity targets, it will give due regard to this target going forward. the executive directors can receive family private health cover, car allowance and death in service life assurance. executive directors shall be reimbursed for all reasonable expenses and the company may settle any tax incurred in relation to these. for executive directors 50% of annual bonus to be paid immediately in cash and 50% deferred into shares. should the committee determine that one or more targets are commercially sensitive, these will be disclosed in subsequent years’ remuneration reports once commercial sensitivity ceases to apply. no material change will be made to the type of performance measures without prior shareholder consultation. adherence to these guidelines is a condition of continued participation in the equity incentive arrangements. each independent non-executive director’s term of office runs for a three year period. if a contract is to be terminated, the committee will determine such mitigation as it considers fair and reasonable in each case. for the purposes of this disclosure, dividend equivalents have not been added to deferred bonus and ltip share awards. single total figure of remuneration for executive directors for the 2017 financial year (audited) annual

company’s sip. there have been no other movements since 30 september 2017 to the date of this report. 4 nil-cost options granted under the company’s ltip and annual bonus plans exclude any dividend equivalents that may have accrued. no shareholder holds securities carrying any special rights or control over the company’s share capital. as a consequence, the directors believe that zpg is well placed to manage its business and financial risks successfully. the acquisition accounting for these two entities has been identified as a key audit matter. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 100 zpg plc annual report 2017 independent auditor’s report continued t o the members of zpg plc revenue recognition in the property segment >> key audit matter description agency revenue primarily consists of recurring subscription payments with agent and developer members in return for property listings. revenue recognition is limited in complexity; however given the large volume of agreements there is a risk that customer subscription agreements may not be appropriately captured and accounted for, and hence the agency revenue population may not be complete. the fair value accounting for these bundled contracts can be complex as the fair value may not be ascribed to each deliverable in accordance with ias 18. therefore we also considered this key audit matter as a fraud risk. 102 zpg plc annual report 2017 independent auditor’s report continued t o the members of zpg plc our application of materiality continued we agreed with the audit committee that we would report to the committee all audit differences in excess of £115,000 (2016: £100,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. matters on which we are required to report by exception adequacy of explanations received and accounting records under the companies act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: • we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or • adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or • the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. kate j houldsworth fca (senior statutory auditor) for and on behalf of

domiciled and incorporated in the united kingdom. from 1 october 2018 these assets will be measured as fair value through other comprehensive income in accordance with ifrs 9. as this treatment mirrors the group’s current policy, there is not expected to be any material impact on the group’s reported results; however, management notes that any gain or loss arising on the sale of these assets may no longer be able to be recognised in the consolidated income statement but will remain within other comprehensive income. all other standards identified above are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. exchange differences on translation into the presentational currency are recognised within other comprehensive income. capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic life. they are recognised at amortised cost, which is net of any allowance for impairment in relation to irrecoverable amounts. the provision is reviewed regularly in conjunction with a detailed analysis of historical payment profiles and past default experience. the information set out below provides information about how the group determines fair values of various financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value: • level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; • level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and • level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 114 zpg plc annual report 2017 notes to the

the recoverable amounts of intangible assets and goodwill are based on their value in use, which is determined using cash flow projections derived from financial plans approved by the board covering a three year period. cash flows for other cgus, beyond the three year period have been extrapolated using a perpetuity growth rate. amending the analysis such that a growth rate into perpetuity of negative 1%, or a reasonable increase in discount rate, is applied across all cgus whilst holding all other variables constant would not give rise to an impairment. indicators of impairment for all cgus, including property software group, will continue to be assessed throughout the 2018 financial year. further detail on borrowings is provided in note 26. the company defines net debt as loans and
