operating expenses are presented on the basis as analysed by management. underlying operating costs excluding net new space were down 0.8%, driven principally by a reduction in underlying rent costs as a result of the rent re-gears achieved at four sites, together with good labour cost control, supported by the implementation of the fourth hospitality payroll management system in december 2016. these cost efficiencies more than offset underlying cost inflation. central administration costs centrally allocated overheads were up 15% at £2.6m (fy16 pf: £2.3m), mostly driven by increased levels of expense in marketing, it and training to support the business growth plans. acquisition investment was an outflow of £2.6m (fy16: £2.3m) utilised to purchase three new sites: blackburn, eastbourne

we designed audit procedures at group and significant component level to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. management considers each site to be a cash-generating unit (cgu) and has performed an impairment assessment using discounted cash flows to ensure that the carrying value of each site’s assets is supported by expected future cash

monitors goodwill in aggregate for internal purposes. this measure provides us with a consistent year-on-year basis for determining materiality based on trading performance and eliminates the impact
