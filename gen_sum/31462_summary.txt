One way we can see this is the most crucial measure: our impressive, sector-leading Net Promoter Score of 66%, up from 49% in 2016. These awards are reflected by our own colleagues, with 90% saying they would recommend Tenpin as a great place to work. As planned, we made good further progress with our acquisition programme during FY17, completing the acquisitions of three sites in Blackburn, Eastbourne and Rochdale. I stated in our interim results in September that I was pleased with how our teams throughout the business performed during a very busy period which also included the completion of a successful IPO process, and I am delighted with how they continued to perform during a busy second half, allowing us to deliver results in line with our strategy. Acquisition performance TARGET 2-4 SITES PER YEAR Blackburn Eastbourne Rochdale Strategic report | 9 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc Operating review In April 2017, as part of its IPO process, the Group outlined its strategy to the market. The Group has a strong relationship with its main bowling equipment supplier, Qubica AMF, and we are currently working with them to develop an accelerated manufacturing and roll-out plan to introduce Pins & Strings across the estate. The Group believes that following Tenpinisation these sites will deliver a return on investment in line with our expectations of around 30%. This is a significant achievement for the Group and complements its Investors in People Gold status. The Group believes that engaged colleagues provide better customer experiences and it measures how customers value their experience using Net Promoter Scores. Significant investment from leading operators, such as Tenpin, together with market consolidation has helped this revival. A consumer survey carried out indicated that only 32% of UK adults participated in tenpin bowling over the 12 months to March 2017. Our centres operate with c.24 lanes and on average have a footprint of around 30,000 square feet. Our product offering comprises bowling, family amusements, pool, table-tennis, soft play and Sector 7 laser games. Embedded growth within our business model and strategy is supported by a well-developed pipeline of acquisition sites.

The following table summarises these principal risks, their possible impact and how they are managed or mitigated. The Board believes that, as a relatively low-frequency and low-ticket activity, bowling should withstand an economic downturn. 2 Cost of sales and operating expenses are presented on the basis as analysed by management. Central administration costs Centrally allocated overheads were up 15% at £2.6m (FY16 PF: £2.3m), mostly driven by increased levels of expense in marketing, IT and training to support the business growth plans. Acquisition investment was an outflow of £2.6m (FY16: £2.3m) utilised to purchase three new sites: Blackburn, Eastbourne and Rochdale. Financial review continued Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc 30 | Strategic report Financing arrangements The Group finances its operations through a combination of cash, property leases, finance leases and access to committed bank facilities where necessary.

These statements should be treated with caution due to the inherent risks and uncertainties underlying any such forward-looking information. Our audit approach Context Ten Entertainment Group plc is a tenpin bowling operator and operations are wholly UK-based. Management considers each site to be a cash-generating unit (CGU) and has performed an impairment assessment using discounted cash flows to ensure that the carrying value of each site’s assets is supported by expected future cash flows. Goodwill is not allocated to individual CGUs as management considers that the synergies arising from each acquisition benefit the group as a whole rather than individual sites and management monitors goodwill in aggregate for internal purposes. This measure provides us with a consistent year-on-year basis for determining materiality based on trading performance and eliminates the impact of non-recurring items.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences but, where deductible temporary differences exist, management’s judgement is required as to whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised based on the availability of future taxable profits. All deposits paid in advance for a game of bowling that has yet to be played are accounted for as deferred revenue under current liabilities until the game is played, upon which it is recognised as revenue. Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful economic life. The principal useful lives used for this purpose are as follows: Long leasehold premises The shorter of 50 years or their estimated useful lives Short leasehold premises Their estimated useful lives Fixtures, fittings and equipment Between three and 40 years Amusement machines Four years Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until they are brought into use. Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with business combinations are expensed as incurred. 78 | Financial statements Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc Statement of accounting policies continued Tax continued Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Strategic decisions are made by the Board based on information presented in respect of these segments.
