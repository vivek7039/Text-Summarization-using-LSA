where significant milestones were achieved during this long history, but i do not believe that any previous year can match the historic milestones that the group has achieved this year. this new group has, for the first time, seen the greg lawless arena group ceo 17 overview strategic report governance financial statements annual report & accounts 2017 combination of a major structures manufacturer with a major structures rental business. this is a significant development as, traditionally, manufacture and rental businesses have remained distinctly separate. growth strategies we outlined four key components of our strategic plan as part of the ipo process in 2017. these four components are designed to help us deliver not only top line revenue growth, but more importantly improvement in ebitda margins that we believe will continue to create demonstrable shareholder value over the coming years. product extension • we intend to replicate our uk multi-product offering in other parts of the group. this acquisition added some 24,000 tiered seats to our existing stock of 76,000, but also allowed us to enter the fast- growing mass participation sports market in the uk where we now deliver over 300 events each year for cancer research uk and other event organisers. looking ahead we are pleased to have delivered a strong set of inaugural results, post ipo, in 2017. these results, on an adjusted basis, represent a significant increase over our adjusted 2016 numbers and were, in the main, delivered by strong organic growth. greg lawless group ceo 10 april 2018 19 overview

whether there will be sufficient future taxable profits against which it can utilise a deductible difference. under these principles, no acquirer is required to be identified and all entities are included at their pre-combination carrying amounts. this accounting treatment leads to differences on consolidation between share capital and share premium in issue (£1.1m) and the book value of the underlying net assets acquired, this difference is included within equity as a merger reserve. any exchange gain or loss occurring as a result of a business transaction being settled at an exchange rate that differs from that used when the transaction was originally recorded is credited or charged to the profit and loss account. key estimation uncertainties: provision for bad debt provision for bad debts is made against specific balances that are considered by the group to be irrecoverable or where there may exist a risk that a debtor balance may not be fully recoverable. segment results before exceptional items are used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the performance of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries. year ended 31 december 2017 uke £m mea £m us £m total £m revenue rental 44.9 18.2 42.5 105.6 capital sales 1.2 1.1 1.7 4.0 total revenue 46.1 19.3 44.2 109.6
