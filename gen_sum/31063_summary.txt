The Group is renowned for delivering the “Arena Standard” of service across all regions, promising our customers a world class service and product delivery that is essential for a client base such as ours. We believe that this year, more than ever, we are beginning to see the benefits of this clear corporate philosophy as the business has seen more growth in each region than ever before.

We will also continue to explore value accretive acquisition opportunities in line with our stated strategy. Ken Hanna Chairman 10 April 2018 I am pleased to present the Group’s first annual results as a publicly quoted company. There will, no doubt, have been a number of years where significant milestones were achieved during this long history, but I do not believe that any previous year can match the historic milestones that the Group has achieved this year. This new group has, for the first time, seen the Greg Lawless Arena Group CEO 17 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report & Accounts 2017 combination of a major structures manufacturer with a major structures rental business. This is a significant development as, traditionally, manufacture and rental businesses have remained distinctly separate. These four components are designed to help us deliver not only top line revenue growth, but more importantly improvement in EBITDA margins that we believe will continue to create demonstrable shareholder value over the coming years. Product Extension • We intend to replicate our UK multi-product offering in other parts of the Group. This acquisition added some 24,000 tiered seats to our existing stock of 76,000, but also allowed us to enter the fast- growing mass participation sports market in the UK where we now deliver over 300 events each year for Cancer Research UK and other event organisers. • These units manufacture certain parts and bespoke products for a number of unique client requirements. Looking Ahead We are pleased to have delivered a strong set of inaugural results, post IPO, in 2017.

A reconciliation between the opening and closing balances of these items is provided in note 19. The amendments clarify how an entity should evaluate whether there will be sufficient future taxable profits against which it can utilise a deductible difference. It also carries forward the guidance on recognition and de-recognition of financial instruments from IAS 39. Under these principles, no acquirer is required to be identified and all entities are included at their pre-combination carrying amounts. This accounting treatment leads to differences on consolidation between share capital and share premium in issue (£1.1m) and the book value of the underlying net assets acquired, this difference is included within equity as a merger reserve. Any exchange gain or loss occurring as a result of a business transaction being settled at an exchange rate that differs from that used when the transaction was originally recorded is credited or charged to the profit and loss account. A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted. Key estimation uncertainties: Provision for bad debt Provision for bad debts is made against specific balances that are considered by the group to be irrecoverable or where there may exist a risk that a debtor balance may not be fully recoverable. Segment results before exceptional items are used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the performance of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.
