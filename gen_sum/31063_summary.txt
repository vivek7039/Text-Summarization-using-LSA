our strategic plan as part of the ipo process in 2017. these four components are designed to help us deliver not only top line revenue growth, but more importantly improvement in ebitda margins that we believe will continue to create demonstrable shareholder value over the coming years. it’s a ryder cup year, and we will once again be heavily involved delivering event infrastructure in paris. asia tents arena was contracted to provide extensive temporary event infrastructure at the club @ nine bridges on jeju island for the tournament, which took place from october 16th-22nd, 2017. we provided multiple single and double-deck hospitality structures, fully fitted out with bespoke interiors and balconies, to accommodate 20 sponsors. piers has been the group’s finance director since may 2012, overseeing all financial matters including reporting, risk management, insurance, banking, acquisitions and fundraising. paul has also led various business units within nova chemicals corporation, a multi-billion dollar, publicly traded manufacture of refinery products, primary petrochemicals and polymers that is headquartered in calgary, alberta. paul brings a lengthy history of working in events to the arena group and knows the middle east very well having moved to dubai in 1993 with bbdo (part of omnicom group), working as an account director for global brands such as pepsi, emirates and general motors. however, any such system of internal control can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. the group also has adopted an anti- bribery policy and whistleblowing polices which are included in each employee’s staff handbook. bank interest is charged at a fixed margin to libor which has been agreed as part of the current financing arrangements. the amendments clarify how an entity should evaluate whether there will be sufficient future taxable profits against which it can utilise a deductible difference. under these principles, no acquirer is required to be identified and all entities are included at their pre-combination carrying amounts. year ended 31 december 2017 uke £m mea £m us £m total £m
