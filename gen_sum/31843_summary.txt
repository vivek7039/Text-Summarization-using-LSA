our industry continues to evolve rapidly, with huge growth in esports, live streaming, social and mobile gaming, whilst social media is changing the way games are played and how gaming communities interact. console price points have reduced further encouraging more customers to buy into current generation consoles with playstation 4 seeing stronger relative performance. building on these schemes, last year we launched game elite, a new customer membership scheme in the uk, offering greater discounts, enhanced loyalty rewards and exclusive competitions. in particular, we were able to reduce our total fixed and variable store costs by £3.6 million (or 4.0%) despite upward pressures incurred as a result of regulatory wage increases introduced during the year. — the global audience for gaming is expanding as games become ubiquitous across all platforms and devices, with billions of players globally. — console market performance is also influenced by the strength of new games

our stakeholders customers by delivering a specialist proposition including exclusive products available only at game; engaging ways to purchase such as trade-in; the ability to access products through multiple channels and convenient locations; a growing range of live gaming services and one of the most generous reward programmes in our markets, we are providing customers with a valuable, differentiated proposition that they cannot find anywhere else. accordingly, the group has recently commenced a review to maximise shareholder value in respect of multiplay’s digital business. i) delivering a compelling customer proposition enhanced uk loyalty scheme: ‘game elite’ launched 20 years ago this year, our customer loyalty programmes in the uk and spain are some of the longest- standing and most popular of their kind in their respective regions. more recently, we reconfigured our software stock management system to significantly improve the availability of preowned products online. over the last three years we have almost doubled sales (measured as gtv) from our digital and non-console categories, from £123.5 million in fy13/14 to £236.8 million in fy16/17, with these areas contributing approximately 27% of our total gtv this year. during the year we our strategy continued 34 game digital plc annual report and accounts 2017 as mentioned previously, we have also launched an online trade-in proposition and new preowned stock management engine during the year, enhancing our online proposition in these areas. during the year we have continued to focus our efforts on improving future store contribution by way of the following: 1) fixed cost reductions through ongoing lease renewal programme and concession partnerships during the year, 39 uk leases were successfully renewed on improved terms out of a total of 49 renewed, with rents reduced on an annualised basis by £1.4 million across those leases. to date 50 leases have been renewed on better terms, producing an annualised saving of £1.7 million. the programme is designed to lower variable costs in stores whilst improving customer services levels by increasing store efficiencies. alongside these developments the group continues to broaden and improve its range of retail services. number of listings through our ‘marketplace’ offer 265,000+ iii) developing our online and multichannel proposition like all retail markets around the world, we continue to see consumers completing a growing proportion of their purchases online, particularly through mobile devices. delivering a seamless, connected and engaging customer journey is therefore increasingly important to our business. during the year we also launched a new ‘click & reserve’ proposition, providing further convenience for customers. importantly, we are achieving a retail sales uplift relative to the estate average in these stores, with the greatest impact seen in pc gaming and vr categories and core categories such as playstation 4 have also benefited despite consolidation of store space. arena time has also been recently developed and launched which allows belong customers to purchase bulk ‘credits’ for gaming hours in our arenas. feedback from customers, store teams, supplier partners and gaming communities continues to be very positive. we were also selected by activision to host a european qualifying event for the 2017 call of duty world league (‘cwl ’) championship. we are planning for 221 lease events before the end of 2018 and, in conjunction with these plans, we are exploring opportunities to open new concession locations with complementary third-party brands, where a lower overall cost of occupation and flexible terms can be agreed. conclusion whilst dynamics in the uk console market have been challenging, we have made good progress in the year as we continue to focus on developing our strategic initiatives and creating a new cost base for our uk retail

learning zone at least once a week in the uk, with more than 250,000 e-learning modules completed. providing opportunities for career progression also remains a key focus and this year also saw the completion of the second year of our high potential programme which provides accelerated career development and progression for high performing colleagues. last year, the retail high potential programme was extended to include managers within our distribution centre. 47 game digital plc annual report and accounts 2017 overview strategic report governance results shareholder information we see social media as an important means of interacting and engaging with our customers so we encourage our employees to participate. over the year we have engaged our suppliers, gathering information about their policies and processes in relation to modern slavery. age-related sales training is completed on every employee’s first day working in-store, and then regularly throughout the year. specialeffect is a uk-based charity which uses video games and technology to enhance the quality of life for people with disabilities. we also report on some scope 3 categories, as this data is being used internally to drive emission and cost reductions. sales of both the console and key software titles will remain dependent on stock availability. we continue to work closely with our supplier partners and have been successful in securing additional support. the benefits from these new arrangements, together with our continued focus on higher margin categories and digital content sales have driven a positive improvement in our uk gross margin rate, which increased 10 basis points in the year, to 27.4% (calculated as a % of revenue). we are also exploring opportunities to open new concession locations where lower cost of occupation and more flexible terms can be agreed, commencing a concession trial with the leading consumer electronics retailer maplin, in september 2017. we are also exploring opportunities to open new belong venues in low-cost, high footfall retail and leisure locations both within, and outside, our existing estate. within retail operations, we continue to focus on improving customer service standards whilst carefully managing our store employee costs, flexing resourcing levels during periods of higher and lower demand. benefiting from this development both activities have independently delivered significant revenue growth over the last twelve months. multiplay’s digital division remains a separate business unit, based in the new forest, hampshire. the margin rate decline was mainly explained by a lower mix of prior generation preowned sales. business review continued 52 game digital plc annual report and accounts 2017 financial
