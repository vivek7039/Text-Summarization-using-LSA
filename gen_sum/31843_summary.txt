Over the period, we have rapidly developed our live gaming operations, opening 18 BELONG gaming arenas; launched a major new membership scheme in the UK – ‘GAME Elite’; successfully developed new retail categories and services; delivered a number of improvements to the omni-channel customer journey, including an enhanced Click & Collect service and new Reserve & Collect offer; hosted our largest ever Insomnia Gaming Festival and doubled sales from our digital enterprise businesses. This commitment has seen over £57 million returned to shareholders by way of ordinary and special dividends since the Group’s flotation in 2014. Our ‘BELONG’ gaming arena initiative was launched just over a year ago, with an encouraging performance being delivered from the first 18 venues in operation. Console price points have reduced further encouraging more customers to buy into current generation consoles with PlayStation 4 seeing stronger relative performance. Building on these schemes, last year we launched GAME Elite, a new customer membership scheme in the UK, offering greater discounts, enhanced loyalty rewards and exclusive competitions. In particular, we were able to reduce our total fixed and variable store costs by £3.6 million (or 4.0%) despite upward pressures incurred as a result of regulatory wage increases introduced during the year. — The global audience for gaming is expanding as games become ubiquitous across all platforms and devices, with billions of players globally.

More recently, we reconfigured our software stock management system to significantly improve the availability of preowned products online. During the year we OUR STRATEGY CONTINUED 34 GAME Digital plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 As mentioned previously, we have also launched an online trade-in proposition and new preowned stock management engine during the year, enhancing our online proposition in these areas. The programme is designed to lower variable costs in stores whilst improving customer services levels by increasing store efficiencies. Arena time has also been recently developed and launched which allows BELONG customers to purchase bulk ‘credits’ for gaming hours in our arenas. We were also selected by Activision to host a European qualifying event for the 2017 Call of Duty World League (‘CWL ’) Championship. We are planning for 221 lease events before the end of 2018 and, in conjunction with these plans, we are exploring opportunities to open new concession locations with complementary third-party brands, where a lower overall cost of occupation and flexible terms can be agreed. Why it’s important to GAME The business is focused on improving its percentage gross margin in all categories. External factors such as Brexit or a banking crisis could also adversely affect consumer confidence and shopping habits. — Diversify the business, expanding beyond traditional retail into related markets of leisure, entertainment and hospitality e.g. our new, pay-to-play gaming arenas ‘BELONG’. External factors such as Brexit or a banking crisis could also adversely affect consumer confidence and shopping habits. Movement of risk in year Link to strategy Improve, Expand, Develop Principal risk 9: Core systems and new technologies Specific risks Failure to invest sufficiently in critical systems and in the development of new technologies could impact our ability to deliver our growth strategies and/or cause significant business disruption during peak trading, at a major gaming event or during the live hosting of a new gaming title. Overview At GAME Digital, we recognise that operating responsibly is a critical foundation to furthering our mission; building the most valuable community for gamers. 60% of employees visit GAME Learning Zone at least once a week in the UK, with more than 250,000 e-learning modules completed. Over the year we have engaged our suppliers, gathering information about their policies and processes in relation to modern slavery. This has involved a high level risk assessment of our supply chain that will lead to further follow up activity in FY 2018. Age-related sales training is completed on every employee’s first day working in-store, and then regularly throughout the year. SpecialEffect is a UK-based charity which uses video games and technology to enhance the quality of life for people with disabilities. We also report on some Scope 3 categories, as this data is being used internally to drive emission and cost reductions. The benefits from these new arrangements, together with our continued focus on higher margin categories and digital content sales have driven a positive improvement in our UK gross margin rate, which increased 10 basis points in the year, to 27.4% (calculated as a % of revenue). Within retail operations, we continue to focus on improving customer service standards whilst carefully managing our store employee costs, flexing resourcing levels during periods of higher and lower demand. Gross margin rates in the territory declined by 90 basis points to 24.5% (2016: 25.4%), reflecting a lower mix of higher margin older generation software (across both mint and preowned categories) as well as selected price investment across key categories to support our leading market shares.

Where urgent decisions are required on matters specifically reserved for the Board between meetings, there is a process in place to facilitate discussion and decision-making. In addition, it is likely that the Committee will continue with its work on succession planning for both senior management and executive roles. This review has also given a greater understanding of customer behaviour in relation to top ups, redemptions and expired balances. However, based on the three-year plan and other strategic initiatives planned, management has determined that no adjustments for impairment are required. Under the current policy, awards can only be granted with earnings per share (‘EPS’) and total shareholder return (‘TSR’) targets. Application of the remuneration policy for 2017/18 As mentioned there will be no change to base salary, benefits or pension. The specific targets are considered commercially sensitive but will be disclosed retrospectively in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration. Retaining an EPS measure ensures that there remains a focus on the core measures of our long-term profitability. Having completed my three-year term as a Non-Executive Director I will be stepping down at the AGM in January 2018. Awards vest on performance measures against a range of challenging targets set and assessed by the Remuneration Committee. Non-financial metrics may apply for a minority of the bonus scheme with these targets linked to stretching short-term strategic objectives. In line with HMRC regulations for such schemes, SAYE and SIP awards are not subject to performance conditions.

The Lajedosa Facility Agreement does not include any financial covenants, but does include restrictions, amongst other things, in relation to mergers, acquisitions, investments, disposals, new business activities and entry into certain forms of financing arrangement, in each case subject to certain exceptions. Save as noted above, there have been no other notifiable interests disclosed to the Company between 29 July 2017 and 14 November 2017. We also agreed to report differences below this threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. Revenue for goods, such as third-party gift cards and digital content, sold on a commission basis is recognised net of associated purchase costs. Hosting revenue and multiplayer gaming subscription income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period to which it relates. Supplier funding Supplier rebates and other similar promotional funding (including marketing contributions from suppliers where there are no directly attributable marketing costs incurred by the Group) are generally recognised as a credit to cost of sales over the period to which they relate and, where appropriate, based on actual or estimated volumes. Deferred revenue is adjusted for the value of points that are not expected to be redeemed by customers based on historical redemption rates. Unredeemed deposits relating to products that have been launched are recognised within revenue using calculations based on historical redemption and expiry rates. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment if there is any indication that the carrying value may not be recoverable. On classification as held for sale, assets are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. In light of developing accounting practice and other recent guidance and interpretations, income received from suppliers in relation to promotional support where there are no directly attributable costs has been reclassified from other operating expenses to a deduction within cost of sales with a small proportion recorded as revenue.
