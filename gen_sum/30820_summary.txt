information. more information can be found on pages 28 to 30, including details of our own internal review following the tragic events at grenfell tower, london, in june 2017. customer service customer service continues to be a key priority for all taylor wimpey employees. following concern expressed by some customers, during 2017 we carried out a review of historic lease structures and, in particular, ten-year doubling ground rent clauses, which we had stopped using on new developments from late 2011. whilst taylor wimpey implemented these leases in good faith and the terms were clearly set out in the relevant leases, it was clear from our review that the impact of these doubling rent review clauses was causing some of our customers understandable concern, particularly from a mortgageability and saleability perspective. in our annual general meeting trading update of april 2017, we announced that we would make a provision, before tax, of £130 million in the first half accounts to allow us to put things right for our affected customers. perhaps more importantly, it also identified areas, such as better collaboration between some functions, where further work is needed and we will of course prioritise these areas in 2018. as part of the government’s welcomed employee voice initiative, during 2017 we established our national employee forum (nef) with elected representatives from across the business. we are confident that our well-capitalised balance sheet together with our high-quality landbank with outlets located in places where demand is high and where people want to live provides the flexibility and resilience needed to manage all types of market conditions through the cycle. help to buy remains a popular purchasing tool for our customers, and the new build housing market more widely. we believe that the land market and planning environment have significantly changed over recent years. we have experienced no material change in build cost inflation patterns since the eu referendum result. through 2017, demand for new build housing has remained robust supported by healthy employment trends, a competitive mortgage market and the government’s help to buy scheme. whilst there were some regional variations, we saw generally strong demand throughout 2017 and the uk housing market remained resilient. ” 2017 was another strong year for taylor wimpey and we enter 2018 in a good position with positive forward momentum. more information on our financial performance can be found within our group financial review on pages 42 to 45. uk operational performance summary whilst there were some regional variations, we saw generally strong demand throughout 2017 and the uk housing market remained resilient. we estimate that market-led house price growth for our regional mix was c.4% in the 12 months to 31 december 2017 (2016: 5%). continuing to drive value from the business for all our stakeholders chief executive’s statement pete redfern chief executive demonstrating excellence through improved operational efficiency and discipline developing and nurturing stakeholder relationships which play a key role in our business success driving financial performance in the right way to deliver sustainable shareholder returns 12 taylor wimpey plc annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report first time buyers accounted for 41% of total sales in 2017 (2016: 38%). we have remained disciplined in building and optimising a short term landbank of c.75k plots, of which 52% is strategically sourced, in the relatively balanced land market we have experienced since 2011. we have added in excess of 57k potential plots to the strategic pipeline since 2013, at a reduced cost and which, importantly, continues to give us increased flexibility and choices. dividends we are committed to providing a reliable dividend stream for our investors through the cycle. more information can be found on our case study on page 34. a key aspiration, and goal, for the group management team is to make taylor wimpey the employer of choice and establish a culture where individuals from all backgrounds can reach their full potential. our employee engagement survey, conducted in 2017, highlighted key strengths but more importantly has highlighted areas for improvement and these will be a key area of focus for 2018. we aim to do this annually so we can measure performance. our project 2020 design competition in partnership with the royal institute of british architects (riba) attracted over 100 entries from 14 different countries. our communities we are committed to working with local people and stakeholders throughout the planning process. ryan mangold group finance director responsibilities ryan’s role covers all areas of finance, including tax, treasury and managing the group’s defined benefit pension scheme, as well as overall responsibility for our commercial and information technology functions. on sites where there are tall buildings with aluminium composite material cladding, we have sought advice from independent fire safety experts, and, where required, have put in place additional measures to ensure that the buildings are fully compliant with the government’s guidance on interim fire safety measures. in central london c.52% of private completions for 2018 are forward sold, as at 18 february 2018 (2017 equivalent period: 58%). we are confident that our well-capitalised balance sheet together with our high-quality landbank with outlets located in places where demand is high and where people want to live provides the flexibility and resilience needed to manage all types of market conditions through the cycle. our strategy is built on this and so seeks to protect growth whilst mitigating future downside risk. why we are different 1 2 3 read more on pages 10 and 11. read more on pages 24 and 25. read more on page 21. dual stream dividend underpins value we are confident that the quality of our short term landbank, with the underpin of our significant strategic land pipeline, combined with a high-quality balance sheet, will mean that we can continue to be cash generative through the cycle, enabling us to sustain a significant ordinary dividend to shareholders on an annual basis, including through a ‘normal’ downturn. we believe that we can deliver enhanced value through the housing cycle and benefit shareholders by driving the outputs of our strategy in three main areas: – dividend policy – medium term financial targets (2016-2018) – further continuous operational improvement our medium term targets (2016-2018) 2017 performance an average annual return on net operating assets** of: 30% 32.4% an average operating profit* margin of: c.22% 21.2% total dividends to be paid in cash to shareholders over the period: £1.3bn £450.5m our long term strategic goals: – deliver at least a 15% return on net operating assets** through the housing cycle – earn top quartile operating profit* margin – grow net assets by 10% per annum on average through the housing cycle (including returns to shareholders) we will be hosting a strategy day in may 2018, where we will update the market on our views of long term strategy. this enables us to achieve the right planning permissions and ensure our developments are valued by their local communities. what we do good-quality land with planning is the critical ‘raw material’ for our business. we are focused on selecting the right land and developing it in a sustainable manner. continue to focus on selecting the right land and developing it in a sustainable manner. our kpis 88% customer satisfaction risk link to kpi d e f kpi link to remuneration read more on pages 32 and 33. progress in 2017 having introduced a number of customer service initiatives in recent years, such as the newly created role of head of customer service and the home quality inspection (hqi), a key focus in 2017 has been embedding the new processes and delivering a consistent standard. there is nothing more important to us than providing a safe place in which our employees and subcontractors can work. we have a relentless focus on value at every stage of our business model and this is ingrained into the taylor wimpey mindset. it is chaired by lee bishop, our major developments director and representative of the gmt. case study ingrid osborne was selected for the cranfield school of management’s “100 women to watch 2017”. as leaders we have a critical role to play in creating the right culture and leading by example. we offer a range of trainee positions to attract young people and address specific skills gaps. q&a 23 taylorwimpey.co.uk our approach we believe that the land market and planning environment have significantly changed over recent years. we employ dedicated land teams in each of our 24 regional businesses, who use their expertise and local knowledge to identify potential high-quality, sustainable sites. during the year, and as previously announced, we added a further site to our major developments portfolio of large scale land opportunities. case study in 2017, taylor wimpey midlands purchased freehold land known as flying fields, southam, warwickshire. the land was acquired with an outline planning permission for 535 new homes of which 35% is to be affordable housing. our approach goes well beyond regulatory requirements, with engagement starting before we submit a planning application and continuing throughout the development process. during 2017 we worked with communities, planners and landowners to convert a further 7,863 plots from the strategic pipeline. we believe that the land market and planning environment have significantly changed over recent years. our annual injury incidence rate (aiir) for reportable injuries per 100,000 employees and contractors reduced to 152 in 2017 (2016: 211). on sites where there are tall buildings with aluminium composite material cladding, we have sought advice from independent fire safety experts, and, where required, have put in place additional measures to ensure that the buildings are fully compliant with the government’s guidance on interim fire safety measures. during peak periods, taylor wimpey logistics pick, package and dispatch up to 100,000 items in 1,500 build packs on around 60 lorries per week. we will be reviewing the wider standard house type range to further refine in 2018. build costs our scale affords us the benefit of strong purchasing power, and we can achieve significant cost savings across our regional businesses with national agreements with a number of suppliers. taylor wimpey logistics plays an important part in our supply chain management, providing us with an alternative route to delivery and aiding efficiency with the preparation of ‘just in time’ build packs for each stage of the building process. climate change has the potential to impact our business strategy in a number of ways. however, we also work with many smaller businesses, providing labour and services, including companies that are local to our development sites. in 2017, this included research at 16 completed sites that explored the impact of design and placemaking on customer satisfaction. taking this approach can also help if, and when, there is greater competition in high growth areas. for example, following our design competition with the riba, we will be building a series of prototype homes incorporating sustainable build technologies and off-site production techniques. these include factors that may affect our reputation and which can come from many sources. our customers and our corporate obligation are at the heart of taylor wimpey’s cultural values, which were launched to all employees in 2016. the enhanced customer journey is in place and we have focused heavily on product quality. the government has recently launched a consultation on leasehold properties, and this may result in changes to future ground rent structures. whilst our business model, like most other volume housebuilders, is to transfer the freehold, management and upkeep of apartment and other developments to third party organisations, we note that potential changes may arise from the consultation. on sites where there are tall buildings with aluminium composite material cladding, we sought advice from independent fire safety experts, and, where required, have put in place additional measures to ensure that the buildings are fully compliant with the government’s guidance on interim fire safety measures. where cil charges are not in place, there could be an impact on gaining planning consent or judicial review challenge. 38 taylor wimpey plc annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report risk relevance to strategy potential impact on kpis mitigation progress in 2017 b impact of market environment on mortgage availability and demand the cost of servicing a mortgage continues to be at historic lows. however, a change in business confidence, employment opportunities or significant changes in the bank of england base rate that is not combined with wage growth could impact the demand for housing, which may also lead to lower selling prices. furthermore, the bank of england has powers to set loan-to-value and debt-to-income limits for financial institutions selling residential mortgages. this may be tempered to some extent by the current imbalance between demand and supply. a reduction in demand for new homes below normal levels could negatively impact on both profit and cash generation. we are well underway with a project to take on more direct labour across the majority of trades. the cost of these key products has risen significantly and whilst other material costs have been stable in 2017 we are experiencing more cost pressure coming into 2018. the supply of quality subcontractors and labour generally remains challenging. there continues to be competition amongst employers in the housebuilding and construction industries for sector-specific staff. we monitor employee turnover levels closely and conduct exit interviews to identify any areas for improvement. limited availability of good-quality land at an attractive price throughout the housing cycle can lead to significant and unsustainable competition. we are mindful of external factors and continue to critically assess opportunities for robustness in changing circumstances. the group strategy is underpinned by our short term landbank, which supports 5.1 years of development at current completion levels. the assessment considers sensitivity analysis on a series of realistically possible, but severe and prolonged, changes to principal assumptions. in addition to the potentially tragic personal impact of an accident on site or after customer completion, there is potential for legal proceedings and civil, financial penalties, reputational damage and delay to the site’s progress. we continue to compare very favourably with the uk housebuilding and construction industry in terms of site safety. in 2017, 5% (2016: 5%) of the group’s uk completions were from sites that had been previously impaired. other direct costs and selling expenses per unit decreased marginally to £6.0k (2016: £6.2k), being 2.3% of total revenue (2016: 2.4%). † ** wip turn is defined as total revenue divided by the average of opening and closing work in progress. return on net operating assets** increased by 1.7 percentage points to 32.4% (2016: 30.7%), mainly reflecting improved profitability while maintaining balance sheet discipline. pensions as at 31 december 2017, the ias 19 defined benefit pension scheme valuation is in surplus by £23.9 million. during 2017, a medically underwritten mortality study (mums) was commissioned in addition to using postcode analysis data which has historically formed the basis of member

excellent experience gained from both her previous executive positions and also from her non executive roles, all of which will help to further strengthen the board’s expertise, including our ongoing focus on customer service. the board has put in place arrangements designed to facilitate contact with shareholders concerning business, governance, remuneration and other relevant topics. more details are set out on pages 6, 14, 21 and 28 to 29. engagement with our customers delivering high levels of customer satisfaction enhances the reputation of our business and reduces the costs associated with rectifying poor quality work. the board receives monthly reports on customer service matters, at group level and for each operating division. directors make every effort to attend all board and applicable committee meetings, as strongly evidenced by the exceptionally strong attendance records over many years. see page 61. all directors should be submitted for re-election at regular intervals, subject to continued satisfactory performance. pete redfern, chief executive, has operational responsibility for delivering the company’s strategy in a profitable, safe and environmentally responsible manner. accordingly, there is a code of business conduct, which sets out the standard for individual dealings both internally and externally. all business units receive training each year from external experts on legislative and regulatory matters. the board considers that there is an effective balance with three executive directors and six (shortly to become five, with effect from 26 april 2018) non executive directors plus myself as chairman, which ensures that each viewpoint is properly represented around the board table. for gwyn burr, who was appointed on 1 february 2018, this evaluation took place as part of the appointment process. for gwyn burr, who was appointed with effect from 1 february 2018, this evaluation took place as part of the appointment process. in addition, all new appointments and interests of directors are reported to the board for consideration or noting as appropriate. this included not only attendance at board and applicable committee meetings (where attendance was 100% during 2017 for all directors, save for mike hussey missing one meeting of the board and of the audit committee as noted on page 52), but also preparation time for meetings, visits to our businesses and other additional requirements that may be required from time to time. this will be a topic for nomination committee consideration during 2018. each of these key areas remains firmly on the board’s agenda during 2018 and an update will be provided in the 2018 annual report and accounts. – monitored those significant it initiatives that either directly protect, support and enhance the current it environment or that are key in their contribution to business initiatives underway to enhance the experience of customers, suppliers and employees. committee members number of meetings attended humphrey singer (chairman) (a) 3/3 kate barker 3/3 mike hussey (b) 2/3 angela knight 3/3 rob rowley 3/3 (a) humphrey singer was appointed chairman on 10 january 2018 as successor to rob rowley, who chaired the committee throughout 2017. as described in the nomination committee report on page 69, there is a formal process of induction for new directors and this includes specific reference to assisting competence in relevant committee areas through exposure to appropriate areas of the company’s operations and performance. the board’s assessments use a standard methodology which takes into account environmental, social and governance considerations. it also reviews progress and performance in action taken to mitigate the impact of those risks. in addition, fees for eligible non-audit services are not to exceed 70% of the group audit fee, calculated on a rolling three-year basis. non-audit services in 2017 predominantly related to work undertaken as a result of deloitte’s role as auditors, in particular the assurance work carried out in connection with the announcement of the company’s half year results for 2017, which is of direct benefit to shareholders although it is not formally regarded as ‘audit’ work for reporting purposes. these reports outline internal audit’s opinion of the management control framework in place together with actions indicating improvements proposed or made as appropriate. the internal audit function also formally reviews proposed related-party transactions, such as purchases by employees from group companies, to ensure proper procedures are followed and that such procedures are undertaken strictly in accordance with the formal policy in place and, where applicable, company law. – kate barker will succeed rob as the board’s senior independent director with effect from 26 april 2018. – to drive the company’s diversity and inclusivity agenda across all levels of our business. these programs for directors were reviewed during the year and are considered to remain appropriate. we are also focusing upon recruiting individuals from a wider range of backgrounds, experience and industries at all levels. rob rowley stood down as chairman of the audit committee on 10 january 2018 and was succeeded in this position by humphrey singer. in addition, our whistleblowing policy encourages employees to speak up, including through an independent ‘safecall’ telephone facility, against any inappropriate practices or behaviour and we regularly publicise the policy to all staff and workers on site. we will identify people management practices that assist a diverse workforce to achieve their full potential. we will use our community engagement programme to heighten awareness of personal interaction and valuing individuals. we will extend our recruitment sources in order to attract a more diverse range of applicants. the new hr information system is better capturing data relating to all aspects of diversity and inclusion. a specific focus of the company’s whistleblowing campaign is on diversity, encouraging employees to speak up against any inappropriate practices or behaviour. our grievance policy ensures that any reports of harassment or bullying are investigated and acted upon. feedback was incredibly positive in terms of creating an environment where individuals could share personal challenges and development areas. although it is still early days, i very much look forward to working with this important new body. currently we are focusing on

return (tsr) against a housebuilders group (30%) and against the ftse 100 (20%). salaries are normally reviewed annually to ensure that they remain competitive with external market practices and are competitive when measured against ftse peers (other non-ﬁnancial companies of a similar size in terms of market capitalisation and other large uk housebuilders).there is no automatic entitlement to an increase each year. non executive directors do not participate in any incentive, share scheme, benefits-in-kind or pension arrangements. no more than one home per annum can be acquired at a discount under the scheme. compulsory deferral in shares is designed to further align the interests of directors with shareholders. one-third of any eis payable is deferred into shares for three years and held in trust. the sharesave plan and sip have standard terms under which all uk employees with at least three months’ service can participate. – the ability to adjust existing performance conditions for exceptional events so that they can still fulfil their original purpose. targets are set based on a sliding scale that takes account of internal planning and external market expectations for the company. for further details see employee involvement on page 96. the company also offers both sharesave and share incentive schemes to all eligible uk employees with more than three months’ service. tax equalisation may also be considered if an executive is adversely affected by taxation due to their employment with the company. replacement share awards, if used, will be granted using taylor wimpey’s existing share plans wherever and to the extent possible, although in exceptional circumstances awards may also be granted outside of these schemes if necessary and as permitted under the listing rules. – employer’s contribution to a pension scheme (details of which are set out on page 79). any such payment will typically reflect the individual’s salary, bonus entitlement, benefits in kind and pension entitlements. where an executive director is considered by the remuneration committee to be a good leaver, deferred eis awards (shares) would vest. psp awards are subject to a two year post vesting holding period for 2018 and future vestings. details of any share awards made to executive directors during 2018 will be included in the 2018 remuneration report. the level of required shareholding for executive directors to attain is two times base salary. executive directors are also required to retain at least 50% of their net of taxes gain arising from any shares vesting or acquired pursuant to the company’s long term incentive plans, until such time as the guidelines have been met. in line with recent practice and good governance, voting on all resolutions at this year’s agm will again be conducted by way of a poll. no person has any special rights of control over the company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. through 2017 our regional teams have been working with the competition winners openstudio, to develop their designs for use in three trial sites. we currently have limited control over our subcontractor base in terms of their size, growth, mobility, skills, training, recruitment and commitment. during 2017 we completed a further talkback survey, with the overall results continuing to be extremely positive. it was also very pleasing to see improved scores in areas such as customer service, flexible working, training, benefits package and how employees feel that our cultural principles make taylor wimpey a better place to work, which were clear areas of focus following the 2015 survey. our intranet includes a wide range of employee information from human resources policies to advice for employees on sustainable living. it also includes an ‘open door’ forum that puts employees directly in touch with our chief executive. chaired by tim betts, divisional managing director, the first nef meeting took place in october 2017, with topics discussed including customer service and business attire. during 2017, we also saw the launch of our first e-learning modules, which can be accessed via any pc, laptop tablet or mobile phone. we are also raising awareness more generally around data protection and the new gdpr regime. equal opportunities we strive to treat our employees fairly and with respect at all times. in exceptional circumstances, for example due to health and safety considerations on construction sites, some adjustments are not possible. instruction on equal opportunities is part of the induction programme and we have created two diversity e-learning educational modules which will help employees to understand in more detail our commitment to building a more diverse and inclusive workforce. our diversity policy can be found on the company’s website at www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/corporate/sustainability/our-policies employment of people with disabilities it is our policy that people with disabilities should have fair consideration for all vacancies within the group. the company will shortly be publishing its second statement under the modern slavery act 2015. it will be available on our website at www.taylorwimpey.co.uk charitable donations we support charities and issues that are relevant to our business, communities, partners and people. following the introduction of our volunteering policy in 2016, whereby employees are entitled to take up to four half-days (or two full days) paid leave per year, many employees at all levels around the country gave up their work and free time to participate in fundraising events for charitable causes including st. mungo’s; the youth adventure trust; crash; crisis uk and centrepoint, which raised a further £295,000 (2016:

an operating segment covering the corporate functions, major developments and strategic land. income and expense items are tr anslated at an appropriate average rate for the year. exchange differences arising are recognised within other comprehensive income and transferred to the group’s translation reserve. software development costs costs that are directly associated with the acquisition or production of identifiable and unique software controlled by the group, and that generate economic benefits beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over three to five years from the time of implementation, and are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. depreciation is charged so as to expense the cost or valuation of assets over their estimated useful lives. if the recoverable amount of tangible fixed assets exceeds their carrying value, no further impairment is required. trade receivables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land, are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. if the recoverable amount of tangible fixed assets exceeds their carrying value, no further impairment is required. trade receivables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land, are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. as actual changes in inflation, growth, yields and investment returns may differ from those assumed, this is a key source of esti mation uncertainty within the financial statements. under ifrs 9 the shared equity port folio will be treated as fair value through profit and loss. introductory fees are currently deducted from revenue but under the new standard will be recognised in cost of sales. under ifrs 9 the shared equity port folio will be
