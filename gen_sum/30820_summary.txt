More information can be found on pages  28 to 30, including details of our own internal review following the tragic events  at Grenfell Tower, London, in June 2017. Through 2017, demand for new build housing has remained robust  supported by healthy employment trends, a competitive mortgage market  and the Government’s Help to Buy scheme. Our Project 2020 design  competition in partnership with the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA)  attracted over 100 entries from 14 different countries. On sites  where there are tall buildings with Aluminium Composite Material cladding,   we have sought advice from independent fire safety experts, and, where  required, have put in place additional measures to ensure that the buildings  are fully compliant with the Government’s guidance on interim fire safety  measures. Creating  value across  the cycle Stakeholder engagement: We strive to be an open, transparent and responsive company for all our stakeholders. There is nothing more important to us than providing a safe place in  which our employees and subcontractors can work. We have a relentless focus on value at every stage of our business model  and this is ingrained into the Taylor Wimpey mindset. Importantly it highlighted areas  which needed further work, including better  collaboration between teams, and we will be  focusing on this in 2018. We  employ dedicated land teams in each of our 24  regional businesses, who use their expertise and  local knowledge to identify potential high-quality,  sustainable sites. During the year, and as previously announced,  we added a further site to our Major Developments  portfolio of large scale land opportunities. Our  approach goes well beyond regulatory  requirements, with engagement starting before we  submit a planning application and continuing  throughout the development process. On sites  where there are tall buildings with Aluminium  Composite Material cladding, we have sought  advice from independent fire safety experts, and,  where required, have put in place additional  measures to ensure that the buildings are fully  compliant with the Government’s guidance on  interim fire safety measures. During peak periods, Taylor Wimpey Logistics  pick, package and dispatch up to 100,000  items in 1,500 build packs on around 60  lorries per week. However, we  also work with many smaller businesses, providing  labour and services, including companies that are  local to our development sites. Our target was a 25% reduction  in scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions per  100 square metres of completed homes by 2018  compared with 2013. For example, following our design  competition with the RIBA, we will be  building a series of prototype homes  incorporating sustainable build technologies  and off-site production techniques. The Government has recently launched a consultation on leasehold  properties, and this may result in changes to future ground rent structures. On sites  where there are tall buildings with Aluminium Composite Material cladding, we  sought advice from independent fire safety experts, and, where required, have  put in place additional measures to ensure that the buildings are fully  compliant with the Government’s guidance on interim fire safety measures. Where CIL charges are not in  place, there could be an  impact on gaining planning  consent or Judicial Review  challenge. Limited availability of  good-quality land at an  attractive price throughout the  housing cycle can lead to  significant and unsustainable  competition. During 2017, a  Medically Underwritten Mortality Study (MUMS) was commissioned in addition  to using postcode analysis data which has historically formed the basis of  member life expectancy. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 £m Contribution to local communities Employment Pension contributions Taxes Net investment in land and WIP Debt servicing Dividends 2014 2015 2016 2017 For our Viability Statement see page 41. James Jordan Group Legal Director and  Company Secretary Date of appointment Joined July 2011 Skills & experience James, a solicitor, was previously  Group Company Secretary and  General Counsel of George  Wimpey Plc from February 2002  until July 2007, when, following  the merger, he was appointed to  the same position with Taylor  Wimpey plc. External appointments James is a Trustee of the  Tennis Foundation charity  where he also chairs their   Audit and Remuneration   Committees. – Made good progress towards achieving our strategy for improving  diversity and inclusivity at all levels throughout the Group’s businesses. Details of this engagement during 2017 and into 2018,  together with our actions taken in response, are set out on page 51. The Board has put in place arrangements designed to  facilitate contact with shareholders concerning business, governance,  remuneration and other relevant topics. Directors make every effort to attend all Board and applicable Committee  meetings, as strongly evidenced by the exceptionally strong attendance  records over many years. Pete Redfern, Chief Executive, has operational responsibility for delivering  the Company’s strategy in a profitable, safe and environmentally  responsible manner. Accordingly, there is a Code of Business Conduct, which sets  out the standard for individual dealings both internally and externally. For Gwyn Burr, who was appointed with effect  from 1 February 2018, this evaluation took place as part of the appointment  process. In addition, all new appointments and interests of  Directors are reported to the Board for consideration or noting as appropriate. In  addition, fees for eligible non-audit services are not to exceed 70% of the  Group audit fee, calculated on a rolling three-year basis. These reports outline Internal Audit’s opinion of the  management control framework in place together with actions indicating  improvements proposed or made as appropriate. Rob Rowley stood down as Chairman of the Audit Committee on  10 January 2018 and was succeeded in this position by Humphrey Singer. A specific focus of the Company’s whistleblowing campaign is on diversity, encouraging  employees to speak up against any inappropriate practices or behaviour. Salaries are normally reviewed annually to ensure  that they remain competitive with external market  practices and are competitive when measured  against FTSE peers (other non-ﬁnancial companies  of a similar size in terms of market capitalisation and  other large UK housebuilders).There is no automatic  entitlement to an increase each year. The Sharesave plan and SIP have standard terms  under which all UK employees with at least three  months’ service can participate. Targets are set based  on a sliding scale that takes account of internal planning and external market  expectations for the Company. The Company also offers both Sharesave and Share Incentive schemes to all  eligible UK employees with more than three months’ service. Tax equalisation may also be considered if an executive is  adversely affected by taxation due to their employment with the Company. Where an Executive Director is considered by the Remuneration Committee  to be a good leaver, deferred EIS awards (shares) would vest. In line with recent  practice and good governance, voting on all resolutions at this year’s AGM will  again be conducted by way of a poll. No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital  and all issued shares are fully paid. Through 2017 our  regional teams have been working with the competition winners Openstudio,  to develop their designs for use in three trial sites. We currently  have limited control over our subcontractor base in terms of their size, growth,  mobility, skills, training, recruitment and commitment. Our intranet includes a wide range of employee information from  human resources policies to advice for employees on sustainable living. Chaired  by Tim Betts, Divisional Managing Director, the first NEF meeting took place  in October 2017, with topics discussed including customer service and  business attire. During 2017, we also saw the launch of our first e-learning modules, which  can be accessed via any PC, laptop tablet or mobile phone. – State whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed,  subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the  financial statements. Where differences fell outsid e of an acceptable threshold, we performed corroborative inquir ies with  Management and obtained evidence supporting the variance.

The IFRIC 14 deficit at 31 December 2017 does not include any value in respect of this bullet payment as mo delling undertaken by an  independent actuary indicates that the Scheme is expected to be fully funded by 2028 and therefore no bullet payment is expecte d to be required.
