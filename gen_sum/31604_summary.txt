currency. easyjet’s focus on rigorous cost control continues to deliver excellent results and supported the investment in operational resilience. at constant currency the headline cost per seat decreased by 4.4% as easyjet continued to benefit from its hedged fuel position. this helped to offset: • a continued increase in the combined impact on cost from disruption of eu 261 claims and an increasingly congested european aviation infrastructure. £ 5.0bn revenue (2016: £4.7bn) 4.4% headline cost per seat improvement from the 2016 financial year, restated at constant currency 11 www.easyjet.com strategic report purposeful investment to build strong number one and number two network positions easyjet’s strategy is focused on primary airports, serving valuable catchment areas that represent europe’s top markets by gdp. these are strong, existing markets, built up over a period of time by legacy carriers. reflecting the airline’s discipline, it also discontinued 20 routes which either did not meet expected return criteria, or became secondary to a more attractive route elsewhere. easyjet has continued to focus on key markets, growing market share in the uk, switzerland and italy. • inflationary cost increases such as agreed crew deals and start-up costs related to the introduction of a new ground handling company, dhl, at gatwick. economic trends remain favourable across europe with continued gdp growth supporting spending in all easyjet’s major countries. for example, despite 80% of outbound airports being regulated, airport and ground handling costs decreased by 1.3% per seat at constant currency. • 20% of all easyjet passengers now travel through an automated bag drop area with further automation planned to be rolled out across the network. • easyjet is using data science and its strong relationship with airbus to support predictive maintenance, which will drive further long-term cost savings. • capacity limitation events at gatwick airport such as the disruption caused by a burst tyre on an air canada flight in july. this will deliver c.£15 million of annualised saving, with a six to nine month payback on the investment. through the app customers can also add bags, seats, hotels, cars, insurance, lounges, transfers and, most recently, in-destination activities. following these upgrades, queue times at manual bag drop desks have declined with 90% of our customers waiting fewer than five minutes. this has seen customer satisfaction scores for baggage drop wait time increase by 22 percentage points year-on-year. autobag drop has been rolled out to six further airports in total since introduction at gatwick. easyjet is building increasingly strong relationships with its customers through the use of personalised data. easyjet’s customer relationship management (crm) database of marketable customers increased by 5.6% during the year to 27.7 million. the airline is exploring new distribution channels, partner agreements and structures such as connectivity with other airlines. during the 2017 financial year, bag revenue increased by 30% above projection due to improved pricing algorithms. this was aided by the recovery from shock events (which disproportionately impacted short-term travel) and an increase in business flexi revenue. this year negotiations with global distribution system (gds) partners helped to drive costs savings of over £1 million. by optimising a scaleable organisational design, focusing on accountabilities and empowerment, it will enhance ways of working that will support more effective and cost-efficient growth as well as more agile decision making that best fits easyjet’s entrepreneurial culture. pricing is competitive with other sources of funding and frees up cash for use in the business. hedging positions easyjet operates under a clear set of treasury policies agreed by the board. brexit plans and share ownership in july easyjet announced that it had established a

europe and domestically within european countries after the uk has left the eu (regardless of the outcome of talks on a future uk-eu aviation agreement). as such, easyjet has no current intention of using these proposed powers, in respect of non-eu holders of easyjet shares but considers these changes an important step in ensuring that easyjet plc has the ability to maintain eu ownership and control at all times should it need to do so and thus secure its future operations in europe for the long-term. based on current assumptions, easyjet expects to incur headline losses of around £60 million on its activities at tegel in the 2018 financial year, as it starts up operations in january 2018 using wet lease aircraft with initially lower loads and yields. on a personal note, this will

liquidity (cash plus revolving credit facility) per 100 aircraft seats. performance: this remains significantly above the liquidity buffer to cover peak unearned revenue with a minimum position of £2.6 million per 100 seats. performance: overall customer satisfaction was lower than the prior year primarily due to increased disruption. partially offsetting these impacts was growth in ancillary revenue which grew by 8.6% to £11.38 per seat, as initiatives and high load factors offset ticket pricing pressures. at constant currency, easyjet delivered a headline profit before tax of £509 million during the year. partially offsetting these impacts was growth in ancillary revenue which grew by 8.6% to £11.38 per seat, as initiatives and high load factors offset ticket pricing pressures. this was mainly driven by an increase in disruption costs due to a greater level of eu 261 compensation claims and an increase in welfare costs driven by significant industrial strike action and adverse weather conditions. this european aoc helps secure future flying rights for the 30% of easyjet’s network which remains wholly within and between eu member states; • a £2 million non-cash gain

systems. easyjet seeks to maintain positive working relationships with all trade unions and other representative bodies. • market risks – significant/sudden increases in jet fuel prices, currency fluctuations or interest rates which have not been adequately protected through hedging. there are approximately 7,400 a320 family aircraft operating with a proven track record for safety and reliability. increased competition in the recruitment market may impact easyjet’s ability to attract and retain key talent. this includes pilot sponsorship and the amy johnston flying initiative to attract more female pilots. in addition, easyjet has developed a coherent employment brand to attract and retain top talent. shareholder activism on their part could adversely impact the reputation of easyjet and cause a distraction to management. link to strategy: easyjet has an active shareholder engagement programme led by its investor relations team. as part of that programme easyjet engages

eight countries across europe, complying with national laws. this has a higher cost than the approach taken by some other airlines that employ all their people on one contract, irrespective of where they may work. easyjet does this so that its roles are attractive locally and to reflect each country’s employment practices. female make up of: worldwide pilot community easyjet new entrant pilots in
