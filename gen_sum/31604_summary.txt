Grow revenue We have a clear focus on building strong relationships with customers to create more sustainable, long-term revenues, leveraging quality, innovation and digital. easyJet’s focus on rigorous cost control continues to deliver excellent results and supported the investment in operational resilience. At constant currency the headline cost per seat decreased by 4.4% as easyJet continued to benefit from its hedged fuel position. This helped to offset: • A continued increase in the combined impact on cost from disruption of EU 261 claims and an increasingly congested European aviation infrastructure. £ 5.0bn REVENUE (2016: £4.7BN) 4.4% HEADLINE COST PER SEAT IMPROVEMENT FROM THE 2016 FINANCIAL YEAR, RESTATED AT CONSTANT CURRENCY 11 www.easyJet.com STRATEGIC REPORT PURPOSEFUL INVESTMENT TO BUILD STRONG NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO NETWORK POSITIONS easyJet’s strategy is focused on primary airports, serving valuable catchment areas that represent Europe’s top markets by GDP. Reflecting the airline’s discipline, it also discontinued 20 routes which either did not meet expected return criteria, or became secondary to a more attractive route elsewhere. • Inflationary cost increases such as agreed crew deals and start-up costs related to the introduction of a new ground handling company, DHL, at Gatwick. For example, despite 80% of outbound airports being regulated, airport and ground handling costs decreased by 1.3% per seat at constant currency. • 20% of all easyJet passengers now travel through an automated bag drop area with further automation planned to be rolled out across the network. • easyJet is using data science and its strong relationship with Airbus to support predictive maintenance, which will drive further long-term cost savings. • Capacity limitation events at Gatwick airport such as the disruption caused by a burst tyre on an Air Canada flight in July. Through the app customers can also add bags, seats, hotels, cars, insurance, lounges, transfers and, most recently, in-destination activities. Following these upgrades, queue times at manual bag drop desks have declined with 90% of our customers waiting fewer than five minutes. This was aided by the recovery from shock events (which disproportionately impacted short-term travel) and an increase in Business Flexi revenue.

The Board is responsible for risk management and ensuring appropriate mitigating actions are being taken to manage risks effectively. The impact of such an incident would be heightened if easyJet failed to react promptly and deal with it effectively. • Market risks – significant/sudden increases in jet fuel prices, currency fluctuations or interest rates which have not been adequately protected through hedging. As part of that programme easyJet engages with easyGroup Holdings Limited on a regular basis alongside its other major shareholders.

A GOOD CITIZEN AIM HOW EASYJET IS DOING THIS KEY HIGHLIGHTS DELIVERING OUR COMMITMENTS We’re here to connect people across Europe for work and leisure. Security risk assessments, informed by the current geopolitical situation, are made for each country and airport to which easyJet flies. easyJet has been working with industry partners through Airline UK’s Code of Practice which encourages voluntary action. For more information, see our online gender pay report at www.easyjet.com DISABILITY easyJet treats applicants with disabilities equally and supports current employees who become disabled. This has a higher cost than the approach taken by some other airlines that employ all their people on one contract, irrespective of where they may work. easyJet does this so that its roles are attractive locally and to reflect each country’s employment practices.

The Board reviews its Committee membership each year to ensure that undue reliance is not placed on individuals. Directors are encouraged to highlight specific areas where they feel their skills or knowledge would benefit from further development as part of the annual Board evaluation process. As noted above, Carolyn McCall is not eligible to receive a bonus in respect of the 2017 financial year. However, we are recommending some minor amendments to increase flexibility, enhance clarity and further strengthen alignment with shareholders’ interests. This revised policy will be put to shareholders for approval in a binding vote at the AGM on 8 February 2018. The following assumptions have been made: • Minimum (performance below threshold) – Fixed pay only with no vesting under any of easyJet’s incentive plans. Fixed pay Annual Bonus LTIP (Performance) Below threshold CHIEF EXECUTIVE (JOHAN LUNDGREN) Exceeds target In line with expectations £4,124,000 £2,459,000 £794,000 19% 32% 100% 36% 45% 38% 30% Fixed pay Annual Bonus LTIP (Performance) Below threshold CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER (ANDREW FINDLAY) Exceeds target In line with expectations £2,230,000 £1,363,000 £496,000 22% 36% 100% 36% 41% 34% 30% The scenarios do not include any share price growth or dividend assumptions. Any incentive offered above this limit would be contingent on the Company receiving shareholder approval for an amendment to its approved policy. Necessary expenses incurred undertaking Group business will be reimbursed so that the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not worse off, on a net of tax basis, for fulfilling Company duties. However, retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be provided in next year’s remuneration report unless they remain commercially sensitive at that time. (9) Performance related buy-out arrangements were agreed to compensate Andrew Findlay for bonus and LTIP forfeited from his previous employer. (5) Deferred bonus shares outstanding beyond the Chief Executive’s departure date have lapsed due to her resignation in July 2017. (i) British Airways, Lufthansa, Ryanair, Air France-KLM and Iberia have all been included in the comparative European Airlines group.

Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of assets, on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives. A number of operating leases require easyJet to make contingent rental payments based on variable interest rates; these are expensed as incurred. Where non-market performance criteria (such as ROCE) attached to the share options and awards are not met, any cumulative expense previously recognised is reversed. Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where they relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority. • Level 2, fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over the counter derivatives), which are determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. Financial risk management aims to limit these market risks with selected derivative hedging instruments being used for this purpose. Exposures to these counterparties are regularly reviewed and, if the long-term credit rating falls below A- management will take remedial action. As at 30 September 2017 easyJet had agreements with third parties for which fees were contingent upon the completion of acquisition activities totalling £4 million (2016: £nil). 132 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2017 WE’D LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE WHO HAS HELPED TO PRODUCE THIS REPORT : Paul Ablin, Adèle Anderson, Michael Barker, Meena Bhatia-Ahir, Mita Bhattacharjee, Maxwell Bruce, Matthew Callaghan, Louise Cardani, Anna Carter, Phil Chastell, Peter Duffy, Andrew Findlay, James Fisher, Matt Garner, Bill Gosbee, Mike Hirst, Sarah Kayser, Nick Kennedy, Matt Landsman, Rosie Lobb, Carolyn McCall DBE, Tom Minion, Paul Moore, Stuart Morgan, Kyla Mullins, Matthew Newman, Mark Ramsden, Natalie Roberts, Sarahjane Robertson, Zarina Sabir, Jade Steele, Chris Sominka, Ben Souter, Rebecca Waite, Charlotte Warner, Mario Yiannopoulos and all of our employees across the network.
