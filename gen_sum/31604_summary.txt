continued to benefit from its hedged fuel position. this helped to offset: • a continued increase in the combined impact on cost from disruption of eu 261 claims and an increasingly congested european aviation infrastructure. reflecting the airline’s discipline, it also discontinued 20 routes which either did not meet expected return criteria, or became secondary to a more attractive route elsewhere. • inflationary cost increases such as agreed crew deals and start-up costs related to the introduction of a new ground handling company, dhl, at gatwick. for example, despite 80% of outbound airports being regulated, airport and ground handling costs decreased by 1.3% per seat at constant currency. • 20% of all easyjet passengers now travel through an automated bag drop area with further automation planned to be rolled out across the network. • easyjet is using data science and its strong relationship with airbus to support predictive maintenance, which will drive further long-term cost savings. • capacity limitation events at gatwick airport such as the disruption caused by a burst tyre on an air canada flight in july. following these upgrades, queue times at manual bag drop desks have declined with 90% of our customers waiting fewer than five minutes. this was aided by the recovery from shock events (which disproportionately impacted short-term travel) and an increase in business flexi revenue. brexit plans and share ownership in july easyjet announced that it had established a new airline, easyjet europe, which is headquartered in vienna and will enable

amendment to its approved policy. necessary expenses incurred undertaking group business will be reimbursed so that the chairman and non-executive directors are not worse off, on a net of tax basis, for fulfilling company duties. however, retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be provided in next year’s remuneration report unless they remain commercially sensitive at that time. depreciation is calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of assets, on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives. a number of operating leases require easyjet to make contingent rental payments based on variable interest rates; these are expensed as incurred. where non-market performance criteria (such as roce) attached to the share options and awards are not met, any cumulative expense previously recognised is reversed. exposures to these counterparties are regularly reviewed and, if the long-term credit rating falls below a- management will take remedial action. as at 30 september 2017 easyjet had agreements with third parties for which fees were contingent upon the completion of acquisition activities totalling £4
