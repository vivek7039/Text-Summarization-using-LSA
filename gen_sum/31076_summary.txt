financial statements 2017 progress conversion to redox-based gas sweetening to significantly reduce processing costs and substantially eliminate waste disposal requirements. 2018 objectives — seek to optimise extraction of oil from existing wells, including the new horizontal well. within these constraints, the board would consider distributing up to 75% of its free cash flow as dividends. the lpg project is expected to commence producing and selling product from april 2018. when it is fully operational, the lpg plant could add up to 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day of incremental sales volumes. unfortunately, volga gas has recently experienced higher formation water content at certain production wells at vostochny makarovskoye (“vm”) and so the board thought it appropriate to commission an updated independent reserves report and prudent to adopt its findings in full. during 2016 and early 2017 , after extensive investigations and pilot tests, management concluded that a switch to redox-based sweetening would be most advantageous – not only for reduced cost but also for the elimination of waste material that required disposal. current trading and outlook between january and march 2018, group production averaged 4,084 barrels of oil equivalent per day, in line with management’s plan, given the anticipated higher levels of planned maintenance downtime in the period. this issue has been dealt with and since december 2017 all of the processed gas is available for sale. having recently completed this, management expects improvements in efficiency, reduced operational downtime and higher effective operating capacity. lpgs, primarily comprising propane and butane, are currently either included in the sales gas stream or flared. between january and march 2018, well #101 has been producing at an average rate of approximately 300 bopd. production-based taxes were us$10.9 million (2016: us$10.3 million) reflecting the impact of higher oil prices and ruble exchange rates on mineral extraction tax (“met”) rates as well as the impact of further formula changes that came into effect on 1 january 2017. this was partly offset by lower production volumes. vadim son chief financial officer 11 volga gas plc annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report c or p or at e governance financial statements cash flow group cash flow from operating activities was us$6.3 million (2016: us$13.3 million). gas sales have generally been conducted as expected, subject to occasional constraints during pipeline maintenance operations. oil and gas production taxes the group’s sales generated from oil and gas production are subject to mineral extraction taxes (“met”), which form a material proportion of the total costs of sales. the group maintains insurance against many potential losses and liabilities arising from its operations in accordance with customary industry practices, but the group’s insurance coverage cannot protect it against all operational risks. revenues are predominantly received in rur, so the operating profitability is not materially exposed to moderate short-term exchange rate movements. the group’s operations and financial management have not been impacted directly by any sanctions to date. further short-term debt facilities may be arranged to provide financial headroom for future development activities. the group has established enhanced protection of its information technology infrastructure, operational systems and procedures against fraudulent activities. at ebrd he was responsible for
