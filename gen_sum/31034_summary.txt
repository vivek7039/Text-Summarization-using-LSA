Profitability was solid, having been impacted by a subdued RMI market, especially in the second half, and higher raw material cost inflation. We have five clear strategic priorities to help us achieve our overall objective: • Target growth in market share.

We recorded one major injury in 2017 (cut to an employee’s hand) under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013 (‘RIDDOR’).

Profit was impacted by raw material cost inflation and a subdued RMI market, especially in the second half.

This allows new build buyers to source consistent products from a wide supplier base, mitigating their delivery risk. Finally, Vista Panels continues to perform very well, with 39% of doors sales now channelled through our branch network. We have implemented window configuration software across the network, using common pricing and specifications for windows supplied to all Eurocell branches. Although we continue to experience cost inflation, a good proportion of this has been mitigated with selling price increases implemented through the year. We have also built a higher level of safety stocks to ensure consistent on-time deliveries, particularly for our new build customers. The Company takes steps to ensure distributable reserves are maintained at an appropriate level through intra-group dividend flows. Our equal opportunities policy requires that we give full and fair consideration to applications for employment by disabled people. This is achieved through training, education and informing our employees about environmental issues that may affect their work. We will strive to continually improve our environmental performance and review this policy in light of any planned future activities.

COMPETITOR ACTIVITY The Group has a number of existing competitors who compete on range, price, quality and service. Any future acquisition we do make poses integration and other risks which may significantly affect our results or operations. Prior to Drax, Michael worked for MT International and Arthur Andersen, where he qualified as a Chartered Accountant. We seek to promote consistently high standards of governance throughout the Group, which are recognised and understood by all. This structure enables the Board to make informed decisions on a range of key issues including strategy and risk management. Now in our third year as a listed business, we have developed open and frequent dialogue with investors. This policy sets out the procedure for employees to raise legitimate concerns about any wrongdoing without fear of criticism, discrimination or reprisal. Further, against a more challenging economic backdrop, the business reported robust financial results and another consistent operational performance. 51 FINaNCI aL STa TEm ENTS OvER vIE w OvER vIE w CORPORa TE gO v ERNaNCE STRa TEg IC REPORT believes these investments leave the Group well placed to deliver further gains in market share and more control of material costs in the future. n/a CORPORa TE gO v ERNaNCE Directors’ Remuneration Report continued 53 FINaNCI aL STa TEm ENTS OvER vIE w OvER vIE w CORPORa TE gO v ERNaNCE STRa TEg IC REPORT Element and Purpose Policy and Operation Maximum Performance Measures Pension To provide retirement benefits.

We tested, on a sample basis, inventory held as at 31 December 2017 to verify that sale prices in 2018 were above cost. We then challenged management in respect of those customers with whom amounts were past due but not impaired to assess for bias. For Eurocell Building Plastics, we tested management’s estimated average branch dilapidations cost to actual costs incurred in respect of leases exited during the current and prior year. 81 OvER vIE w STRa TEg IC REPORT FINaNCI aL STa TEm ENTS CORPORa TE gO v ERNaNCE Management has completed an assessment of its existing contractual relationships with customers, and has determined that there will be no material impact of implementing IFRS 15 on its revenue streams.
