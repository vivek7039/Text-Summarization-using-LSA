Year end net debt at £24.3m (2016: £39.5m) was once again reduced, cumulatively a 78.8% reduction over the same period. Our multichannel operations adapt quickly to changing shopping behaviours so that our customers can deliver the right brand experience CHALLENGES Delivering the right brand experience SALE Both volume and value of last mile deliveries are increasing as consumers are more confident at purchasing goods online. The increasingly complex supply chain that is being driven as a result of this requires pragmatic and well thought through solutions. Customers include: • BAE Systems • Müller Milk & Ingredients • Phillips 66 • Valero Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 8 STRATEGIC REPORT OUR BUSINESS 42% of Group 50% of Group HOW WE ARE RESPONDING Deploying new developments We work closely with our suppliers to trial, evaluate and deploy new equipment. While these challenges may present difficulties, they also generate opportunities for us to expand into new areas. Independent forecourt retailers now make up a significant market share and this has led to an increase in demand for more flexible fuel deliveries. Employees 1 7 ,500 Flexible warehouse facilities An actively managed portfolio of Wincanton and customer locations, from dedicated sites to shared user operations. In order to do this we draw on all our expertise and resources from across the Group. • We create innovative solutions and implement cutting edge technology to drive continuous improvement initiatives with over 500 Lean Six Sigma trained specialists. As a result we have achieved an underlying operating margin of 4.7%, up from 4.3% (excluding WRM) in the prior year. This growth was partly offset by the impact of lost volumes due to contract cessations in Retail grocery and Consumer products. These extended contracts demonstrate our track record of service excellence combined with a compelling commercial approach and added value. Our W 2 Labs initiative has been established in partnership with L Marks, innovation specialists and early-stage investors. The set up and successful Christmas operation of a new National Fulfilment Centre (NFC) for Majestic Wine has again proven our eCommerce expertise. As a UK and Ireland focused business the direct impact to date has been negligible for Wincanton. This decrease is principally due to contract exits, including those from all closed book contracts providing fleet maintenance for home delivery services in the Pullman business. As a result we have achieved an underlying operating margin of 4.7%, marginally up from 4.4% in the prior year (4.3% excluding WRM). Risk registers specific to business unit and support functions are maintained by senior management responsible for those areas. Risk governance The Group faces a diverse range of risks and uncertainties which could have an adverse effect on its success if not managed. Both the EMT and Audit Committee consider risk as a routine agenda item at their respective meetings. Campaigns have included; providing new or more varied healthy foods at sites, wellbeing kiosks, health assessments and exercise classes. Courses are run on a regular basis for first line managers in risk assessment and accident investigation. We pay particular attention to the measurement of Collisions per Million Kilometres (CMK) as a barometer for our performance in these areas. An important KPI for us is measurement of LTIFR, and we track this on a weekly basis. Given the nature of our business and working environments we track all activities closely to identify areas for continual improvement. We have an important part to play in helping our customers achieve their wider environmental goals and we know that a well-managed supply chain plays a key role in mitigating their impact on the environment as well as our own. We use an ISO14001 certified environmental management system and provide monthly performance results across a range of indicators. We also record energy and fuel use for managed supplies, which includes all supplies that are wholly or partially managed at sites operated by Wincanton for itself or its customers, irrespective of whether the fuel and/or energy is purchased by us directly. We promote the value of an active lifestyle, highlight potential health issues and provide support across our entire workforce. Adrian was formerly Finance Director with Psion plc, an international technology business, through to its acquisition by Motorola Solutions, Inc. in October 201 2. Each Non-executive Director is appointed for an initial fixed term of three years, subject to annual re-election by shareholders. Following consideration, it was agreed that Condign Board Consulting Limited be engaged to undertake the exercise. Accordingly, all shareholders are encouraged to receive communications electronically, by contacting the Company’s registrars, Computershare. In addition to routine matters, the Committee have also undertaken specific reviews on insurance arrangements and taxation. As a Committee we welcome engagement and constructive dialogue with all of our shareholders on remuneration, at any time. This report is subject to an advisory vote by shareholders at the Company’s AGM on 29 June 201 7 . All Directors are subject to re-election every three years in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. However, in line with corporate governance best practice, all Directors currently put themselves forward for annual re-election at each AGM. 50% of bonus is deferred in shares which vest subject to performance and are therefore defined as a long term incentive. 75% of bonus was deferred in shares which vested subject to performance and are therefore defined as a long term incentive. Performance targets Threshold vesting (25% of maximum) under the SOP requires average TSR growth to exceed 10% per annum. Benefits are not anticipated to exceed 10% of salary per annum over the period for which this policy applies. Minor changes The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy set out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without requiring prior shareholder approval for that amendment. These legacy SOP awards will continue until they vest or expire, subject to achieving stretching performance conditions. Further details of bonus payments and share awards made during the year are disclosed in this report on pages 49 to 52. Such awards are intended to encourage sustainable long term value generation and align senior employees’ interests with our shareholders. Within the SIP all participants are currently eligible to receive one matched share for every four shares purchased. All Directors are subject to re-election every three years in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. In line with corporate governance best practice, all Directors currently put themselves forward for annual re-election at each AGM. Charitable fundraising activities, led and supported by employees, are detailed on page 29 in the Corporate Responsibility Report.
