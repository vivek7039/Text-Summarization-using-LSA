business 42% of group 50% of group how we are responding deploying new developments we work closely with our suppliers to trial, evaluate and deploy new equipment. our examples are wide ranging but include investment in new efficient vehicles, participation in continued government trials of longer trailers and use of enhanced vehicle telematics which pro-actively track journeys to promote better driving methods and reduce accidents. improved visibility and tracking shortened delivery timescales alongside fragmented drop locations across some sectors is driving the need for customers to have confidence in their logistics partner to deliver both accuracy and efficiency within their supply chains. while these challenges may present difficulties, they also generate opportunities for us to expand into new areas. independent forecourt retailers now make up a significant market share and this has led to an increase in demand for more flexible fuel deliveries. employees 1 7 ,500 flexible

+30bps how we measure our performance revenue £1, 118. this has been driven primarily by the full year impact of contracts exited in the prior year, including all closed book home shopping contracts in pullman, partly offset by revenue from contract wins. as a result we have achieved an underlying operating margin of 4.7%, up from 4.3% (excluding wrm) in the prior year. this growth was partly offset by the impact of lost volumes due to contract cessations in retail grocery and consumer products. in a challenging grocery marketplace we will deliver substantial savings into the future for our customers. these extended contracts demonstrate our track record of service excellence combined with a compelling commercial approach and added value. our w 2 labs initiative has been established in partnership with l marks, innovation specialists and early-stage investors. we will be responsible for the replenishment of their 900-strong store portfolio making over 100,000 deliveries per annum. the set up and successful christmas operation of a new national fulfilment centre (nfc) for majestic wine has again proven our ecommerce expertise. as a uk and ireland focused business the direct impact to date has been negligible for wincanton. however, we do recognise the potential to experience an affect as our customers’ markets are impacted. underlying eps, which excludes from earnings amortisation of acquired intangibles and exceptionals, increased by 1 5.9% to 27 .7p (2016: 23.9p). this decrease is principally due to contract exits, including those from all closed book contracts providing fleet maintenance for home delivery services in the pullman business. as a result we have achieved an underlying operating margin of 4.7%, marginally up from 4.4% in the prior year (4.3% excluding wrm). defined benefit arrangements the wincanton plc pension scheme (the scheme) includes defined benefit sections which were closed to future accrual on 3 1 march 20 1 4. group’s cash exposure to these onerous leases will fall materially over time. risk registers specific to business unit and support functions are maintained by senior management responsible for those areas. each risk register has been compiled following comprehensive assessment of the group and its competitive environment. risk governance the group faces a diverse range of risks and uncertainties which could have an adverse effect on its success if not managed. both the emt and audit committee consider risk as a routine agenda item at their respective meetings. the topic of brexit is a frequent area of discussion with our customers and the group will continue to stay closely connected with our customers to identify any change in their requirements that may arise. the topic of brexit is a frequent area of discussion with our customers and the group will continue to stay closely connected with our customers to identify any change in their requirements that may arise. for new employees that transfer into wincanton from one of our customers we undertake a snapshot version of our survey three months after the transfer date to get early feedback during the transition period. campaigns have included; providing new or more varied healthy foods at sites, wellbeing kiosks, health assessments and exercise classes. that is why we strive to hire the best employees in every area of our operations. we work hard to ensure employees of all backgrounds, genders and ethnicity are valued equally. courses are run on a regular basis for first line managers in risk assessment and accident investigation. every site develops a programme that promotes and encourages links with their local community. we pay particular attention to the measurement of collisions per million kilometres (cmk) as a barometer for our performance in these areas. the st ar programme focuses on driver risk assessment, based on increasing overall road craft skills, and linkage into risk based driver intervention that help us to identify areas where support, training and further information may be required. we have a substantial team of talented drivers who take pride in their profession. an important kpi for us is measurement of ltifr, and we track this on a weekly basis. given the nature of our business and working environments we track all activities closely to identify areas for continual improvement. this is consistent with the previous year’s performance and makes us a company ‘managing carbon’. progress on these plans is regularly reported to, and monitored by, our senior management team. we have an important part to play in helping our customers achieve their wider environmental goals and we know that a well-managed supply chain plays a key role in mitigating their impact on the environment as well as our own. we use an iso14001 certified environmental management system and provide monthly performance results across a range of indicators. we also record energy and fuel use for managed supplies, which includes all supplies that are wholly or partially managed at sites operated by wincanton for itself or its customers, irrespective of whether the fuel and/or energy is purchased by us directly. we promote the value of an active lifestyle, highlight potential health issues and provide support across our entire workforce. adrian colman chief executive officer nomination committee member adrian was appointed chief executive officer in august 201 5, having been the group finance director from january 201 3 to 31 july 201 5. adrian was formerly finance director with psion plc, an international technology business, through to its acquisition by motorola solutions, inc. in october 201 2. prior to joining psion, adrian was chief financial officer of london city airport and before that financial controller and head of investor relations at qinetiq group plc. a responsibility statement for each role has been set out and adopted by the board. each non-executive director is appointed for an initial fixed term of three years, subject to annual re-election by shareholders. other directorships the chairman and non-executive directors hold appointments as directors on a small number of other companies, as detailed in their biographies on pages 34 to 35. the number of external appointments held by the chairman and non-executive directors are considered upon changes in appointments and annually as part of their performance reviews. in accordance with the code all directors, being eligible, put themselves forward for annual re-election. following consideration, it was agreed that condign board consulting limited be engaged to undertake the exercise. accordingly, all shareholders are encouraged to receive communications electronically, by contacting the company’s registrars, computershare. in addition to routine matters, the committee have also undertaken specific reviews on insurance arrangements and taxation. as a committee we welcome engagement and constructive dialogue with all of our shareholders on remuneration, at any time. if you would like to contact us, please do so through our company secretary. we strongly believe this approach motivates and rewards individuals appropriately for their contribution to the group’s performance and aligns executives’ interests in the same way shareholders receive a return on their investment in us. as part of this process, we sought engagement with both our largest shareholders and shareholder bodies. this report is subject to an advisory vote by shareholders at the company’s agm on 29 june 201 7 . all directors are subject to re-election every three years in accordance with the company’s articles of association. however, in line with corporate governance best practice, all directors currently put themselves forward for annual re-election at each agm. 50% of bonus is deferred in shares which vest subject to performance and are therefore defined as a long term incentive. 75% of bonus was deferred in shares which vested subject to performance and are therefore defined as a long term incentive. executive director pension arrangements for year ended 31 march 2018 will be consistent with this approach. performance targets threshold vesting (25% of maximum) under the sop requires average tsr growth to exceed 10% per annum. benefits are not anticipated to exceed 10% of salary per annum over the period for which this policy applies. t argets are set having regard to a number of internal and external reference points. in exceptional circumstances, for example on recruitment, individual awards may be granted up to 250% of salary. wincanton plc annual report and accounts 2017 56 directors’ remuneration report directors’ remuneration policy continued • determination of a good leaver (in addition to any specified categories) for incentive-plan purposes, based on the plan rules and the appropriate treatment under the plan rules; and • adjustments required in certain circumstances (eg rights issues, share buybacks, special dividends, other corporate events, etc.). minor changes the committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without requiring prior shareholder approval for that amendment. further details of bonus payments and share awards made during the year are disclosed in this report on pages 49 to 52. such awards are intended to encourage sustainable long term value generation and align senior employees’ interests with our shareholders. the committee will take account of an executive director’s duty to mitigate their loss. in addition to the contractual provisions regarding payment on termination, the group’s incentive plans and share schemes contain provisions for termination of employment, based on ‘good leaver’ and ‘bad leaver’ treatment. a good leaver would not forfeit long term incentive awards on cessation of employment. if employment is terminated by the company, the departing executive director may have a legal entitlement (under statute or otherwise) to additional amounts which would need to be met, for example in a redundancy situation. within the sip all participants are currently eligible to receive one matched share for every four shares purchased. all directors are subject to re-election every three years in accordance with the company’s articles of association. in line with corporate governance best practice, all directors currently put themselves forward for annual re-election at each agm. charitable fundraising activities, led and supported by employees, are detailed on page 29 in the corporate
