Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset in accordance with the policy described below. If a significant event occurs that may affect the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment review will be carried out. Strategic brands have a finite useful economic life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at least annually. Net realisable value is based on estimated recoveries from customers and distributors for those pattern books expected to be sold, less the anticipated cost of disposal. An impairment allowance is made for any slow-moving and obsolete marketing materials including those expected to be given away free of charge. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against distribution and selling expenses in the Income Statement. Borrowing costs are capitalised as an increase to the carrying value of software or property, plant and equipment on major projects where their impact is material. Bank overdrafts that cannot be offset against other cash balances are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the Balance Sheet. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS – SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS UNDER LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS (‘LTIP’) The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees which must be measured at fair value and recognised as an expense in the Income Statement with a corresponding increase in equity. Dividend distribution is set by the Board on a regular basis so long as sufficient funds are available. Executive Directors identify, evaluate and where appropriate, hedge financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s operating units. Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash and loan facility utilisation on a monthly basis. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED E) CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Group’s objectives when managing capital are: • to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders; and • to provide an adequate return for shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use (‘VIU’) calculations. It comprises an historical record of unique designs that are used to generate royalty income in the business. At 31 January 2017 the Group has gross unused UK tax losses of £3,225,000 (2016: £3,225,000) available for offset against future profits. CREDIT QUALITY OF FINANCIAL ASSETS (i) Neither past due nor impaired Included in the Group’s trade receivable balances are receivables with a carrying value of £8,782,000 (2016: £6,637,000) which are neither past due nor impaired at the reporting date. The Company enters into monthly forward foreign exchange contracts with a third party to buy sterling and sell US dollars. The agreement also includes a £10,000,000 accordion facility option to further increase available credit which provides substantial headroom for future growth. The revolving credit facility is also subject to compliance of two financial covenants, being interest cover and leverage. Pension benefits are related to the members’ final salary at retirement and their length of service. There have been 10 awards under this plan, in which Executive Directors and senior management of the Group participate.
