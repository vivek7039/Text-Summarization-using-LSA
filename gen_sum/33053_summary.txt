similarly, while hanson believes its internal estimates are reliable, they have not been verified by independent sources. an investor can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. “during 2005, the group once again achieved excellent progress against its primary objective, which is to create sustainable, long-term value for our shareholders. i am happy to report that for the fifth consecutive year we saw an overall improvement in our safety statistics. price increases have been necessary to recover those higher input costs that could not be absorbed through cost initiatives. excluding acquisitions and property income, operating profit before impairments † from the existing business grew by 1 3.6%. in line with our ongoing capital expenditure policy, we aim to remain disciplined and biased towards projects which will have superior risk/return ratios. we will work closely with our customers to deliver premium products and services whilst remaining disciplined on selling prices. in february 2006, a settlement was reached with insurers covering approximately 20% of the group’s present asbestos costs. all defined benefit plans are now closed to new members, other than those covered by pre-existing collective bargaining arrangements. economic characteristics transportation costs are significant in general, our products have a low-value to weight ratio. when mixed with bitumen they become asphalt, which is used as a surface material for roads, airport runways and car parks. excluding joint-ventures and associates, hanson sold over 20m cubic metres of ready-mixed concrete from 637 sites in eight different countries. other materials can also be added at this stage such as slag and fly ash to improve certain characteristics of the cement. asphalt is used as a surfacing material for roadways and airport runways by the construction sector. they are produced by embedding a reinforcing steel structure within concrete, and range in diameter from 25 centimetres to over 3.5 metres. the large-scale structures are used in a wide variety of construction engineering applications, primarily infrastructure, including uses such as drainage systems and water transmission. it includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined. 5we are prepared to make disposals of underperforming or non-core operations if required –we are prepared to sell operations if they do not meet our medium-term ownership criteria although we believe that, at present, we have completed most of the required disposals. the word “group” designates that it excludes our share of joint-ventures’ and associates’ profit after tax. discontinued operations include the cost of asbestos, shown as a loss on disposals in prior years, after tax. investment decisions are based on risk versus return evaluation using cash flow projections discounted at a weighted average cost of capital. our operations hanson operates through six divisions on a multi-national basis within the construction and building materials markets. in addition, approximately one-third of 2005 group turnover † was attributable to new y ork, pennsylvania, ohio and indiana. all major aggregates operations have at least 1 0 years of remaining mineral reserve life based on current production levels. in certain markets, we selectively declined to compete for high volume contracts at low margins. projects included a processing upgrade at sylvania, ohio, which should increase productivity and reduce costs. volume/price summary volume for the 12 months ended december 31, 2005 and % movement against prior year volume price 2005 2005 v 2004 2005 v 2004 2005 v 2004

is expected to remain subdued in 2006. input costs will be significantly higher in 2006 than 2005. we are working to mitigate these factors by reducing capacity, improving productivity through capital expenditure and hedging costs such as gas, where economic. despite these measures, it is anticipated that significant price increases will be necessary in 2006 to recover our earnings. leslie cadzow, chief executive, hanson australia & asia pacific (right), was photographed on the steps of sydney opera house with two members of the building products management team, malcolm pointon, general manager building products (centre) and steve james, precast manager (left). three acquisitions were made in 2005 for £12.6m, including a basalt quarry at molong in new south wales, and the acquisition of two sydney based precast concrete companies, rescrete and abbey precast, both of which expanded our building products range. the share of joint-ventures’ and associates’ profit after tax † increased due largely to improved earnings from our hong kong operations. both these countries increased their operating profit before impairments † , as did germany, despite its difficult market conditions. productivity improvements were not sufficient to counter a decline in volume and the impact of higher energy costs. efficiency improvements were achieved in our aggregate operations which helped to offset a reduced operating profit before impairments † . replenishment of our reserves position, either through acquisition or mineral reserve purchases, remains a high priority for 2006. we will continue to focus on both acquisitions and margin improving capital expenditure activities. the old bullring in barcelona, spain, is being transformed into a shopping and commercial centre. hanson continental europe disposed of 19 ready-mixed concrete sites on may 13, and has subsequently restructured its spanish operations. a further £123.1m of capital expenditure had been committed as at december 31, 2005 primarily for new building products plants in the usa. these capital expenditures are expected to be financed out of group cash flows and bank facilities. over recent years, movements in market value apart, the group’s defined benefit plans have generally moved toward asset allocations with lower levels of risk. our core funding is provided by two us bond issues, each of $750m, maturing in september 2010 and march 2013, respectively. hanson’s significant accounting policies in accordance with ifrs are set out on pages 74 to 77 of the annual report and form 20-f . changes in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the level of demand for hanson’s products. changes in government policy or legislation relating to public works expenditure and housing could have a material adverse effect on the levels of demand for hanson’s products. inclement weather conditions could significantly impact levels of construction activity and hence demand for hanson’s products. extended periods of inclement weather, especially periods of heavy or sustained rainfall during peak construction periods during the year and other acts of nature such as hurricanes, can result in a material reduction in demand for our products at important times, as well as impact our ability to produce our products, and consequently result in reduced revenues and profits. there may also be substantial challenges or delays in integrating and adding value to the businesses which we acquire. members of the group remain contractually and statutorily liable for certain environmental clean-up/ remediation costs relating to these discontinued operations. factors which could cause actual costs to differ from these estimates and assumptions principal risks and uncertainties 47 † continuing operations include: (i) unknown adverse conditions arising at sites; (ii) third party claims in excess of estimates; (iii) changes to regulatory requirements; (iv) changes in remediation techniques and; (v) any other significant variations to assumptions made in support of these estimates. in particular, claims and lawsuits have been filed against our us subsidiaries, either directly or as a result of indemnity obligations, relating to products incorporating coal by-products and other chemicals, in particular for the wood treating industry. in addition, existing operations suffer, from litigation claims which may be uninsured or fall within deductible levels. in 2006, the board will formally endorse its approach to health and safety with a group policy statement. significant environmental issues – legislative, risk, performance, product development and opportunities – are reported quarterly to the board. where businesses identify a need for additional, more stretching requirements, they actively build upon this policy. local management teams have overall responsibility for engagement with the communities in which we are located. hanson requires each of the divisions to have an equal opportunities policy which complies with group expectations and local legislation. we have a general policy of supporting community projects in this way, particularly close to our operations. activities hanson is a focused heavy building materials company with operations in north america, the uk, australia, asia pacific and continental

reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated from their functional currency at balance sheet exchange rates. from january 1, 1998 to december 31, 2003, all acquired goodwill was capitalised and amortised over a period not exceeding 20 years. full provision is made against slow moving inventories based on historical experience and current market conditions. if a hedge becomes ineffective, the hedged item ceases to be remeasured with subsequent changes in fair value. after initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. included within wages and salaries above is £1.0m (£0.6m) in relation to the share-based payment expense for directors. the options granted under the executive share option schemes a and b are deemed to be cash-settled and consequently grants that had not been settled by january 1, 2005 have been accounted for under ifrs 2. options were granted with an exercise price equal to market value and remained exercisable at any time up to 10 years from the date of grant. an impairment charge of £16.5m has been recognised against goodwill held in hanson aggregates north america southwest region. an impairment provision of £14.9m recorded against tangible assets, mainly plant and equipment in hanson aggregates north america west region, has been reversed. an impairment charge of £5.3m has been recognised against goodwill and tangible assets at various individual

the group has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences on its foreign subsidiaries, associates or joint-ventures. earnings per share is also calculated below, before impairments, since the directors consider that this gives a useful indication of underlying performance. profits or losses on disposal of assets held for sale are included within group operating profit before impairments – see note 2(b). disposal groups and other assets held for sale are analysed on a segmental basis in note 2(e). at present, based on detailed analysis and the assumptions noted below, the provision for those costs which are both probable and reliably estimable equates to approximately eight years of gross cost, assuming an annual level of approximately us$60m. koppers’ liabilities koppers’ environmental obligations and related costs arise primarily from the us chemical and related operations formerly operated by koppers company inc, a company acquired by beazer plc which itself was acquired by the company in 1991. members of the beazer group remain contractually and statutorily liable for certain environmental costs relating to these discontinued operations. at december 31,

koppers’ liability and other discounted provisions which are accounted for at a discount rate of 5.1%. on january 31, 2006, the operations of seagoe, a drainage business based in northern ireland, classified as held for sale at december 31, 2005, was sold. these limits, assuming they are not used for non-asbestos claims, are expected to provide asbestos insurance cover for this subsidiary well beyond 2020. as detailed in note 21, the group’s total cost of asbestos, before tax, is estimated to average approximately $60.0 million per annum over the next eight years. based on these estimates, this settlement would reduce the net cost by 20% to $48.0 million per annum, after 2008. since the preliminary restatements, certain other amounts have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. transition impact (as at january 1, 2004): negative goodwill with a carrying value of £0.5m has been transferred to reserves. b) pensions and other post-retirement benefits principal difference: under uk gaap , the group provided for the cost of pension and other post-retirement benefits over employee service lives in accordance with ssap 24 “accounting for pension costs” . the pension prepayment (reported within trade and other receivables under uk gaap) of £199.6m has also been derecognised on transition to ifrs. accordingly, hanson has reduced its operating profit by £8.6m and reported income of £12.0m within net finance costs. uk gaap prohibits recognition of deferred tax on certain timing differences defined in the standard. income statement impact (for the year ended december 31, 2004) in 2004, under uk gaap , a deferred tax credit of £18.7m was recognised. transition impact (as at january 1, 2004): no accrual is required for the 2003 final dividend of £84.5m, since this was declared and paid in 2004. as a result, the accrual for this dividend is not recognised on transition. transition impact (as at january 1, 2004): the opening liability for cash-settled awards of £0.4m has been reclassified from retained earnings where it was recorded under uk gaap . uk gaap requires that material items which are unusual by virtue of size or incidence must be disclosed as exceptional, where this is necessary to show a true and fair view. current year profit after tax from operations discontinued in the year of £1.9m has been reclassified from turnover, costs and overheads, operating profit and taxation into a new section of the income statement showing discontinued operations. iv) an element of the group’s capitalised software with a net carrying value of £2.2m has been reclassified from property, plant and equipment under uk gaap to intangible assets in accordance with ifrs as at january 1, 2004. at december 31, 2004, this balance is £3.3m. ias 39 recognises three areas in which derivatives may be used as part of a hedge relationship: fair value, cash flow and net investment hedges. if a hedge becomes ineffective, the hedged item ceases to be remeasured for subsequent changes in fair value. iii) net investment hedges the group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency investments. from december 31, 1997 to january 1, 2004, all acquired goodwill was capitalised and amortised over a period not exceeding 20 years. separately identified intangible assets recognised since transition to ifrs have been amortised on the same basis as under us gaap . until december 31, 2004, certain derivative instruments were not required to be recognised on the balance sheet at fair value. these changes did not have a material impact on the group’s proforma net income or related per share amounts. us gaap applies a stricter definition, permitting discounting only where the timing of cash flows are fixed or reliably determinable. under us gaap , termination benefits are recognised where a detailed formal plan has been communicated to employees. the issuance of this standard removes future differences as it is to be applied on a prospective basis. sfas 153 has removed this exemption for transactions taking place after january 2005. foreign exchange gains and losses on disposals of businesses prior to the transition date, under ifrs, cumulative foreign exchange gains and losses relating to disposals were adjusted within reserves. differences in deferred taxation may occur as a result of accounting adjustments between ifrs and us gaap . eitf 04-06 is effective january 1, 2006 and any capitalised post-production stripping costs will be recognised as an adjustment to retaining earnings at that

shareholder documents such as annual and interim reports and shareholder circulars electronically, by downloading from the company’s website, rather than by post. please note that those so electing will be able to change their mind about receiving documents by electronic notification at any time and that it will be the responsibility of the shareholder to notify any change of e-mail address. t o register, shareholders will need their shareholder reference number (which can be found on the share certificate or dividend voucher). we are also a significant purchaser of certain important materials such as cement, bitumen, steel, gas, fuel and other energy supplies, the cost of which can fluctuate by material amounts and consequently have an adverse impact on our businesses. we do not believe that such compliance will materially adversely affect our business or results of operations. we believe that our operating units should be able to achieve compliance with the applicable regulations and ordinances in a manner which should not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, a number of present and former hanson operating units (responsibility for which remains with a member of the hanson group) have been named as potentially responsible parties (“prps”) at approximately 40 off-site landfills under cercla or comparable state statutes. there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not differ materially from our estimates. in april 2005, we entered into a five year £500m multi-currency revolving credit facility arranged by barclays capital and j.p . this facility is available to be drawn as either cash advances or standby letters of credit. in addition, a us shareholder is subject to backup withholding (currently at a rate of 28%) on dividends paid in the usa on adss or ordinary shares unless the us shareholder provides an irs form w-9 or otherwise establishes an exemption. stamp duty reserve tax at a rate of 0.5% will be payable on any agreement to transfer ordinary shares or any interest therein unless an instrument transferring the ordinary shares is executed and stamp duty at a rate of 0.5%, rounded up to the nearest £5 has been paid. stamp duty reserve tax will not be payable on any agreement to transfer adrs representing adss.
