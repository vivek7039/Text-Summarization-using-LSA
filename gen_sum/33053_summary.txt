An investor can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. “During 2005, the group once again achieved excellent progress against its primary objective, which is to create sustainable, long-term value for our shareholders. I am happy to report that for the fifth consecutive year we saw an overall improvement in our safety statistics. Looking forward We expect to make further progress during 2006 based on strong market positions, value adding acquisition opportunities and continued financial discipline. We have achieved double digit earnings growth, completed a significant number of valuable acquisitions and increased our returns to shareholders. Price increases have been necessary to recover those higher input costs that could not be absorbed through cost initiatives. In line with our ongoing capital expenditure policy, we aim to remain disciplined and biased towards projects which will have superior risk/return ratios. We will work closely with our customers to deliver premium products and services whilst remaining disciplined on selling prices. All defined benefit plans are now closed to new members, other than those covered by pre-existing collective bargaining arrangements. When mixed with bitumen they become asphalt, which is used as a surface material for roads, airport runways and car parks. Excluding joint-ventures and associates, Hanson sold over 20m cubic metres of ready-mixed concrete from 637 sites in eight different countries. Other materials can also be added at this stage such as slag and fly ash to improve certain characteristics of the cement. They are produced by embedding a reinforcing steel structure within concrete, and range in diameter from 25 centimetres to over 3.5 metres. The large-scale structures are used in a wide variety of construction engineering applications, primarily infrastructure, including uses such as drainage systems and water transmission. Discontinued operations include the cost of asbestos, shown as a loss on disposals in prior years, after tax. Investment decisions are based on risk versus return evaluation using cash flow projections discounted at a weighted average cost of capital. † Continuing operations CA WA OR AR GA FL KY VA MD RI LA NC MS AL OH OK SD MN ONTARIO QUEBEC PA SC TX IN IL MI AZ Operations – Hanson Building Products North America* Pipe and Roofing products tile Brick factories plants factories Alabama (AL) 10 – – Arizona (AZ) 3 1 – Arkansas (AR) 4 – – California (CA) 6 3 – Florida (FL) 10 4 – Georgia (GA) 4 – – Illinois (IL) 1 – – Indiana (IN) 1 – – Kentucky (KY) – – 2 Louisiana (LA) 3 – 1 Maryland (MD) 2 – – Michigan (MI) – – 1 Minnesota (MN) 2 – – Mississippi (MS) 7 – – North Carolina (NC) – – 5 Ohio (OH) 6 – – Oklahoma (OK) 1 – – Oregon (OR) 3 – – Pennsylvania (PA) 1 – – Rhode Island (RI) 1 – – South Carolina (SC) 1 – 4 South Dakota (SD) 1 – – T exas (TX) 19 1 7 Virginia (VA) 11 – – Washington (WA) 1–– Ontario (Canada) 5 – 4 Quebec (Canada) – – 1 Total 103 9 25 *Including joint-ventures Please note that the maps are for illustrative purposes only and are not to scale.

It has long-term mineral reserves with approximately 2.2bn metric tonnes of reserve and resources, owned, leased or under option, available for future extraction. Input costs, in particular energy, continued to increase although the earnings impact was partly mitigated by forward hedging of gas prices. Capital expenditure † in 2005 totalled £16.8m (£16.1m) with an emphasis on projects which will reduce production costs, increase efficiency and automate manual handling activities. We are working to mitigate these factors by reducing capacity, improving productivity through capital expenditure and hedging costs such as gas, where economic. Excluding this tax benefit, foreign exchange and acquisition earnings of £0.6m, the existing operations improved by £5.1m, or 7 .7% against a very strong 2004. The share of joint-ventures’ and associates’ profit after tax † increased due largely to improved earnings from our Hong Kong operations. A further £123.1m of capital expenditure had been committed as at December 31, 2005 primarily for new building products plants in the USA. Over recent years, movements in market value apart, the group’s defined benefit plans have generally moved toward asset allocations with lower levels of risk. Our core funding is provided by two US bond issues, each of $750m, maturing in September 2010 and March 2013, respectively. Hanson’s significant accounting policies in accordance with IFRS are set out on pages 74 to 77 of the Annual Report and Form 20-F . Changes in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the level of demand for Hanson’s products. Changes in government policy or legislation relating to public works expenditure and housing could have a material adverse effect on the levels of demand for Hanson’s products. There may also be substantial challenges or delays in integrating and adding value to the businesses which we acquire. Members of the group remain contractually and statutorily liable for certain environmental clean-up/ remediation costs relating to these discontinued operations. Hanson requires each of the divisions to have an Equal Opportunities Policy which complies with group expectations and local legislation. Activities Hanson is a focused heavy building materials company with operations in North America, the UK, Australia, Asia Pacific and Continental Europe. Policies –A planning framework which incorporates a four year plan approved by the Board, with objectives for each business unit. Arrangements are also in place for the Senior Independent Director and other Non-executive Directors to meet with major shareholders, if they so request. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated from their functional currency at balance sheet exchange rates. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. An impairment provision of £14.9m recorded against tangible assets, mainly plant and equipment in Hanson Aggregates North America West region, has been reversed. An impairment charge of £5.3m has been recognised against goodwill and tangible assets at various individual operating sites within Hanson Aggregates UK. At December 31, 2005, the group has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences on its foreign subsidiaries, associates or joint-ventures. Earnings per share is also calculated below, before impairments, since the Directors consider that this gives a useful indication of underlying performance. Profits or losses on disposal of assets held for sale are included within group operating profit before impairments – see note 2(b). Members of the Beazer group remain contractually and statutorily liable for certain environmental costs relating to these discontinued operations. Other issues raised by the Attorney General’s complaint have not yet been addressed and will be vigorously defended. Also excluded is the Koppers’ liability and other discounted provisions which are accounted for at a discount rate of 5.1%. On January 31, 2006, the operations of Seagoe, a drainage business based in Northern Ireland, classified as held for sale at December 31, 2005, was sold. The pension prepayment (reported within trade and other receivables under UK GAAP) of £199.6m has also been derecognised on transition to IFRS. Income statement impact (for the year ended December 31, 2004) In 2004, under UK GAAP , a deferred tax credit of £18.7m was recognised. Transition impact (as at January 1, 2004): No accrual is required for the 2003 final dividend of £84.5m, since this was declared and paid in 2004. Transition impact (as at January 1, 2004): The opening liability for cash-settled awards of £0.4m has been reclassified from retained earnings where it was recorded under UK GAAP . UK GAAP requires that material items which are unusual by virtue of size or incidence must be disclosed as exceptional, where this is necessary to show a true and fair view. IAS 39 recognises three areas in which derivatives may be used as part of a hedge relationship: fair value, cash flow and net investment hedges. Separately identified intangible assets recognised since transition to IFRS have been amortised on the same basis as under US GAAP . Under US GAAP , derivative instruments, whether designated as a hedge or not, are required to be recognised on the balance sheet at fair value. These changes did not have a material impact on the group’s proforma net income or related per share amounts. US GAAP applies a stricter definition, permitting discounting only where the timing of cash flows are fixed or reliably determinable. EITF 04-06 is effective January 1, 2006 and any capitalised post-production stripping costs will be recognised as an adjustment to retaining earnings at that date. The group has reserves for taxes that may become payable in future periods as a result of tax audits. It is the group’s policy to establish reserves for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of an examination by tax authorities.
