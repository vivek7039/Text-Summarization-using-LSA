base across the region, winning a number of multi-country contracts with new clients. performance was outstanding across the region with both net fee income and operating profit increasing significantly year-on-year. belgium, germany, portugal, the netherlands and spain all delivered net fee income increases in excess of 20%. the marketing function is a good example of this with a shift in demand from general marketers to digital specialists and now, niche roles like pay per click (ppc), search engine optimisation (seo) and retargeting specialists are increasingly common. a new market or new discipline must represent a long-term growth opportunity for the group and secondly, the right management must be in place to ensure we effectively maintain and grow our robert walters

the business. focusing on the behaviours that make our environment special, reminding us what’s important so we can replicate them effectively at greater scale. “following my accountancy qualifications i worked in the oil and gas industry as a group accountant but was looking for faster career progression. in 2007, just after maternity leave, i took on additional responsibility, setting up processes for our belgian business. over the next few years i became a true business partner to alain mlanao, managing director of walters people in paris. i moved first to ensure it was the right decision and my family joined me a few months later. our people are enthusiastic, optimistic and create positive change through the energy they bring to their work. whilst cost saving remains important, many are now moving away from decisions purely based on costs. what we’re now seeing is a growing trend towards using onshore locations or moving overseas operations back home; benefiting both resource solutions and the robert walters recruitment business. not just through formal processes like quarterly business reviews but talking to clients at industry roundtables and regular events. innovation also helps us cement client relationships and we are their ‘go-to’ source for all new recruitment innovations. we’ve trialled over 100 technologies and implemented numerous new tools for some of our biggest clients. we offer a one hundred per cent client focused model, understanding each organisation’s needs and building around them: it’s completely bespoke.” oliver

interim professionals are senior executives, capable of leading significant business change, including mergers/takeovers, business process engineering or crisis. interim management used to be considered the last career step for senior professionals before retirement, but now we are seeing younger managers taking on interim roles to diversify their careers with new responsibilities they wouldn’t necessarily have in a permanent job. it’s an e-learning platform where our candidates can benefit from free educational programmes – in finance, languages and other areas. i’ve always been

business has always been at the heart of the group. a sustainable business corporate social responsibility everyone has the opportunity to help build community and give back. everyone has the opportunity to give back through a variety of programmes, from volunteering day, global charity day, global angels volunteering programme and other initiatives, whether that’s helping underprivileged children, preparing the long-term unemployed for interviews or providing food and supplies to those in need. similarly, in spain our team worked with fundación atresmedia running pre-employment workshops and mock interviews to help students prepare for the job market. australia’s long-term partnership with dress for success, a charity helping women achieve economic independence, continued and our consultants led two employment workshops per month. in south africa, our team supported cotlands, a not-for-profit organisation creating access to play-based, early learning opportunities for underprivileged children. in new zealand, staff volunteered their time once a month to make school lunches for underprivileged children who would otherwise go without. fit (financial industry in tokyo) supports local community organisations which serve important but not necessarily well recognised or understood causes. meanwhile, the director of our new zealand business bravely volunteered to shave his head to raise funds for kidscan, an organisation that provides underprivileged children in new zealand with food, clothing and healthcare so they can focus on their education. the group is also partnering with enei (employers network for equality and inclusion) to push best practice forward. although our impact on the environment is minimal as an office-based organisation, we are fully

competition. the group remains committed to maximising career opportunities through significant investment in training and professional development. the board has put in place an organisational structure with clearly defined responsibilities and delegation of authority. salaries are normally reviewed annually on 1 january and are influenced by: – the performance of each individual executive

employee benefit trust. the company does not have agreements with any director or employee that would provide specific compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover, except that provisions of the group’s share plans may cause options and awards to vest on a takeover. the forecasts and cash flow projections being used to assess going concern have been comprehensively stress-tested by using simulation techniques involving sensitivity analysis applying, in particular, projections of reduced net fee income of up to 20% from forecasts each year over a three-year period. he also previously held a number of senior management positions with cadbury schweppes plc and united biscuits limited. robert walters plc is quoted on the london stock exchange and currently has a global presence spanning 28 countries. prior to this, she was senior vice president human resources for europe, middle east and africa (emea) at intercontinental hotels group. this year we have concentrated on the impact of changes in pay rates for temporary workers covered by resource solutions contracts. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. accordingly, revenue is accrued in respect of permanent placements meeting the above criteria but which remain unbilled. key observations we did not identify any reportable misstatements or significant deficiencies in internal controls as a result of our audit work. we have therefore focused our risk on aged balances (> 30 days overdue) relating to sales in the permanent recruitment business. in australia, china, france, hong kong, japan and the united kingdom, we performed additional testing to confirm that these internal controls were operating effectively. additionally, we evaluated post year-end developments to determine whether any provisions required reversal or further provision. key observations we did not identify any reportable misstatements or significant deficiencies in internal controls as a result of our audit work. john charlton fca senior statutory auditor
