Hong Kong, another of the Group’s well-established scale businesses, also had a record year whilst market conditions in Singapore remained more challenging. Resource Solutions continued to grow its client base across the region, winning a number of multi-country contracts with new clients. Performance was outstanding across the region with both net fee income and operating profit increasing significantly year-on-year. BOARD CHANGES Leslie Van de Walle will be stepping down from his role as Non-executive Chairman on 1 March 2018. Growth is being driven by increased globalisation of the workforce as organisations increasingly look for one integrated provider with global solutions. By focusing on long-term, international careers we are able to effectively embed our culture in new territories. By promoting our international mobility programme we encourage successful staff to move around the world, building new businesses and strengthening existing ones. Our growth is largely organic with the Group only having made four market-entry acquisitions in its 32-year history. He gives us his vision for developing the Group’s people strategy and an insight into our culture. Focusing on the behaviours that make our environment special, reminding us what’s important so we can replicate them effectively at greater scale. “Following my accountancy qualifications I worked in the oil and gas industry as a group accountant but was looking for faster career progression. In 2007, just after maternity leave, I took on additional responsibility, setting up processes for our Belgian business. Over the next few years I became a true business partner to Alain Mlanao, managing director of Walters People in Paris. I moved first to ensure it was the right decision and my family joined me a few months later. Our people are enthusiastic, optimistic and create positive change through the energy they bring to their work. What we’re now seeing is a growing trend towards using onshore locations or moving overseas operations back home; benefiting both Resource Solutions and the Robert Walters recruitment business. Not just through formal processes like quarterly business reviews but talking to clients at industry roundtables and regular events. Innovation also helps us cement client relationships and we are their ‘go-to’ source for all new recruitment innovations.

A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY EVERYONE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP BUILD COMMUNITY AND GIVE BACK. Everyone has the opportunity to give back through a variety of programmes, from Volunteering Day, Global Charity Day, Global Angels Volunteering Programme and other initiatives, whether that’s helping underprivileged children, preparing the long-term unemployed for interviews or providing food and supplies to those in need. Similarly, in Spain our team worked with Fundación Atresmedia running pre-employment workshops and mock interviews to help students prepare for the job market. Australia’s long-term partnership with Dress for Success, a charity helping women achieve economic independence, continued and our consultants led two employment workshops per month. In South Africa, our team supported Cotlands, a not-for-profit organisation creating access to play-based, early learning opportunities for underprivileged children. In New Zealand, staff volunteered their time once a month to make school lunches for underprivileged children who would otherwise go without. FIT (Financial Industry in Tokyo) supports local community organisations which serve important but not necessarily well recognised or understood causes. The Group is also partnering with ENEI (Employers Network for Equality and Inclusion) to push best practice forward.
