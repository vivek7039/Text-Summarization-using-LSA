Jing Tea is a UK based distributor of branded speciality teas to the retail and food service sectors internationally. Second, our focus on sustainability has put us in a strong position to beneﬁt from these global trends. Third, we have been operating in many of our territories for a very long time. We will continue to build on these strong foundations for the beneﬁt of all our stakeholders. Over the last three years we have disposed of Duncan Lawrie Asset Management at a substantial proﬁt and closed or sold Duncan Lawrie Private Bank, AKD Engineering and Loddon all of which were loss- making. A UK based branded speciality teas business selling to the retail and food service sectors internationally. Both of these companies have been with the Group for many years, and whilst both remain cash generative they are too small and too niche to represent good investment opportunities or to deliver long term growth for the Group. I am also pleased that we have been able to raise the dividend again this year. To establish a sustainably proﬁtable business model that works in the European ﬁsh distribution market. Costs continue to rise through wage and general inﬂation which, without compensatory increases in the market price, creates margin pressure. During the year, Goodricke acquired a number of well-known Indian brands including Tea City, Supercup and Samovar. Trials have started on shear plucking in an eﬀort to reduce harvesting costs through improved productivity. Tea prices in Malawi were ﬁrm throughout 2017 due to strong demand resulting from an undersupplied Kenyan market. There is also signiﬁcant investment being made to expand water resources for irrigation from the Simpson Dam on Mambedi estate. The cracking facility successfully completed its second full season of processing and is FSSC 22000 certiﬁed. In addition 0.9 million kg of smallholder fruit was packed (2016: 1.8 million kg) Avocado Pricing and Operations Avocado production was in line with expectations for the year despite the dry conditions which had a negative impact on fruit size. We exported an increased volume of Hass but Pinkerton volumes were down on the previous year. In California we had a good year, with record yields being achieved for the Murcotts without an impact on prices. We continue to raise cattle on those areas of the Kakuzi estate in Kenya unsuitable for crop development. Engineering South Abbey Metal Finishing and its subsidiary Atﬁn made a substantially increased operating proﬁt in 2017 as demand grew for their services to the aerospace industry. In common with other research based businesses, it is expected to lose money pending the outcome of commercial trials. As stated earlier, we are now seeking partners to ﬁnance the next stage of its development. On the Linton Park estate work has commenced to convert surplus buildings into residential property for rent. ■ Trialing a new automated withering system at Chemomi factory, Kenya in order to improve quality and reduce labour costs. In 2017 the Group launched a new on-line system for capturing data relating to our global environmental footprint. Targets adopted by companies to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions are considered “science-based” if they are in line with the level of decarbonisation required to keep the global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial temperatures. CAMELLIA PLC CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT 14 249229 Camellia R&A pp01-pp19  18/04/2018  18:12  Page 14 Some of the initiatives we are undertaking include: ■ Pursuing limited resource use eﬃciency, this year alone we identiﬁed over 200 energy and water management projects across the Group. We assist with the improvement of local infrastructure by supporting road, water, healthcare and education projects. We also give medical support to schools that are either run locally or by our operations. Unfortunately, in other situations the law is either unclear or under developed and in these instances we make provisions on a best estimate basis for the liabilities likely to arise, having taken advice as appropriate. Our 2017 triennial valuation for the UK scheme has been agreed and shows a surplus of £7.1 million. I am pleased to report that as a consequence of this surplus, no further deﬁcit reduction contributions are required for the meantime. Contributions to externally funded deﬁned beneﬁt schemes are determined after consultation with the respective trustees and actuaries. (ii) As reported elsewhere, in 2017 all the Darjeeling tea gardens were subject to prolonged strikes. These divisions report into the Board by function against a variety of metrics including budgets and business plans. The Board has agreed to undertake a performance evaluation by way of an internal review every three years. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 249229 Camellia R&A pp20-pp35  18/04/2018  18:13  Page 29 CAMELLIA PLC 30 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE A report summarising the Group’s ﬁnancial and operational performance including detailed information on each of its businesses is sent to Directors each month. ■ To approve compensation packages or arrangements following the severance of any executive Director’s service contract.

Associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise signiﬁcant inﬂuence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the ﬁnancial and operating policy decisions of that entity. The rates of depreciation used for the other assets are as follows:- Biological assets (Bearer plants) 20 to 50 years Freehold and long leasehold buildings nil to 50 years Other short leasehold land and buildings unexpired term of the lease Plant, machinery, ﬁxtures, ﬁttings and equipment 3 to 25 years No depreciation is provided on bearer plants until maturity when commercial levels of production have been reached. Impairment of non-ﬁnancial assets Assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In accordance with IAS 41, on initial recognition, agricultural produce is required to be measured at fair value less estimated point of sale costs. Accounts payable are classiﬁed as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. Borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than in a business combination, that at the time of the transaction aﬀects neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt or loss. A deﬁned beneﬁt plan is a pension plan that deﬁnes an amount of pension beneﬁt that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax eﬀects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders. Factors considered which could trigger an impairment review include the signiﬁcant fall in market values, signiﬁcant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, a major change in market conditions or negative cash ﬂows. This involves a signiﬁcant amount of judgement as tax legislation can be complex and open to diﬀerent interpretation. 249229 Camellia R&A pp54-pp69  18/04/2018  18:15  Page 62 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 63 CAMELLIA PLC 13 Earnings/(loss) per share (EPS) 2017 2016 Weighted Weighted average average number of (Loss)/ number of Earnings shares EPS earnings shares EPS £’m Number Pence £’m Number Pence Attributable to ordinary shareholders 22.2 2,762,000 803.8 (10.7) 2,762,000 (387.4) –––––––––– –––––––––– –––––––––– –––––––––– –––––––––– –––––––––– Attributable to ordinary shareholders – continuing operations 7.4 2,762,000 268.0 9.3 2,762,000 336.7 –––––––––– –––––––––– –––––––––– –––––––––– –––––––––– –––––––––– Attributable to ordinary shareholders – discontinued operation 14.8 2,762,000 535.8 (20.0) 2,762,000 (724.1) –––––––––– –––––––––– –––––––––– –––––––––– –––––––––– –––––––––– Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding those held by the Group as treasury shares (note 34).

The Group’s exposure to this risk is mitigated by the geographical spread of its operations, selective forward selling in certain instances when considered appropriate, and regular reviews of available market data on sales and production. 249229 Camellia R&A pp70-pp74  18/04/2018  18:53  Page 72 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 73 CAMELLIA PLC 26 Inventories 2017 2016 £’m £’m Group Made Tea 31.3 34.8 Other agricultural produce 1.9 1.6 Work in progress 0.2 0.4 Trading stocks 2.5 2.2 Raw materials and consumables 11.5 11.6 –––––––––– –––––––––– 47.4 50.6 –––––––––– –––––––––– Made Tea inventories include the fair value of green leaf which includes a fair value uplift of £1.2 million (2016: £0.8 million).
