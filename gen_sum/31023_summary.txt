contract with a public sector body to design, build, finance and operate/maintain an infrastructure asset in accordance with agreed service standards. infrastructure can be defined as the physical assets and systems that support a country or community. the group aims to create value for shareholders through originating, investing in and managing infrastructure assets internationally. these special purpose companies are typically also financed with ring-fenced medium to long-term senior debt. 5 represents cash proceeds received on realisations for the year ended 31 december 2017, including £1.9 million consideration deferred to 2018. operational investments can be sold to secondary market investors who target a lower rate of return consistent with the reduction in risk for assets that have completed construction. we plan to use the proceeds to invest in public private partnership (ppp) projects, renewable energy assets, and in other appropriate greenfield infrastructure assets which fit our business model and meet our investment criteria. we committed capital to each of our three core regions – asia pacific, europe and north america – in the year. we continue to see strong demand for new greenfield infrastructure in each of our regions. we have an experienced board which has been strengthened by the addition of will samuel. we aim to invest in new greenfield infrastructure projects which, post-construction, produce long-term predictable cash flows that meet our rate of return targets. in that respect, we see nav growth and dividends as key measures of our success: in 2017, our nav grew by 10.5% from £1,016.8 million at • 31 december 2016 to £1,123.9 million at 31 december 2017. this was 13.5% if we add back the dividends paid in 2017. we are proposing total dividends of 10.61p per share for • 2017 compared to dividends of 8.15p per share for 2016. this represents growth of 30.2% over 2016, reflecting the significant increase in realisations during 2017. to deliver our strategy, we have set ourselves the core objectives below, while maintaining the discipline and analysis required to mitigate against the delivery, revenue and operational risks associated with investments in infrastructure projects: growth in primary investment volumes (new investment • capital committed to greenfield infrastructure projects) over the medium term; growth in the value of external aum and related fee • income; and management and enhancement of our investment • portfolio, with a clear focus on active management during construction, accompanied by realisations of investments which, combined with our corporate banking facilities and operational cash flows, enable us to finance new investment commitments. patients were first admitted to the hospital in early september 2017. like many assets in the early operational stage, certain aspects of service provision are still being addressed and, as we have previously reported, remaining disputes are being dealt with through a process of arbitration. the portfolio valuation represents our assessment of the fair value of investments in projects on a discounted cash flow basis and assuming that each asset is held to maturity, other than shares in jlen which are held at market value. i visited our international offices regularly during 2017. we are lucky to have high quality individuals and experienced teams across our business and it is my privilege to thank them for all they have done this year. within the pipeline is one preferred bidder position related to the mbta fare collection project in boston, us as well as nine shortlisted ppp positions with an investment opportunity of approximately £200 million and four exclusive renewable energy positions with an investment opportunity of approximately £150 million. our investment commitments for 2017 are summarised in the table below: new grafton correctional centre asia pacific 79.3 – 79.3 hornsdale 3 wind

during 2017, the primary investment team successfully secured seven new investments, resulting in total commitments of £382.9 million: north america – we continued to increase our activities in • the market, most notably through committing £118.0 million to the i-66 managed lanes ppp project in virginia. in australia and new zealand, the tenor of ppp project finance debt tends to be more medium-term than long-term. the canadian market also continues to demonstrate strong ppp deal flow, which we are actively pursuing. operations commenced in late 2017 and the wind farm benefits from a 15 year fixed price power purchase agreement. rocksprings wind farm, us (95.3% interest) located in texas, this project has a total capacity of 149 mw. operations commenced in late 2017 and the wind farm benefits from power purchase agreements with two investment grade corporate offtakers. buckthorn wind farm, us (90.05% interest) located in texas, this project has a total capacity of 100 mw. to ensure project operational performance and cost risks • lie principally with our service supply chain partners. to optimise spv management costs and project insurance • premiums through bulk purchasing or efficiency gains, thereby increasing investor returns. despite this, since the projects we invest in are principally large and sophisticated infrastructure assets, delays can occur. the two principal inputs are (i) forecast cash flows from investments and (ii) discount rate. under the group’s valuation methodology, a base case discount rate for an operational project is derived from secondary market information and other available data points. by sector £ million wind and solar investments represented 30.9% of the portfolio value at 31 december 2017, with rail rolling stock accounting for a further 24.9%. project companies in which the group invests are described as “non-recourse”, which means that providers of debt to such project companies do not have recourse to john laing beyond its equity commitments in the underlying projects. re-presented financial results as described above, the company meets the criteria for being an investment entity under ifrs 10 and accordingly the company is required to fair value its investments in its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates except for those directly-owned subsidiaries that provide investment-related services, and do not themselves qualify as investment entities; it consolidates such subsidiaries on a line by line basis. the net gain on investments at fvtpl in the group income statement includes fair value movements from the portfolio of investments in non-recourse project companies and also comprises income and costs that do not arise directly from investments in this portfolio, including investment fees earned from project companies by recourse subsidiaries that are held at fvtpl. this comprised a net tax credit of £1.5 million (2016 – £1.8 million charge) in recourse subsidiaries that are consolidated (shown in the ‘tax credit/(charge)’ line on the group income statement), primarily in relation to group relief receivable from entities held at fvtpl, and a net tax credit of £4.7 million (2016 – £6.6 million) in recourse subsidiaries that are held at fvtpl (shown in the ‘net gain on investments at fair value through profit or loss’ line on the group income statement), including (i) group relief payable to recourse subsidiaries that are consolidated, together with (ii) group/consortium relief received from project companies. the discount rate, as prescribed by ias 19, is based on yields from high quality corporate bonds. the company has a strong risk management culture, supported by a management risk committee and an internal audit function, which helps to ensure that key risks to the business are identified, assessed and monitored appropriately. 3. management and enhancement of the group’s investment portfolio, with a clear focus on active management during construction, accompanied by realisations of investments which, combined with the group’s corporate banking facilities and operational cash flows, enable it to finance new investment commitments. the use of ppp programmes by governmental entities may be delayed or may decrease thereby limiting opportunities for private sector infrastructure investors in the future, or be structured such that returns to private sector infrastructure investors are reduced. ppp projects are normally structured so as to provide significant contractual protection for equity investors (see also counterparty risk). through its track record of more than 130 investment commitments, the group has developed significant expertise in compliance with public tender regulations. where possible, specific clauses relating to potential currency change within a particular jurisdiction are incorporated in project documentation. over recent years, the secondary markets for both ppp and renewable energy investments have grown. it operates a policy of ensuring that sufficient financial resources are maintained to satisfy committed and likely future investment requirements. the group works closely with a wide range of project finance providers, including banks and other financial institutions. one such project, auckland south corrections facility, was successfully refinanced in late 2017. prior to financial close, all proposed investments are scrutinised by the investment committee. > no change future investment activity the group operates in competitive markets and may not be able to compete effectively or profitably. the group’s investment pipeline is not a guarantee of actual bidding activity or future investments. in addition, to the extent that a project company’s actual costs incurred differ from forecast costs, for example, because of late construction, and cannot be passed on to sub-contractors or other third parties, investment returns and valuations may be adversely affected. where patronage or volume risk is taken, the directors review revenue assumptions and their sensitivities in detail prior to any investment commitment. the group typically hedges cash flows arising from investment realisations or significant distributions in currencies other than sterling. the intention is that projects are structured such that (i) day-to-day service provision is sub-contracted to qualified sub-contractors supported by appropriate security packages (ii) cost and price inflation risk in relation to the provision of services lies with sub-contractors (iii) performance deductions in relation to non-availability lie with sub-contractors (iv) future major maintenance costs and ongoing project company costs are reviewed annually and cost mitigation strategies adopted as appropriate. in overseas jurisdictions, the group’s investments backed by governmental entities may ultimately be subject to sovereign risk. in establishing project contractual arrangements prior to making an investment, the credit standing and relevant experience of a sub-contractor are considered. ppp projects are normally structured so as to provide significant contractual protection for equity investors. ppp projects are normally supported by central and local government covenants, which significantly reduce the group’s risk. within the outsourced arrangements, cyber risk is addressed through (i) the group’s organisational structure which includes segregation of responsibilities, delegated lines of accountability, delegated authorities and (ii) specific controls, including controls over payments and access to it systems. the group plans its human resources needs carefully, including appropriate local recruitment, when it bids for overseas projects. > no change principal risks and risk management (continued) john laing annual report and accounts 2017 / 43 financial statements governance strategic report overview corporate responsibility

and senior positions throughout his career. at the end of each year, all directors make a declaration concerning any conﬂicts they or their connected persons may have. any such notiﬁcations are reviewed at the next board meeting and, if considered appropriate, authorised. upon appointment, non-executive directors undertake an induction process to familiarise themselves with the group’s activities, policies and key issues. the group’s system of internal control is designed to manage and mitigate rather than eliminate altogether the risk of failure to meet business objectives and can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material ﬁnancial misstatement or loss. the group finance director is normally invited to attend meetings, along with other members of management as appropriate. the committee uses external search consultants or open advertising for recruitment purposes as deemed most appropriate. engagement with shareholders the board is committed to providing shareholders with timely announcements of signiﬁcant events or transactions affecting the company, including its ﬁnancial performance and any changes to strategy as well as material investment commitments and realisations. following discussions with management, we are pleased to report the appointment of mark westbrook as chief risk ofﬁcer with effect from january 2018. mark has been appointed to the executive committee in his new role (see page 52). whilst we cannot give absolute assurance that the group’s internal control system is operating effectively, we are satisﬁed that overall the control and compliance culture of the group is strong and its risk base is well diversiﬁed, which helps to provide reasonable assurance that these ﬁnancial statements are free from material error and/or misstatement. any bonus above target (60% of salary) is deferred into shares vesting in equal tranches over one, two and three years subject to continued employment. strategy to

strategic report overview 1 general information the results of john laing group plc (the “company” or the “group”) are stated according to the basis of preparation described below. although the group has a net deﬁned beneﬁt pension liability, ifrs 10 does not exclude companies with non-investment related liabilities from qualifying as investment entities. project companies in which the group invests are described as “non-recourse”, which means that providers of debt to such project companies do not have recourse to john laing beyond its equity and/or subordinated debt commitments in the underlying projects. these policies have been applied consistently to each of the years presented, unless otherwise stated. subsequent to initial recognition, investments in project companies are measured on a combined basis at fair value principally using discounted cash flow methodology. loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. deposits held with original maturities of greater than three months are shown as other ﬁnancial assets. other non-derivative ﬁnancial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses. under the group’s valuation methodology, a base case discount rate for an operational project is derived from secondary market information and other available data points. value enhancements are only incorporated when the group has sufficient evidence that they can be realised. a base case discount rate for an operational project is derived from secondary market information and other available data points. if the minimum funding requirement is higher, an additional liability would need to be recognised. notes to the group financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2017 john laing annual report and accounts 2017 / 97 financial statements governance strategic report overview 6 share-based incentives (continued) deferred share bonus plan in accordance with the deferred share bonus plan, 9,762 shares were awarded on 17 march 2017 to executive directors and certain senior executives in relation to that part of their

ended 31 december 2016 during the year ended 31 december 2016, the group disposed of shares and subordinated debt in six ppp and renewable energy project companies as well as part of its shareholding in jlen. the tables in section a) provide an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to their initial recognition at fair value. for the parent company and its recourse subsidiaries, financial risks are managed by a central treasury operation which operates within board approved policies. the group also holds investments in renewable energy projects whose fair value may vary with forecast energy prices to the extent they are not economically hedged through short to medium-term fixed price purchase agreements with electricity suppliers, or do not benefit from governmental support mechanisms at fixed prices. the group’s investment in jlen is valued at its closing market share price at 31 december 2017. liquidity risk the group adopts a prudent approach to liquidity management by maintaining sufficient cash and available committed facilities to meet its current and upcoming obligations. the table below summarises the life expectancy implied by the
