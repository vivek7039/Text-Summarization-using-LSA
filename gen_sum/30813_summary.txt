There are a number of ongoing secular  drivers for the market which give us  confidence in its sustained  long-term growth. On the other hand, we have seen a rise  in competition from new business  models which provide customers with  increased choice and alternative ways  to order delivered food. While all our analysis shows that pizza  continues to be the most cost-effective  way of feeding a family with delivered  food, the pizza market model of higher  menu prices and big promotional  discounts can make it harder to  compare with other cuisines in value  terms and may affect value perception  as a result. We have also  seen a tighter labour market, created by  high levels of employment and increased  demand for delivery drivers from the  new entrants described above. Our franchisees also  differentiate themselves from delivery  service companies by offering full  employment terms to drivers rather  than flexible contracts. Foreign exchange movements also play a  significant role as most foodstuffs are  easily traded across the European Union.

We believe pizza to be the best value  delivered food, but it is not always perceived  that way by customers. These include our Chipotle Pulled  Pork pizza and a Chilli Cheese stuffed crust,  both of which have been very popular with  customers. As a result,  we saw our average ticket price fall 13.2%  but achieved order volume growth over  the year of 34.9%. Franchisees  meet the cost of new store openings,  which enables us to grow our reach with  limited capital intensity. Our franchisees benefit from the  huge scale and logistics advantages we provide  – giving cost economics that their competitors  are not able to replicate. STRATEGIC REPORT Domino’s Pizza Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 16 Introduction In this section I cover all the financial  aspects of the business – looking not only  at performance but also at other significant  value drivers such as capital allocation and  structure, and return on capital employed. However, this has little  bearing on the system sales operating margin,  which tends to iron out food price volatility. Most of our costs are variable, so we do not  typically experience significant operating  leverage relative to system sales performance. Systems sales does not  represent revenue attributable to  Domino’s as it is derived mainly  from stores owned by franchisees. STATUTORY REVENUE  £m £474.6m 474.6 360.6 316.8 288.7 268.9 Description Statutory revenue represents  revenues directly attributable  to DPG being derived from  monies paid by franchisees for  foodstuffs together with  royalty payments for use of the  Domino’s brand, rental income  from freehold and leasehold  property, and corporate store  sales in Switzerland. Performance in 2017 (1.1)% pts The percentage of orders  delivered within 30 minutes  fell slightly but still remains  a key differentiator. Performance in 2017 +9.1% On a 52 week basis, underlying  operating profit grew 9.1%  achieved through strong store  growth and like-for-like  system sales. OUR APPROACH All businesses choose to take considered  risks in the expectation of earning a  return for their shareholders. Potential impact High Probability Medium Mitigation Open and transparent relationships with  multi-site franchisees are managed at senior  levels of the Group. Potential impact Medium Probability Low Mitigation Management keeps consumers’ purchasing  preferences under continual review and  adjusts menus in response to these. Potential impact High Probability Low Mitigation Suppliers who are selected through  competitive tendering and appropriate due  diligence processes supply the Group  under long-term contracts. At 31 December 2017,  the Group has net debt of £89.2m and a  committed £350m five-year multi-currency  bank facility, which expires in July 2022. Every Domino’s pizza is bursting with  great quality ingredients like hand-stretched  fresh dough, Welsh mozzarella and  vine-ripened tomatoes. We generally recommend about three  slices per person and continue to offer  Delight Cheese with a third less fat than  standard mozzarella. We publish detailed nutritional  profiles for more than 1,500 combinations  of regular pizzas and those made with our  Delight Cheese. We also have an ingredients bible listing  any additives included in our products to help  customers understand why they are present. We do not permit the use of  antibiotics within our supply chain for  anything other than treatment purposes. • All new products must follow strict  nutritional criteria to ensure that they  meet government guidelines on salt,  sugar, calories and portion sizing. We continue to use a financial control  approach to define our organisational  boundary; as a result, we report GHG  emissions from all six markets considered  as part of the Group’s current financial  consolidation: United Kingdom; Republic of  Ireland; Switzerland; Iceland; Norway; and  Sweden. Gender diversity  Following business acquisitions, during the  year we welcomed over 2,000 colleagues  from Norway, Iceland and Sweden into  Domino’s Pizza Group. The majority  of her executive career was  spent at GE Capital and Vodafone,  where she held various senior  marketing roles. Our aim is to maintain a sustainable  business model which creates value  for shareholders and benefits the  Group’s wider stakeholders. Formally check on effectiveness The Board undertakes a formal and  rigorous annual evaluation of its own  performance in each year. In addition,  our brokers are invited to provide an  independent view on matters of strategic  importance such as potential acquisitions  and share buybacks. An explanatory circular containing  the notice of meeting is sent to shareholders  at least 20 working days beforehand, with  separate votes being offered on each  substantive issue. An important factor in achieving this  effectiveness is drawing members from  a range of backgrounds, which has been  shown to help avoid “group think”. Shareholder dialogue  would take place, as appropriate, should  there be any material change of emphasis  in relation to current practices. The Company also offers an  HMRC‑ registered savings ‑ related share  option scheme for all UK ‑ based employees  with more than six months’ service,  including Executive Directors. Service contracts are normally entered  into on a rolling basis, with notice periods  given by the employing company limited to  12 months or less. This award, which is structured as a nil ‑ cost option, vests subject to continuous employment and no other performance criteria. These statements  should be treated with caution due to the  inherent risks and uncertainties underlying  any such forward ‑ looking information.

Details in respect of amounts relating to the  Chairman, certain former Directors and Key Management Personnel are included within note 37. Property, plant and equipment Construction in progress is stated at cost, net of accumulated impairment losses, if any. When significant parts of plant and  equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. IFRS 16, replacing IAS 17, provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities  for all applicable leases. An initial assessment indicates that the adoption of IFRS 9 will not have a material impact on its consolidated results and financial position. On adoption of IFRS 9 this has been assessed as a derivative instrument with subsequent changes in fair value recognised  through profit or loss. Total interest on financial liabilities not at fair value through profit or  loss, including loan costs related to finance for franchisee capital development reported within cost of sales, is £1.9m (2016: £1.2m). In respect of the international market CGUs, no reasonably expected change would give rise to an impairment charge.
