annual report & accounts 2017 02 chairman’s statement rapid and encouraging pr o g re s s • continued strong growth despite a tougher environment for our customers • resilient uk performance is a testament to the quality of our franchisees • international expansion provides growth potential on many fronts • your board’s approach to capital allocation balances immediate returns with investment in the longer term sustainability of growth overview i am pleased to report that domino’s has achieved another year of good growth, despite a more challenging market environment. there are a number of ongoing secular drivers for the market which give us confidence in its sustained long-term growth. on the other hand, we have seen a rise in competition from new business models which provide customers with increased choice and alternative ways to order delivered food. pizza continues to grow, albeit at a lower rate than the overall market for delivered food. pizza remains the most popular choice, offering great tasting food, speed, convenience and value for money. while all our analysis shows that pizza continues to be the most cost-effective way of feeding a family with delivered food, the pizza market model of higher menu prices and big promotional discounts can make it harder to compare with other cuisines in value terms and may affect value perception as a result. this is something we began to address during 2017 through clearer pricing communication, and will continue to focus on in 2018. the collection market while the traditional takeaway or collection market has seen a shift towards delivery over time, this remains a core segment. increasingly our stores are located in high visibility, easy access locations close to other shops and businesses. our two main branded competitors, papa john’s and pizza hut, have a combined market share of 20–25%. businesses such as deliveroo focus more on branded restaurant chains and also take care of delivery. our pizzas are baked using fresh dough, 100% mozzarella cheese and other carefully sourced, high quality ingredients. in 2015 the hourly rate for someone aged 25 was £6.70, since when it has increased by 12% to £7.50. we have also seen a tighter labour market, created by high levels of employment and increased demand for delivery drivers from the new entrants described above. our franchisees also differentiate themselves from delivery service companies by offering full employment terms to drivers rather than flexible contracts. supply capacity inevitably lags price moves both up and down, thus exaggerating any movements in the market. foreign exchange movements also play a significant role as most foodstuffs are easily traded across the european union. we expect food inflation to continue into 2018. milk prices per litre 31.39p 2017 2016 2015 2014 31.39 22.75 25.65 34.15 strategic report domino’s pizza group plc annual report & accounts 2017 08 overview it has been a year of excellent operational and strategic development for domino’s pizza group, with continued organic growth in established markets enhanced by an increasing presence in a number of newer markets. we believe pizza to be the best value delivered food, but it is not always perceived that way by customers. as a result, many customers are still left with the false perception of high menu prices. we have added voice ordering through amazon alexa and integrated apple pay as a payment option. quicker delivery significantly enhances the customer experience and leads to a higher level of repeat ordering. during the year, our % dot fell very slightly, from 82.9% of orders to 81.8%, but still remains a key differentiator. our collection business performed strongly over the year, underpinned by new stores and territory splitting. these include our chipotle pulled pork pizza and a chilli cheese stuffed crust, both of which have been very popular with customers. while the annual survey demonstrated continued strength in key areas such as great tasting food and convenience, we witnessed an emerging weakness in value for money perception, with prices being cited as the single biggest barrier to increased repeat ordering. 2017 saw a return to more normalised sales growth rates, combined with cost pressures on both labour and food. it is also a major source of differentiation versus our competitors, whether in the restaurant or aggregator space. on a 52 week reported basis, system sales were up 19.9% to £60.1m, reflecting the weakness of sterling year-on-year. consolidated system sales for the year from our international operations were £78.1m, with an underlying ebit contribution of £0.8m.

international continued in h1, we lowered menu prices and introduced a delivery charge. as a result, we saw our average ticket price fall 13.2% but achieved order volume growth over the year of 34.9%. conversions are performing well, with weekly sales up around 50% on average compared to their previous runrate. franchisees meet the cost of new store openings, which enables us to grow our reach with limited capital intensity. they supplement the national advertising budget with local marketing, and invest in labour to provide strong customer service. this will give us sufficient highly efficient capacity to produce dough for our target of 1,600 stores. our franchisees benefit from the huge scale and logistics advantages we provide – giving cost economics that their competitors are not able to replicate. strategic report domino’s pizza group plc annual report & accounts 2017 16 introduction in this section i cover all the financial aspects of the business – looking not only at performance but also at other significant value drivers such as capital allocation and structure, and return on capital employed. in any analysis of our performance, it is important to understand the difference between system sales and statutory revenue, and why we as a business focus more on the former as a driver of performance rather than statutory revenue. however, this has little bearing on the system sales operating margin, which tends to iron out food price volatility. most of our costs are variable, so we do not typically experience significant operating leverage relative to system sales performance. the drivers of revenue growth were store openings, like-for-like growth from existing stores, food cost inflation, the acquisition of majority stakes in our nordic businesses, and a positive translation effect from a weaker sterling exchange rate. during the year we invested £36.6m in buying our own shares, at an average price of 339.9p. treasury management in december 2017, the group successfully re-negotiated and increased its unsecured revolving multi-currency facility to £350m. systems sales does not represent revenue attributable to domino’s as it is derived mainly from stores owned by franchisees. statutory revenue £m £474.6m 474.6 360.6 316.8 288.7 268.9 description statutory revenue represents revenues directly attributable to dpg being derived from monies paid by franchisees for foodstuffs together with royalty payments for use of the domino’s brand, rental income from freehold and leasehold property, and corporate store sales in switzerland. link to strategy performance in 2017 +12.5% dividend per share increase of 12.5% reflects improved returns for our shareholders. performance in 2017 (1.1)% pts the percentage of orders delivered within 30 minutes fell slightly but still remains a key differentiator. performance in 2017 +9.1% on a 52 week basis, underlying operating profit grew 9.1% achieved through strong store growth and like-for-like system sales. our approach all businesses choose to take considered risks in the expectation of earning a return for their shareholders. these known risks are taken into account in developing the group’s strategy and business plans. in prior years we had included the implementation of our new erp system as a principal risk. nature of threat these risks could have some impact on future performance, for a limited time. potential impact high probability medium mitigation open and transparent relationships with multi-site franchisees are managed at senior levels of the group. potential impact medium probability low mitigation management keeps consumers’ purchasing preferences under continual review and adjusts menus in response to these. change from 2016  commentary the group is continually reviewing its products to ensure they meet governmental guidelines. the group would be vulnerable if a supplier decided to cease trading, suffered a major interruption or food safety incident, or was responsible for an ethical breach of such severity that the group would no longer trade with them. potential impact high probability low mitigation suppliers who are selected through competitive tendering and appropriate due diligence processes supply the group under long-term contracts. nature of threat these risks have the potential to compromise our future performance for a limited time. the group is considering developing additional dough proving facilities, which would mitigate this risk significantly. nature of threat these risks could have some impact on future performance, for a limited time. those risks are “principal” because they could prevent the group from delivering on its strategy. although we have net debt and a committed bank facility, we could find no plausible scenario which had such an impact on the group’s future performance, solvency or liquidity that it would lead to the group’s financial failure. every domino’s pizza is bursting with great quality ingredients like hand-stretched fresh dough, welsh mozzarella and vine-ripened tomatoes. we generally recommend about three slices per person and continue to offer delight cheese with a third less fat than standard mozzarella. combined, these changes have helped us to remove nearly a tonne of salt from our products. we publish detailed nutritional profiles for more than 1,500 combinations of regular pizzas and those made with our delight cheese. we also have an ingredients bible listing any additives included in our products to help customers understand why they are present. we also offer a gluten-free pizza base, which is becoming increasingly popular with our customers. we do not permit the use of antibiotics within our supply chain for anything other than treatment purposes. • all new products must follow strict nutritional criteria to ensure that they meet government guidelines on salt, sugar, calories and portion sizing. • 19% reduction in emissions intensity ratio to 0.28 tco 2 e per tonne of dough produced, down 37% since baseline. 2 we report all material ghg emissions, using “tonnes of co 2 -equivalent” (‘tco 2 e’) as the unit, to account for all ghg emissions which are attributable to human activity, as defined in section 92 of the climate change act 2008(a). all colleagues who work with us receive an excellent benefits package which includes access to pruhealth “vitality”. gender diversity following business acquisitions, during the year we welcomed over 2,000 colleagues from norway, iceland and sweden into domino’s pizza group. • continued to boost fundraising by customers using pennies in the republic of ireland for barretstown. to date, we have raised almost £2m, which could fund 44 teenage cancer trust specialist nurses for a year, who are responsible for leading nursing care of all the young people on a teenage cancer trust unit and beyond. right now, for every young person teenage cancer trust reaches, there is another they cannot. to reach every young person who needs them, teenage cancer trust is expanding its team of expert nurses to work in local hospitals and patients’ homes so that young people can receive the expert treatment they need, no matter where they live. other appointments stephen is also executive chairman of aim ‑ listed franchise brands plc and its subsidiary companies. stephen hemsley non-executive

for shareholders and benefits the group’s wider stakeholders. additional meetings are arranged as necessary which do not necessarily require the full participation of all directors. 4. formally check on effectiveness the board undertakes a formal and rigorous annual evaluation of its own performance in each year. all of our directors submit themselves for re ‑ election at each agm and we provide shareholders with sufficient information in the meeting papers for them to decide whether their commitment and performance warrant a further year in office. in addition, our brokers are invited to provide an independent view on matters of strategic importance such as potential acquisitions and share buybacks. an explanatory circular containing the notice of meeting is sent to shareholders at least 20 working days beforehand, with separate votes being offered on each substantive issue. an important factor in achieving this effectiveness is drawing members from a range of backgrounds, which

financial statements and statement of compliance with ifrs the financial statements of the group for the 53 weeks ended 31 december 2017 were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 7 march 2018 and the balance sheet was signed on the board’s behalf by david wild. interests in associates and joint ventures the group’s interests in its associates, being those entities over which it has significant influence and which are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. the group has also entered into a number of contractual arrangements with other parties which represent joint ventures. identifiable intangible assets meeting either the contractual-legal or separability criteria are recognised separately from goodwill. contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised if the acquisition-date fair value can be measured reliably. these assets are considered to have finite useful lives and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of each of the assets, considered to be between three and ten years. if not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. property, plant and equipment construction in progress is stated at cost, net of accumulated impairment losses, if any. when significant parts of plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the group depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. the majority of assets within supply chain centre equipment are being depreciated over ten years or more. the following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: royalties, franchise fees and sales to franchisees royalties are based on domino’s pizza system sales to customers and are recognised as the income is earned. ifrs 16, replacing ias 17, provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities for all applicable leases. an initial assessment indicates that the adoption of ifrs 9 will not have a material impact on its consolidated results and financial position. on adoption of ifrs 9 this has been assessed as a derivative instrument with subsequent changes in fair value recognised through profit or loss. at 31 december 2017 £m at 25 december 2016 £m deferred tax asset 8.3
