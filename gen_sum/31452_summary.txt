focus on a few key strategic growth areas – cyber security, network assurance and new wireless services. this will enable our customers to realise their vision of supplying data connectivity with lower cost, higher reliability and security. they also have to reduce their cost of operations by implementing new network architecture and operating practices. within this broad landscape there are market disrupters: virtualisation, the internet of things (iot), 5g wireless and cyber security. connected things range from personal devices, such as a smart stylus, through large autonomous vehicles and industrial infrastructure. there is a necessary increase in spending on cyber security to detect and protect against threats. we will deploy systems in production networks for active test and management to lower the cost of operations. • we are a founding member of the industry group netsecopen, focused on defining new open standards for testing enterprise network security performance. we

for measurement adjusted operating margin is a measure of the group’s overall profitability. reason for measurement long-term growth in adjusted basic eps is a fundamental driver to increasing shareholder value. the board has determined that a three-year period should be used when assessing viability, as explained on page 97 of this annual report. technology change spirent sells complex solutions in industries that can be subject to rapid technological changes. spirent’s success is dependent in part on proprietary technology which may be infringed by others. intellectual property claims can result in significant defence costs, and may affect spirent’s ability to market its products. all spirent’s businesses work very closely with customers and remain focused on their requirements. each business makes investment decisions specifically related to their solutions portfolio based on market needs. spirent continues to focus its investment into areas that offer the most potential for sustainable earnings growth. over recent years there has been significant consolidation in our customer base amongst service providers and network equipment manufacturers. it also reduces the potential number of customers to whom those solutions and services could be sold. one of the group’s strategic objectives is to invest in deepening our customer relationships. disruption, financial problems of contract manufacturers or limitations in their manufacturing capacity could limit supply and/or increase cost. there would also be a potential impact on spirent’s credibility in the security market. in addition, the group’s largest manufacturing subcontractor has multiple worldwide sites and comprehensive business continuity plans. actions by competitors and increased competition can bring about pressure on spirent’s gross margin. these factors could also affect spirent’s competitive position, thereby reducing revenue and consequently affecting financial results. the group’s broad solution portfolio, market-leading capabilities and customer focus continue to address this risk. spirent aims to maintain market- leading positions through significant investment in the development of differentiated products. competitor activity is closely monitored with a view to maintaining clear differentiation based on spirent’s products, services and global reach. acquisitions a key element of spirent’s strategy is to develop new capabilities and technologies, sometimes through acquisition. underperformance by acquisitions will impact the group’s results and may lead to impairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets. our business strategy can be summarised as follows: • to lead in high-speed ethernet/ip performance testing of emerging standards for data centers and wide area networks. revenue $261.0m $262.2m 2016 32 ahead of the cloud the rise of cloud computing and streaming high definition video services means that internet traffic is increasing by almost 25 per cent per year – a technical challenge if ever there was one. our wave 2 wireless local area network (wlan) solution received the 2017 best of interop grand prize. • early in 2017, we announced the spirent pt testbench, a testing, analysis and reporting application to help developers build more accurate positioning functions quickly, embodying over 30 years of spirent gnss testing expertise, enabling users to setup, run and interpret tests with a single mouse click. cyberflood was the first platform to offer proactive testing for wannacry ransomware, demonstrated at black hat. • we are a founding member of the industry group netsecopen, focused on defining open standards for testing enterprise network security performance. “this is a critical time for the cyber security industry,” said crest president ian glover. service providers worldwide are investing in their networks to keep up with these performance demands. realise virtualised solutions the internet protocol network industry is amid a revolutionary technology transformation driven by virtualisation enabling technologies, such as sdn and nfv. our active test solutions provide superior ability to isolate and resolve issues in virtualised network environments where traditional passive approaches are less effective. “spirent’s test platform allows us to test the overall network experience so that we can be certain the end user experience is the best it can be.” spirent communications plc annual report 2017 37 strategic report corporate governance financial statements other information strategic report operating review continued our strategy can be summarised as follows: • to develop active service assurance systems for ethernet business service, mobile network turn-up, troubleshooting and optimisation, enhancing our ability to win business at tier 1 carriers. performance highlights • sucessfully secured fifteen deals over $1 miilion, totalling about $50 million in 2017, as evidence our strategy is working. they reduce churn by aggregating and analysing data from multiple sources to provide real-time insights into the customers’ experience. nokia envisage spirent velocity will speed up their 5g lifecycle tests while bringing down the costs. the test methodology will be incorporated into an automated testing system developed by china mobile research institute. the project demonstrates how network functions virtualisation (nfv) and open interfaces enable radically faster service innovation with fewer resources. using our products or services, service providers can understand how new mobile devices operate on their network. spirent’s solutions enable carriers to validate the most stringent requirements, including internet protocol multimedia subsystem signalling themes, mobility scenarios, and user experience evaluation. • china telecom corporation limited, one of the world’s largest mobile telephone operators, selected our spirent umetrix voice solution to help ensure that handsets are able to deliver superior call quality by setting stringent quality requirements and by measuring the performance of every new smartphone. early 5g deployments are anticipated in several markets, including the united states, south korea, japan and china. the highlights were a robust performance from lifecycle service assurance, with 10 per cent revenue growth and adjusted operating margin increased to 16.4 per cent, and the profitability turnaround of connected devices, which delivered an improvement in adjusted operating profit of $9.6 million on lower revenue. adjusted basic earnings per share increased by 43 per cent to 7.55 cents reflecting the growth in adjusted operating profit and reduced tax charge in 2017. cash at bank closed at $128.4

time following appointment as an executive director. corporate governance report on directors’ remuneration continued spirent communications plc annual report 2017 82 share incentive interests awarded during the year in 2017, the committee approved an award of performance shares to mr hutchinson and ms bell equivalent to 150 per cent and 100 per cent of base salary respectively. any additional cash or share-based awards on recruitment of an executive director which may fall outside the policy statement would be performance-related and would therefore be regarded as variable remuneration and fall within the company’s standard 400 per cent cap. it is intended that this policy would also apply to new appointments of executive directors. when recruiting non-executive directors, the remuneration arrangements offered will generally be in line with those set out above. details of any payments will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise. it is expected that incidents of harassment are reported to the appropriate human resources director. the group encourages an open culture in all its dealings between employees and people with whom it comes into contact. every effort

acquired intangible assets, being customer lists, current technology, database, brand names and a non-compete covenant, are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives and the charge is included within other items in the income statement. after technological feasibility is established, additional costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life. cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a first-in, first-out basis, including all attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity. provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. contingent liabilities contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only on the occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain future events outside the group’s control, or present obligations that are not recognised because it is not probable that a settlement will be required or the value of such a payment cannot be reliably measured. such allowances are based on an assessment of receivable ageing, past experience or known customer exposures. consequently all gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to the income statement. revenue from maintenance contracts is recognised over the period of performance on a straight line basis. contractual arrangements are accounted for as two or more separate transactions only where the commercial substance is that the individual components operate independently of each other, because they are capable of being provided separately from one another and it is possible to attribute reliable fair values to every component. employee benefits when an employee has rendered services to the group during an accounting period, short-term benefits expected to be paid in exchange for those services are recognised in

differences in measured time signals from clocks on satellites to calculate these positions and altitudes. in addition to its wireless interface specification, lte uses a simplified flat ip-based network architecture. universal mobile telecommunications system (umts) the most common 3g wireless technology globally, which uses wideband code division multiple access on its underlying air interface and offers support for data transfer rates from hundreds of kilobits per second to tens of megabits per second. virtual evolved packet core (vepc) a framework for virtualising the functions required to converge voice and data on 4g long-term evolution (lte) networks. vepc moves the core network’s individual components from dedicated hardware to software that operates on low-cost commercial off-the-shelf servers.
