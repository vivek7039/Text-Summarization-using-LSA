areas of growth. throughout wilmington plc, we are fortunate to have highly talented people working in our businesses. the main communities that use our offerings are healthcare professionals on an increasingly global basis. adjusted profit before tax (which now for the first time includes share based payment costs of £0.6m (2016: £0.6m)) increased 5% to £21.4m (2016: £20.3m). we enter the new financial year anticipating continued momentum, particularly in our risk & compliance and healthcare divisions. new reporting structure as previously announced, to help simplify wilmington still further we reorganised our business into three divisions; risk & compliance, professional and healthcare. this division focuses on supporting the post-qualification needs of individual professionals and smes with an increasing emphasis on exploiting international opportunities, and an accelerated move to expand our digital -learning solutions; areas where we feel the revenue growth opportunities are greatest. in line with our strategy all three divisions offer information, networking and education capabilities servicing key defined communities, supported by best- in-class technology. the positive cashflow characteristics of wilmington matched with clear fiscal discipline in turn help us attract and maintain significant finance from third party providers. in this context, we were delighted to announce two acquisitions during the year both of which were consistent with our strategy of acquiring complementary businesses with high repeat revenues in our chosen knowledge areas and communities. mark asplin chairman 12 september 2017 strategic report 09 www.wilmingtonplc.com stock code: wil 25570-4 ar2017 27 september 2017 10:58 am proof 4 group strategy our strategy is to further develop its business into a knowledge based model and structure focussing on serving the needs of chosen communities with an overall objective of becoming a single integrated international business. we set out below our strategic objectives that aim to achieve this and in so doing increased shareholder value. the weekly print magazine has been slowly phased out; july 2017 saw its last edition printed. these measures, in the opinion of the directors, can be useful to readers when they provide relevant information on our future or past performance and equivalent information cannot be presented by using financial measures defined under ifrs. the group integrates acquired businesses into existing companies over time, and therefore the board does not deem it appropriate or practical to identify income relating specifically to acquired intangible assets, so no adjustment is made in this respect. 25570-4 ar2017 27 september 2017 10:58 am proof 4 3 adjusted earnings per share this key measure indicates the underlying profit attributable to individual shareholders. one important measure is the roe which we seek to maintain at over 30.0% pre tax. each of the operating divisions monitors, and is in turn assessed on, their own key performance measures. this year we delivered an improved performance against the majority of our divisional financial and operational targets.

databases. investment bank training as previously reported had a weak first half year which was mainly due to the competition issues previously highlighted but also due to some softening of training assignments in the asia pacific region. the main communities that use our offerings are healthcare professionals on an increasingly global basis. the underwood street premises has served wilmington well for many years but given its modular structure arranged over 4 floors it was not consistent with our vision and strategic objective of encouraging greater collaboration, flexible working and the

therefore part of day to day planning to make certain financial and operational investments in pursuit of growth objectives, accepting the risk that the anticipated benefits from these investments may not always be fully realised. regulatory change following brexit should increase demand for our product and service offerings in the short to medium term. just as importantly, the group operates a
