Adjusted profit before tax (which now for the first time includes share based payment costs of £0.6m (2016: £0.6m)) increased 5% to £21.4m (2016: £20.3m). We enter the new financial year anticipating continued momentum, particularly in our Risk & Compliance and Healthcare divisions. New Reporting Structure As previously announced, to help simplify Wilmington still further we reorganised our business into three divisions; Risk & Compliance, Professional and Healthcare. This division focuses on supporting the post-qualification needs of individual professionals and SMEs with an increasing emphasis on exploiting international opportunities, and an accelerated move to expand our digital -learning solutions; areas where we feel the revenue growth opportunities are greatest. In line with our strategy all three divisions offer information, networking and education capabilities servicing key defined communities, supported by best- in-class technology. The positive cashflow characteristics of Wilmington matched with clear fiscal discipline in turn help us attract and maintain significant finance from third party providers. MARK ASPLIN Chairman 12 September 2017 Strategic Report 09 www.wilmingtonplc.com Stock Code: WIL 25570-4 AR2017 27 September 2017 10:58 AM Proof 4 Group Strategy Our strategy is to further develop its business into a knowledge based model and structure focussing on serving the needs of chosen communities with an overall objective of becoming a single integrated international business. We set out below our strategic objectives that aim to achieve this and in so doing increased shareholder value. 25570-4 AR2017 27 September 2017 10:58 AM Proof 4 3 Adjusted Earnings per Share This key measure indicates the underlying profit attributable to individual shareholders. Each of the operating divisions monitors, and is in turn assessed on, their own key performance measures. This year we delivered an improved performance against the majority of our Divisional financial and operational targets. For 2017/18 continued investment is being made to strengthen the content offering and more topic areas will be added together with supporting databases. The Underwood Street premises has served Wilmington well for many years but given its modular structure arranged over 4 floors it was not consistent with our vision and strategic objective of encouraging greater collaboration, flexible working and the building of a “one Wilmington” team. Mercia firmly employs technology as an enabler for its clients – accountancy businesses ranging in size from sole practitioners to top-ten firms. These are projects that mean recruiting new team members, highly capable people who thrive on responsibility, enjoy technical challenges and exceed demanding targets. Moving them away from familiar but outdated products, and supporting the transition to new, digital alternatives is essential.” Alongside with growing business in Spain, Susana finds time to progress another of her key strategic tasks – expanding Inese’s business into Latin America.

Described by a former colleague as having “an outstanding ability to execute”, Loïc is a finance professional who worked in the aerospace and defence industries, before moving in the early 2000s to what was then an emerging digital-insights sector for healthcare professionals. For the next decade, Loïc broadened his experience in financial, sales and general-management roles with a leading international healthcare-insight company. As you would expect from a proven early adopter, there is clear evidence of successful innovation at APM; in 2016, it launched APMjob.com, an online job board – and the company’s first non- editorial product. “In fact, I’m very comfortable with all Wilmington’s core values as they have been guiding my career for many years. Wilmington plays an important role in supporting the charity community, for example www.charitychoice.co.uk, a website which supports charities and raises awareness of their fundraising activities. Accordingly, whilst environmental issues are important we do not believe that they constitute a risk for the Group. The vast majority of paper is produced at mills with ISO 14001 accreditation and Environmental Management System (‘EMAS’) registration. Printers All our major print suppliers are ISO14001 certified or encouraged to work towards a minimum of this standard. Wilmington seeks to be socially responsible, having a positive impact on the communities within which it operates. For the first time share based payments of £0.6m (2016: £0.6m) are included within operating expenses before adjusting items, amortisation and impairment. 23 www.wilmingtonplc.com Stock Code: WIL Strategic Report 25570-4 AR2017 27 September 2017 10:58 AM Proof 4 Trade and other payables Total balances increased from £43.9m to £52.3m. Trade and other payables increased by £3.8m to £25.4m (2016: £21.6m) reflecting, inter alia, acquisitions in the period which accounted for £1.1m. Regulatory change following Brexit should increase demand for our product and service offerings in the short to medium term. Just as importantly, the Group operates a meritocratic culture where everyone can maximise his or her potential.

The Executive Committee together with individual Managing Directors are responsible for identifying acquisitions in their business sectors, subject to Board approval. Digitalisation is compelling our clients and customers to revisit their business models increasingly shaped by the digital world. The Group’s acquisition model ensures retention of management and staff in acquired businesses meaning that local expertise is maintained. Wilmington’s Data Protection Officer (DPO) is running a GDPR compliance programme to ensure that all businesses are prepared. It is based principally on reviewing reports from management to consider whether significant risks are identified, evaluated, managed and controlled. The Committee considers any issues or risks arising from internal audit in order that appropriate actions can be undertaken for their satisfactory resolution. Going concern As highlighted in note 20 to the financial statements, the Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through an overdraft facility and a revolving credit facility which were extended on 1 July 2015 and are next due for renewal on 1 July 2020. During the year we have continued to promote a culture guided by four core values – enabling, enhancing, collaborating and innovating. 41 www.wilmingtonplc.com Stock Code: WIL Our Governance 25570-4 AR2017 27 September 2017 10:58 AM Proof 4 Access to independent advice All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary who ensures that Board processes are followed and good corporate governance standards are maintained. Any Director who considers it necessary or appropriate may take independent, professional advice at the company’s expense. Such provision will however be assessed on a case-by-case basis so that the best placed adviser is retained. The Group regularly use other providers to ensure that independence and full value for money are achieved. It should be noted that at 30 June 2017 Anthony Foye held shares worth significantly more than the shareholding guideline level. All Non-Executive Directors have initial fixed term agreements with the Company of no more than three years. Fees are subject to an overall cap as set out in the Company’s Articles of Association. The Committee may make payments or awards in respect of hiring an employee to ‘buy out’ remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer. Any such payments or awards are excluded from the maximum level of variable remuneration referred to above. Where considered appropriate, such special recruitment awards will be liable to forfeiture or ‘claw back’ on early departure. Where a position is filled internally, any ongoing remuneration obligations or outstanding variable pay elements shall be allowed to continue in accordance with their terms. Change of control Awards under the PSP will generally vest early on a takeover or other relevant corporate event. The goodwill and intangible assets (excluding computer software) balance of £115 million, allocated across multiple cash-generating units (‘CGUs’), are subject to an annual impairment review. 25570-4 AR2017 27 September 2017 10:58 AM Proof 4 Wilmington plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2017 72 Balance Sheets as at 30 June 2017 Group Company Notes 2017 £’000 2016 £’000 2017 £’000 2016 £’000 Non-current assets Goodwill 12 86,028 70,763 — — Intangible assets 13 31,911 29,038 — — Property, plant and equipment 14 4,444 4,628 — 674 Investments in subsidiaries 15 — — 49,420 49,420 Deferred tax assets 21 820 942 285 384 123,203 105,371 49,705 50,478 Current assets Trade and other receivables 16 28,444 26,121 84,863 65,972 Cash and cash equivalents 10,687 14,642 70 1,603 39,131 40,763 84,933 67,575 Total assets 162,334 146,134 134,638 118,053 Current liabilities Trade and other payables 18 (52,330) (43,896) (28,337) (18,422) Current tax liabilities (1,932) (1,553) — — Deferred consideration – cash settled (177) (1,272) — — Derivative financial instruments 17 — (1,013) — (1,013) Borrowings 19 (925) (2,204) (4,761) (583) (55,364) (49,938) (33,098) (20,018) Non-current liabilities Borrowings 19 (49,353) (46,697) (14,572) (12,399) Deferred consideration – cash settled (2,305) (1,370) — — Derivative financial instruments 17 (662) (1,037) (662) (1,037) Deferred tax liabilities 21 (4,585) (3,989) — — Provisions for future purchase of non-controlling interests (100) (100) — — (57,005) (53,193) (15,234) (13,436) Total liabilities (112,369) (103,131) (48,332) (33,454) Net assets 49,965 43,003 86,306 84,599 Equity Share capital 22 4,362 4,349 4,362 4,349 Share premium 22 45,225 45,225 45,225 45,225 Treasury shares 22 (96) (96) (96) (96) Share based payments reserve 898 886 898 886 Translation reserve 3,541 2,602 — — Retained (losses)/earnings (4,051) (10,116) 35,917 34,235 Equity attributable to owners of the parent 49,879 42,850 86,306 84,599 Non-controlling interests 24 86 153 — — Total equity 49,965 43,003 86,306 84,599 The notes on pages 76 to 114 are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
