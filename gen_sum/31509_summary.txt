food-on-the-go greggs is a strong and trusted brand and we draw on our heritage in fresh bakery to compete successfully in the food-on-the-go market. today we’re just as keen for greggs to have a positive impact on people’s lives. great tasting, freshly prepared food competitive supply chain best customer experience first class support teams strategy 06 greggs plc annual report and accounts 2017 chairman’s statement greggs performed well in 2017, delivering further like-for-like sales growth as well as expanding its estate of shops. this was achieved despite significant inflationary headwinds and alongside continued major investment in line with our strategic plan. as i reported last year this involved taking some difficult decisions, particularly regarding the organisation of our manufacturing and logistics operations. this year i also spent time with an employee panel, a particularly helpful experience given the significant changes that we are making in our supply chain. that’s why we donate at least one per cent of our pre-tax profits to the greggs foundation and fundraise all year round for this fantastic charity. we offer great value at every time of the day and care about where our ingredients come from. we’re proud of our commitment to purchasing fairtrade products and take great care to ensure that the animal products used in our recipes are produced and delivered in a way that avoids the abuse or exploitation of animals. our strategy has four pillars: 1. great tasting, freshly prepared food greggs products are differentiated by the way we freshly prepare food each day in our shops and by offering outstanding value for good quality, great tasting food-on-the-go. sales of hot sandwiches and hot soup are growing well and provide a platform for further menu development, which we intend will create the opportunity to extend trading in greggs for longer in the day as our reputation grows. making good, freshly prepared food accessible to all income levels is embedded in our core purpose as a brand with outstanding value meal deals setting us apart from the competition. balanced choice growing public concern over obesity is driving increased demand for healthier choices in food-on- the-go. greggs has a key role to play in encouraging healthier food choices, making good quality freshly prepared food accessible nationwide at outstanding did you know… breakfast remains the fastest-growing part of our trading day and we continue to build increased spend and visit frequency through menu development. look closer at how we are being more socially responsible on pages 16-23 12 greggs plc annual report and accounts 2017 we have a strong pipeline of new shop openings for 2018 and are planning to further accelerate our shop growth, aiming to add in the range of 110-130 net new shops in the year. working in a greggs shop is very demanding so we rely on our amazing teams to deliver fast, friendly service under pressure. our shops the key consideration when customers choose where to shop for food-on-the-go is convenience. chief executive’s report continued we completed 132 refurbishments and franchise partners refurbished a further ten units. decisions such as these, which impact our people, are always difficult but our teams have shown commitment and professionalism throughout these changes and we have been able to agree a way forward on a basis of voluntary redundancy in the majority of cases. this investment phase is a complicated programme of work which will take until 2020 to complete. 4. first class support teams we have made further significant progress in the fourth year of our major process and systems investment programme. did you know… our healthier options are increasingly popular – balanced choice now accounts for over £100m of sales. these included the award-winning greggs breakfast club programme which, with support from 80 partners, now provides six million free wholesome breakfasts each year to children in over 465 primary schools. we are currently conducting a trial in 20 shops across manchester and liverpool city centres to establish feasibility for in-store recycling of hot drinks cups. this will give us the opportunity to ensure we have a robust and effective process in place before potentially rolling out further. reducing the use of plastic in society is another issue where we are trying to play our part. going forward, we aim to reduce further the amount of plastic involved in our processes. our balanced choice range continues to grow in popularity and now accounts for more than £100 million of sales. we made a ‘pledge for veg’ in partnership with the food foundation which will enable us to help customers increase their vegetable intake through our salads, soups and cold sandwiches. we only use palm-derived fats and oils in our ingredients, that are certified as sustainable. during that time, our team members and customers have helped raise over £8.5 million for the charity – something we are all incredibly proud of! this information will prove invaluable in helping our shop teams to deliver a great greggs customer experience every day. we also extended our leeds bakery to create a centre of excellence for cake and muffin production. more products will feature in 2018 as we create new reasons to visit us for food-on-the-go, at all times of the day. the result reflects strong sales growth in a year when, as expected, we experienced higher than historical cost inflation. total group sales for the 52 weeks ended 30 december 2017: £960m like-for-like sales in company-managed shops grew by: 3.7% 25 greggs plc annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report in 2017 the total cash impact of exceptional items was a net outflow of £1.9 million (2016: £3.8 million cash outflow). these were in addition to the property gain on disposal of our edinburgh site, which was treated as exceptional. should this progress to completion, any resultant profit will also be treated as an exceptional gain. this is covered two times by diluted earnings per share before exceptional items in line with our progressive dividend policy. overall we plan capital expenditure of around £95 million in 2018. there will be further investment to complete our supply chain programme across 2019 and 2020 and the bulk of the work to modernise our it systems should also complete in this timeframe. the scheme underwent a full actuarial revaluation in 2017 , which showed no current requirement for company contributions. we continue to see particularly strong returns on the relocation of shops within their existing catchments. we do not have responsibility for any emission sources that are outside of our operational control. female male total board 3 4 7 senior managers 58 78 136 other managers 276 281 557 all employees 15,408 6,326 21,734 percentage of women on the board: 43% percentage of employees who are

well-established risk management processes embedded within the business, which enable us to identify, evaluate, record and monitor significant risks. additional risks and uncertainties, not presently known to management or deemed less material currently, may also have an adverse effect on the business. procedures are in place throughout our supply sites and shops to ensure that food safety is maintained. we phase our change activity to avoid affecting the company as a whole wherever possible. the new general data protection regulation (gdpr) provides a rigorous control framework, with severe penalties for non-compliance. we are working to ensure compliance with the gdpr requirements, including data mapping, policy development and staff training. wider economic uncertainty and job insecurity may cause consumers to be more cautious with their discretionary spending. this may be compounded by the relative complexity of our shop operations compared with other retailers. procedures

2017 dear shareholder, i am pleased to introduce our governance report, which follows on pages 41 to 47. in 2017, the executive team undertook an extensive consultation exercise to explain to our people in more detail what impact our £100 million investment in our supply chain could have on their working lives. at these meetings it reviews strategy, financial performance against key indicators, resources, risk management and other matters reserved for the board. the emerging themes included a review of our risk disclosures, looking forward on board succession planning, harvesting best practice from non-executive director experience on other boards, and considering how to engage better with stakeholders in meeting companies act (s172) obligations. the audit committee currently consists of four independent non-executive directors: allison kirkby (chair), helena ganczakowski, peter mcphillips and sandra turner. the nominations committee did not seek external consultancy support during 2017. following appointment, new directors are subject to an in-depth tailored induction process. the board receives reports on any comments received from shareholders and market analysts following these presentations. this request has been enshrined within the audit committee’s terms of reference, which are available at corporate.greggs.co.uk. any matters raised are treated in confidence and an independent review will be undertaken where it is appropriate. two areas which were previously considered to be significant – accounting for onerous leases and shop asset impairment – are no longer included above as the amounts provided have been utilised to such an extent that they are no longer material. expenditure in accordance with this plan can then be committed without further referral to the audit committee. two reports were made during the year, relating to inappropriate management behaviour and product theft. it is simple and consistent, with pay outcomes dependent upon performance linked to our business strategy. our related amendment to the psp rules was also approved with a majority vote of 97.14 per cent. consequently, the roce ranges have been increased to ensure that they remain appropriately stretching in light of our business strategy, without encouraging undue risk taking. no maximum limit is prescribed particularly as the cost of providing insured benefits fluctuates over time. no more than 25% of the bonus opportunity is payable under each element for threshold performance. they may also receive limited travel or accommodation related benefits in connection with their role as a director. with the sip, all colleagues may purchase company shares from pre-tax salary subject to hmrc limits. any future executive directors’ service contracts will be terminable on 12 months’ notice served by either party. there are no contractual provisions in force other than those set out above that impact any termination payment. the following table shows the effective date of appointment for each non-executive director: non-executive director original date of appointment ian durant 5 october 2011 allison kirkby 30 january 2013 helena ganczakowski 2 january 2014 peter mcphillips 10 march 2014 sandra turner 1 may 2014 non-executive directors are appointed on an understanding that the appointment will last for at least six years, but without any commitment by either party. the strategic objectives for each bonus cycle are based on measures which will provide a strong link to future value creation. where appropriate a sliding scale of targets is set for each kpi to encourage continuous improvement, or sustained high performance. bonus targets for the forthcoming year are considered to be commercially sensitive and so have not been disclosed. retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be made in next year’s annual report on remuneration. for these awards the roce ranges have been increased to ensure that they remain appropriately stretching in light of our business strategy without encouraging undue risk taking. 2 2017 remuneration until date of retirement

£3.9 million) determined with reference to a benchmark of company profit before tax normalised to exclude exceptional items of which it represents 5 per cent (2016: 5 per cent). based solely on that
