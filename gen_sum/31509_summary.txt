Today we’re just as keen for Greggs to have a positive impact on people’s lives. Great tasting, freshly prepared food Competitive supply chain Best customer experience First class support teams Strategy 06 Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT Greggs performed well in 2017, delivering further like-for-like sales growth as well as expanding its estate of shops. This was achieved despite significant inflationary headwinds and alongside continued major investment in line with our strategic plan. As I reported last year this involved taking some difficult decisions, particularly regarding the organisation of our manufacturing and logistics operations. This year I also spent time with an employee panel, a particularly helpful experience given the significant changes that we are making in our supply chain. That’s why we donate at least one per cent of our pre-tax profits to the Greggs Foundation and fundraise all year round for this fantastic charity. We offer great value at every time of the day and care about where our ingredients come from. We’re proud of our commitment to purchasing Fairtrade products and take great care to ensure that the animal products used in our recipes are produced and delivered in a way that avoids the abuse or exploitation of animals. Making good, freshly prepared food accessible to all income levels is embedded in our core purpose as a brand with outstanding value meal deals setting us apart from the competition. Balanced Choice Growing public concern over obesity is driving increased demand for healthier choices in food-on- the-go. Greggs has a key role to play in encouraging healthier food choices, making good quality freshly prepared food accessible nationwide at outstanding Did you know… Breakfast remains the fastest-growing part of our trading day and we continue to build increased spend and visit frequency through menu development. Look closer at how we are being more socially responsible on pages 16-23 12 Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 We have a strong pipeline of new shop openings for 2018 and are planning to further accelerate our shop growth, aiming to add in the range of 110-130 net new shops in the year. Working in a Greggs shop is very demanding so we rely on our amazing teams to deliver fast, friendly service under pressure. Decisions such as these, which impact our people, are always difficult but our teams have shown commitment and professionalism throughout these changes and we have been able to agree a way forward on a basis of voluntary redundancy in the majority of cases. First class support teams We have made further significant progress in the fourth year of our major process and systems investment programme. Scoping work has also begun for the remaining SAP support modules, with human resources, payroll and property management to be implemented in 2018. These included the award-winning Greggs Breakfast Club programme which, with support from 80 partners, now provides six million free wholesome breakfasts each year to children in over 465 primary schools. We are currently conducting a trial in 20 shops across Manchester and Liverpool city centres to establish feasibility for in-store recycling of hot drinks cups. This will give us the opportunity to ensure we have a robust and effective process in place before potentially rolling out further. Reducing the use of plastic in society is another issue where we are trying to play our part. Our Balanced Choice range continues to grow in popularity and now accounts for more than £100 million of sales. We made a ‘Pledge for Veg’ in partnership with the Food Foundation which will enable us to help customers increase their vegetable intake through our salads, soups and cold sandwiches. During that time, our team members and customers have helped raise over £8.5 million for the charity – something we are all incredibly proud of! This information will prove invaluable in helping our shop teams to deliver a great Greggs customer experience every day. We also extended our Leeds bakery to create a centre of excellence for cake and muffin production. More products will feature in 2018 as we create new reasons to visit us for food-on-the-go, at all times of the day. The result reflects strong sales growth in a year when, as expected, we experienced higher than historical cost inflation. Total Group sales for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017: £960m Like-for-like sales in company-managed shops grew by: 3.7% 25 Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report In 2017 the total cash impact of exceptional items was a net outflow of £1.9 million (2016: £3.8 million cash outflow). These were in addition to the property gain on disposal of our Edinburgh site, which was treated as exceptional. This is covered two times by diluted earnings per share before exceptional items in line with our progressive dividend policy. We will also continue to grow and diversify our shop estate through the opening of c.90 new company-managed shops, with further openings funded by franchise partners.

Additional risks and uncertainties, not presently known to management or deemed less material currently, may also have an adverse effect on the business. Procedures are in place throughout our supply sites and shops to ensure that food safety is maintained. The new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides a rigorous control framework, with severe penalties for non-compliance. We are working to ensure compliance with the GDPR requirements, including data mapping, policy development and staff training. Wider economic uncertainty and job insecurity may cause consumers to be more cautious with their discretionary spending.

Roger began his career at Marks and Spencer where he spent 20 years, ultimately becoming head of its food business. At these meetings it reviews strategy, financial performance against key indicators, resources, risk management and other matters reserved for the Board. The Audit Committee currently consists of four independent Non-Executive Directors: Allison Kirkby (Chair), Helena Ganczakowski, Peter McPhillips and Sandra Turner. The Remuneration Committee currently consists of four independent Non-Executive Directors: Sandra Turner (Chair), Helena Ganczakowski, Allison Kirkby and Peter McPhillips. This request has been enshrined within the Audit Committee’s terms of reference, which are available at corporate.greggs.co.uk. Any matters raised are treated in confidence and an independent review will be undertaken where it is appropriate. Expenditure in accordance with this plan can then be committed without further referral to the Audit Committee. Our related amendment to the PSP rules was also approved with a majority vote of 97.14 per cent. Consequently, the ROCE ranges have been increased to ensure that they remain appropriately stretching in light of our business strategy, without encouraging undue risk taking. They may also receive limited travel or accommodation related benefits in connection with their role as a Director. There are no contractual provisions in force other than those set out above that impact any termination payment. The strategic objectives for each bonus cycle are based on measures which will provide a strong link to future value creation. Where appropriate a sliding scale of targets is set for each KPI to encourage continuous improvement, or sustained high performance. Bonus targets for the forthcoming year are considered to be commercially sensitive and so have not been disclosed. Retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be made in next year’s annual report on remuneration. For these awards the ROCE ranges have been increased to ensure that they remain appropriately stretching in light of our business strategy without encouraging undue risk taking. These indices were chosen for this comparison because they include companies of broadly similar size to the Company.
