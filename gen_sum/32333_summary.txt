(usp). we have achieved the milestone of 3.0m customers, added 100 new partners and reached 50m affinity partner households, making good progress towards our 80m household target. we delivered a 50%

membership limited, a group company, purchased npower’s ‘domestic care and maintenance’ contracts business. as a result of these investments, together with ongoing partner payments, we expect capital expenditure to be around £70m in fy18. as previously stated, we are prepared to see leverage increase for reasonable periods of time if circumstances warrant this. we also regularly review the methods by which we interact with our customers ensuring their needs are met and providing them with updated tools to purchase, renew and review their policy holdings for example through our latest digital initiatives. during the year, our marketing channels performed as we expected with direct mail response rates continuing to perform well. it is possible such legislative changes could reduce, or even remove, the need for some of our products and services. we have maintained appropriate dialogue with all relevant regulatory bodies that govern or influence our businesses and have sought to engage, where possible, in regulatory and compliance discussions around the development of the markets in which we operate. processes have been established to ensure that all directly employed engineers and sub-contractors meet minimum standards. the inability to attract, motivate or retain key talent could impact on our overall business performance. strategic report 48 principal risks and uncertainties (continued) risk description / impact mitigation change since 2016 annual report our it systems become a constraint to growth and drive inefficiency instead of efficiency improvements the group’s core it system is used in each of our businesses. the system is now around 20 years old and has had a number of ‘in house’ developments. this could result in a loss of customers, legal liability, regulatory action or harm to our reputation. we have a number of defensive and proactive practices across the group to mitigate this risk. we have a detailed information security policy, which is communicated across the group and training provided as required. where necessary, this is achieved by entering into interest rate swaps for certain periods, in which we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount. retention rates are high across all established businesses, resulting in stable and recurring cashflows from a large, diverse customer base. we are committed to developing and implementing a successful corporate responsibility programme that beneﬁts key stakeholders. we will take all practicable steps to ensure that if an employee becomes disabled during the time they are employed, their employment can continue. we have co-ordinated talent and leadership programmes across the business, from front-line developing leaders to senior executives. we continue to support the midland langar seva society, which feeds homeless people in birmingham 365 days a year. in fy17, we contributed $45,000 to key charities; red rover foundation, american cancer society, humane society, best buddies (disabled children) and ct advocates of southwest connecticut • homeserve cares and goodwill jobs where we assist customers with repairs that they could otherwise not a’ord. over 230 employees have raised money for cancer charities including races across spain and a charity football tournament organised by the ngo “cooperación internacional”. 59 annual report & accounts 2017 leadership johnathan ford, group chief operating o‡cer, is the

provided their comments to the chairman of the board or committee. newly appointed board members are required to undergo an induction programme, which includes obtaining a thorough understanding of the group’s various operations. board members also have the opportunity to receive formal training from external providers if they wish. by order of the board jm barry gibson chairman 23 may 2017 governance audit & risk committee report 74 members mark morris (chairman) chris havemann ben mingay the audit & risk committee is chaired by mark morris who has recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience. the policy has been updated in respect of fy18 and beyond to comply with eu audit regulation reforms. a report on completed internal audits is presented to the committee and, where appropriate, action plans are reviewed. remuneration for executive directors is structured so that the variable pay element forms a signiﬁcant portion of each director’s package. furthermore there is a clawback provision in respect of annual bonuses and long-term incentive awards which helps to guard further against excessive risk-taking. however, any salary increases will normally be no higher than the typical level of increase awarded to other uk employees. before any bonus is payable a minimum level of both customer and ﬁnancial performance must be achieved. bonuses are based on group performance and, if relevant, the speciﬁc territory for which an executive director is responsible. a minimum level of both customer and ﬁnancial performance must be achieved before any bonus becomes payable. three years awards of performance and matching shares are granted under the long term incentive plan (which was approved by shareholders in 2008). di’erent measures may be applied for future award cycles as appropriate to reﬂect the business strategy. these are balanced by the use of ﬁnancial targets and personal objectives used to reﬂect other strategic priorities. the dividend roll up on unexercised nil cost options will continue until ﬁve years from grant. richard harpin participates in a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme which has been valued according to bis regulations. david bower will not receive a matching award in fy18 having only recently been appointed to the board. outplacement services may be provided where appropriate, and any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims in connection with a termination (including, at the discretion of the committee, reimbursement for legal advice) would be paid as necessary. generally, any outstanding share awards will lapse when an executive leaves employment, except in certain circumstances. ltip awards may be made shortly following an appointment (assuming the company is not in a closed period). fees for a new chairman or non-executive director will be set in line with the approved policy. details of their current three year appointments are as follows: name date of contract j m b gibson 1 april 2016 s

and complied with across the group. there is also a risk that deferred tax assets in relation to acquired net operating losses are not recognised appropriately, which is dependent on the group being able to access and utilise these losses over a number of years. we are satisﬁed that the recognition of a deferred tax asset in relation to acquired net operating losses is appropriate. matthew

contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate arrangements that can be provided to customers either on a stand-alone basis or as an optional extra, revenue is recognised for each element as if it were an individual contract. revenue in respect of boiler installations and uninsured jobs is recognised when our performance obligations are complete. marketing expenses also include payments made to aªnity partners in recognition of their support for the group’s selling and policy renewal activities. the terms of their support and related payments are included in contractual agreements with each aªnity partner. exchange movements, if any, are classiﬁed as equity and transferred to the group’s translation reserve. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary dierences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which deductible temporary dierences can be utilised.
