Demand for digital engagement at every stage of the customer journey continues, while more customers seek “smart home” products to enhance their experience. Entering new geographies Utilities around the world recognise that providing home assistance services is proven to increase customer loyalty and drive higher retention rates in their core energy businesses. 13 Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Richard Harpin Chief Executive Future developments Key Performance Indicator Affinity partner households 102m (FY16: 92m) Group retention rate 82% (FY16: 83%) Investment in New Markets £6.0m (FY16: £5.9m) As the Group enters FY18 we are well-placed for growth, with a strong pipeline of further partner prospects across North America, France and Spain. New customers typically enrol on an introductory offer and so we expect our policy retention rate in year 1 to be lower than subsequent years. Operational performance Through affinity partner relationships, HomeServe offers home assistance products, under a utility brand, to around 90% of the addressable UK market. With continued high levels of repair revenue, we expect margins to remain at this level going forward. This was a transformational year for HomeServe in North America, with good underlying organic growth enhanced by the acquisition of Utility Service Partners Inc. (USP). We have achieved the milestone of 3.0m customers, added 100 new partners and reached 50m affinity partner households, making good progress towards our 80m household target. We delivered a 50% increase in adjusted operating profit to $26.2m, driven by the continued success of our underlying business. Strategic report 22 website, enabling more effective digital marketing, with a 55% increase in the number of new customers joining online. Direct mail continues to be the most significant marketing channel, with continued progress in sales through our partner channels. Income per customer excludes USP customers who have yet to go through a full renewal cycle with HomeServe. Strategic report 26 Financial performance Total revenue increased 2% to €107.4m (FY16: €105.0m), principally reflecting an increase in renewal income generated by Suez. We have retained the 39,000 customers previously acquired and will look to renew them under our brand going forward. Checkatrade is the UK’s most recognised and trusted online directory of high- quality, customer-recommended tradespeople with nearly 1m unique customer visits a month, resulting in approximately 1.3m jobs per annum. We have commenced marketing a range of home assistance products, principally through Edison Energia’s sales channels, including television advertising. On 1 December 2016 HomeServe Membership Limited, a Group company, purchased npower’s ‘domestic care and maintenance’ contracts business. As a result of these investments, together with ongoing partner payments, we expect capital expenditure to be around £70m in FY18. As previously stated, we are prepared to see leverage increase for reasonable periods of time if circumstances warrant this. During the year, our marketing channels performed as we expected with direct mail response rates continuing to perform well. It is possible such legislative changes could reduce, or even remove, the need for some of our products and services. Strategic report 48 Principal risks and uncertainties (continued) Risk Description / Impact Mitigation Change since 2016 Annual Report Our IT systems become a constraint to growth and drive inefficiency instead of efficiency improvements The Group’s core IT system is used in each of our businesses. We have a detailed information security policy, which is communicated across the Group and training provided as required. Retention rates are high across all established businesses, resulting in stable and recurring cashflows from a large, diverse customer base. We will take all practicable steps to ensure that if an employee becomes disabled during the time they are employed, their employment can continue. We continue to support the Midland Langar Seva Society, which feeds homeless people in Birmingham 365 days a year. In FY17, we contributed $45,000 to key charities; Red Rover Foundation, American Cancer Society, Humane Society, Best Buddies (Disabled Children) and CT Advocates of Southwest Connecticut • HomeServe Cares and Goodwill Jobs where we assist customers with repairs that they could otherwise not a’ord. Over 230 employees have raised money for cancer charities including races across Spain and a charity football tournament organised by the NGO “Cooperación Internacional”. 59 Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Leadership Johnathan Ford, Group Chief Operating O‡cer, is the Director responsible for environmental, health and safety matters. The reports that follow are intended to give shareholders an understanding of our corporate governance arrangements and how they operated in FY17. Richard Harpin (52) Founder and Chief Executive O‡cer of HomeServe, which was set up in 1993 as a joint venture with South Sta’ordshire Group. Newly appointed Board members are required to undergo an induction programme, which includes obtaining a thorough understanding of the Group’s various operations. By Order of the Board JM Barry Gibson Chairman 23 May 2017 Governance Audit & Risk Committee report 74 Members Mark Morris (Chairman) Chris Havemann Ben Mingay The Audit & Risk Committee is chaired by Mark Morris who has recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience. A report on completed internal audits is presented to the Committee and, where appropriate, action plans are reviewed. Share awards are granted under the HomeServe 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), shareholder approval for which will expire in July 2018. Remuneration for Executive Directors is structured so that the variable pay element forms a signiﬁcant portion of each Director’s package. Furthermore there is a clawback provision in respect of annual bonuses and long-term incentive awards which helps to guard further against excessive risk-taking. However, any salary increases will normally be no higher than the typical level of increase awarded to other UK employees. Bonuses are based on Group performance and, if relevant, the speciﬁc territory for which an Executive Director is responsible. Three years Awards of performance and matching shares are granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan (which was approved by shareholders in 2008). These are balanced by the use of ﬁnancial targets and personal objectives used to reﬂect other strategic priorities. David Bower will not receive a matching award in FY18 having only recently been appointed to the Board. LTIP awards may be made shortly following an appointment (assuming the Company is not in a closed period). Details of their current three year appointments are as follows: Name Date of contract J M B Gibson 1 April 2016 S David 23 November 2016 C Havemann 1 December 2015 B Mingay 1 January 2015 M Morris 27 February 2015 Outside Appointments Executive Directors may hold one outside appointment and can retain any fees received.

Key observations We were satisﬁed that appropriate revenue deferral policies have been adopted and complied with across the Group. We are satisﬁed that the recognition of a deferred tax asset in relation to acquired net operating losses is appropriate. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period (see below) adjustments. Revenue in respect of boiler installations and uninsured jobs is recognised when our performance obligations are complete. Marketing expenses also include payments made to Aªnity Partners in recognition of their support for the Group’s selling and policy renewal activities. The terms of their support and related payments are included in contractual agreements with each Aªnity Partner. These are valued using the excess earnings method taking into account a number of key assumptions such as retention and net income.
