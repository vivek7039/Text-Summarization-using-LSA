industrial technology companies, creating power and propulsion systems for use on land, at sea and in the air. our new vision and refreshed strategy lays a firm foundation for creating long-term shareholder value. i would draw attention to the fact that we have sustained investment in capital expenditure and r&d notwithstanding short-term financial pressures. rolls-royce has an extraordinary brand and we are exceptionally well-placed to defy the traditional engineering industry norms. investor trust and confidence i am acutely aware that in recent years our credibility with investors has been damaged. there are significant risks – most notably product reliability failure, a disorderly brexit or an external global shock that would disrupt travel. i do not believe that, in the long term, these are incompatible with our growth aspirations. it is in everyone’s interest to better align the recognition of profit and cash. profitability, and return on capital in particular, are crucial strategic measures but for the short term, cash flow is our dominant financial metric. our short-term focus over the next two to three years is on meeting customer commitments and requirements whilst generating substantial increases in cash flow. civil aerospace had some notable successes in 2017 with record levels of large engine deliveries, further expanding the installed fleet and generating service revenue growth. looking forward, sustaining this improvement and delivering increasing cash flow generation will strengthen our position as one of the world’s leading industrial technology companies. defence aerospace had another solid year as we renewed a number of core us contracts and further developed our service delivery capability. in early 2018, we announced chris cholerton would be taking up the post of president – civil aerospace, tom bell would be returning to rolls-royce as president – defence and harry holt took up the post of group hr director. operational excellence – a new operating strategy was developed and we invested a further £764m in capital expenditure in 2017. capitalising on the rapidly advancing digital techniques, our aim is to create an agile, highly productive and cost-competitive manufacturing footprint. power systems’ first availability contract commenced in 2017 with hitachi rail to run in civil aerospace, while we worked to minimise the impact of in-service issues, key milestones were achieved towards entry into service for the new trent 1000 ten, trent xwb-97 and trent 7000. testing of our new power gearbox design, a vital component in our new ultrafan demonstrator programme, has proceeded well and the advance3 demonstrator achieved its first successful ground test. our goal is to make 2018 a breakthrough year in terms of strategic, operational and financial goals. i am confident that with the right management team now in place, a simplified business structure and steps being taken to improve our processes, we will make further meaningful progress in meeting our strategic, operational and financial goals in 2018. our largest business, civil aerospace, will continue to focus on increasing engine deliveries and working with customers to minimise the impact of in-service engine issues. we will also look to report progress on the strategic review of our commercial marine operation. this, in turn, will drive significant free cash flow as we increase penetration of our service products. having taken full ownership of the company, itp aero is now a separate business unit within rolls-royce. itp aero will retain organisational autonomy allowing it to continue serving other original equipment manufacturers (oem) as customers, while meeting our governance and compliance standards. we are building on our strong heritage in thermo-mechanical engineering to produce state-of-the-art electro-mechanical and hybrid power systems. we are renowned as a pioneer in the use of digital solutions for our customer care. we are continuously enhancing the digital twin of our physical activities and seeking new data innovations. vitalise existing capabilities we will develop next generation technologies to sustain and grow our current competitiveness. for example, the ultrafan represents a fundamental upgrade of our gas turbines, incorporating 11 breakthrough technologies. digitalisation allows us to create entirely new ways of engineering, manufacturing and serving our customers across the group. total shareholder return 25.4% employees we create an environment where each employee is able to be at their best. invested in training and development £31.2m partners we create partnerships based on collaboration where each partner benefits from the relationship. we

have now reached the top end of our targeted £200m run-rate reduction in fixed costs. there has been good progress here in 2017, with further significant steps to be made going forward. looking at and presenting our civil aerospace business on a cash flow driver basis should also help increase understanding. four key initiatives have been launched as part of a change programme within the rolls-royce finance function to deliver on our financial priorities. civil aerospace margins reflected the impact of higher volumes of unlinked oe engines, which carry an oe deficit, allied to lower long-term service agreement (ltsa) margins and other related costs driven by additional maintenance costs on trent 1000 and trent 900 engines. power systems saw a strong gross margin improvement of 240bps, principally reflecting improved product mix and pricing discipline. — power systems made excellent progress in 2017, with profit of £330m up 61%, reflecting 3% revenue growth, a 240bps expansion in gross margin, due to better mix and pricing discipline, and benefits of overhead cost reduction actions which saw c&a costs fall 7%. restoring our shareholder payments to an appropriate level over time as free cash flow grows will be a key capital allocation priority. each programme has brought together more than 20,000 parts to create engines that have undergone rigorous testing at facilities around the world. underlying revenue mix large engine 70% v2500 12% regional 4% business aviation 14% services 52% oe 48% 22 rolls-royce holdings plc annual report 2017 strategic report business review overview 2017 2017 marked some notable successes for civil aerospace, with record levels of widebody engine deliveries, expanding the installed fleet and generating positive service revenue growth. the trent xwb-84 saw much improved oe economics and has achieved over 1.2 million flying hours in service with unprecedented levels of reliability. for business aviation, while oe sales were 26% lower, reflecting a 32% reduction in engine sales as airframe production transitioned to competitor-powered programmes, there was a 10% increase in service revenue from continued fleet growth and consistently high corporatecare coverage. engineering and r&d significant milestones have been achieved in each of the three new large engine programmes on their progression towards entry into service. good progress has been made on new engine architecture demonstrator programmes in 2017. the advance3 demonstrator successfully completed initial ground test runs and the ultrafan power gearbox successfully completed a high power test run to a record 70,000hp. these actions enabled the business to deliver a record 483 widebody engines in 2017 (2016: 357), up 35%, despite challenges caused by in-service issues. together these two facilities will enable us to deliver seven trent xwb engines a week by mid-2018. civil aerospace outlook outlook for the new business structure under ifrs 15 is discussed in the 2018 outlook on page 58. rolls-royce holdings plc annual report 2017 25 strategic report business review strategic report operating environment rolls-royce key differentiators our continued development of advanced world-leading technology, culture of partnership with customers and innovation in services are attributes that civil aerospace customers really value and are difficult to imitate. it does not imply a slow-down in the growth of air travel, which remains robust. a broad consensus forecasts that air traffic (revenue passenger kilometres) will grow by approximately 5% compound annual growth rate over the next 20 years. in parallel, a number of engine demonstrators with embedded electrical generators have been successfully run; and work on innovative hybrid aircraft demonstrator projects is ongoing. — if the technical performance of a product falls significantly below customer expectation (e.g. trent 1000 and trent 900 time on-wing is less than planned) or fails to deliver the planned business benefits, then this would cause significant financial and reputational damage. — if the business experiences significant pricing pressure from increased competitor challenge in key markets, then financial performance may be impacted. rolls-royce holdings plc annual report 2017 strategic report business review 26 service delivery centres

reductions also on track. technology inserts for the c-130 hercules legacy fleet met operational performance expectations and demonstrated excellent reliability and fuel efficiency in extended hurricane operations during major us storms in 2017. this helped generate good international interest with a potential first export order currently being evaluated. the plant’s first turbine production cell came on stream in march and a second is nearing completion. the modernisation will help drive meaningful productivity benefits and reduce operational overheads by 2020. we also announced further rationalisation of our operational footprint with the closure of our repair and overhaul facility in oakland, california by 2020. a joint venture agreement with turkish industrial firm kale group positions us well to develop an indigenous combat engine for turkey targeting the tf-x fighter jet. strategic aftermarket initiatives looked to deepen customer relationships and distribution capability, including an enhanced spares supply contract with aviall, a boeing company, covering all defence variants of the ae engine fleet. — if the business suffers a major disruption in it supply chain, then delivery schedules would be delayed, damaging financial performance and reputation. — if new applications are not secured, then the business may have to increase investment or accept erosion in capabilities. 30 rolls-royce holdings plc annual report 2017 strategic report business review hitachi rail europe honours power systems as best supplier in recognition of its outstanding support over the past three years, hitachi rail europe awarded mtu its 2017 best supplier accolade for delivery performance. under new leadership the business was able to achieve a material reduction in product variants and greater r&d discipline while targeting low-emission technologies. operational and strategic review power systems’ customers span a range of end markets providing significant diversity. engine production increased principally due to demand for the core series 4000 products, large engines and rail power packs. gas systems sales in marine and power generation now make up over 14% of revenue from the s4000 range. a project agreement was signed with agricultural machinery manufacturer claas for the annual supply of around 5,000 series 1000-1500 engines. this complements the investment in electrification to expand our hybrid capabilities and further development of micro-grid solutions. power systems outlook outlook for the new business structure under ifrs 15 is discussed in the 2018 outlook on page 58. rolls-royce holdings plc annual report 2017 33 strategic report business review strategic report operating environment rolls-royce key differentiators technology leadership and a reputation for market-leading performance and system approach, new product innovation, full lifecycle service solutions and high levels of customisation in collaboration with customers will maintain a strong market position for power systems. — increased utilisation in resource industries, especially oil & gas and mining, is driving aftermarket service demand after several years of challenging market conditions. — there is continued growth forecast in emerging markets, e.g. china and india, where domestic partnerships including local value creation will continue to be important. — tightening emission regulations in several regions will require clean diesel solutions where the business is well positioned (e.g. s4000 engine). — if electrical-storage technologies develop faster than anticipated, then these may substitute rolls-royce products and/or affect margins. from spring 2018, it will manufacture up to 1,500 engines a year for the oil & gas and power generation industries. operational and strategic review lower activity within commercial marine reflected the weak market environment as deep water exploration activities remained at depressed levels. there was also activity across the merchant sector including norwegian ferry operator contracts for new gas engines and thrusters along with further auto-crossing system product sales. rolls-royce successfully demonstrated this new technology by partnering with global towage operator, svitzer, including the first trial of a remotely operated commercial vessel that took place in copenhagen harbour. marine outlook outlook for the new business structure under ifrs 15 is discussed in the 2018 outlook on page 58. rolls-royce holdings plc annual report 2017 37 strategic report business review strategic report operating environment rolls-royce key differentiators marine is a leading provider of mission-critical solutions for the commercial and naval maritime markets, a position built on unique domain knowledge, continuous leadership in maritime innovation and digital solutions that allow close partnership with our customers globally across a broad range of ship types. growth within these markets is fundamentally driven by gdp, trade, oil price and defence spending. — continued trend towards hybrid/full-electric propulsion and integrated electric systems with increased adoption of energy storage solutions. — if continuing market downturn leaves key customers, suppliers and competitors exposed to strain, then there could be further consolidation impacting the competitive landscape. — if market shifts in technology (e.g. electrification and digitalisation) proceed at a faster rate than expected, then the business may not be positioned to take full advantage of this potential growth. the civil nuclear business achieved key milestones on large retrofit contracts for safety-critical control systems in finland and france. service contracts were signed with nuclear utility customers across europe, canada and china while additional investment was made into the small modular reactor (smr) programme where the uk government announced a viability study covering a number of technologies. financial overview underlying revenue underlying revenue rose by 4% driven mainly by increased production activity in support of the dreadnought class build programme, together with greater activity in civil nuclear new build contracts and field services. these have helped to drive significant improvements in delivery of reactor plant components into the astute programme. — if political tensions prevent trade or co-operation with state-owned potential partner organisations, then access to anticipated nuclear opportunities in the uk and overseas may not be available. together the partners in this consortium believe that smrs represent a unique opportunity for the uk to become a global leader in innovative nuclear technologies, creating up to 40,000 highly skilled jobs, opening up valuable export markets and producing energy for as low as £60/mwh – competitive against wind and solar. technology leadership is integral to maximising our competitive advantage and driving the group’s long-term success. the engineering team is responsible for design rigour, product safety and ensuring our skills match business needs. technologies for today and tomorrow the increasingly demanding requirements of civil aviation are driving game-changing innovation in our aerospace gas turbines. we have brought agency engineering contractors who support non-core tasks in new product introduction programmes into our direct headcount following a reinterpretation of export control regulations. advance3 is central to the ultrafan demonstrator programme, which will add power gearbox, composite fan and high-speed turbine technology elements. electrification is already core to our marine business where permanent magnet electric thrusters, hybrid ships and battery powered ferries are indicative of this change. technology is driving core products to ever higher levels of performance while electrification and digitalisation are opening market-shifting new opportunities. during the year we strengthened our approach to governance and risk management in this area by introducing an executive-level environment & sustainability committee. increasingly we are able to repair individual engine components, reducing the manufacture of new parts and minimising customer disruption. we are building on our strong engineering heritage to produce state-of-the-art electro-mechanical and hybrid power systems, combined with digital solutions. this means building on our existing thermo-mechanical products to deliver step changes in emissions performance. 3 waste data for 2016 and 2017 has been calculated in accordance with our basis of reporting, as set out at www.rolls-royce.com/sustainability. project sunshine

tax treatment of travel expenses incurred by lewis booth, while travelling to and from the uk, changed in may 2016 (five years after his date of appointment and in accordance with hmrc rules). we were satisfied that appropriate governance procedures and controls are in place to manage this revised methodology. as a result, we were satisfied that the going concern and viability statements have been prepared on an appropriate basis. all risks are managed through a risk management system (rms – described on page 59) in accordance with policies and guidance approved by the board. therefore new policies and formalised compensating internal controls specifically in respect of financial reporting were introduced. non-audit services provided by kpmg in order to safeguard the auditor’s independence and objectivity, and in accordance with the frc’s ethical standard, we do not engage kpmg for any non-audit services except where it is work that they must, or are clearly best-suited to, perform. we monitor improvements that are proposed to the group’s product safety management system (sms). together these ensure that there is regular, diverse activity to monitor the state of our safety processes. we also noted the lessons being learned and captured for future projects on how to structure safety cases. we were encouraged that quarterly asset reports for certain sites outside the americas had been introduced to provide an overview to local stakeholders of maintenance provided, costs, safety critical maintenance requirements, equipment reliability analysis, training needs and improvements delivered. we also welcomed the introduction of a new leading indicator to track planned maintenance schedule adherence for high-consequence safety critical equipment. we were briefed by the product safety leadership team on defence aerospace markets, products and operating environments. we examined specific cases, how these were being handled, findings, corrective measures taken and the relationship management maintained with third parties involved. this covered how engine documentation on legacy platforms is registered to maintain product knowledge and enable continuing support under the business’ historic engines policy. committee members member attended eligible to attend sir kevin smith (chairman) 6 6 lewis booth 1 1 ruth cairnie 6 6 brad singer 6 6 jasmin

supply chain strategies to accelerate its development. a similar session was held with the power systems team to discuss competitiveness of our reciprocating engine technology. we heard about potential future applications of hybrid electrical configurations for aircraft in the aerospace businesses and how electrical systems technology was rapidly increasing in the markets addressed by our marine and power systems businesses. i have been pleased with our progress this year as the group has carried out a detailed review of its technology strategy. by order of the board pamela coles

restructuring of the uk pension schemes (see note 19). 4 in rolls-royce holdings plc’s own financial statements, c shares are issued from the merger reserve. the accounting policy for these arrangements has been chosen, consistent with adopted ifrs, to reflect their commercial effect. however, the directors do not consider that it is possible to determine a reliable fair value for this intangible asset. (in contrast, provision is made when additional costs on non long-term contract arrangements are identified.) risk and revenue sharing arrangements rrsas with key suppliers (workshare partners) are a feature of our civil aerospace business. this is a gated process which assesses both the technical feasibility and commercial viability of programmes. this has resulted in an additional £83m of development costs being capitalised than otherwise would have been. as set out in note 25, itp aero was acquired on 19 december 2017. it has been assumed that itp aero did not have any significant trading activity between the acquisition date and 31 december 2017. a subsidiary is an entity controlled by the company. the group has arrangements with partners who do not undertake development work or supply parts. deferred tax is not recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill or for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit. – derivatives, comprising foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity contracts are classified as fair value through profit or loss. rolls-royce holdings plc annual report 2017 127 financial statements notes to the consolidated financial statements financial statements 1 accounting policies continued hedge accounting the group does not generally apply hedge accounting in respect of forward foreign exchange contracts or commodity swaps held to manage the cash flow exposures of forecast transactions denominated in foreign currencies or in commodities respectively. development expenditure (which predominantly relates to civil aerospace engine programmes) is capitalised as an internally generated intangible asset (programme asset) only if it meets strict criteria, relating in particular to technical feasibility and generation of future economic benefits. rolls-royce holdings plc annual report 2017 129 financial statements notes to the consolidated financial statements financial statements 1 accounting policies continued post-retirement benefits pensions and similar benefits (principally healthcare) are accounted for under ias 19. for defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted present value, using a discount rate derived from high-quality corporate bonds denominated in the currency of the plan, whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value. the group considers asset-value guarantees to be non-financial liabilities and accordingly these are also treated as insurance contracts. the group has paid participation fees to airframe manufacturers, its customers for oe on certain programmes. a contract liability will be created where payment is received ahead of the costs incurred to meet performance obligations. 2 unrealised fair value changes to derivative contracts included in profit before financing: (i) include those of equity accounted joint ventures; and (ii) exclude those for which the related trading contracts have been cancelled when the fair value changes are recognised immediately in underlying profit. 3 the adjustment eliminates charges recognised as a result of recognising assets in acquired businesses at fair value. rolls-royce holdings plc annual report 2017 135
