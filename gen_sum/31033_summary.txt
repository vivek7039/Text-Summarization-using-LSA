and work on innovative hybrid aircraft demonstrator projects is ongoing. strategic aftermarket initiatives looked to deepen customer relationships and distribution capability, including an enhanced spares supply contract with aviall, a boeing company, covering all defence variants of the ae engine fleet. — if the business suffers a major disruption in it supply chain, then delivery schedules would be delayed, damaging financial performance and reputation. under new leadership the business was able to achieve a material reduction in product variants and greater r&d discipline while targeting low-emission technologies. — increased utilisation in resource industries, especially oil & gas and mining, is driving aftermarket service demand after several years of challenging market conditions. — there is continued growth forecast in emerging markets, e.g. china and india, where domestic partnerships including local value creation will continue to be important. operational and strategic review lower activity within commercial marine reflected the weak market environment as deep water exploration activities remained at depressed levels. there was also activity across the merchant sector including norwegian ferry operator contracts for new gas engines and thrusters along with further auto-crossing system product sales. rolls-royce successfully demonstrated this new technology by partnering with global towage operator, svitzer, including the first trial of a remotely operated commercial vessel that took place in copenhagen harbour. — if continuing market downturn leaves key customers, suppliers and competitors exposed to strain, then there could be further consolidation impacting the competitive landscape. — if market shifts in technology (e.g. electrification and digitalisation) proceed at a faster rate than expected, then the business may not be positioned to take full advantage of this potential growth. — if political tensions prevent trade or co-operation with state-owned potential partner organisations, then access to anticipated nuclear opportunities in the uk and overseas may not be available. we have brought agency engineering contractors who support non-core tasks in new product introduction programmes into our direct headcount following a reinterpretation of export control regulations. electrification is already core to our marine business where permanent magnet electric thrusters, hybrid ships and battery powered ferries are indicative of this change. during the year we strengthened our approach to governance and risk management in this area by introducing an executive-level environment & sustainability committee. we believe there is greater impact in lasting engagement than one-off cash contributions, but do make charitable donations aligned to our strategy. group – reported results reconciliation between underlying and reported results year to 31 december £m revenue profit before financing financing profit/(loss) before tax 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 underlying 15,090 13,783 1,175 915 (104) (102) 1,071 813 revenue recognised at exchange rate on date of transaction 1 1,217 1,172 – – – – – – mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives 8 – – 24 – 2,648 (4,420) 2,672 (4,420) related foreign exchange adjustments 1 – – 345 570 257 (151) 602 419 movements on other financial instruments – – – – 11 (8) 11 (8) effects of acquisition accounting 2 – – (129) (115) – – (129) (115) impairments 3 – – (24) (219) – – (24) (219) exceptional restructuring 4 – – (104) (129) – – (104) (129) acquisitions and disposals 5 – – 798 (3) – – 798 (3) financial penalties 6 – – – (671) – – – (671) post-retirement schemes 7 – – – (306) 1 3 1 (303) other – – – (1) (1) 1 (1) – reported 16,307 14,955 2,085 41 2,812 (4,677) 4,897 (4,636) rolls-royce holdings plc annual report 2017 51 strategic report additional financial review strategic report net funds outflow in itp aero was £14m;
