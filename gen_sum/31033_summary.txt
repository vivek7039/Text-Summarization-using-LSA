employees (year average) 50,000 read more in our business review on pages 20 to 41 we are one of the world’s leading industrial technology companies, creating power and propulsion systems for use on land, at sea and in the air. i would draw attention to the fact that we have sustained investment in capital expenditure and r&d notwithstanding short-term financial pressures. there are significant risks – most notably product reliability failure, a disorderly brexit or an external global shock that would disrupt travel. profitability, and return on capital in particular, are crucial strategic measures but for the short term, cash flow is our dominant financial metric. our short-term focus over the next two to three years is on meeting customer commitments and requirements whilst generating substantial increases in cash flow. civil aerospace had some notable successes in 2017 with record levels of large engine deliveries, further expanding the installed fleet and generating service revenue growth. looking forward, sustaining this improvement and delivering increasing cash flow generation will strengthen our position as one of the world’s leading industrial technology companies. defence aerospace had another solid year as we renewed a number of core us contracts and further developed our service delivery capability. itp aero will retain organisational autonomy allowing it to continue serving other original equipment manufacturers (oem) as customers, while meeting our governance and compliance standards. 6 organic 8 growth of 22% driven by revenue improvement, our focus on reducing fixed costs, higher capitalised r&d and product mix. four key initiatives have been launched as part of a change programme within the rolls-royce finance function to deliver on our financial priorities. restoring our shareholder payments to an appropriate level over time as free cash flow grows will be a key capital allocation priority. each programme has brought together more than 20,000 parts to create engines that have undergone rigorous testing at facilities around the world. the trent xwb-84 saw much improved oe economics and has achieved over 1.2 million flying hours in service with unprecedented levels of reliability. engineering and r&d significant milestones have been achieved in each of the three new large engine programmes on their progression towards entry into service. a broad consensus forecasts that air traffic (revenue passenger kilometres) will grow by approximately 5% compound annual growth rate over the next 20 years. in parallel, a number of engine demonstrators with embedded electrical generators have been successfully run; and work on innovative hybrid aircraft demonstrator projects is ongoing. — if the business experiences significant pricing pressure from increased competitor challenge in key markets, then financial performance may be impacted. strategic aftermarket initiatives looked to deepen customer relationships and distribution capability, including an enhanced spares supply contract with aviall, a boeing company, covering all defence variants of the ae engine fleet. — if the business suffers a major disruption in it supply chain, then delivery schedules would be delayed, damaging financial performance and reputation. under new leadership the business was able to achieve a material reduction in product variants and greater r&d discipline while targeting low-emission technologies. — increased utilisation in resource industries, especially oil & gas and mining, is driving aftermarket service demand after several years of challenging market conditions. — there is continued growth forecast in emerging markets, e.g. china and india, where domestic partnerships including local value creation will continue to be important. operational and strategic review lower activity within commercial marine reflected the weak market environment as deep water exploration activities remained at depressed levels. there was also activity across the merchant sector including norwegian ferry operator contracts for new gas engines and thrusters along with further auto-crossing system product sales. rolls-royce successfully demonstrated this new technology by partnering with global towage operator, svitzer, including the first trial of a remotely operated commercial vessel that took place in copenhagen harbour. marine outlook outlook for the new business structure under ifrs 15 is discussed in the 2018 outlook on page 58. rolls-royce holdings plc annual report 2017 37 strategic report business review strategic report operating environment rolls-royce key differentiators marine is a leading provider of mission-critical solutions for the commercial and naval maritime markets, a position built on unique domain knowledge, continuous leadership in maritime innovation and digital solutions that allow close partnership with our customers globally across a broad range of ship types. — if continuing market downturn leaves key customers, suppliers and competitors exposed to strain, then there could be further consolidation impacting the competitive landscape. — if market shifts in technology (e.g. electrification and digitalisation) proceed at a faster rate than expected, then the business may not be positioned to take full advantage of this potential growth. — if political tensions prevent trade or co-operation with state-owned potential partner organisations, then access to anticipated nuclear opportunities in the uk and overseas may not be available. together the partners in this consortium believe that smrs represent a unique opportunity for the uk to become a global leader in innovative nuclear technologies, creating up to 40,000 highly skilled jobs, opening up valuable export markets and producing energy for as low as £60/mwh – competitive against wind and solar. technologies for today and tomorrow the increasingly demanding requirements of civil aviation are driving game-changing innovation in our aerospace gas turbines. we have brought agency engineering contractors who support non-core tasks in new product introduction programmes into our direct headcount following a reinterpretation of export control regulations. electrification is already core to our marine business where permanent magnet electric thrusters, hybrid ships and battery powered ferries are indicative of this change. technology is driving core products to ever higher levels of performance while electrification and digitalisation are opening market-shifting new opportunities. during the year we strengthened our approach to governance and risk management in this area by introducing an executive-level environment & sustainability committee. we are building on our strong engineering heritage to produce state-of-the-art electro-mechanical and hybrid power systems, combined with digital solutions. project sunshine over 16,700 photovoltaic panels have been installed on the roof and car port of our seletar campus in singapore. headcount by business unit 1 2017 2016 civil aerospace 24,600 23,800 defence aerospace 6,100 6,000 power systems 10,100 10,300 marine 4,600

investor perspective drawing on his experience as chief operating officer of valueact, the group’s largest shareholder. we also undertook an open and meaningful shareholder consultation exercise on our remuneration policy, approved with a majority of over 95% at the agm in may 2017. you can read about our stakeholder engagement activities on page 73. looking forward the board remains strongly committed to continuous improvement in governance. at the end of 2017, a communication video from irene was made available to all employees updating them on her role and insights so far. the event was a huge success and based on some helpful feedback, we have already identified changes that will make future meetings even better. members of the board also attend relevant seminars, conferences and training events to keep up-to-date on developments in key areas. more information on these awards is on page 90. shareholding requirement executive directors are required to work towards holding

recognition of goodwill or for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit. the temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised, aggregate to £188m (2016: £276m). these have been estimated using cash flows from the most recent forecasts prepared by management, which are consistent with past experience and external sources of
