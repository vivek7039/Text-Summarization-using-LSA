infrastructure projects in our energy and aviation divisions by providing an efficient low-cost value engineering construction solution. i am confident that his business experience and entrepreneurial approach will be a key part in the next chapter of stobart group’s value creation. these all create additional value for the group and will be an important part of further developing london’s best
