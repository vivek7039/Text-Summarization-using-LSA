84 stobart group limited annual report and accounts 2017 notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 28 february 2017 1 accounting policies of stobart group limited basis of preparation and statement of compliance the principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. ifrs 16, with certain exceptions, requires the group, where the group is a lessee, to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities for all leases, there no longer being a distinction between operating and finance leases for lessees. identifiable intangible assets, meeting either the contractual- legal or separability criterion, are recognised separately from goodwill. contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised if the acquisition- date fair value can be measured reliably. each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated shall represent the lowest level within the entity at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and shall not be larger than an operating segment before aggregation. goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated income statement. other non- financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. forward contracts are entered into by the group to purchase and/or sell biomass-related products and management judges that these forward commodity contracts are entered into for the group’s ‘own use’ rather than as trading instruments. they continue to be held in accordance with the group’s expected purchase, sale and/or usage requirements. net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in profit or loss. investment properties acquired as part of a business combination are recognised initially at fair value and exclude transaction costs. non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount immediately prior to being classified as held for sale in accordance with the group’s accounting policy and fair value less costs to sell. further information, including carrying values and impairment charges during the year, is set out in note 13 on page 98. ( e ) v a lu a t i on of pro per t y in v en to r ies the group is required to review, on an annual basis, whether the property inventories carrying values can be recovered. year ended 28 february
