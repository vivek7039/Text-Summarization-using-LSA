high street, huntingdon, cambridgeshire pe29 3tq on 23 may 2018 at noon and my colleagues and i very much look forward to seeing those of you who are able to attend. these businesses operate under the

retailer partners, facilities are operated under joint venture companies who receive volume related management fees. 11 hilton food group plc annual report and financial statements 2017 overview

beginning of the year we signed a joint venture agreement with sonae to manage their existing meat processing and packing facility in santarem, portugal. 13 hilton food group plc annual report and financial statements 2017 overview strategic report governance financial statements resourcing for growth: culture and people successful businesses are principally about having the right people in the right positions at the right time working together as ‘one team’, with local management teams empowered, encouraged and advised in specialist areas enabling them to support their local customers. we recognise that people from different backgrounds, countries and experiences can bring benefits to our business. we consider this devolved structure to be a critical success factor, achieving close working relationships with our customers, who benefit from personal, dedicated, flexible and rapid local support. past and future trends over recent decades as major retail chains have progressively gained a greater share of the grocery markets in most countries, they have increasingly turned to large scale, centralised packing solutions capable of producing private label packed food products more safely and cost effectively. grocery retail markets are expected to remain extremely competitive, with continuing pressure on consumer expenditure. basic earnings per share were 1.5% lower but 11.0% higher before exceptional items (5.9% on a constant currency basis). additional details of volume growth by business segment are set out in the chief executive’s summary. the 2017 increase reflected volume growth, higher raw material prices and favourable exchange translation rate movements. the group sells high quality basic food products, for which there will always be continuing demand, to successful blue chip multiple retailers in developed countries. hilton has not to date been materially adversely affected by the lengthy recessionary environments seen in some countries, but will keep any future identified country specific risks under continuing review. the board’s policy is to have an interest rate cap on a proportion of this borrowing. hilton’s pricing is based predominately either on cost plus agreements or agreed packing rates with its customers. liquidity risk this has for many businesses represented an area of concern over recent years, given the continuing difficult and uncertain economic environment in some countries. forward looking statements this strategic report contains forward looking statements that are inevitably subject to risk factors associated with, amongst other things, economic, political and business developments which may occur from time to time across the countries in which the group operates. it must be recognised that systems of internal control are designed to manage rather than completely eliminate any identified risks. the group takes a proactive approach to risk management with well-developed structures and a range of processes for identifying, assessing, prioritising and mitigating its key risks, as the delivery of our strategy depends on our ability to make sound risk informed decisions. hilton operates a decentralised, entrepreneurial business structure, which enables it to work very closely and flexibly with its retail partners in each country, in order to achieve high service levels in terms of orders delivered, delivery times, compliance with product specifications and accuracy of documentation, all backed by an uncompromising focus on food safety, product integrity and traceability assurance. its potential impact no business is immune to difficult economic climates and the consequent pressure on levels of consumer spending, such as those seen over recent years across europe. control systems embedded in project management enable the risks of growth to be appropriately highlighted and managed. risk mitigation measures and strategies adopted the group maintains a flexible global food supply base, which is progressively widening as it expands and is continuously audited to ensure standards are maintained, so as to have in place a wide range of options should supply disruptions occur. description of risk the group’s it systems could be subject to cyber attacks including fraudulent external email activity. retail packing at hilton the key factors in ensuring that our retail partners receive products that consistently achieve agreed shelf lives and meet customer expectations are top quality ingredients from our suppliers, temperature control and high class standards of hygiene. hilton maintains annual third party accreditation through fssc (food safety system certification) using iso 22000 and iso/ts 22002-1 or the latest brc global standard for food safety and additionally our retail customers make frequent visits to our sites, some of which are unannounced. auditing as a means of challenging standards is now expected by consumers together with well established procedures throughout the food chain. where possible wild catch species are independently certified to the marine stewardship council’s standard for a well- managed and sustainable fishery. the ambience of our culinary innovation centres has been designed to create an open and stimulating environment in which creativity can flourish. we have established partnerships with key suppliers whose core capability is the development of innovative ingredients. by working closely in partnership with our suppliers we can combine our extensive, in-depth understanding of food production on an industrial scale with their expertise to develop a delicious portfolio of innovative products designed to match consumer expectations. finally we are continuously setting the industry standard for lighter product trays which therefore require less plastic. although hilton’s products are perishable having limited shelf life we continuously strive, working with our retail partners to ensure that waste is minimised and products are available for purchase and consumption for as long as possible before the end of their shelf life. the group requires all its subsidiaries to achieve high health and safety standards within their individual operations. we have been successful in recruiting senior women into office based professional roles as part of a recruitment process to ensure the best-fit hire. prior to this, he worked for the foyle food group, based in northern ireland of which he was a founder in 1977. robert was previously a board
