OVERVIEW TISSUE REGENIX GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 05 What is Regenerative Medicine? dCELL ® technology provides an enhanced healing environment, in terms of both natural, tissue-specific physical structure and bio-mechanical properties. With its first full year of sales, controlled joint venture GBM-V increased revenue by 8 fold to £1.1m. With adoption by the acute surgical and wound reconstruction markets, due to its impressive clinical outcomes with a single application, DermaPure ® has seen significant uptake in the orthopaedic trauma and urogynaecology arenas where treatment innovation has been in high demand. Having identified an opportunity in this market, we have signed an exclusive distributor agreement with ARMS Medical, a specialist urogynaecology distributor in the United States to maximise this opportunity, leveraging their strong relationships with KOLs and surgeons. In October they commenced the production of AmnioWorks ® , an advanced wound care product derived from human amniotic membrane. Alongside this, additional sizes of their frozen and freeze dried wound care product Matrix IQ were released to address larger surgical site procedures. We expect that this process will complete ahead of schedule with our first CellRight-processed DermaPure ® becoming available during H1 2018. Fundamental to this was the announcement of a long-term, multi-year distribution agreement with Arthrex, Inc. for CellRight’s osteobiologic products. Sales in both CellRight and BioSurgery have had a strong start to the year, including shipments under two significant distributor agreements.
