(‘one-stop-shop’) suite of services to customers, reducing reliance on partners and expanding margins. overview the acquisition is consistent with ergomed’s strategy to grow its existing, profitable services business both organically and through bolt on acquisitions. psr’s dedication to the rare disease landscape is exemplified by an extensive track record of orphan drug projects in a wide range of therapeutic areas, its continued efforts to achieve true patient centricity and its societal commitments by participation in fundraising activities and public-private partnerships. orphan

endocrinology orphan diseases are severe, debilitating or even life-threatening conditions which affect fewer than 1 in 2000 people (eu definition) or fewer than 200,000 people in the us (us definition). compared to a traditional clinical research organisation (cro) service provider, ergomed’s gross margin can fluctuate because of its co-development activities, where ergomed undertakes clinical studies at reduced fees in return for carried interests in the partnered product. consolidated cash flow statement at present, the group does not have any borrowings or long term debt apart from a few immaterial fixed asset finance leases. ergomed aims to provide high quality services at competitive rates, drawing upon its differentiators in the marketplace, as appropriate. to the extent that there are fluctuations in exchange rates, this may have a material impact on ergomed’s financial position or results of operations. our management team includes former senior regulators in the european medicines agency and, through industry associations, remain active promoters of regulation. the company’s organic growth combined with acquisitions is naturally diluting reliance on relatively few large clients. prior to that, andrew held a variety of r&d positions at novartis, sanofi and mds. peter george’s fees as a non-executive director were increased to £120,000 per annum

‘other current assets’. cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. intangible assets acquired in a business combination intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost). when a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. they are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. when such an expense is not reimbursed, they are classified as costs of sales on the consolidated income statement. deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. obligations under such agreements are included in creditors net of the finance charge allocated to future periods. rentals payable under operating leases are charged against income on a straight line basis over the lease term. under ifrs 2, where such share options relate to employees of group companies other than the company, a charge arises.  if the expected market launch date of peprostat (2021) and readyflow (2023) are each delayed by more than one year, an impairment to goodwill would be required.  if the expected royalty rate was reduced by 3% from 20%, an impairment to goodwill would be required. this charge is based on the fair value of such share options for financial reporting purposes. deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the group has a legally enforceable right to do so. no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining £1,291,000 (2016: £nil) as it is not considered probable that there will be future profits available. in addition, a further 100,818 ordinary shares will be issued to part satisfy the second component of deferred consideration for pharminvent and 345 ordinary shares will
