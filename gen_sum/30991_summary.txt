HAEMOSTATIX COMPANY OVERVIEW Peak sales potential $500 m 1 PeproStat™ Reduced time to  haemostasis by   1.6 minutes versus  standard of care. These results reinforce  PeproStat’s potential as a safe, blood-free, ready-to-use  and cost-effective method of controlling bleeding during  surgery. Current products  in this rapidly expanding market segment require eight  preparation steps prior to use, are blood derived, and  opaque, obscuring the wound site.

MARKET LEADERSHIP PrimeVigilance is a leading provider  of drug safety and medical  information services in Europe. PrimeVigilance now employs over 450 employees  with hubs in Guildford, UK; Belgrade, Serbia; Prague, Czech  Republic; Boston, USA; and Zagreb, Croatia. We believe our co-development pipeline continues to offer  potential upside as programmes progress and move towards  commercialisation. These results reinforce PeproStat’s potential  as a safe, blood-free, ready-to-use and cost-effective method  of controlling bleeding during surgery. We can offer a broader (‘one-stop-shop’) suite  of services to customers, reducing reliance on partners  and expanding margins. Overview The acquisition is consistent with Ergomed’s   strategy to grow its existing, profitable services business  both organically and through bolt on acquisitions. PSR’s dedication to the rare disease landscape is   exemplified by an extensive track record of orphan drug  projects in a wide range of therapeutic areas, its continued  efforts to achieve true patient centricity and its societal  commitments by participation in fundraising activities and  public-private partnerships.

Compared to a traditional clinical research  organisation (CRO) service provider, Ergomed’s gross margin  can fluctuate because of its co-development activities, where  Ergomed undertakes clinical studies at reduced fees in return  for carried interests in the partnered product. Consolidated cash flow statement At present, the Group does not have any borrowings or long  term debt apart from a few immaterial fixed asset finance leases. Ergomed aims to provide high quality services at  competitive rates, drawing upon its differentiators  in the marketplace, as appropriate. To the extent that there are fluctuations  in exchange rates, this may have a material impact  on Ergomed’s financial position or results of  operations. Our management team includes former senior  regulators in the European Medicines Agency  and, through industry associations, remain active  promoters of regulation. The Company’s organic growth combined with  acquisitions is naturally diluting reliance on  relatively few large clients. Prior to  joining Ergomed, Stephen worked  in the US as Chief Financial Officer  of AssureRx Health, Inc. Prior to  Clinigen, he was CEO at Penn Pharma,  having led a £67 million management  company buy-out in 2007. Prior to that, Andrew held  a variety of R&D positions at Novartis,  Sanofi and MDS. Peter George’s fees as a Non-Executive Director were increased to £120,000 per annum when he was elected Chairman with  effect from 1 April 2017. Remuneration The Executive Directors during the year, Miroslav Reljanovic, Neil Clark, Andrew Mackie, Jan Petracek, Stephen Stamp and Dan  Weng were entitled to receive base salary, travel allowance, employer pension contributions, share options and a discretionary  performance-related bonus.

In addition, Neil Clark, Andrew Mackie and Stephen Stamp hold options over shares held by Miroslav Reljanovic. Principal activities Ergomed is a global business focused on providing specialised services to the pharmaceutical industry. Capital structure The Group is primarily financed through equity provided by its shareholders and net cash generated from operations. Scoping Full scope audit procedures have been performed on four components and represent 89%  of Group revenue. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion  thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Given that the clinical trials of Peprostat and ReadyFlow are still ongoing,  significant assumptions, judgements and estimates are required to be made by management in order  to calculate the expected value in use of Haemostatix. Key observations   We are satisfied that there is no impairment required for the goodwill balance allocated to  Haemostatix. INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT continued TO THE MEMBERS OF ERGOMED PLC 33 Ergomed plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Governance Strategic report  Revenue recognition: Open CRO service contracts  Key audit matter  description There is a risk that revenue from Clinical Research contracts (see note 4 for segmental CRO  revenues) has not been appropriately recognised in line with the percentage completed, as  required by IAS 18: Revenue. Key observations   We concluded that the Group has recognised revenue on service contracts at an appropriate  percentage completion rate. Our internal valuations specialists were engaged to assist in reviewing and re- performing the fair value calculation.

Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there  is an indication that the unit may be impaired. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at their  fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost). Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated  amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately, as  follows. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to  individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a  reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. When such an expense is not reimbursed, they are classified as  costs of sales on the Consolidated income statement. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences  and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which  deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Obligations under such agreements are included in creditors net of the finance charge allocated to future periods. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged against income on a straight line basis over the lease term. Under IFRS 2, where such share options relate to employees of group companies other than the Company, a charge arises.  If the expected market launch date of PeproStat (2021) and ReadyFlow (2023) are each delayed by more than one year, an  impairment to goodwill would be required.  If the expected royalty rate was reduced by 3% from 20%, an impairment to goodwill would be required. This charge is based on the fair value of such share options for financial reporting purposes.
