corporate governance financial statements shareholder information 17 ti fluid systems plc annual report and accounts 2017 the group’s core strategy is to enhance its position as a leading global manufacturer of automotive fluid systems to ensure we continue to deliver revenue growth in excess of global light vehicle production together with strong profitability and cash flow generation. 2017 performance adjusted free cash flow was €119 million in 2017, representing an increase of 43.8% over the prior year. linked to remuneration definition defined as adjusted ebitda less depreciation

and level of product quality delivered. ti fluid systems’ global operations are exposed to a number of risks which could, either on their own, or in combination with others, have an adverse impact on the group’s results, strategy, business performance and reputation which, in turn, could impact upon shareholder returns. global light vehicle production volumes description ti fluid systems has 118 manufacturing locations in 28 countries on five continents and a substantial amount of its revenue is closely linked to the economic cycle and the general macro‑ economic environment. impact historically, there has been close correlation between economic growth and the global light vehicle production volumes. – the group has an extensive manufacturing presence in emerging and other low‑ cost markets which currently have relatively low rates of light vehicle penetration per head of population and are believed to have strong growth potential. – the group monitors closely and responds to any changes in customer demand on a local or group‑ wide basis. impact a loss of production capability at a facility, or quality failings in products, could affect reputation and accreditation, lead to an inability to supply customers, reduce volumes and/or increase claims made against the business under warranties. – ti fluid systems has an international network of five technical centres which focus on research and development. controls and mitigation – the group’s international footprint provides some protection against a downturn in particular territories or regions. impact ti fluid

connectors used for the transfer of fuel in internal combustion engine applications 26 ti fluid systems plc annual report and accounts 2017 financial review revenue in 2017 increased €142.3 million, or 4.2% compared to 2016. the increase is driven primarily by new business, volume and mix. in asia pacific, our revenue at constant currency grew 9.3%, or 6.7% above light vehicle production volume growth. ** other reconciling items include restructuring charges, the bain management fees and adjustments for associate income. our primary exposure, net of hedge arrangements is related to the group’s external borrowings that are denominated in us dollars and are largely loaned to subsidiaries in the uk, whose functional currency is euro. outlook for 2018, excluding the impact of currency movements, we expect continued revenue growth in excess of global light vehicle production volume growth with adjusted ebit margin and adjusted free cash flow consistent with prior year levels. adjusted ebit is defined as adjusted ebitda less depreciation (including pp&e impairment) and amortisation (including intangible impairment) arising on tangible and intangible assets before adjusting for any purchase price adjustments to fair values arising on acquisitions. during the coming year it is intended that an internal performance evaluation will be undertaken. prior to this position, tim

of subject matter experts in relation to hedging arrangements. provisions are made for uncertain tax positions which involve judgement and estimates by management as to the likelihood of their realisation. information provided has included specialist tax advice in applicable jurisdictions and updates on specific ongoing audits. pricewaterhousecoopers llp also reported to the committee its findings in this area which have been reviewed and considered. the system of internal controls is designed to manage, rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and we can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. a report on completed internal audits is presented to the committee and, where appropriate, action plans are reviewed. the objective of the review was to ensure that our remuneration structures for directors and other senior employees would be fit for purpose as a listed company whilst also retaining certain key features, such as simplicity and transparency. similar us-based automotive companies have maximum long-term incentive opportunities of up to 595% base salary for the chief executive officer. adherence to these guidelines is a condition of continued participation in the company’s equity incentive arrangements. underlying basic eps is considered a simple and clear measure of absolute growth in line with the company’s strategy. if a contract is to be terminated, the committee will determine such mitigation as it considers fair and reasonable in each case. post 1 july 2021,

misrepresentations, or through collusion. we issued written instructions to all component auditors and had regular communications with them throughout the audit cycle. the period of total

consolidated financial statements are set out below. 1.1. basis of preparation these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards (‘ifrs’) as adopted by the european union, and the uk companies act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under ifrs. all financial information presented in euro has been rounded to the nearest 100,000 except where stated otherwise. 1.1.3.2. new interpretation during september 2017, the ifrs interpretations committee issued an agenda decision on interest and penalties related to income taxes. 76 ti fluid systems plc annual report and accounts 2017 1. summary of significant accounting policies continued 1.1.3.3. new and revised ifrs in issue but not yet effective a number of new standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018, or are not yet effective because they have not yet been endorsed by the eu. 4 amendments to ifrs 9: ‘prepayment features with negative compensation‘ this amendment confirms that when a financial liability measured at amortised cost is modified without de-recognition, a gain or loss should be recognised immediately in profit or loss. 4 amendments to ias 28: ‘long-term interests in associates and joint ventures’ clarifies that ifrs 9 applies to long-term interests forming part of the investment in an associate or joint venture where the equity method is not applied. where appropriate, estimates of interest and penalties are included in these provisions for uncertain tax positions. estimates are reviewed at least annually to ensure that the recoverability of costs is reasonably certain. reference is made to contractual considerations, historical data and other relevant factors such as specific events with an underlying product. as amounts set aside in any year could differ from actual tax liabilities, adjustments may be required in subsequent periods, which may have a material impact on the group’s income statement and/or cash tax payments. assumptions underlying these judgements are reviewed at least annually to ensure that the recoverability of costs is reasonably certain. notes to the group financial statements continued 81 ti fluid systems plc annual report and accounts 2017 overview strategic report corporate governance financial statements shareholder information 1.7. property, plant and equipment (pp&e) pp&e is stated at historical cost, which includes expenses directly attributable to bringing assets into productive use including finance charges, less accumulated depreciation. non-financial assets other than goodwill that have previously been impaired are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. tooling that is being manufactured for an external customer or supplier is reported as an item of inventory until invoiced, and represents the gross amount recoverable from the customer in respect of costs incurred, less progress payments received. accrued expenses are recognised when ownership of goods or services has been transferred but not invoiced. 84 ti fluid systems plc annual report and accounts 2017 1. summary of significant accounting policies continued 1.16. provisions a provision is recognised if, because of a past event, the group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. the provision is based on contractual considerations, historical warranty data and expected outcomes against their associated probabilities. notes to the group financial statements continued 85 ti fluid systems plc annual report and accounts 2017 overview strategic report corporate governance financial statements shareholder information defined benefit plans a defined benefit plan provides an amount of benefit that an employee

contributed 11.6% of total revenue, across both reporting segments in the year (2016: two customers contributed 10.5% and 11.1%). the portfolio of derivatives is spread across six counterparties with no one dominant financial institution. the group enters into derivative contracts, and incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks. forward foreign exchange contracts – designated in cash flow hedge relationships in october 2015, the group entered into a series of forward foreign exchange contracts and us dollar interest rate swaps with a number of financial institutions. those euro/krw contracts that qualified for hedge accounting impact equity; however, that movement would be offset by a substantially equal and opposite movement arising from the group’s exposure to the net investment in krw subsidiaries. notes to the group financial statements continued 91 ti fluid systems plc annual report and accounts 2017 overview strategic report corporate governance financial

key management personnel made by the group. performance-based options have the same vesting period as time-based options, subject to certain performance conditions occurring such that the sponsor, the ‘funds managed by bain capital’ (affiliates of and funds advised by bain capital llc) achieves two times cash proceeds relative to its equity investment, provided that such return is measurable in
