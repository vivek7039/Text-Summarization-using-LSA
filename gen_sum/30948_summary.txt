Fuel lines used for the  transfer of fuel in  internal combustion  engine applications 16 TI Fluid Systems plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Our business model How we  create value Stakeholders  who benefit Shareholders We aim to generate progressive shareholder  returns in the long term. TI Fluid Systems’ global operations are exposed to a number  of risks which could, either on their own, or in combination with  others, have an adverse impact on the Group’s results, strategy,  business performance and reputation which, in turn, could  impact upon shareholder returns. Impact Historically, there has been close correlation between  economic growth and the global light vehicle production  volumes. – The Group monitors closely and responds to any changes  in customer demand on a local or group‑ wide basis. – TI Fluid Systems has an international network of five technical  centres which focus on research and development. Controls and mitigation – The Group’s international footprint provides some protection  against a downturn in particular territories or regions. Impact TI Fluid Systems competes globally to attract and retain  personnel in a number of key roles. We use this information to compare  injury rate, safety culture and levels of engagement for each  location. While North American light vehicle production volumes incurred  a small retraction, this was more than offset by strong European  and Asia Pacific increases. Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information 27 TI Fluid Systems plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Net Foreign Exchange Gains and Losses Net foreign exchange gains were €24.6 million in 2017 compared to  losses of €2.0 million in 2016. Adjusted EBIT is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less depreciation  (including PP&E impairment) and amortisation (including intangible  impairment) arising on tangible and intangible assets before  adjusting for any purchase price adjustments to fair values arising  on acquisitions. Prior to this position, Tim held a number of senior  finance positions at Delphi Corporation in both the United States  and Europe. Prior to joining Lear,  Jeff was Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for  International Automotive Components Group. The Board meets formally five times a year, with additional  ad-hoc meetings called as and when circumstances require. The Non-Executive Directors  comprise Neil Carson, Senior Independent Director, Paul  Edgerley, John Smith, Stephen Thomas and Jeffrey Vanneste. The Audit & Risk Committee is chaired  by Jeffrey Vanneste, who has recent and relevant financial  experience. The impairment reviews were also an area of focus for  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and we considered their report. We also noted PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s work and use  of subject matter experts in relation to hedging arrangements. Provisions are made for uncertain tax positions which involve  judgement and estimates by management as to the likelihood  of their realisation. Information provided has included  specialist tax advice in applicable jurisdictions and updates on  specific ongoing audits. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP also reported to the  Committee its findings in this area which have been reviewed  and considered. A report  on completed internal audits is presented to the Committee and,  where appropriate, action plans are reviewed. Similar US-based automotive  companies have maximum long-term  incentive opportunities of up to 595% base  salary for the Chief Executive Officer. Adherence to these guidelines is a condition of continued  participation in the Company’s equity incentive arrangements. Underlying Basic EPS is considered a simple and clear measure of absolute growth in line with the  Company’s strategy. If a contract is to be terminated, the Committee will determine such mitigation as it  considers fair and reasonable in each case.

New Interpretation During September 2017, the IFRS Interpretations Committee issued an agenda decision on interest and penalties related to income  taxes. Where appropriate, estimates of interest and penalties are included in these provisions for uncertain tax positions. Reference is made to contractual considerations, historical data and other relevant factors  such as specific events with an underlying product. Assumptions  underlying these judgements are reviewed at least annually to ensure that the recoverability of costs is reasonably certain. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have previously been impaired are reviewed for  possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. Accrued expenses are recognised when ownership of goods or services has been transferred but not invoiced. The provision is based on  contractual considerations, historical warranty data and expected outcomes against their associated probabilities. The Group enters into derivative contracts, and incurs  financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks. This is principally represented by gross tax losses in  respect of which no deferred income tax asset was recognised (before the netting of specific provisions) amounting to €549.8 million  (31 December 2016: €560.3 million) that can be carried forward against future taxable income. All tax losses referred to above can  be carried forward without time limitation (UK, Brazil and Australia). The functional currency of SeAH FS is Korean won, which has been converted to euro at prevailing  exchange rates. Receivables provided for as uncollectable and charged  to the Income Statement are included in administrative expenses.

All derivative items reported are within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy specified in IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’; their measurement  includes inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The fair values of non-derivative amounts are determined in accordance with generally accepted valuation techniques based on  discounted cash flow analysis. These contracts are designed to partially match the interest and principal repayments of US dollar based debt reported in Note 3.3.2. Independent accounting valuations of all major defined benefit scheme assets and liabilities were carried out as at 31 December 2017. The US pension plans are subject to annual actuarial valuation, and were most recently valued by independent qualified actuaries as  at 1 January 2017. The UK plan is subject to triennial actuarial valuation, and was most recently formally valued as at 6 April 2015.
