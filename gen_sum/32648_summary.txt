for each performance measure are set by the committee with reference to internal plans and external expectations. elements of variable remuneration would be treated as follows: annual bonus under the annual incentive plan, an employee who ceases employment or is under notice prior to the payment of bonus typically will not receive any payment. assumptions made for each scenario are as follows: • minimum: ﬁxed remuneration only (i.e. salary, beneﬁts and pension). these discretions are implicit in the policy stated above, but we have listed them for clarity. details of any payments to former executive directors will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise. in any case, no executive director, including the ceo would be allowed more than one paid non-executive directorship. these will be subject to clawback provisions and a two year holding period for executive directors. annual report on remuneration 42 i moss bros group plc shop on-line at

external ﬁnancial information provider. it excludes exceptional proﬁts, onerous lease provision release, interest, movement in hire deposits and other material accruals unless the remuneration committee considers them appropriate to include. brian brick’s fees earned from ambleside consulting limited since he became ceo are listed below. these assumptions relate to forecast sales growth and margin ﬁgures which are based on management estimates. the changing trends and economic environment require judgements in respect of provisions to be reassessed at each reporting date. we challenged
