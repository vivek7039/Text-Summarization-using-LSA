OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS • Beneﬁts from ongoing investment in a strong brand identity and store reﬁt programme continue, delivering an environment to showcase our enhanced product range. We opened a further 7 stores in Westﬁeld Stratford City, the Merry Hill shopping centre, Worcester, Belfast, Harrogate, Newbury and on Teesside. We have also recruited a new Buying Director, Nick Reed, who joins us from Charles Tyrwhitt, the multi-channel Menswear retailer, which he joined in 2000. Retail gross margins improved on the previous year by 2.2% as a result of more focused promotional activity. MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 9 The Hire website continues to gain traction and we believe it will achieve further growth, with wedding hire customers more frequently beginning their journey online before engaging with our stores to complete their transaction. We have integrated The Moss Bros. Way, our values framework, across key people processes and in particular recruitment. We have made progress on internal promotions, including Store career paths and appointments from Stores to Head Ofﬁce. The focus for 2017 is building management capability, change management and embedding customer behaviours and to support this we are equipping 4 Centres of Excellence; model stores that will showcase a multi-functional store with the customer experience at its core. MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 13 Management monitors progress by reference to a number of key performance indicators (“KPIs”). This is delivered through a highly developed and efﬁcient infrastructure which enables consistent ‘delivery to promise’. We have previously strengthened our market position through the introduction of a new transactional Hire website and back-end system improvements are in development. Costs Supply chain cost price increases and currency ﬂuctuation could have a materially adverse affect on results. A ﬂuctuation in currency rates could materially affect the Group’s cost base and margins. If general price inﬂation returns this may allow an increase in retail selling prices albeit subject to market conditions. Suppliers going out of business could have a signiﬁcant impact on our ability to meet demand in store and online. We continually review and monitor our disaster recovery plan to ensure that all business risks are adequately covered. PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 17 The Board recognises its responsibilities in respect of social, environmental and ethical (“SEE”) matters with the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer having overall Board responsibility for Group Environmental Management. During the period, employees were provided with information about the Group’s performance and on other matters of concern to them as employees, through our online communication portal, telephone conference calls, regular newsletters, notice boards, reports, team brieﬁngs and conferences. The business operates from a portfolio of high street, shopping centre and factory outlet stores all held under operating leases. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 19 DIRECTORS Debbie Hewitt MBE – Non-Executive Chairman. It is also the Committee’s policy to consider every year whether there should be an audit tender process. Beneﬁts typically comprise a car allowance, private medical insurance, life assurance and group income protection. For example, Executive Directors may be invited to participate in the Sharesave scheme approved by HMRC. Annual Bonus To drive and reward market leading short term operating performance of the Group. 50% of any bonus payment is invested in shares and deferred for a three year period. Targets for each performance measure are set by the Committee with reference to internal plans and external expectations. Elements of variable remuneration would be treated as follows: Annual bonus Under the Annual Incentive Plan, an employee who ceases employment or is under notice prior to the payment of bonus typically will not receive any payment. Long-Term Incentive Plan Under the LTIP, unvested awards will normally lapse upon cessation of employment. Assumptions made for each scenario are as follows: • Minimum: ﬁxed remuneration only (i.e. salary, beneﬁts and pension). These discretions are implicit in the policy stated above, but we have listed them for clarity. Details of any payments to former Executive Directors will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise. The second role, which he retains, is with SFD, a visual display and merchandising company. In any case, no Executive Director, including the CEO would be allowed more than one paid Non-Executive Directorship. These will be subject to clawback provisions and a two year holding period for executive directors.

Brian Brick’s fees earned from Ambleside Consulting Limited since he became CEO are listed below. Brian Brick has one award outstanding which will vest subject to continued employment on 11 April 2016. These assumptions relate to forecast sales growth and margin ﬁgures which are based on management estimates. The changing trends and economic environment require judgements in respect of provisions to be reassessed at each reporting date. This is identiﬁed as a key source of estimation uncertainty in Note 2 and within the accounting policy on page 65-70. We challenged all store forecasts in terms of future earnings projections and costs associated with running stores to determine if the provision is complete. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the ﬁnancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
