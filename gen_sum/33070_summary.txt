For further explanation see ‘Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), on page 74. 02 STRATEGY Reuters goal is to be the information company our customers value most, by offering indispensable content, innovative trading services and great customer service. We are also strengthening our Enterprise Information Products and Risk Management software offerings, to capitalise on increases in compliance spend. With the acquisition of Telerate, we would extend our presence among core financial customers, including fixed income, buy side firms and regional dealers. We are uniquely placed to achieve cost synergies from the acquisition because Telerate’s information distribution infrastructure already operates on our systems. COMPANY INFORMATION continued We offer systems to help our customers manage trade processing, financial content and internal business processes more effectively throughout their organisations. Financial desktop products • Reuters Xtra family – targeted at the most sophisticated end-users within sales, trading and portfolio management. • Reuters Wealth Manager family – targeted at private client advisors and retail brokers who require products that can be integrated closely with their in-house systems. The Reuters Wealth Manager family includes portfolio management tools and information on a wide range of managed funds. In 2004, our Lipper subsidiary strengthened its offering by acquiring Fitzrovia International PLC, which analyses mutual fund fees and expenses. Our increasing focus on transactions means that we anticipate a shift in the mix of subscription and usage revenues over time. These surveys measure opinion in a number of key areas, including leadership, customer orientation, performance culture and career development. In addition, our fundamentals and estimates data is recognised as a leading source of high quality financial information covering over 35,000 companies worldwide. Several exchanges compete with our datafeed business by providing low-latency real time feeds of their data direct to banks and financial institutions. However, through shareholders’ agreements, Reuters shared effective control with Equant and therefore did not consolidate Radianz as a subsidiary for accounting purposes. For more information, see ‘Related party transactions and material contracts – Instinet Group – sale of Bridge Trading’ on page 88. • Reuters profit before taxation increased by £279 million, driven mainly by profits on disposals, which included the majority of Reuters stake in TSI as well as its holdings in GL TRADE, Riskmetrics, TowerGroup, Yankee Group Research Inc. (Yankee) and ORT SAS Group (ORT). Enterprise Revenue from the Enterprise segment, which accounts for 20% of Reuters revenues, fell by £79 million to £481 million, a decline of 14% on an actual Trends in user accesses and average revenue per access (ARPA) User accesses declined by approximately 10,000 over the year as a whole. Datafeeds and Market Data Systems are more established businesses with strategically vital capabilities, that sit at the heart of Reuters new transactions offer. Communications costs declined by £46 million, or 13% on an actual basis, as a result of the weakened US dollar and Fast Forward initiatives. In January 2005, INET announced that it would share up to 50% of its market data revenue for certain American Stock Exchange transactions. Net cash flows are generally either applied to reduce debt or placed in short- term investments with financial institutions holding strong credit ratings within pre-agreed limits set by the Board. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. To the extent that these currency exposures are not hedged, exchange rate movements may cause fluctuations in Reuters Group’s consolidated financial statements. Reuters currently holds approximately 14% of Savvis’ voting share capital, which it has agreed to transfer as partial consideration for Telerate. If Reuters Group is unable to cope effectively with increased competitive pressure arising from the above or any other factors, its financial results could be adversely affected. Compliance with Regulation ATS could have an adverse effect on Instinet Group’s business, financial condition and operating results. Reuters Group may not be able to realise the anticipated benefits of existing or future acquisitions and disposals. Sir John Craven stepped down from the Board and Dick Olver took on his role as senior independent non-executive director. Former non-executive director of Gleacher & Co LLC (2000-2003), Rothmans International BV (1998- 2000), Ducati SpA (1999-2000) and Société Générale de Surveillance SA. The company has also received a waiver from NASDAQ’s provisions requiring shareholder approval of employee share-based incentive schemes. In practical terms, this means that the reward structure for directors should attract, motivate and retain high-calibre individuals capable of successful leadership. Total executive remuneration is calibrated to deliver mid-market rewards at formally targeted levels of personal and corporate performance. Reuters continues to ensure that an increasing proportion of executive reward is variable and wholly dependent upon performance. In 2004, excluding pension entitlements, the targeted composition of each executive director’s remuneration was as follows: Fixed Variable Long-term Base pay Bonus incentives Total % % % % Tom Glocer 17% 26% 57% 100% David Grigson 29% 29% 42% 100% Devin Wenig 29% 29% 42% 100% Executive directors are required to build and maintain a personal equity stake in the company. Non-executive directors have letters of engagement rather than service contracts and are not eligible to participate in executive share plans. Dick Olver, who replaced Sir John Craven as senior independent non-executive director, receives an additional £5,000 per annum for this role. Since April 1999 it has been Reuters policy that all new UK employees, including executive directors, are offered participation in a defined contribution pension plan. There is the potential to earn additional bonus payments based on significant out-performance against Target Operating Profit and customer satisfaction targets. Details of all share incentive awards outstanding for each executive director serving during 2004 are set out on pages 38 and 39. Currently restricted shares will not normally be granted for long-term incentive purposes to executive directors or members of the GMC. It is intended that, other than for executive directors and GMC members, employees will be eligible to participate in this plan instead of the DSOP. 07 SERVICE CONTRACTS It is Reuters policy that new executive directors be offered notice periods of not more than one year. Any termination payment will not exceed an amount equal to the sum of annual salary, bonus and 12 months’ pension contributions paid by Reuters. Reuters carried out a partial restructuring of its UK approved pension arrangements for senior employees during the year. The past directors involved were Sir Peter Job, Jean-Claude Marchand, John Parcell, Robert Rowley, David Ure, André Villeneuve, Geoffrey Weetman and Mark Wood. Other operating income primarily comprises amounts received from joint ventures in respect of costs incurred by Reuters on their behalf. Management consultancy fees include amounts earned in 2002 by PwC Consulting, which ceased to be part of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP on 1 October 2002. The directors consider it important that Reuters Group has access to a broad range of external advice, including from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP . Reuters Group only enters into such derivative financial instruments to hedge (or reduce) the underlying exposure described above. However, Reuters Group does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparties who are all banks with recognised long-term credit ratings of ‘A3/A-’ or higher. This does not give rise to a charge against profit as Reuters has taken advantage of the exemption allowed under UITF17 ‘Employee Share Schemes’. 30 OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS Minimum payments for non-cancellable operating leases for terms in excess of one year from 31 December are as follows: 2004 2003 2002 £m £m £m Year ended 31 December 2003 – – 91 2004 – 97 81 2005 94 83 68 2006 81 73 62 2007 74 63 57 2008 67 54 47 2009 61 45 40 Thereafter 379 282 289 Total minimum lease payments 756 697 735 At 31 December, the Group had commitments to make payments during the following year under non-cancellable operating leases as follows: Land and buildings Other 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 £m £m £m £m £m £m Operating leases which expire: Within one year 8 711 1 22 In the second to fifth years 34 43 37 6 64 Over five years 54 48 50 – – – Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 69 31 ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS Acquisitions On 11 March 2004, Reuters acquired the 50% shareholding in Icor Brokerage Ltd that it did not already own and, on 22 October 2004, acquired Fitzrovia International plc. Since the year end, Reuters has reduced its holding in TSI to 7.4%, generating total net proceeds of £9 million. Other borrowings falling due after more than one year relate to Euro Medium Term Notes issued, which are repayable at various dates between 2006 and 2008. Profits and losses on financial instruments are reported as part of profit for the period to which they relate. Securities transactions Securities transactions between Instinet Group counterparties which pass through Instinet Group and in its role as agency brokers, are recorded on a settlement date basis and, therefore, are only reflected in the balance sheet if there is a failure to settle. Income from these securities and any adjustment for changes in their market value during the year is reported as part of profit. Under US GAAP, available for sale current asset investments are stated at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses included in the statement of other comprehensive income. Variations from regular cost are spread on a straight line basis over the expected average remaining service lives of relevant current employees. Under US GAAP , deferred taxes are accounted for in accordance with FAS 109 ‘Accounting for Income Taxes‘ on all timing differences and a valuation allowance is established in respect of those deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some portion will remain unrealised. This year the Board has decided that voting on all resolutions will be carried out by way of a poll. The reseller rights have an initial term of one year which Reuters may elect to extend for two further one-year terms. In addition, under a development agreement Reuters develops enhancements to the RGRS interface so that customers can better access Instinet Group’s proprietary trading functionality. This is available to certain customers who are increasing their level of business with Instinet Group, Reuters or both. Telerate had provided Reuters with facilities and maintenance for equipment supporting the data collection function of the Bridge Data Network in Europe and Asia, among other services, although these have largely been terminated over time as Reuters now provides these functions for itself. In keeping with its Fast Forward goal to simplify business operations, Reuters has also disposed of or closed over 80 units during the period. 2002 • Island Holding Company Inc., was acquired by Instinet Group in September 2002 for stock consideration, having a value at the closing of £194 million. On 21 January 2005, the Court ruled that neither party will be permitted to introduce evidence regarding Instinet Group’s profits.
