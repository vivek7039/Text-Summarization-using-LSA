niall fitzgerald, kbe chairman chairman’s statement 02 reuters group plc annual report and form 20-f 2004 “we must put in place a strategic framework for sustained growth in the years ahead.” chief executive’s review reuters group plc annual report and form 20-f 2004 03 one to one with tom glocer our ceo answers the key questions about reuters q what was the high point of 2004? unfortunately, our journalists and photographers are all too often exposed to danger as they report world events. it brought home to me just how integral we are to the way our customers run their businesses and how we can create a competitive advantage for reuters by increasing our investment in business continuity and disaster recovery. q where do you expect reuters growth to come from in the next few years? our dialogue with customers, investors and reuters own staff has shifted from one of recovery to growth. growth in electronic trading is being driven by lower spreads in traditional cash equities markets and a quest for greater efficiency as firms seek to grow their trading platforms to handle an ever-increasing number of trades whilst employing fewer people. concentration of trading liquidity and increased regulation are in turn driving the trend towards consolidation. 02 strategy reuters goal is to be the information company our customers value most, by offering indispensable content, innovative trading services and great customer service. our drive to become more competitive delivered a successful defence of our foreign exchange information and trading franchise, where the number of user positions grew in 2004 for the first time in seven years, despite increased competition. in november, we announced the development of new transactions services for fixed income and equities which build on our successful foreign exchange trading franchise and position us to benefit from the rapid growth in electronic trading. on 21 february 2005 we launched reuters trading for fixed income with tradeable prices from six banks. we are also strengthening our enterprise information products and risk management software offerings, to capitalise on increases in compliance spend. with the acquisition of telerate, we would extend our presence among core financial customers, including fixed income, buy side firms and regional dealers. we are uniquely placed to achieve cost synergies from the acquisition because telerate’s information distribution infrastructure already operates on our systems. our data is available through various delivery platforms such as workstations, datafeeds, internet and wireless solutions. company information continued we offer systems to help our customers manage trade processing, financial content and internal business processes more effectively throughout their organisations. financial desktop products • reuters xtra family – targeted at the most sophisticated end-users within sales, trading and portfolio management. • reuters wealth manager family – targeted at private client advisors and retail brokers who require products that can be integrated closely with their in-house systems. the reuters wealth manager family includes portfolio management tools and information on a wide range of managed funds. in 2004, our lipper subsidiary strengthened its offering by acquiring fitzrovia international plc, which analyses mutual fund fees and expenses. our increasing focus on transactions means that we anticipate a shift in the mix of subscription and usage revenues over time. we have a process to review talent, organisational capability and succession planning for key positions. these surveys measure opinion in a number of key areas, including leadership, customer orientation, performance culture and career development. in addition, our fundamentals and estimates data is recognised as a leading source of high quality financial information covering over 35,000 companies worldwide. several exchanges compete with our datafeed business by providing low-latency real time feeds of their data direct to banks and financial institutions. in addition, from 1 april 2004 rtsl has been classified by the fsa as an alternative trading system (ats). however, through shareholders’ agreements, reuters shared effective control with equant and therefore did not consolidate radianz as a subsidiary for accounting purposes. for more information, see ‘related party transactions and material contracts – instinet group – sale of bridge trading’ on page 88. • reuters profit before taxation increased by £279 million, driven mainly by profits on disposals, which included the majority of reuters stake in tsi as well as its holdings in gl trade, riskmetrics, towergroup, yankee group research inc. (yankee) and ort sas group (ort). additionally, reuters experienced an increase in debtors of £18 million relating to an interim funding payment in connection with the pending acquisition of telerate (see ‘related party transactions and material contracts – other material contracts – telerate acquisition agreement’ on page 89). enterprise revenue from the enterprise segment, which accounts for 20% of reuters revenues, fell by £79 million to £481 million, a decline of 14% on an actual trends in user accesses and average revenue per access (arpa) user accesses declined by approximately 10,000 over the year as a whole. revenue from the xtra product family is divided between sales & trading (93%) and research & asset management ( 7%). within enterprise, revenues are derived from four product lines, offering customers fully integrated business solutions. datafeeds and market data systems are more established businesses with strategically vital capabilities, that sit at the heart of reuters new transactions offer. these declines were driven by reuters withdrawal from its consulting business as part of fast forward, major customers consolidating systems into larger centres and an aggressive campaign by reuters to migrate small and medium sized customers to newer, desktop-based offerings. within media, revenues are derived from the text, visuals, consumer and advertising services product lines. property costs reduced by £25 million, or 13% on an actual basis, as consolidation of office space continued. communications costs declined by £46 million, or 13% on an actual basis, as a result of the weakened us dollar and fast forward initiatives. in january 2005, inet announced that it would share up to 50% of its market data revenue for certain american stock exchange transactions. both the eps and margin calculations are based on uk gaap per reuters current reporting. all treasury activity takes place within a formal control framework under policies approved by the board. net cash flows are generally either applied to reduce debt or placed in short- term investments with financial institutions holding strong credit ratings within pre-agreed limits set by the board. drawings under these lines were £45 million at 31 december 2004. instinet group has access to the equivalent of us$189 million short-term uncommitted bank facilities of which us$15 million were drawn at 31 december 2004. contractual financial obligations the following table summarises reuters group’s principal contractual financial obligations at 31 december 2004, certain of which are described in the consolidated financial statements and notes. the group also has significant costs denominated in foreign currencies with a different mix from revenue. the approximate proportions of operating profit excluding goodwill amortisation and currency gains received in each key currency group were as follows: year to 31 december 2004 2003 2002 adjusted group operating profit by currency % %% euro 137 171 296 us dollar 8 (5) (71) japanese yen 28 32 53 sterling (103) (133) (283) other 30 35 105 total 100 100 100 sterling costs exceeded sterling revenue due to the level of restructuring costs and uk-based marketing, development, operational and central services costs. as a result, some current asset investments and goodwill have been written down to net realisable value. in evaluating this allowance, customer credit worthiness, current economic conditions and previous experience are taken into account. there are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. reuters may not be able to realise the anticipated benefits of its fast forward transformation plan. unfavourable conditions in financial markets may have a significant adverse effect on the group’s business. in addition, reuters group’s business could be adversely affected by further consolidations among clients and competitors. to the extent that these currency exposures are not hedged, exchange rate movements may cause fluctuations in reuters group’s consolidated financial statements. reuters group is dependent on third parties for the provision of certain network and other services. reuters currently holds approximately 14% of savvis’ voting share capital, which it has agreed to transfer as partial consideration for telerate. factors that have significantly increased the market data update rates include: the emergence of proprietary data feeds from other markets; high market volatility; decimalisation; reductions in trade sizes resulting in more transactions; new derivative instruments; increased automatically-generated algorithmic and program trading; market fragmentation resulting in an increased number of trading venues; and multiple listings of options and other securities. while reuters group has implemented a number of capacity management initiatives, there can be no assurance that reuters group and its network providers will be able to accommodate accelerated growth of peak traffic volumes or avoid other failures or interruptions. significant competition in the financial information and trading industries could adversely affect reuters group’s business. if reuters group is unable to cope effectively with increased competitive pressure arising from the above or any other factors, its financial results could be adversely affected. on 15 december 2004, the sec published for public comment an amended version of proposed ‘regulation nms’. among other consequences, instinet group might be required to comply with fair representation or ownership requirements. compliance with regulation ats could have an adverse effect on instinet group’s business, financial condition and operating results. reuters group may not be able to realise the anticipated benefits of existing or future acquisitions and disposals. it is reuters group’s policy not to make political contributions and none was made in 2004. reuters policy is to make payments on time, provided suppliers perform in accordance with the agreed terms. sir john craven stepped down from the board and dick olver took on his role as senior independent non-executive director. joined reuters in 1993 as corporate counsel, reuters america and held a number of senior management positions before being appointed president, investment banking & brokerage services in january 2001. also a non-executive director of instinet and nastech pharmaceutical company. former non-executive director of gleacher & co llc (2000-2003), rothmans international bv (1998- 2000), ducati spa (1999-2000) and société générale de surveillance sa. the company has also received a waiver from nasdaq’s provisions requiring shareholder approval of employee share-based incentive schemes. in addition, on 22 november 2004 he was appointed chairman of the nelson mandela legacy trust (uk). its aim is for the group to achieve profitable growth within an acceptable risk profile. a sub-committee meets on an ad hoc basis to address disclosure matters arising between reporting periods. an investor relations department is dedicated to facilitating communications between the company and its shareholders. in practical terms, this means that the reward structure for directors should attract, motivate and retain high-calibre individuals capable of successful leadership. total executive remuneration is calibrated to deliver mid-market rewards at formally targeted levels of personal and corporate performance. reuters continues to ensure that an increasing proportion of executive reward is variable and wholly dependent upon performance. in 2004, excluding pension entitlements, the targeted composition of each executive director’s remuneration was as follows: fixed variable long-term base pay bonus incentives total % % % % tom glocer 17% 26% 57% 100% david grigson 29% 29% 42% 100% devin wenig 29% 29% 42% 100% executive directors are required to build and maintain a personal equity stake in the company. this fee is fixed until 1 october 2007. the company does not provide a pension contribution to niall fitzgerald. niall fitzgerald succeeded sir christopher hogg and he has also waived receipt of any committee chairmanship fees. dick olver, who replaced sir john craven as senior independent non-executive director, receives an additional £5,000 per annum for this role. since april 1999 it has been reuters policy that all new uk employees, including executive directors, are offered participation in a defined contribution pension plan. however, there is no intention to provide any additional compensation as a consequence of such changes. there is the potential to earn additional bonus payments based on significant out-performance against target operating profit and customer satisfaction targets. from 2003, awards have been based on the fair market value per share using option pricing methodology. in line with market practice, no performance conditions are attached to options granted under this plan. it is not intended that executive directors should receive any further awards under these plans. currently restricted shares will not normally be granted for long-term incentive purposes to executive directors or members of the gmc. it is intended that, other than for executive directors and gmc members, employees will be eligible to participate in this plan instead of the dsop. as a result of the acquisition by the instinet group of island in 2002, a further 416,406 shares under option were outstanding under the island stock option plan (and are now exercisable into instinet group common stock) as at 31 december 2004. exercise prices range from us$0.91 to us$9.23 (on an adjusted basis) with a term of ten years from grant. 07 service contracts it is reuters policy that new executive directors be offered notice periods of not more than one year. in the event of termination by tom glocer due to our fault or by us without cause, tom glocer’s compensation will be limited to a maximum of 12 months’ accrued benefits being annual salary, annual bonus and pension contributions. any termination payment will not exceed an amount equal to the sum of annual salary, bonus and 12 months’ pension contributions paid by reuters. board approval is required and directors are permitted to retain cash-only fees paid for such appointments. index of reuters group plc tsr performance 2000 – 2004 2001 2000 200 160 120 80 40 0 ftse reuters 2002 2003

for senior employees during the year. the past directors involved were sir peter job, jean-claude marchand, john parcell, robert rowley, david ure, andré villeneuve, geoffrey weetman and mark wood. during 2004, the directors were not aware of any control breakdowns that resulted in a material loss. other operating income primarily comprises amounts received from joint ventures in respect of costs incurred by reuters on their behalf. management consultancy fees include amounts earned in 2002 by pwc consulting, which ceased to be part of pricewaterhousecoopers llp on 1 october 2002. the directors consider it important that reuters group has access to a broad range of external advice, including from pricewaterhousecoopers llp . reuters group seeks to limit these risks by entering into a mix of derivative financial instruments. reuters group only enters into such derivative financial instruments to hedge (or reduce) the underlying exposure described above. restated restated 2004

of profit for the period to which they relate. securities transactions securities transactions between instinet group counterparties which pass through instinet group and in its role as agency brokers, are recorded on a settlement date basis and, therefore, are only reflected in the balance sheet if there is a failure to settle. income from these securities and any adjustment for changes in

gaap figures, and also changes to the differences between uk and us gaap , as explained below: shares held by employee share ownership trusts (esots) under uk gaap, shares in reuters group plc held by esots are now shown as a deduction from shareholders’ equity until such time as share options vest un-conditionally in employees, whereas previously they were shown as a fixed asset investment. under us gaap , specific rules establish the criteria that must be met for revenue recognition. under us gaap , the costs of developing computer software products subsequent to establishing technical feasibility are capitalised. under us gaap , certain costs relating to computer software licences acquired for internal use are capitalised. under us gaap, available for sale current asset investments are stated at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses included in the statement of other comprehensive income. variations from regular cost are spread on a straight line basis over the expected average remaining service lives of relevant current employees. assets not recognised are shown by way of a valuation allowance in the balance sheet. under us gaap , deferred taxes are accounted for in accordance with fas 109 ‘accounting for income taxes‘ on all timing differences and a valuation allowance is established in respect of those deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some portion will remain unrealised. 78 reuters group plc annual report and form 20-f 2004 36 adjustments to net income restated restated 2004 2003 2002 £m £m £m profit/(loss) attributable to ordinary
