expenditure than depreciation and an increase in employee benefits assets following the move of the uk defined benefit pension scheme into surplus. the energy we use in our factories, offices,

out in the remuneration committee report which starts on page 75. i am pleased that we have continued to make good progress with a number of actions identified from previous board evaluation exercises. during 2017, with external support, we undertook our annual effectiveness evaluation of the board, its principal committees and individual directors. directors are also encouraged personally to identify any additional training requirements that would assist them in carrying out their role. in addition to formal meetings, the chairman and chief executive maintain regular contact with all directors. the board of each business is required to confirm twice yearly that it has complied with these policies and procedures. internal audit also conducts regular reviews to ensure that

not exceed any limits in applicable law and take into account the relevant ethical guidance for auditors. as a result of volatility in world and european sugar prices, we introduced an additional earnings per share measure into the long term incentive plan (ltip). we increased shareholding requirements for our executive directors and introduced a deferred award of shares connected with the

from a dividend equivalent, paid at vesting. operation and link to business strategy base salaries are normally reviewed on an annual basis or following a significant change in responsibilities. if there is a significant change in role scope, remuneration will be adjusted to reflect this. the executive directors have a greater proportion of their total reward package at risk than other employees. the committee chairman is available to discuss with shareholders any remuneration matters that will help shape our policy and practice. relocation if a new executive director needs to relocate, the company may pay: • actual relocation costs and other reasonable expenses relating to moving house; • disturbance allowance of up to 5% of salary, some of which may be tax-free for qualifying expenditure; • school fees for dependent children where there are cultural or language considerations; • medical costs for the overseas family, where relevant; • one business class return

associated british foods plc annual report and accounts 2017 112 significant accounting policies for the 52 weeks ended 16 september 2017 112 associated british foods plc (‘the company’) is a company domiciled in the united kingdom. assets classified as held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. the accounting policies set out below have been applied to all periods presented, except where detailed otherwise. adjustments are made as appropriate for significant transactions or events occurring between 16 september and these other balance sheet dates. contributions payable by the group in respect of defined contribution plans are charged to operating profit as incurred. other unfunded post-employment liabilities are accounted for in the same way as defined benefit pension plans. the group economically hedges foreign currency exposure on recognised monetary assets and liabilities but does not normally seek hedge accounting. any derivatives that the group holds to hedge this exposure are classified as ‘held for trading’ within derivative assets and liabilities. for goodwill, and intangibles without a finite life, the recoverable amount is estimated at least annually. payments made under finance leases are apportioned between capital repayments and interest expense charged to the income statement. value in use is determined with reference to projected future cash flows discounted at an appropriate rate. segment non-current asset additions are the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one year, comprising property, plant and equipment, operating intangibles and biological assets. revenue adjusted operating profit 2017 £m 2016 £m 2017 £m

based on a change in the specific assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. other deferred tax assets totalling £97m (2016 – £99m) have not been recognised on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain. cash equivalents generally comprise deposits placed on money markets for periods of up to three months which earn interest at a short-term deposit rate; and funds invested with fund managers that have a maturity of less than or equal to three months and are at fixed rates. in addition to the amounts disclosed above, at 17 september 2016 there were £10m of trade and other payables classified as liabilities held for sale. for payables with a remaining life of less than one year, carrying amount is deemed to reflect fair value. 2016 last year the group acquired two small european agriculture businesses which, together, increased net assets by £8m satisfied in cash. provisions for transaction and associated restructuring costs were £33m, with a loss of £1m on recycling foreign exchange differences. all disclosures in this note are given gross, before the held for sale reclassification was made. as a result, it is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates which affect the group’s transaction costs. instead, such derivatives are classified as held for trading and marked to market through the income statement. the group’s businesses are exposed to counterparty credit risk when dealing with customers, and from certain financing activities. the immediate credit exposure of financial instruments is represented by those financial instruments that have a net positive fair value by counterparty at 16 september 2017. the group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be: note 2017 £m 2016 £m cash and cash equivalents
