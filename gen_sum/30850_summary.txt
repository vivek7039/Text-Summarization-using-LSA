report what we offer we enable individuals and institutions to access this outperformance through a variety of savings products. our efficient platform and operating model helped turn revenue growth into underlying earnings per share of 34.2p, up 16%. investment outperformance helps us to grow our assets under management (aum), by ensuring we keep existing clients and attract new ones. our fund managers are organised into strategy teams, ensuring that they can share ideas and information, while retaining accountability as individuals for their funds’ performance. as we grow, this approach helps to give us a more diversified business by asset class, geography and investment style. this included 34 people located in europe and asia providing in‑ country support for our international business growth. we do this within a team framework where respect, high standards and innovation are key to our high‑ performance culture. europe (started trading) austria (2014) france (2009) germany

dear fellow shareholders the board was very pleased with the group’s performance this year. new clients came from across an increasingly broad distribution network of partners with wider geographical reach. it also included substantial changes to our operating platform in preparation for all the requirements of mifid ii. both of these changes benefit clients and increase transparency, enabling them to more easily assess the investment performance after all fees. it is confident that jupiter’s position as an active fund manager focused on investment performance after all fees can support its continued growth. board and governance we were delighted to welcome roger yates as a non‑ executive director in october 2017. roger led henderson’s successful global expansion and has over a decade of non‑ executive experience on the boards of uk financial services companies. people and culture jupiter has good gender balance at board level but this is not replicated in all areas of the group. there was also meaningful demand for a range of other strategies, including absolute return and global emerging markets. these launches underline jupiter’s growing expertise and reputation in emerging markets, which accounts for an increasing proportion of our aum. worldwide, the population aged 60 or over is growing faster than all younger age groups, at about 3% per annum. mutual fund providers, pension funds and insurance companies are providing more opportunities for these individuals to achieve their investment goals. persistently low interest rates in many countries mean that traditional savings accounts offer negative real returns. at the other end, there are significant inflows into high‑ performance, outcome‑ orientated active strategies, capable of delivering additional returns. jupiter must meet this challenge in order to retain clients, attract greater inflows and grow revenues. investment outperformance after all fees, delivered through active asset management, is therefore our number one priority. we continue to develop and evolve our internal processes in a way that recognises the importance of controls. to accelerate this process, we are proactively deploying more of our balance sheet as seed investments. given the historic importance of london as a financial centre, and the supporting infrastructure and resources that have built up there, we do not believe that brexit will fundamentally affect london’s importance, even if businesses relocate some operations to european centres. since 2016, individuals have had more freedom over how they use their pension pots at the point of retirement. total net inflows were £47.5bn, up from £8.4bn in the previous year when political uncertainty dampened clients’ investment appetite. while each building block addresses the interests of all our stakeholders, some have a primary focus on one particular stakeholder group. we organise our investment professionals into strategy teams, so they can share ideas and information, while remaining individually accountable for the performance of their funds. in many cases, these individuals also need financial planning advice, which is not part of jupiter’s business model. instead, we access them through our distribution partners such as financial advisers and wealth managers. there are also influential organisations in the mutual fund market, such as research consultants and rating agencies. we continue to deepen our distribution in the uk, focusing on financial advisers and wealth managers. the breadth of our product range means that clients can choose products which meet their needs and suit current market conditions. who we serve asset manager fees key flow of product flow of fees jupiter investment strategies delivered via: mutual funds:

stakeholders. in 2017, we expanded our seed investment programme, extending its size, scope and making it more dynamic. our significant investment in 2017 will, over time, deliver efficiencies and more operating scale, facilitating further growth through a standardised approach to running the platform. 1 deliver outperformance after fees to our clients 2 sell this expertise through products

this year. this results from our distribution partners changing the ways in which they characterise themselves and engage with clients. this creates opportunities for us to support them more creatively through our strong relationship‑ based model, with new products and client service solutions. net inflows/(outflows) by product (£m) 2017 2016 mutual funds 5,100 859 segregated mandates 364

strategic report talent and culture jupiter is a people business; only through them can we achieve our objectives. we will continue to enhance the capabilities of line managers with ongoing training and development. we are also helping our managers manage their teams effectively, with a focus on improving management and personal development conversations around performance. other programmes of work for 2018 will include developing a new induction programme for joining employees to ensure they understand our culture, value and strategy, a review of the benefits we offer our people, and an increase in the talent resourcing conducted in‑ house, rather than through external agencies. creating a diverse mix of younger people joining the firm is an important contributor to improving diversity over time. an important analysis of employee diversity is by gender (excluding contractors), which is shown in the table below: 2017 2016 at 31 december female male female male board 5 5 5 4

recognise that the talented people who join us bring their own perspectives, which make a positive contribution to jupiter’s culture. it has also streamlined the sharing of data across business functions, which helps us to make well‑ informed decisions that ultimately benefit our clients. the investment in technology and work performed has been integral to ensuring that jupiter was in a position to comply with mifid ii from its start date of 3 january 2018. investment in change programmes to ensure we comply with new requirements such as the general data protection regulation and those of smcr will continue throughout 2018. spend on technology focuses on delivering security, resilience and simplicity. the provision of dual data location sites for our private cloud off‑ premise server estate facilitates robust business continuity planning. due to this accounting treatment, there was an increase in social security costs on all unexercised share awards. underlying eps (£m)

ebitda other than its use as a profitability performance measure in the assessment of variable compensation for executive directors, the group no longer uses adjusted ebitda as a performance measure as there are no material differences between jupiter’s underlying pbt and its adjusted ebitda. the group only invests in liquid funds and chooses to hedge market and currency risk on the majority of its holdings of seed investments, with all seed investments either hedged or invested in absolute return or fixed income products. this position of capital strength enables us to be agile when assessing and pursuing market opportunities in which we see the potential for value creation. liquidity the group has a robust free cash position, supported by an undrawn rcf and hedged seed investments. d. used principally in the internal assessment of whether executive directors have met specified performance criteria (see pages 73 and 74). being debt‑ free and having now fully amortised its trade name intangible assets, there are currently no material differences between jupiter’s underlying pbt and its adjusted ebitda; additionally, amortisation charges going forward will principally relate to assets developed as part of the operating business which should be taken into consideration when measuring performance. we have utilised the global reporting initiative (gri) to structure our disclosure of corporate responsibility information. tcf is a core fca principle, which promotes fair treatment of clients from product inception through to marketing and post‑ sales support. we do not view governance themes in isolation but seek to understand how they affect long‑ term performance. these meetings allow us to question and challenge companies on the issues we think may affect their long‑ term value. the content of these meetings varies but can include strategy, board effectiveness, remuneration, shareholder rights, culture, values, succession planning and sustainability. for product distribution, we use third‑ party platforms, wealth managers and financial advisers to access clients. 35 strategic report governance financial statements other information jupiter fund management plc annual report and accounts 2017 society our corporate values set out our aim of making a positive contribution to society, as managers of other people’s money. we believe this approach incorporates all of our entities with sustainability impacts that are actually or potentially material. our office in hong kong, where renewable tariffs are not available, purchased internationally recognised i‑ recs, using chinese wind power to offset the electrical kw/h usage. our approach is governed by a board‑ approved tax strategy, which we have shared with hm revenue & customs. as chairman, my role is to lead the board, set its agenda and ensure it operates effectively. this success is promoted by having board members with a diverse range of relevant skills and experiences. in december, adrian creedy stepped down as company secretary and has been succeeded by adam westley. the board is very grateful for adrian’s contribution during a career with jupiter spanning over two decades. the remuneration committee continued to perform its role of ensuring that jupiter can attract and retain talented individuals. previous appointments edward joined jupiter in 1994 as a uk fund manager, after working at schroders (1982 ‑ 1986) and electra investment trust (1986‑ 1994). previous appointments charlotte commenced her career at ernst & young where she progressed to be an audit partner in the financial services practice. previous appointments jonathon was a founding partner of actis llp, the emerging markets specialist alternatives fund manager, where he spent over ten years. previous appointments karl was a founding partner of institutional asset manager oxford investment partners, which was bought by towers watson in 2013. prior to that he held a number of positions at morgan grenfell/deutsche asset management between 1992 and 2004, including chief investment officer for london, australia, europe and the asia pacific. having led two global asset managers, roger also brings significant understanding of international business management to the board. he was appointed chief executive officer of henderson group plc in 1999 and led the company for a decade. he keeps the evolving culture in jupiter under review, particularly its impact on risk management and controls. six scheduled board meetings took place during the year, with an additional meeting off‑ site in june for a two day discussion of strategy related matters. each functional business area completes a risk assessment at least annually, and more frequently when required which, when taken in conjunction with the ongoing control performance assessments, is considered to be adequate for capturing any ongoing and emerging risks to the business. identified risks that have a sufficiently high likelihood of potential impact on the group are reflected in the enterprise risk management dashboard, to ensure they receive an appropriately high level of senior management and board attention. these values have long been deeply embedded in jupiter’s culture and are clearly documented. through the investor relations function, jupiter maintains a regular dialogue with interested shareholders, potential investors and industry analysts, as well as ensuring that the group adheres to both regulatory changes and best practice issuance from other bodies. lorraine will not be seeking re‑ election at the 2018 agm, having served as a non‑ executive director for eight years. this project has a number of practical workstreams to promote better diversity practices across the financial sector. we will continue to focus on succession planning, talent‑ management, board recruitment and diversity throughout 2018. liz airey chairman 26 february 2018 nomination committee report 51 financial statements other information jupiter fund management plc annual report and accounts 2017 governance strategic report the nomination committee’s work in 2017 the committee meets at least twice each year, with further meetings taking place as required, for example to consider non‑ executive or senior executive recruitment as it arises. this is subject to a binding vote and sets out our future policy for approval by shareholders. our proposals are not intended to increase overall remuneration opportunity for executive directors; they are designed to keep total remuneration opportunity in the same range as recent compensation, and the potential upside has now been capped. the proposed new policy will enable us to provide market competitive salaries within a rebalanced pay framework. introducing capped incentives our current policy contains no limits on the amounts that individual executive directors can be awarded under incentive schemes. simplification our current remuneration arrangements involve a large number of corporate financial measures which make them relatively complex. future ltip awards will also only vest subject to satisfaction of an additional underlying business performance underpin. performance and remuneration for 2017 as discussed throughout this annual report, 2017 delivered a continuation of jupiter’s growth strategy. for the annual bonus, we look back at investment performance over one and three years. we received a strong level of support for this policy, and have incorporated investor feedback when possible. benefits are also offered on a consistent basis – for example, the level of employer pension contributions is 15% of base salary for executive directors and all uk employees and other benefits, such as private medical insurance, are offered to all uk employees on the same terms. after consulting with our major shareholders and other stakeholders, it is apparent that views across and within these groups are not always uniform, but we did receive strong positive feedback for the new policy, particularly from our largest shareholders. for annual bonuses, the committee believes it is appropriate to use a balanced scorecard approach. ltip awards will also only vest subject to satisfaction of an additional underlying business performance underpin. the committee monitors shareholdings against these requirements annually and decides at its discretion what (if any) action should be taken, which may include requiring an individual to hold a proportion of vested shares until the requirements are met. malus provisions apply so that relevant awards can be withheld or reduced (including to zero) in certain circumstances. l l all‑ employee share plans: participation in the hmrc approved sharesave plan and hmrc approved share incentive plan will be offered on the same basis as it is for all other executive directors and employees. where the remuneration committee determines that such a payment is necessary for recruitment, payments, for example, relocation allowances and other relocation related expenses, may also be paid at a level determined as appropriate by the remuneration committee. typical benefits include: private medical insurance, life assurance, dependants’ pension and an income protection scheme to cover long‑ term illness. 50% of the non deferred bonus is delivered in shares, subject to a six month holding period. no more than 25% of the annual bonus award will be based on individual and strategic measures. executive directors are eligible to participate in both plans on the same basis as other uk employees. typical benefits include: private medical insurance, life assurance, dependants’ pension and an income protection scheme

private medical insurance) will not continue after termination of employment. employees with registered pension protection or those impacted by the tapered annual allowance may elect to have some or all of their pension contributions paid instead as a cash allowance, after deducting an amount equal to the cost of employer national insurance on such cash payments. bonus awards are determined using the balanced scorecard of corporate, strategic and individual performance measures as described below. jupiter’s approach to the distribution of value is further explained in the strategic report on pages 12, 26 and 27. jupiter has altered its remuneration structure for other employees from 2017 onwards in line with regulatory and other market developments. 1 available profit, adjusted available

against those conditions and the associated level of vesting is outlined below. the company has recruited a number of fund managers to manage new investment strategies including asian income and emerging market debt. internationally, we have grown in all regions with a singular focus on the wealth management market. a new senior fund manager started with jupiter in 2013 to run the group’s absolute return strategy. additionally, john continues to be employed by jupiter in his role as head of strategy for the independent funds team. where performance measures produce an outcome which does not align with that of stakeholders, the committee may exercise its discretion as it considers appropriate. given the longer time horizon over which ltip assesses performance, both a three and five year outperformance measure is included. maarten slendebroek and edward bonham carter both hold shares with a value in excess of 300% of base salary as at 31 december 2017. following her appointment to the board in september 2016, charlotte jones is expected to build up her shareholding within the five years following appointment. key terms: l l performance conditions for ltip awards granted 2012 are underlying eps, net sales and strategic goals (with the exception of maarten slendebroek’s 2012 ltip awards, where no performance conditions are attached as part of buy‑ out arrangements). for ltip awards granted from 2013 onwards, the performance conditions are: underlying eps, net sales, investment outperformance and strategic goals. this is demonstrated through a variety of reward features and processes that ensure alignment to risk considerations throughout the organisation. l l for executive directors and executive committee members, all variable remuneration is subject to malus and clawback provisions, whereby incentive awards may be reduced, withheld or reclaimed in certain circumstances, including where there has been a material failure of risk management. no new shares have been issued since listing in 2010. therefore, we are currently operating within the relevant dilution targets by a comfortable margin. 3 maarten slendebroek has two separate ltip awards included in the 2016 single figure, both of which had performance periods ending during that financial year. 4 maarten slendebroek has two separate ltip awards included in the 2017 single figure, both of which had performance periods ending during that financial year. if a participant does not submit an instruction to the sip trustee, no vote is registered. net revenue is stated after fee and commission expenses to intermediaries for ongoing services under distribution agreements. management monitors operating earnings, a non‑ gaap measure (see page 31), for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. these are included within financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (fvtpl) on the balance sheet. an item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. trade and other receivables, including loans to employees, are included in current assets except where they have maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. it will supersede the current guidance found in ias 17 leases 1 january 2019 there are no other ifrss or ifrs ic interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the group. under the new standard, derivatives will continue to be held for trading (and therefore at fvtpl). therefore, at each month end, receivables are low as we have already collected amounts due from the majority of our clients. cash collateral is paid over by the group to satisfy counterparty requirements in respect of open derivative positions. institutional debtors rarely default, given that the group manages assets worth many multiples of any outstanding fees on behalf of those clients, although it should be noted that the group is not generally permitted to remove cash from managed segregated mandates in order to receive settlement. we undertook a review of customer contracts to determine our performance obligation and the associated recognition timing. gains and losses recognised in the income statement during the year ended 31 december 2017 by category are

sample not administered by hsbc or jp morgan, we obtained supporting external evidence over aum. management have modelled the fair value less costs to sell approach under ias 36 by using a discounted cash flow model. the impairment review requires a number of significant estimates to be made by management such as forecasts and discount rates. given this, consistent with the prior year, we set an overall company materiality level based on total assets. the period of total uninterrupted engagement is 11 years, covering the years ended 31 december 2007 to 31 december 2017. jeremy jensen (senior
