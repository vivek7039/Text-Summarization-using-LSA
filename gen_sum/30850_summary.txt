investment outperformance helps us to grow our assets under management (aum), by ensuring we keep existing clients and attract new ones. our fund managers are organised into strategy teams, ensuring that they can share ideas and information, while retaining accountability as individuals for their funds’ performance. as we grow, this approach helps to give us a more diversified business by asset class, geography and investment style. both of these changes benefit clients and increase transparency, enabling them to more easily assess the investment performance after all fees. it is confident that jupiter’s position as an active fund manager focused on investment performance after all fees can support its continued growth. people and culture jupiter has good gender balance at board level but this is not replicated in all areas of the group. these launches underline jupiter’s growing expertise and reputation in emerging markets, which accounts for an increasing proportion of our aum.
