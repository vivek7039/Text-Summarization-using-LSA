Investment outperformance helps us to  grow our assets under management  (AUM), by ensuring we keep existing  clients and attract new ones. Our fund managers are organised into  strategy teams, ensuring that they can  share ideas and information, while  retaining accountability as individuals for  their funds’ performance. As we grow,  this approach helps to give us a more  diversified business by asset class,  geography and investment style. Both of these changes benefit  clients and increase transparency,  enabling them to more easily assess the  investment performance after all fees. It is confident that Jupiter’s position  as an active fund manager focused  on investment performance after all  fees can support its continued growth. People and culture Jupiter has good gender balance at  Board level but this is not replicated in  all areas of the Group. Fixed income has been a major  contributor to our AUM growth for  several years and it was the largest  source of net inflows in 2017. These launches underline Jupiter’s  growing expertise and reputation in  emerging markets, which accounts for  an increasing proportion of our AUM. Mutual fund  providers, pension funds and insurance  companies are providing more  opportunities for these individuals to  achieve their investment goals. This means moving to a single  price for buying and selling fund  units, thereby eliminating ‘box profits’  earned by the Group. While each building block addresses  the interests of all our stakeholders,  some have a primary focus on one  particular stakeholder group. We  organise our investment professionals  into strategy teams, so they can share  ideas and information, while remaining  individually accountable for the  performance of their funds. The breadth  of our product range means that clients  can choose products which meet their  needs and suit current market conditions. Our significant  investment in 2017 will, over time, deliver  efficiencies and more operating scale,  facilitating further growth through a  standardised approach to running the  platform. Our investment function is  arranged around 12 strategies,  providing a framework for repeatable  performance, but the teams themselves  are small and nimble. Our well‑ defined  product development process enables  us to deliver new products or  enhancements, so we can target client  groups in a timely and efficient way.

We have a broad range of  investment strategies which enables us  to offer products suitable for different  market conditions. Our strong capital position  and relatively low cost base means we  are well placed to cope with this risk. Jupiter has formal guidelines for  managing and overseeing all third‑ party relationships, ensuring they  receive a level of scrutiny that reflects  their potential risk to our business. We  have put in place appropriate  procedures and controls which will  enable monitoring of our ongoing  compliance with MiFID II.

We  have put in place appropriate  procedures and controls which will  enable monitoring of our ongoing  compliance with MiFID II. This creates  opportunities for us to support them  more creatively through our strong  relationship‑ based model, with new  products and client service solutions. Thailand offers significant growth  potential and we entered the market  through an agency relationship, which is  already producing inflows. We  are also helping our managers manage  their teams effectively, with a focus on  improving management and personal  development conversations around  performance. Other programmes of work for  2018 will include developing a new  induction programme for joining  employees to ensure they understand  our culture, value and strategy, a review  of the benefits we offer our people,  and an increase in the talent resourcing  conducted in‑ house, rather than through  external agencies. An important analysis of employee  diversity is by gender (excluding  contractors), which is shown in the table  below: 2017 2016 At 31 December Female Male Female Male Board 5 5 5 4 Senior  management 11 71 9 63 Other  employees 168 233 169 218 Total 184 309 183 285 Jupiter rewards employees equally for  doing equivalent jobs, at the same  level of performance and experience. We also recognise  that the talented people who join us  bring their own perspectives, which make  a positive contribution to Jupiter’s culture. It has also streamlined the  sharing of data across business functions,  which helps us to make well‑ informed  decisions that ultimately benefit our  clients. Investment in change  programmes to ensure we comply with  new requirements such as the General  Data Protection Regulation and those  of SMCR will continue throughout 2018. This position of capital strength enables  us to be agile when assessing and  pursuing market opportunities in which  we see the potential for value creation. Being  debt‑ free and having now fully  amortised its trade name intangible  assets, there are currently no  material differences between Jupiter’s  underlying PBT and its adjusted  EBITDA; additionally, amortisation  charges going forward will principally  relate to assets developed as part  of the operating business which should  be taken into consideration when  measuring performance. TCF is  a core FCA principle, which promotes  fair treatment of clients from product  inception through to marketing and  post‑ sales support. These  meetings allow us to question and  challenge companies on the issues we  think may affect their long‑ term value. The content of these meetings  varies but can include strategy, board  effectiveness, remuneration, shareholder  rights, culture, values, succession planning  and sustainability. This outlines reforms to  make competition work better, including  greater fee transparency and a focus  on creating value for clients. Our office in Hong Kong,  where renewable tariffs are not  available, purchased internationally  recognised I‑ RECS, using Chinese wind  power to offset the electrical KW/h  usage. The new remuneration  policy introduces a number of best  practice features for Executive Director  pay which reflects feedback received  from shareholders and investor bodies. Previous appointments Edward joined Jupiter in 1994 as a UK fund  manager, after working at Schroders (1982 ‑ 1986)  and Electra Investment Trust (1986‑ 1994). Previous appointments Charlotte commenced her career at Ernst & Young  where she progressed to be an audit Partner in  the Financial Services Practice. Previous appointments Jonathon was a founding Partner of Actis LLP,  the emerging markets specialist alternatives fund  manager, where he spent over ten years. Six scheduled Board meetings  took place during the year, with an  additional meeting off‑ site in June for  a two day discussion of strategy related  matters. I am grateful to all the shareholders and  investor bodies who have continued their  positive engagement with Jupiter  throughout 2017. Introducing capped incentives Our current policy contains no limits on  the amounts that individual Executive  Directors can be awarded under  incentive schemes. Benefits are also offered on a consistent  basis – for example, the level of employer  pension contributions is 15% of base salary  for Executive Directors and all UK  employees and other benefits, such as  private medical insurance, are offered to  all UK employees on the same terms. N/A 68 Governance REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures LTIP Provides long‑ term reward with awards  made on an annual basis. SERVICE AGREEMENTS POLICY  The policy terms and effective dates of the current Executive Directors’ service agreements are summarised below:  Provision Details Term Not fixed  Notice period Six months’ written notice from either party, during which period salary and benefits will  be provided but no contractual entitlement to any bonus payment will accrue or arise. Employees with registered  pension protection or those impacted by the Tapered Annual Allowance may elect to have some or all of their pension contributions paid instead as a cash allowance, after  deducting an amount equal to the cost of employer national insurance on such cash payments. Results  were strong, with a 78% response rate  and an overall engagement score of  87%, 11 points above the financial  services average. Continued  progress was made on the acquisition of talent, including fund managers and key functional roles to support  Jupiter’s future success. The Company has recruited a number of fund managers to  manage new investment strategies including Asian Income  and Emerging Market Debt. Additionally, John continues to be employed by Jupiter in his  role as Head of Strategy for the Independent Funds Team. Where  performance measures produce an outcome which does not align with that of stakeholders, the Committee may exercise its  discretion as it considers appropriate. Given the longer time horizon over  which LTIP assesses performance, both a three and five year outperformance measure is included. This is  demonstrated through a variety of reward  features and processes that ensure  alignment to risk considerations  throughout the organisation. 3 Maarten Slendebroek has two separate LTIP awards included in the 2016 single figure, both of which had performance periods ending during that financial year. 4 Maarten Slendebroek has two separate LTIP awards included in the 2017 single figure, both of which had performance periods ending during that financial year. Management monitors operating earnings, a non‑ GAAP measure (see page 31), for the purpose of making decisions about  resource allocation and performance assessment. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected  from its use. Trade and other receivables, including loans to employees, are included in current assets except where they have maturities  greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. Therefore, at  each month end, receivables are low as we have already collected amounts due from the majority of our clients. Institutional debtors rarely default, given that the Group manages assets worth many multiples of any outstanding fees on  behalf of those clients, although it should be noted that the Group is not generally permitted to remove cash from managed  segregated mandates in order to receive settlement. For those in our  testing sample not administered by HSBC or JP Morgan, we  obtained supporting external evidence over AUM. Management have modelled the fair value less costs to sell  approach under IAS 36 by using a discounted cash flow  model. The impairment review requires a number of significant  estimates to be made by management such as forecasts and  discount rates.
