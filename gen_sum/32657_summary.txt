But we’re not just about soft drinks – with the addition of FUNKIN we have moved into the cocktail mixer segment, broadening and strengthening our portfolio with a unique and exciting market leading brand in a growing market. We do not believe that the repurchase programme will have any material impact on our ability to secure acquisition opportunities should these be identiﬁed. Operating across multiple routes to market, we have a well established and e§cient distribution network, with our Direct Store Delivery channel in particular setting us apart, by oŽering a tailored and personal service to thousands of independent retailers across the UK. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 We are a growth driven, branded consumer goods business, delivering long-term sustainable value. In contrast, the carbonates sector experienced modest inﬂation, growing value by just over 1% versus a ﬂat volume position. In March 2017 we announced our intention to meet consumers’ changing tastes and preferences with a number of further signiﬁcant portfolio developments. IRN-BRU and Rubicon in particular exit the full year with strong momentum based on positive brand fundamentals. The Snapple brand has enjoyed growth of over 20% across 2016/17, with signiﬁcant product innovation, packaging advancements Chief Executive’s Review continued 11 A.G. BARR p.l.c. We are operating from a well-invested and sustainable asset base, with our new organisational structures established to support growth. EBITDA (deﬁned as proﬁt on ordinary activities before tax less exceptional items, adding back interest, depreciation, amortisation and impairment) divided by revenue. Net cash ﬂow excluding the movements in borrowings, expansionary capex, shares, dividend payments and non-cash exceptional items. Supported by a national TV advertising campaign, Rubicon Spring has sold more than 7.6 million bottles since its launch. IRN-BRU, Rubicon and Funkin in particular exit the full year with strong momentum based on positive brand fundamentals. This signiﬁcant investment also oŽers exciting opportunities to support our innovation programme and oŽer new glass formats. We believe this committed approach to growth, productivity and cash generation will drive further sustainable value creation for shareholders. This is already delivering improved customer service and will provide a solid platform for future proﬁtability. Our portfolio carbonates, including Barr Flavours, Tizer and KA have been impacted by retailer range reduction activity. This expansionary capital will deliver logistics cost savings and provide production ﬂexibility to support our innovation pipeline. The current value of sterling has created an inﬂationary pressure on our commodity cost base, primarily Euro or US dollar denominated. We do not believe that the repurchase programme will have any material impact on our ability to secure acquisition opportunities should these be identiﬁed. The Group’s internal control and risk management systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all risks and uncertainties that may arise. The Group’s ﬁnancial control environment is subject to review by both internal and external audit. In the event of employees becoming disabled every effort is made to ensure that their employment will continue. If a participant does not submit an instruction to the AESOP Trustee, no vote is registered in respect of those shares. The Chairman also ensures that Board meetings are underpinned by a culture of openness and challenge, with su§cient time made available to debate issues arising. The Nomination Committee is required, in accordance with its terms of reference, to meet at least once per year. The Board has a schedule of matters that are brought to it, or its duly authorised committees, for decision, aimed at maintaining eŽective control over strategic, ﬁnancial, operational and compliance issues. Financial reporting There is a comprehensive strategic planning, budgeting and forecasting system with an annual operating plan approved by the Board. KPMG Audit Plc was appointed as the Group’s external auditor in May 2009 following a competitive tender process. Salary levels are determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account a range of factors including: – role, experience and individual performance; – pay for other employees in the Group; – prevailing market conditions; and – external benchmarks for similar roles at comparable companies. Targets are set annually reﬂecting the Company’s strategy and aligned with key ﬁnancial, strategic and/ or individual objectives. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Accounts Strategic Report Corporate Governance Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures Long Term Incentive Plan 2014 (“LTIP”) continued The Remuneration Committee may at its discretion structure awards as Approved Long Term Incentive Plan (“ALTIP”) awards comprising both a HMRC tax-advantaged option granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme (“ESOS”) and an LTIP award. Executive directors are entitled to participate in a HMRC tax- advantaged all-employee Savings Related Share Option Scheme (“SAYE”) under which they make monthly savings over a period of three or ﬁve years linked to the grant of an option over the Company’s shares with an option price which can be at a discount to the market value of shares on grant. Executive directors are also entitled to participate in a HMRC tax- advantaged All-Employee Share Ownership Plan (“AESOP”). Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Accounts Strategic Report Corporate Governance Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures Retirement beneﬁts continued R.A. White’s deferred pension will be re-valued in line with RPI until his normal retirement date. Full payment or vesting will only occur for what the Remuneration Committee considers to be stretching performance. Where considered appropriate, such payments or awards will be liable to “malus” and/or “clawback” on early departure. Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial period of three years, subject to annual re-election by shareholders in accordance with the Code. Change of control Awards under the LTIP will generally vest early on a takeover, merger or other corporate reorganisation. The Company has regular contact with union bodies on matters of pay and remuneration for employees covered by collective bargaining or consultation arrangements. Employees who join this arrangement no longer pay contributions to the pension schemes but receive a lower taxable salary. No changes are proposed to the maximum annual bonus opportunity which will remain at 100% of salary.

As the group uses a standard cost as its basis of inventory valuation, changes in price and production levels lead to purchase price or manufacturing variances which, if not accounted for correctly, may lead to the valuation of inventories being misstated.

BARR p.l.c. have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union. Revenue recognition Revenue is the net invoiced sales value, after deducting promotional sales related discounts invoiced by customers, including brand support costs, and exclusive of value added tax of goods and services supplied to external customers during the year. Brands acquired separately or through a business combination are assessed at the date of acquisition as to whether they have an indefinite life. The customer relationships have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. The useful lives of all intangible assets are reviewed annually and amended, as required, on a prospective basis. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method. This includes direct labour costs and an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating activity. Profit before tax continued Included within administration costs (note 6) is the auditor’s remuneration, including expenses for audit and non-audit services. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management which cover a three year period. Sensitivity analysis was carried out on the above calculations to review possible levels of impairment after adjusting discount rates. The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. Where trade receivables are past due, an assessment is made of individual customers and the outstanding balance. Management identifies, evaluates and manages financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s business units. Under this arrangement certain property assets were transferred into the Partnership and are being leased back to A.G. BARR p.l.c under a 21 year lease agreement, generating an income stream of £1.1m per annum for the pension scheme, increasing annually in line with inflation. Shareholders will be given a binding vote on the directors’ remuneration policy at least every three years.
