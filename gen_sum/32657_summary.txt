tasting brands that people love. but we’re not just about soft drinks – with the addition of funkin we have moved into the cocktail mixer segment, broadening and strengthening our portfolio with a unique and exciting market leading brand in a growing market. this programme is anticipated to commence in the spring of 2017 and complete within 24 months. we do not believe that the repurchase programme will have any material impact on our ability to secure acquisition opportunities should these be identiﬁed. with great brands, an ežective business model, a clear strategy and a strong team in place to deliver it, the business remains well placed to develop further and realise its long-term potential. operating across multiple routes to market, we have a well established and e§cient distribution network, with our direct store delivery channel in particular setting us apart, by ožering a tailored and personal service to thousands of independent retailers across the uk. annual

the successful development and launch of rubicon spring and irn-bru xtra have contributed to our forward development plans, giving us the insight and conﬁdence to announce our intention that over 90% of company owned brands will contain less than 5g of total sugars per 100ml by the autumn of 2017. this is a signiﬁcant and positive move which supports our consumer- focused strategy, at the same time as reducing our overall exposure to regulatory changes. irn-bru and rubicon in particular exit the full year with strong momentum based on positive brand fundamentals. the snapple brand has

exclusive of value added tax of goods and services supplied to external customers during the year. an intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside of goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. brands acquired separately or through a business combination are assessed at the date of acquisition as to whether they have an indefinite life. the customer relationships have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. the useful lives of all intangible assets are reviewed annually and amended, as required, on a prospective basis. depreciation is charged from the date that assets, other than land, are available for use. the corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other long term payables. annual report and accounts 2017 accounts strategic report corporate governance a previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised although any reversal cannot result in a carrying amount that would exceed the carrying amount that would have been recognised, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years. subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. when a trade receivable becomes uncollectable it is written off against the bad debt provision. subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method. this includes direct labour costs and an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating activity. where the carrying value of an asset is to be recovered through both use and subsequent disposal, a single tax base is attributed to that asset resulting in a single temporary difference being recognised. typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. annual report and accounts 2017 accounts strategic report corporate governance “other” segments represent income from the sale of funkin cocktail solutions, the sale of ice cream and other soft drink related items. these periods have been reviewed at the statement of financial position date and remain appropriate. these calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management which cover a three year period. sensitivity analysis was carried out on the above calculations to review possible levels of impairment after adjusting discount rates. annual report and accounts 2017 accounts strategic report corporate governance 16. derivative financial instruments group and company fair value hierarchy ifrs 7 requires all financial instruments carried at fair value to be analysed under the following levels: level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. where trade receivables are past due, an assessment is made of individual customers and the outstanding balance. risk management is carried out in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors. management identifies, evaluates and manages financial risks in close co-operation with the group’s business units. the treasury committee assesses whether hedge accounting should be applied for each forward option contract. “own use” contracts do not require accounting entries until the commodity purchase actually crystallises. cash flow and fair value interest rate risk as the group has no significant interest-bearing assets, the group’s income and operating cash inflows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates. individual risk limits are set by the management committee based on internal or external ratings. under this arrangement certain property assets were transferred into the partnership and are being leased back to a.g. barr p.l.c under a 21 year lease agreement, generating an income stream of £1.1m per annum for the pension scheme, increasing annually in line with inflation. annual report and accounts 2017 accounts strategic report corporate governance mortality
