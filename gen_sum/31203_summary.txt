We remain focused on serving the needs of consumers who are unable or unwilling to borrow from mainstream institutions through three distinct business divisions: branch- based lending, home credit and guarantor loans. We delivered strong loan book growth in all three business divisions whilst the overall rate of impairment declined. In addition, my three executive colleagues visited our front-line operations on a regular and sometimes weekly basis. We also welcome their recent High-Cost Credit Review Update in which they note: “Consumers can benefit from using high-cost credit where repayments are sustainable and appropriate forbearance is shown if they have temporary repayment problems.” 1 Whilst supportive of the FCA’s objectives, we believe that any potential gains from additional regulation must always be measured against the cost of achieving them. We are pleased that the FCA appears to have no major concerns regarding branch-based lending or guarantor loans. However, we do not believe it has provided any clear evidence that such harm or detriment exists in the home credit market. Niall has brought a wealth of experience from his time at HSBC, Household and more recently Co-operative Bank where he was CEO until December 2016. Loans at Home is the third largest home credit operator in the UK and each of our 1,000 self- employed agents is out seeing their customers every week, chatting about their lives, making sure they are on-track and, importantly, that nothing has changed that we need to know about.

With strong market positions in each of our chosen segments, a clear plan for growth and long- term funding in place, we remain confident in the full year outlook and are pleased to recommend a final dividend of 1.70p per share making 2.20p for the year as a whole (2016: 1.2p), an increase of 83% over the prior year.” John van Kuffeler Group Chief Executive Key performance indicators Year ended 31 Dec 17 Normalised 7 Branch- based lending Home credit Guarantor Loans Loan book growth 21.3% 53.3% 35.4% Revenue yield 8 45.8% 147.0% 35.8% Risk adjusted margin 9 37.0% 101.3% 30.3% Impairments/revenue 19.1% 31.1% 15.3% Impairments/average net loan book 8.8% 45.7% 5.5% Operating profit margin 37.2% 6.1% 37.3% Return on assets 10 17.0% 9.1% 13.4% 7 Excluding fair value adjustments, the amortisation of acquired intangibles and exceptional items. Acquisition of George Banco Branch-based lending Our largest business, Everyday Loans, delivered an outstanding performance with a particularly strong second half driven by increased loan volumes, higher yield and lower impairment. This resulted in us being approached by large numbers of self- employed agents and management staff that were keen to join Loans at Home. Regulation With each of our three business divisions now fully authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’), we believe we have established a constructive dialogue with the regulator at both an operational as well as at a more strategic level. Much of this research was used to support proposals in the creditworthiness and affordability consultation also issued on 31 July 2017 (see above). The document describes how authorisation is a tool, primarily to prevent harm from occurring, by ensuring that all regulated firms and individuals meet common sets of minimum standards.

George Banco was acquired on 17 August 2017 and (together with TrustTwo) represented c.19% of the Group’s total loan book in 2017 (before fair value adjustments). Group 2017 full year results The reported Group results for the year ended 31 December 2017 include a full period of Everyday Loans (including TrustTwo), that was acquired on 13 April 2016, and approximately four and a half months’ performance of George Banco that was acquired on 17 August 2017.

Neither the 2017 or 2016 pro forma results include any contribution from George Banco prior to its acquisition on 17 August 2017. Operational improvements – the introduction of eSignature and Faster Payments during 2017 helped us improve our service to customers through more timely execution. Impairments increased to £11.7m (2016: £8.1m) but fell as a percentage of revenue, reflecting our continued focus on quality underwriting and collections. The increased number of customers taking out larger, longer-term loans meant that revenue yield reduced slightly to 147%. Marc Howells, the CEO of George Banco, was appointed Managing Director of the newly named Guarantor Loans Division that now has a clearly defined management structure and in its first few months as a combined business has delivered strong growth in loan book, revenue and profit. As a result, the Board was comfortable that all three businesses were guided by similar principles of business ethics. As a business we wholeheartedly subscribe to Peter Drucker’s sentiment that “culture eats strategy for breakfast”. Online training programmes provide us with a perfect audit trail for each participant, providing analysis on which modules have been completed and the achievement level attained. Prior to Palamon Capital Partners LLP, Miles spent seven years as a Director in the Leveraged Finance Department of HSBC Investment Bank. She began her early career in financial communications and investor relations before joining ABN Amro as a sell-side analyst. We continued to engage with our investors through a comprehensive programme of investor relations including one-on-one meetings, conference calls, analyst visits and an investor day held in London in November 2017 , during which analysts and investors received an in-depth review from the senior management of all three business divisions. Non- Executive Directors have been appointed for fixed periods of three years, subject to confirmation by shareholders. Intangible assets must also be recognised at fair value if they are separable or arise from other contractual rights. A key theme for the Committee has been to ensure that appropriate risk management strategies are monitored and implemented effectively. The Group has delivered strong loan book growth in each of its three businesses whilst maintaining a tight control on impairment. Our new Directors’ Remuneration Policy As noted above, it is proposed that Mr Cresswell-Turner will participate in the ELG LTI. The business has developed rapidly since it was incorporated as a small start-up cash shell and especially in 2017 . Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview Strategic Report Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 67 The Committee has determined that Mr Cresswell-Turner’s maximum bonus potential for 2018 will remain at 100% of salary but the performance measures should include financial and non-financial targets in relation to ELG. Mr Cresswell-Turner must hold any NSF shares acquired for a further one year before being able to sell them. Performance targets will be set annually by the Committee based on a range of interdependent financial and non-financial measures. Financial targets govern the majority of bonus payments, which may include those related to profit before tax. Shareholding guidelines To ensure that Executive Directors’ interests are aligned with those of shareholders over a longer time horizon. Shares included in this calculation are those held beneficially by the Executive Director and their spouse/ life partner. Non-Executive Directors are reimbursed for all reasonable travelling and subsistence expenses (including any relevant tax) incurred in carrying out their duties.

Dilution The Company funds its share incentives through a combination of new issue and market purchased shares. It is expected that additional programmes aimed at enhancing employee engagement further will be developed as the Group expands. As noted on page 53, the Group has started to capture some environmental data and will provide further updates in future reports. Key observations We found management’s approach for the goodwill impairment assessment to be compliant with IAS 36. We challenged management’s assumptions in respect of cash flow estimates by comparing to underlying data sources and benchmarks. Adjusted pre-tax profit is before fair value adjustments, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, and exceptional items as described in the financial statements. Adjusted pre-tax profit is before fair value adjustments, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and exceptional items as described in the financial statements. Provisions are calculated based on an unbiased probability-weighted outcome which takes into account historic performance and considers the outlook for macro-economic conditions. This was included within impairment in the 2016 Annual Report, however has now been shown separately for comparative purposes. Intangible assets also include acquired intangibles in respect of the customer list, broker relationships, and brand at George Banco. The Directors assess on an ongoing basis whether there is objective evidence that customer receivables are impaired at each balance sheet date. All assumptions are reviewed regularly to take account of differences between previously estimated cash flows on impaired debt and the eventual losses. Amounts receivable from customers The Group reviews its portfolio of loans and receivables for impairment at each balance sheet date. All assumptions are reviewed regularly to take account of differences between previously estimated cash flows on impaired debt and the eventual losses. Transaction costs of £nil (2016: £7 ,131,000) directly relating to raising finance have been deducted from share premium in the year. The Group has in place sufficient long-term committed debt facilities which are sourced from a number of different providers. Cash and covenant forecasting is conducted on a monthly basis as part of the regular management reporting exercise.
