who are unable or unwilling to borrow from mainstream institutions through three distinct business divisions: branch- based lending, home credit and guarantor loans. we delivered strong loan book growth in all three business divisions whilst the overall rate of impairment declined. in addition, my three executive colleagues visited our front-line operations on a regular and sometimes weekly basis. we also welcome their recent high-cost credit review update in which they note: “consumers can benefit from using high-cost credit where repayments are sustainable and appropriate forbearance is shown if they have temporary repayment problems.” 1 whilst supportive of the fca’s objectives, we believe that any potential gains from additional regulation must always be measured against the cost of achieving them. we are pleased that the fca appears to have no major concerns regarding branch-based lending or guarantor loans. however, we do not believe it has provided any clear evidence that such harm or detriment exists in the home credit market. 1. high-cost credit review update – fca, 31 january 2018. non-standard finance plc annual report 2017 6 strategic report we’re changing

non-standard finance “ 2017 was a year of delivery with significant organic loan book growth whilst impairment reduced from 29% to 24% of normalised revenue. with strong market positions in each of our chosen segments, a clear plan for growth and long- term funding in place, we remain confident in the full year outlook and are pleased to recommend a final dividend of 1.70p per share making 2.20p

driven by increased loan volumes, higher yield and lower impairment. earnings enhancing in first full year the acquisition remains on-track to deliver incremental earnings in 2018. strong growth potential the uk’s guarantor loans market is growing strongly and we intend to increase our market share. in home credit, we recruited over 440 experienced self-employed agents taking our total number to over 1,000. such expansion required significant investment in training and incentives that are focused on rewarding both financial results and the delivery of good customer outcomes. 3. acting responsibly as noted in the chairman’s statement on pages 4 to 5, how we behave as a business is not just defined by prevailing laws or regulations but also by our culture or ‘how we do things around here’. regulation with each of our three business divisions now fully authorised by the financial conduct authority (‘fca’), we believe we have established a constructive dialogue with the regulator at both an operational as well as at a more strategic level. • the fca published ‘occasional paper no.28 – preventing financial distress by predicting unaffordable consumer credit agreements: an applied framework’. much of this research was used to support proposals in the creditworthiness and affordability consultation also issued on 31 july 2017 (see above). july 2017 continued • the fca published a consultation on staff incentives, remuneration and performance management in consumer credit. the document describes how authorisation is a tool, primarily to prevent harm from occurring, by ensuring that all regulated firms and individuals meet common sets of minimum standards. branch-based lending 1 >4.5/5 branch-based lending 1 2016: 4.8/5 4.8/5 home credit 2 >95% home credit 2

a % of revenue lending is easy, but lending profitably is more difficult – this measure helps us balance annual loan book growth and short-term profitability. grow too quickly, or lend when you shouldn’t, and impairment will increase to unacceptable levels. note that these targets will change following the adoption of ifrs 9 (see financial review on page 39). branch-based lending <1%

banco was acquired on 17 august 2017 and (together with trusttwo) represented c.19% of the group’s total loan book in 2017 (before fair value adjustments). non-standard finance plc annual report 2017 38 risk/definition mitigation change in 2017 explanation liquidity the group may not be able to meet its financial obligations because it: • is unable to borrow to fund lending by its operating businesses • has failed to renew/replace existing debt facilities as they become payable • cannot fund growth and further acquisitions • the group’s short-term loans to customers provide a natural hedge against medium-term borrowings • the group successfully refinanced all of its bank facilities in august 2017 and raised additional long-term debt funding from a range of different providers • the new £225m loan facility is for six years and is supplemented by a £35m revolving credit facility • cash and covenant forecasting is conducted on a monthly basis as part of the regular management reporting exercise with net debt of c.£197m and total debt facilities of £260m at 31 december 2017 , the group has sufficient headroom on its existing facilities to fund the group’s growth plans in 2018. reputational lending money at high rates of interest means that consumer finance can attract a higher level of media and political scrutiny than certain other business sectors. this in turn could have an impact on the group ’s operational or financial performance. group 2017 full year results the reported group results for the year ended 31 december 2017 include a full period of everyday loans (including trusttwo), that was acquired on 13 april 2016, and approximately four and a half months’ performance of george banco that was acquired on 17 august 2017. the prior year reported figure included approximately eight months’ performance from everyday loans (including trusttwo). nick teunon chief financial officer financial summary year ended 31 december 2017 normalised before

introduction of esignature and faster payments during 2017 helped us improve our service to customers through more timely execution. impairments increased to £11.7m (2016: £8.1m) but fell as a percentage of revenue, reflecting our continued focus on quality underwriting and collections. active lead management by channel – with over one million leads processed in 2017, we are actively reviewing all acquisition channels in order to ensure we maintain lead quality as well as volume and also manage carefully our customer acquisition costs. we rolled-out our collections app for agents in february 2017 and our lending app became fully operational during the fourth quarter of 2017. both have been well-received by agents, removing the need for a paper-based process. the increased number of customers taking out larger, longer-term loans meant that revenue yield reduced slightly to 147%. selectively expanding our network – we will look to add more agents and field staff but only on a highly selective basis to ensure that any additions are profitable in 2018. continuing to improve the quality of our customer base – whilst we believe that there remains a significant opportunity for loan book growth, we are determined that this will not be at the expense of quality. marc howells, the ceo of george banco, was appointed managing director of the newly named guarantor loans division that now has a clearly defined management structure and in its first few months as a combined business has delivered strong growth in loan book, revenue and profit. in particular, the differential in pricing between george banco and trusttwo lifted revenue yield and also drove risk adjusted margin, which was over 30% in 2017. rates of impairment remained within our target range and while return on asset is below our target of 20%, we remain confident that this can be reached as the business continues to grow strongly. we are developing this capability in parallel with our move to a single loan management platform. guarantor loans continued divisional overview non-standard finance plc annual report 2017 49 corporate governance financial statements strategic report overview

culture before our ipo back in february 2015, we set ourselves a vision of becoming a leading participant in the uk’s non- standard finance sector. however, leadership is something that cannot just be attained and then left to drift. by fostering the right cultural values and overall business approach we plan to do both. as a business we wholeheartedly subscribe to peter drucker’s sentiment that “culture eats strategy for breakfast”. whilst there are some subtle differences between each division, it is clear that as a group we share a common business approach, founded upon the following key values and behaviours: • doing the right thing: we recognise our collective responsibility for delivering great outcomes – not just for our customers but also taking into account the impact on other stakeholders. online training programmes provide us with a perfect audit trail for each participant, providing analysis on which modules have been completed and the achievement level attained. whilst the introduction of a pro bono scheme to enable our staff to give up some of their time during office hours for good causes was delayed due to other business priorities, the group did implement a group-wide charity policy in 2017, formalising a process by which we can provide financial support, not just in local communities but also nationwide. external appointments non-executive chairman of

report non-standard finance plc annual report 2017 67 the committee has determined that mr cresswell-turner’s maximum bonus potential for 2018 will remain at 100% of salary but the performance measures should include financial and non-financial targets in relation to elg. there will then be a holding period of one year for the nsf shares acquired. mr cresswell-turner must hold any nsf shares acquired for a further one year before being able to sell them. performance targets will be set annually by the committee based on a range of interdependent financial and non-financial measures. financial targets govern the majority of bonus payments, which may include those related to profit before tax. shareholding guidelines to ensure that executive directors’ interests are aligned with those of shareholders over a longer time horizon. shares included in this calculation are those held beneficially by the executive director and their spouse/ life partner. the charts
