business divisions: branch- based lending, home credit and guarantor loans. we also welcome their recent high-cost credit review update in which they note: “consumers can benefit from using high-cost credit where repayments are sustainable and appropriate forbearance is shown if they have temporary repayment problems.” 1 whilst supportive of the fca’s objectives, we believe that any potential gains from additional regulation must always be measured against the cost of achieving them. however, we do not believe it has provided any clear evidence that such harm or detriment exists in the home credit market. loans at home is the third largest home credit operator in the uk and each of our 1,000 self- employed agents is out seeing their customers every week, chatting about their lives, making sure they are on-track and, importantly, that nothing has changed that we need to know about. having an impaired credit history isn’t something i felt comfortable talking about, however everyone at the branch was fantastic and they never judged me. non-standard finance plc annual report 2017 20 18.4% proportion of total jobs that are deemed to be low-paid jobs 2 15% of the uk
