These movements in the carrying value of capacity have no impact on cash flow. There remains a risk to the implementation of our strategy if suitable vehicles are not available at attractive prices. Participations on weaker syndicates in acquired portfolios are sold to maintain the overall quality. Helios Underwriting plc — Annual report and financial statements 2017 8 Reinsurance quota share The use of quota share reinsurance to provide access to the Lloyd’s underwriting exposures for reinsurers and private capital has been expanded. Capacity on underwriting years after 18 months of development is substantially “off risk” as the underlying insurance contracts have mostly expired.

Helios portfolio aggregates include all vehicles acquired prior to the declared result for each year of account. Helios 2012–2015: Results at 36 months calculated from distribution files excluding any movement for run-off years. The largest losses were three major category four plus hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) which Swiss Re estimates will cost around $92bn with claims from the Caribbean Islands, Puerto Rico, Texas and parts of western Florida. Supply of capital still at all time highs Despite the hurricane losses at year end 2017 global reinsurer capital again reached a record high, according to Aon Benfield, of $605bn increasing by 2% on year end 2016. Increasing broker power is a symptom of the soft market as are acquisition costs. Despite this, AM Best reports that it expects US companies to release $4.6bn from reserves in 2017. The last period when US companies were boosting reserves declaring prior years’ losses was 2000 to 2005. (c) An adjustment is made to exclude pre-acquisition profits on companies bought in the year.

The Company participates in insurance business as an underwriting member at Lloyd’s through its subsidiary undertakings. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. • Amendments to IFRS 2: Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions, issued on 20 June 2016 (effective 1 January 2018). • Amendments to IAS 19: Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement, issued on 7 February 2017, (effective date 1 January 2019). No income statement is presented for Helios Underwriting plc as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. Certain supported syndicates have non-sterling functional currencies and any exchange movement that they would have reflected in other comprehensive income as a result of this has been included within profit before tax at consolidation level, to be consistent with the Group’s policy of using sterling as the functional currency. Each syndicate uses a number of statistical techniques to assist in making these estimates. In addition, the nature of short-tail risks, such as property where claims are typically notified and settled within a short period of time, will normally have less uncertainty after a few years than long-tail risks, such as some liability business where it may be several years before claims are fully advised and settled. The provision for unexpired risks is calculated separately by reference to classes of business that are managed together, after taking into account relevant investment return. Intangible assets: syndicate capacity Syndicate capacity is an intangible asset which represents costs incurred in the Corporation of Lloyd’s auctions in order to acquire rights to participate on syndicates’ years of account. It has an indefinite useful life and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment. Information about these financial assets is provided internally on a fair value basis to the Group’s key management. They are classified as current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting period. These are classified as current liabilities, unless payment is not due within 12 months after the reporting date. Risk background The syndicates’ activities expose them to a variety of financial and non-financial risks. The Group also manages its exposure to insurance risk by purchasing appropriate member level reinsurance. Although there are usually no stated maturities for claims outstanding, syndicates have provided their expected maturity of future claims settlements as follows: 2017 No stated maturity £’000 0–1 year £’000 1–3 years £’000 3–5 years £’000 >5 years £’000 Total £’000 Claims outstanding 132 21,004 22,546 8,192 7,959 59,833 2016 No stated maturity £’000 0–1 year £’000 1–3 years £’000 3–5 years £’000 >5 years £’000 Total £’000 Claims outstanding (30) 16,590 18,746 7,313 7,469 50,087 (ii) Credit risk Credit ratings to syndicate assets (Note 27) emerging directly from insurance activities which are neither past due nor impaired are as follows: 2017 AAA £’000 AA £’000 A £’000 BBB or lower £’000 Not rated £’000 Total £’000 Financial investments 6,245 10,294 11,104 5,262 4,675 37,580 Deposits with ceding undertakings — — — — 5 5 Reinsurers’ share of claims outstanding 56 3,242 9,867 239 1,304 14,708 Reinsurance debtors — 92 468 8 151 719 Cash at bank and in hand 318 143 1,051 234 20 1,766 6,619 13,771 22,490 5,743 6,155 54,778 2016 AAA £’000 AA £’000 A £’000 BBB or lower £’000 Not rated £’000 Total £’000 Financial investments 6,759 11,734 10,416 5,141 4,262 38,312 Deposits with ceding undertakings — — — — 5 5 Reinsurers’ share of claims outstanding (157) 2,576 6,325 125 289 9,158 Reinsurance debtors 78 154 270 20 16 538 Cash at bank and in hand 1 580 1,301 280 1 2,163 6,681 15,044 18,312 5,566 4,573 50,176 Syndicate assets (Note 27) emerging directly from insurance activities, with reference to their due date or impaired, are as follows: Past due but not impaired 2017 Neither past due nor impaired £’000 Less than 6 months £’000 Between 6 months and 1 year £’000 Greater than 1 year £’000 Impaired £’000 Total £’000 Financial investments 37,580 — — — — 37,580 Deposits with ceding undertakings 5 — — — — 5 Reinsurers’ share of claims outstanding 14,708 133 — — (5) 14,836 Reinsurance debtors 719 157 20 15 — 911 Cash at bank and in hand 1,766 — — — — 1,766 Insurance and other debtors 26,205 573 154 271 (5) 27,198 80,983 863 174 286 (10) 82,296 Annual report and financial statements 2017 — Helios Underwriting plc 37 Financial statements 4.

To mitigate this, the surplus Group funds are deposited with highly rated banks and fund managers. The Group does not use derivative instruments to manage risk and, as such, no hedge accounting is applied.
