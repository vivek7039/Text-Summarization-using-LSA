improve the prospects for underwriting profits lower capacity auction prices in 2017 will allow more effective use of available helios funds. capacity on underwriting years after 18 months of development is substantially “off risk” as the underlying insurance contracts have mostly expired. 10.0 11.0 28.6 30.2 20.2 21.6 14.1 14.2 risk management helios continues to ensure that the portfolio

positive rate increases in most classes of business the underwriting results of the helios portfolio of syndicates have consistently outperformed the lloyd’s market average both on an annually accounted basis measured by combined ratio and on a three-year account basis, measured by return on underwriting capacity. however, lloyd’s acquisition costs and administrative expenses as a percentage of net premium reduced marginally to 39% in 2017 compared with 40% in 2016. the start point for lloyd’s is challenging with the 2017 combined ratio excluding prior year releases and major losses being only marginally profitable at 98.4%. certain supported syndicates have non-sterling functional currencies and any exchange movement that they would have reflected in other comprehensive income as a result of this has been included within profit before tax at consolidation level, to be consistent with the group’s policy of using sterling as the functional currency. in addition, the nature of short-tail risks, such as property where claims are typically notified and settled within a short period of time, will normally have less uncertainty after a few years than long-tail risks, such as some liability business where it may be several years before claims are fully advised and settled. the provision for unexpired risks is calculated separately by reference to classes of business that are managed together, after taking into account relevant investment return. information about these financial assets is provided internally on a fair value basis to the group’s key management. although there are usually no stated maturities for claims outstanding, syndicates have provided their expected maturity of future claims settlements as follows: 2017 no stated maturity
