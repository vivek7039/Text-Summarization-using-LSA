Added three new air conditioned outlets at two all-inclusive properties in response to customer feedback. Signed sales and marketing agreement for The Landings in St Lucia 9 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE INFORMATION T he rebased market has meant that it has been necessary for us to discount rates at certain of our properties on a targeted and tactical basis. This partially reflects the success of Waves Hotel & Spa, which contributed strongly to occupancy but had a lower average rate, especially in H1. Over the high demand periods, our specialised US-based revenue team continues to be disciplined and cautious with discounting, leveraging both the Group’s excellent relationships with tour operators as well as its scale and its substantial share of available luxury rooms in Barbados. These steps interplay to find the best combination of physical structure (refurbish), guest experience (reposition) and yield management (reprice).

As such, the Group operates a robust framework for identifying risks, assessing their impact, and putting in place appropriate mitigating actions with clearly identified risk owners. 3 Where management is not comfortable with residual risk, identification of additional mitigating activities or controls required. Despite weakness in Sterling, this risk is largely unchanged from the prior year Day-to- day operational excellence Read more about our strategy on pages 7 to 9 Increase in competition 2 The Group operates in a competitive market and competes with a variety of operators of varying sizes and operational standards, including international hotel chains, regional and local site operators. This includes longer-term weakness in Sterling leading to a perception of higher prices by UK customers, and transactional currency risk. Day-to- day operational excellence Read more about our strategy on pages 7 to 9 Health and safety impacts 5 Disease outbreaks may make Barbados and/or the wider Caribbean less attractive as a destination for international guests. Even if not a significant health threat, disease outbreaks can generate negative publicity that may affect pricing and demand for hotels.

SIMON SHERWOOD Non-Executive Chairman N JEFF SINGLETON Chief Financial Officer SUNIL CHATRANI Chief Executive Officer STEVE BALDWIN Senior Non-Executive Director A* R N* 24 ELEGANT HOTELS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017 BOARD OF DIRECTORS Luke joined the Elegant Hotels Group in 2017 and brings with him a wealth of leisure industry knowledge and a track record of helping companies achieve their growth plans. Previous chairmanships have included Channel 4 Television Corporation, PizzaExpress, Royal Society of Arts and Giraffe Restaurants. Non-Executive Directors who have served longer than nine years should be subject to annual re-election. Simon Sherwood, Sunil Chatrani, Steve Baldwin and David Adams are due for re-election at the 2019 Annual General Meeting. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The Board requires Directors to declare all appointments or other matters which could result in a possible conflict of interest and has adopted appropriate processes to manage and, if appropriate, approve any such conflict. This assessment was prepared by management and included sensitivity analysis to account for potential changes in circumstances from the underlying assumptions. The Group’s internal control framework is intended to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material financial misstatement or loss. KPMG were considered independent in relation to this work as no accounting judgement was involved. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN AND SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS POLICY The Chairman, Executive Directors and senior managers receive remuneration in the form of equity– settled share–based payments (long-term incentive plans), whereby they provide services in exchange for options over shares. In July 2017, share option awards were issued to the Chairman, Executive Directors and senior management. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Subjective valuation: The assets and liabilities acquired are required to be measured at their acquisition-date fair values. For the residual components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these. Based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the other information. A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/ auditorsresponsibilities.

The deferred tax relates to buildings acquired through that business combination for which there is no recognition exemption. In addition, the Directors have made a restatement to gross up the prior year deferred tax balances by $574k, a reclassification of liabilities out of deferred tax assets, in order to correctly present their position. The impact on both basic and diluted EPS is a reduction from 15.5 to 11.0 cents per share. Management has reviewed IFRS 16 and does not believe it will have a material impact on the Group. SEGMENT REPORTING An operating segment is a component of the Elegant Hotels Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses; whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance; and for which discrete financial information is available. Depreciation on assets under construction does not commence until they are complete and available for use. The website has been assessed as an asset with a finite life of three years. All other non-current assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. Future cash flows are determined with reference to the Group’s own projections using pre-tax discount rates. Other Items specifically considered but not deemed relevant related to customer lists, brand name and intellectual property. 49 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE INFORMATION 4.
