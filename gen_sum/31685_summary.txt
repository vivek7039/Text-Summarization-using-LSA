review, up from 25% a year earlier. we saw slightly higher sales activity throughout the year in relation to both of our key products, quantum vs and vecta. electronic data processing plc annual report and accounts 2017 4 “ quantum vs is a comprehensive erp application, which addresses a focussed number of verticals within the distribution sector.” strategy continued vecta is an extremely powerful combined crm and bi product which drives sales growth for businesses in a range of verticals much wider than those addressed by quantum vs. our strategy remains to exploit the space between the major crm products, which typically do not deliver sales analysis as standard, and pure bi tools. contracts for erp applications can be either in the form of traditional on-site licencing arrangements or hosted service level agreements. the recurring revenue model gives us good visibility of revenues and strong cash flows as charges are mainly invoiced annually in advance. any damage or interruption to edp’s networks, however caused, could have a material adverse effect on the delivery of our products and services. detailed monthly management accounts are prepared on a timely basis comparing actual performance of the group with budget and prior year. with regard to the maximum bonus that could have been awarded in 2017, this is not set by individual executive director. similarly, the directors make a judgement as to whether certain services provided under its hosting agreements, for instance system configuration and database preparation, are separate components for which revenue can be recognised upfront at a point in time when the obligation is deemed to have been fulfilled. all other group sales to overseas customers are denominated in sterling and therefore they do not present a foreign currency risk. 45 governance notice of meeting strategic report electronic data processing plc annual report and accounts 2017 financial statements 21. employee benefits
