As previously reported, we sold our remaining surplus freehold property for £1.2 million in December 2016. The Company will update shareholders further when it is in a position to do so. Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 3 Governance Notice of meeting Strategic report Financial statements Chief Executive’s Statement Julian Wassell Revenue for the year was up 3% at £5.11 million compared with £4.96 million the year before. We saw slightly higher sales activity throughout the year in relation to both of our key products, Quantum VS and Vecta, and also increased levels of professional services activity, for which credit should go to our professional services team. Because of the high margin nature of the business (our gross margin is typically over 90%), this increase in turnover had a significant impact on our underlying operating profitability, which increased 26% to £540,000 from £430,000 a year earlier. The fact that we offer our products into a variety of industry verticals within the distribution sector, provides our business with a good degree of resilience as we are not overly reliant on any one sector. Last year hit yet another record as 61% of our revenues were delivered using the hosting model. At 30 September 2017, we had signed 48 customers for Quantum VS compared to 40 a year earlier. Our combined CRM and Business Intelligence (BI) product Vecta generated 28% of total revenues during the period under review, up from 25% a year earlier. We saw slightly higher sales activity throughout the year in relation to both of our key products, Quantum VS and Vecta. Last year hit yet another record as 61% of our revenues were delivered using the hosting model. Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 4 “ Quantum VS is a comprehensive ERP application, which addresses a focussed number of verticals within the distribution sector.” Strategy continued Vecta is an extremely powerful combined CRM and BI product which drives sales growth for businesses in a range of verticals much wider than those addressed by Quantum VS. Our strategy remains to exploit the space between the major CRM products, which typically do not deliver sales analysis as standard, and pure BI tools. Contracts for ERP applications can be either in the form of traditional on-site licencing arrangements or hosted service level agreements. The recurring revenue model gives us good visibility of revenues and strong cash flows as charges are mainly invoiced annually in advance. Adjusted operating margin is calculated using operating profit excluding one-off property costs, certain non-cash IFRS adjustments relating to defined benefit pension scheme charges, holiday pay accruals and capitalisation/ amortisation of development costs and other exceptional non-trading items. Our computer network may be vulnerable to unauthorised access, viruses and other disruptive problems. Any damage or interruption to EDP’s networks, however caused, could have a material adverse effect on the delivery of our products and services. Furthermore, the uncertainties caused by Brexit could have a significant impact on discretionary capital expenditure decisions including IT projects. This figure includes three Executive and two Non-Executive Directors, all of whom are male. • We are dedicated to creating value for shareholders by performing in a manner which will enhance return on investment. The Group does not have any other significant environmental, employee, social, community or human rights issues.

The Group’s auditors, KPMG LLP, and their legacy predecessors, have been in place since 1965. It has concluded that currently there is no requirement to conduct a tender process.

With regard to the maximum bonus that could have been awarded in 2017, this is not set by individual Executive Director. Based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the other information. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud or other irregularities is higher than for one resulting from error, as they may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control and may involve any area of law and regulation not just those directly affecting the financial statements.

Revenue The Group’s revenues derive from a number of sources which are described below. Revenue from new software licences, which typically run for between three and five years, is broken down into two components, namely an initial licence fee, payable upfront, and periodic charges, which are payable over the licence term. A new SLA has two separately identified fee components: an initial service charge, payable by the customer up front, and a periodic service charge, payable annually, quarterly or monthly over the contract term. Other software related revenues are mainly from the provision of professional services including implementation, training and consultancy. Other development expenditure not meeting these criteria is recognised in the income statement as incurred. Treasury shares When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, net of any tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from equity. This includes making an assessment of the fair value of the Group’s ongoing obligation to provide software and hosting support services arising from its customer contracts when determining how much revenue should be recognised over time. Similarly, the Directors make a judgement as to whether certain services provided under its hosting agreements, for instance system configuration and database preparation, are separate components for which revenue can be recognised upfront at a point in time when the obligation is deemed to have been fulfilled. The Group is not exposed through a significant volume of sales transactions with any single customer. The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing surplus cash in recognised UK-based banks. As these revenues represent approximately 2% of total turnover, the Group does not enter into any hedging transactions. All other Group sales to overseas customers are denominated in sterling and therefore they do not present a foreign currency risk. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements. The Directors are currently reviewing the Company’s standard software licences in accordance with the new guidance to determine whether they provide a right to use its intellectual property (where revenue is recognised at a point in time) or a right to access its intellectual property (where revenue is recognised over time).

Deferred income This represents the portion of annual licence fees, hosting charges and maintenance contracts taken out by customers but which relate to a future period. This would detrimentally impact the balance sheet position and may give rise to increased charges in future income statements.
