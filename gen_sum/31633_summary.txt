in paul mcdonald and nick keveth, who have acted with impressive decisiveness in embedding changes within the organisation as we continue to strengthen the business. the investments we have made in recent years to broaden our protection product portfolio to support a wider range of military programmes, both in the us and in other countries, gives the board confidence that we will continue to deliver against our organic growth targets, driving long-term profitable growth and providing sustainable value for our shareholders. we are seeking acquisition targets with at least three of the following five commercial criteria: • strong brand recognition • technology which broadens our product range • expands our geographical reach • secure revenue streams or another source of profitable growth • strong management in place we also expect any acquisition to achieve the following financial criteria: • earnings per share enhancement • post-acquisition group organic growth, margins and cash conversion in line with our strategic growth objectives • return on investment exceeding our weighted cost of capital • post-acquisition net debt to ebitda will remain less than two times 10 11 avon rubber p.l.c. we work to achieve this ambition through our two market-leading businesses, avon protection and milkrite | interpuls. we see opportunities to generate further, profitable growth from our core business through a number of initiatives: • leveraging the product and customer base. we have seen with the acquisitions of argus and interpuls that strong brand positions in complementary markets provide an opportunity to accelerate multi-product sales. we see alternative ownership models and value-added services as an additional differentiator that has scope to open up a broader market. we participate in growing global markets with a large and diverse base of potential customers. fire a leading provider of thermal image camera technology and nfpa certified self-contained breathing apparatus. this range combines our mask systems with self-contained breathing apparatus (‘scba’) and powered air purifying respirators (‘papr’). our papr range has recently received the ce european safety approval enabling marketing to commence in europe. strategic imperatives • continue to grow market share of own brand sales in each region • expand pci offering into north america • expand global distribution network • expand farm services to include pulsator and tag exchange services key strengths • long-term growth market due to growing global population and demand for dairy protein and products • patented technology delivers improved on farm efficiency over the alternative competitive offerings • market leader for pulsation and cluster technology in food

2017 shareholder information financial statements strategic report governance overview how we measure our performance closing order book £34.0m +45.3% constant currency revenue growth 4.5% +5.1% adjusted ebitda margin % 22.1% +1.2% product development % of revenue 5.1% -0.7% the group uses a variety of key performance indicators and we have revised them this year to align more closely with our updated strategy and investor proposition. reason for choice provides a measure of the group’s investment in new products and processes. this is measured by the value of future revenue attaching to orders not yet fulfilled. comments on results strong order intake in the second half of the year has resulted in a closing order book of £34m providing good revenue visibility for 2018. comments on results 5.1% of revenue has been invested into new product development including the m69 aircrew mask, our deltair scba, powered air programme and expanding our pci range in milkrite | interpuls. comments on results strong organic growth from milkrite | interpuls as well as law enforcement and fire with stable constant currency revenue from military have resulted in constant currency revenue growth of 4.5%, well ahead of our 3% objective. comments on results our revenue growth and improved ebitda margin has driven a 15% increase in adjusted earnings per share. growing the law enforcement market demand from this market continues to be driven by a need to provide improved protection against growing global cbrn threats, as recently seen in several countries around the world. continuous focus on operational excellence over the last ten years we have established an efficient and flexible manufacturing operation from which to serve our global customer base. we are committed to continually improving our production processes and see opportunities for further scale efficiencies in the medium-term. farm services continue to build on the success of cluster exchange service (ces) in both us and european markets by introducing the additional pulsator exchange service (pes) and tag exchange service (tes) and marketing as a farm services portfolio, whilst becoming a key partner directly with the farm on a lease hire arrangement. this will have the effect of building a more robust and diversified business, albeit within our existing markets. the dairy market environment continues to be positive with improved milk prices and low feed costs reflected in increased farmer confidence. we also expect sales of our new powered air purifying respirator range to build momentum once niosh approvals have been obtained. annual report and accounts 2017 shareholder information financial statements strategic report governance overview craig sage managing director, milkrite | interpuls divisional review financial performance revenue increased by 17.6% to £49.4m (2016: £42.0m) due to favourable currency movements and 6.6% on a constant currency basis. latin america grew liner revenues by 29.3% on a constant currency basis reflecting market share gains in brazil. asia pacific liner revenues declined by 1% at constant currency as a result of difficult market conditions experienced in china during 2017. precision, control & intelligence sales of our pci products have benefited from increased farmer confidence resulting in higher investment spend. to increase our european capacity, we plan to open a farm services exchange centre at our albinea site in italy during 2018. during the year, we have expanded farm services with the launch of pulsator exchange in north america. the closing order book together with £26.6m of orders received post year end provides good visibility for 2018. annual report and accounts 2017 shareholder information financial statements strategic report governance overview r&d investment continued in avon protection the most significant investments have been in further developing the m69 aircrew mask, our deltair scba and mcm100 product range. in milkrite | interpuls, investment has been focused on expanding our precision, control and intelligence (pci) product range. this product, which is outside of our core cbrn and respiratory range, was primarily developed for a us navy contract which was ultimately awarded to a competitor in 2015. following review of alternative commercial opportunities for this technology, further development has been terminated in view of the limited opportunities identified to commercialise the product in the foreseeable future. the group does not undertake foreign exchange transactions for which there is no underlying exposure. the directors believe that adjusted measures provide a more useful comparison of business trends and performance. available mitigation in the form of a generic control structure, is shown by each identified risk area. all employees are encouraged to take an active role in ensuring that our working environment is a safe place to work and visit by actively reporting all safety observations, being involved in safety audits, assessments and regular training sessions. we have experienced no external environmental incidents or concerns throughout the 2017 financial year at any of our locations. the electricity, gas and water used at our uk sites is monitored on a weekly basis to spot peaks in usage. avon has employees in each of its facilities who are responsible for collecting and acting on the data. avon is fully committed to respecting the human rights of all those working with or for us. e ensuring a friendly and engaged environment that embraces worthwhile communications where innovation is encouraged. under our reward programme, employees can nominate colleagues whom they believe embody one or more of the creed values in their job performance. the 2017 albinea annual site winner, giovanni grasselli, is pictured above with paul mcdonald, chief executive officer. we communicate our strategy, performance and business priorities to all employees in a variety of ways, including through our intranet sites, email and quarterly newsletters as well as through regular employee meetings at all levels of the organisation. pictured below is the bake-off held at our melksham facility to raise money for macmillan cancer support. the scheme is based on a two year ‘work and learn’ programme designed to bring new talent into our organisation. chloe recently joined institutional stockbroker panmure gordon, as senior managing director in the corporate advisory division. in addition, there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant business risks faced by the group. the board reports formally to its shareholders in a number of ways, including regulatory news announcements or press releases in response to events or routine reporting obligations, a detailed annual report and accounts and, at the half year, an interim report. in making their assessment, the directors have taken account of the group’s net cash position (see note 22), its ability to raise new finance in most market conditions and other potential mitigating actions such as restricting dividend payments. such a system can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatements or losses. no external recruitment process was run to identify mr rennie’s successor and mr mcdonald was appointed on 15 february 2017. david evans chairman of the nomination committee 15 november 2017 david evans chairman of the nomination committee 48 49 avon rubber p.l.c. these reviews ensure a balance of objectivity, value for money and compliance with this policy. all of mr rennie’s outstanding share awards lapsed in full • paul mcdonald was appointed chief executive officer on 15 february 2017 and nick keveth was appointed chief financial officer on 1 june 2017. in accordance with our remuneration policy, annual salaries for each were set below the median level, at £300,000 and £230,000 respectively. the policy report is not subject to a shareholder vote this year but has been reproduced here for ease of reference. however, any such payment would be subject to performance conditions and a claw back on underperformance during the first two years of employment. one off bonus arrangements in order to mitigate continuity risk associated with the departure of an executive director and to recognise any extra work and responsibility carried out by the remaining executive director(s) during this period, executive directors may be awarded a one off bonus capped at one year’s base salary, payable in instalments over a defined period and subject to an adjustment factor based on the company’s total shareholder return compared to a comparator group tsr over the defined period. this is reflected in the plan’s performance conditions which are based on tsr and earnings per share (‘eps’). once the shareholding guideline is met executives are not required to retain any portion of future awards that vest. in practice there is therefore a 10% dilution limit on all schemes which the company will continue to operate within. awards under both schemes are targeted at junior management and may be supplemented by unapproved share options. both paul mcdonald and nick keveth receive a company pension contribution equal to 15% of annual salary. mr keveth has reached the lifetime allowance and his company contribution is paid as a non-pensionable salary supplement. the committee will also take care to ensure that, while meeting its contractual obligations, poor performance is not rewarded. any non-executive director who has served for more than nine years since first election is subject to annual re-election by shareholders. the company’s solicitors, tlt llp, provide advice on remuneration governance and all share plans. annual report and accounts 2017 shareholder informations financial statements strategic report governance

lewis’s contribution to the company’s success over a period of eight years, the committee exercised its discretion in accordance with the directors’ remuneration policy to determine that mr lewis was permitted to retain his 2015 and 2016 psp awards on a good leaver basis, pro-rated for service by one third and two thirds respectively. rob rennie mr rennie stepped down as chief executive officer on 15 february 2017. the remuneration he received in respect of his services as an executive director is set out in the 2017 single figure table. these monthly payments are being made subject to an obligation on mr rennie to mitigate his loss, such that the payments will either reduce or cease in the event mr rennie gains new employment or remuneration. a change of control will be deemed to have occurred if any person or persons acting in concert (as defined in the city code on takeovers and mergers) gains direct or indirect control of the company. the company does not have agreements with
