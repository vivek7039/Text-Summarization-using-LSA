Rob Rennie stepped down as Chief Executive Officer on 15 February 2017 and was replaced by Paul McDonald with immediate effect. David Evans Chairman 15 November 2017 OVERVIEW It has been a year of structural and strategic transition for the Group. We see opportunities to generate further, profitable growth from our core business through a number of initiatives: • Leveraging the product and customer base. We have seen with the acquisitions of argus and InterPuls that strong brand positions in complementary markets provide an opportunity to accelerate multi-product sales. We see alternative ownership models and value-added services as an additional differentiator that has scope to open up a broader market. This range combines our mask systems with self-contained breathing apparatus (‘SCBA’) and powered air purifying respirators (‘PAPR’). Our PAPR range has recently received the CE European safety approval enabling marketing to commence in Europe. Strategic imperatives • Continue to grow market share of own brand sales in each region • Expand PCI offering into North America • Expand global distribution network • Expand Farm Services to include Pulsator and Tag Exchange services Key Strengths • Long-term growth market due to growing global population and demand for dairy protein and products • Patented technology delivers improved on farm efficiency over the alternative competitive offerings • Market leader for pulsation and cluster technology in food regulated environment • Global distribution reach via network of independent dealers • Farm Services provides alternative ownership model through lease hire business Page 24–25 Precision, Control & Intelligence Farm Services PRECISION LINERS TUBING CLAWS SHELLS WASHTRAYS CONTROL INTELLIGENCE CLUSTER EXCHANGE PULSATOR EXCHANGE TAG EXCHANGE Interface iFarm Existing Product New Product Dairy LO2Air iMilk600 Other products: • Pneumatic Pulsator • Electronic Pulsator • Control Valves • Controller • Bucket Milker Other products: • MMV • Auto Remover • Sorting Gate Other products: • iFarm • Leg Tag • Neck Tag • Precision Farming We are the world-leading manufacturer of state of the art electronic pulsators designed to facilitate gentle, complete and uniform milking. COMMENTS ON RESULTS Our revenue growth and improved EBITDA margin has driven a 15% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Continuous focus on operational excellence Over the last ten years we have established an efficient and flexible manufacturing operation from which to serve our global customer base. We are committed to continually improving our production processes and see opportunities for further scale efficiencies in the medium-term. This will have the effect of building a more robust and diversified business, albeit within our existing markets. The Dairy market environment continues to be positive with improved milk prices and low feed costs reflected in increased farmer confidence. We also expect sales of our new Powered Air Purifying Respirator range to build momentum once NIOSH approvals have been obtained. Latin America grew liner revenues by 29.3% on a constant currency basis reflecting market share gains in Brazil. Asia Pacific liner revenues declined by 1% at constant currency as a result of difficult market conditions experienced in China during 2017. PRECISION, CONTROL & INTELLIGENCE Sales of our PCI products have benefited from increased farmer confidence resulting in higher investment spend. OUTLOOK The dairy market environment continues to be positive with improved milk prices and low feed costs reflected in increased farmer confidence. In milkrite | InterPuls, investment has been focused on expanding our Precision, Control and Intelligence (PCI) product range. Available mitigation in the form of a generic control structure, is shown by each identified risk area. We have experienced no external environmental incidents or concerns throughout the 2017 financial year at any of our locations. The electricity, gas and water used at our UK sites is monitored on a weekly basis to spot peaks in usage. Avon has employees in each of its facilities who are responsible for collecting and acting on the data. Avon is fully committed to respecting the human rights of all those working with or for us. Under our reward programme, employees can nominate colleagues whom they believe embody one or more of the CREED values in their job performance. Pictured below is the bake-off held at our Melksham facility to raise money for Macmillan Cancer Support. The scheme is based on a two year ‘work and learn’ programme designed to bring new talent into our organisation. Prior to joining Avon, Nick was Director of Finance, Planning & Reporting at Imperial Brands, the FTSE 100 tobacco group. In addition, there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant business risks faced by the Group. Mr Rayner stepped down from the Board when Nick Keveth was appointed Chief Financial Officer on 1 June 2017. Rob Rennie, Chief Executive Officer, stepped down from the Board on 15 February 2017 and was replaced by Paul McDonald. The Board is satisfied that Mr Vervaat has recent relevant financial experience and his profile appears on page 42. The Board reports formally to its shareholders in a number of ways, including regulatory news announcements or press releases in response to events or routine reporting obligations, a detailed Annual Report and Accounts and, at the half year, an interim report. In accordance with our Remuneration Policy, annual salaries for each were set below the median level, at £300,000 and £230,000 respectively. The Policy Report is not subject to a shareholder vote this year but has been reproduced here for ease of reference. However, any such payment would be subject to performance conditions and a claw back on underperformance during the first two years of employment. As reported in last year’s Remuneration Report, the final payment under this arrangement was made to Mr Lewis on 30 November 2016. This is reflected in the Plan’s performance conditions which are based on TSR and earnings per share (‘EPS’). Once the shareholding guideline is met executives are not required to retain any portion of future awards that vest. In practice there is therefore a 10% dilution limit on all schemes which the Company will continue to operate within. Awards under both schemes are targeted at junior management and may be supplemented by unapproved share options. Mr Keveth has reached the lifetime allowance and his company contribution is paid as a non-pensionable salary supplement. The Committee will also take care to ensure that, while meeting its contractual obligations, poor performance is not rewarded. Any Non-Executive Director who has served for more than nine years since first election is subject to annual re-election by shareholders.

Treasury dealings such as investments, borrowings and foreign exchange are conducted only to support underlying business transactions. The Group hedges material forecast US Dollar or euro foreign currency transactional exposures using forward exchange contracts. In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than Sterling, the Group ensures that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level, by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates where necessary to address short-term imbalances. Fair value is assessed by reference to year end spot exchange rates, adjusted for forward points associated with contracts of similar duration. For trade receivables that are not past due, taking into account good historical collection experience, management records an impairment charge only where there is a specific risk of non-collection. At 30 September 2017, 565,803 (2016: 718,789) ordinary shares were held by a trust in respect of obligations under the 2010 Performance Share Plan. 19 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED (b) Interest rate risk The Group does not undertake any hedging activity in this area.
