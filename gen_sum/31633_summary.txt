david evans chairman 15 november 2017 overview it has been a year of structural and strategic transition for the group. we see opportunities to generate further, profitable growth from our core business through a number of initiatives: • leveraging the product and customer base. we have seen with the acquisitions of argus and interpuls that strong brand positions in complementary markets provide an opportunity to accelerate multi-product sales. we see alternative ownership models and value-added services as an additional differentiator that has scope to open up a broader market. strategic imperatives • continue to grow market share of own brand sales in each region • expand pci offering into north america • expand global distribution network • expand farm services to include pulsator and tag exchange services key strengths • long-term growth market due to growing global population and demand for dairy protein and products • patented technology delivers improved on farm efficiency over the alternative competitive offerings • market leader for pulsation and cluster technology in food regulated environment • global distribution reach via network of independent dealers • farm services provides alternative ownership model through lease hire business page 24–25 precision, control & intelligence farm services precision liners tubing claws shells washtrays control

of the art electronic pulsators designed to facilitate gentle, complete and uniform milking. comments on results our revenue growth and improved ebitda margin has driven a 15% increase in adjusted earnings per share. continuous focus on operational excellence over the last ten years we have established an efficient and flexible manufacturing operation from which to serve our global customer base. we are committed to continually improving our production processes and see opportunities for further scale efficiencies in the medium-term. this will have the effect of building a more robust and diversified business, albeit within our existing markets. the dairy market environment continues to be positive with improved milk prices and low feed costs reflected in increased farmer confidence. we also expect sales of our new powered air purifying respirator range to build momentum once niosh approvals have been obtained. we have experienced no external environmental incidents or concerns throughout the 2017 financial year at any of our locations. the electricity, gas and water used at our uk sites is monitored on a weekly basis to spot peaks in usage. avon has employees in each of its facilities who are responsible for collecting and acting on the data. under our reward programme, employees can nominate colleagues whom they believe embody one or more of the creed values in their job performance. the scheme is based on a two year ‘work and learn’ programme designed to bring new talent into our organisation. in addition, there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant business risks faced by the group. all of mr rennie’s outstanding share awards lapsed in full • paul mcdonald was appointed chief executive officer on 15 february 2017 and nick keveth was appointed chief financial officer on 1 june 2017. in accordance with our remuneration policy, annual salaries for each were set below the median level, at £300,000 and £230,000 respectively. the policy report is not subject to a shareholder vote this year but has been reproduced here for ease of reference. however, any such payment would be subject to performance conditions and a claw back on underperformance during the first two years of employment. this is reflected in the plan’s performance conditions which are based on tsr and earnings per share (‘eps’). once the shareholding guideline is met executives are not required to retain any portion of future awards that vest. in practice there is therefore a 10% dilution limit on all schemes which the company will continue to operate within. mr keveth has reached the lifetime allowance and his company contribution is paid as a non-pensionable salary supplement. the committee will also take care to ensure that, while meeting its contractual obligations, poor performance is not rewarded. any non-executive director who has served for more than nine years since first election is subject to annual re-election by shareholders. annual report and accounts 2017 shareholder informations financial statements strategic report governance overview single total figure of remuneration for directors for
