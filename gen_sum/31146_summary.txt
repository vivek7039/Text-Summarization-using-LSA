and financial statements 2017 q: in november last year, you announced the board’s intention to acquire peacock foods. there is ‘much to do’ but we are excited by what the new business brings in every respect. we will do this by adopting a new approach to operations and major projects, creating a refreshed two divisional uk structure, having greater functional centralisation, injecting new capabilities into the business to support our strategy, standardising our processes, and reducing overheads across the business. this will enable us to serve our customers better and operate more consistently as one uk business. • we expect these changes to be better for our people as they will provide greater scope to drive performance, more focus on what really matters, leaner and simpler structures, bigger roles, and better ways of working together. now in his tenth year as ceo, patrick talks about some of these changes, challenges and opportunities. they have been energised by these engagements – taking ‘lessons learned’ back to their own teams. you then make your choice based on some combination of location, brand, value, taste and service. our strategy, customer relationships and business model sets us up well to ensure that we have great food available at whatever point of purchase customers demand. importantly though, they have not dented our board’s confidence, optimism and excitement for the future. the group has built strong long-term partnerships with our customers who are also looking to this category for growth. this is complemented by market-leading positions in convenience food categories including ready meals and cooking sauces. this was primarily driven by our food to go business which accounted for approximately 60% of divisional revenue in the period. we will work with our customers to maximise product returns through collaborating on initiatives including sourcing, ordering, merchandising, and waste management. this will involve the implementation of a more compact divisional structure, overhead reduction, upgraded operational capability, greater functional centralisation and standardisation. source: nielsen data for the 52 weeks to 9 september

medium term by completing a phase of network investment with key customers, integrating the atherstone facility, and acquiring a sandwich manufacturing facility near heathrow. we will ensure that our food safety and technical standards are maintained at the highest level. this provides us with a platform to generate sustainable cash flow that is used for effective capital allocation. the group

innovation and costs effectiveness. post project reviews are carried out on all major capital investment projects to monitor the effectiveness of execution. in the case of peacock foods, significant resources have been allocated to ensure an effective integration. they are subject to a significant number of audits by internal teams, customers and independent bodies auditing against recognised global food safety standards. the group is continually reviewing and improving its recruitment processes to reflect changing market conditions, including rigorous compliance checks. the level of

longer-term compliance with the medium combustion plant directive and f-gas regulations (high global warming potential f-gas replacement options). all uk and us sites are subject to independent third

purpose built and effective cost structures, with partners who value quality, trust and food safety. secondly, there is an increased focus on innovation as customers seek to develop and enhance their commercial strategies in fresh, prepared, ‘perimeter of store’ food offerings. further details of this acquisition are set out in note 31 to the group financial statements. consumers continue to seek

2017 shareholders will be asked to pass a resolution at the forthcoming agm authorising the company to re-allot shares purchased by it and not cancelled as treasury shares. directors mr ep tonge was appointed chief financial officer and executive director on 3 october 2016, replacing mr ar williams who resigned from his position as chief financial officer and executive director on the same day. of the 2016 code, it is intended that an external evaluation will continue to be conducted at least every three years. it is intended that this resolution will once again be put before shareholders at the forthcoming agm. the board acknowledges that, resulting from his role in peacock foods, mr sampson is not considered to be independent. furthermore, mr sampson is currently chair of the group’s us advisory council and he receives a separate fee for this additional responsibility. he is available to each of the directors for any advice or additional services they may require. therefore, the group gives priority to effective dialogue with shareholders and ensuring active shareholder engagement. the board also encourages shareholders to make use of their votes at all general meetings. a significant amount of other published material including news releases and share price information is accessible to all shareholders on the group’s website. three members present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a quorum. each division has a finance director or controller who is responsible for information which accords with agreed policies. the purpose of the risk register is to ensure that all significant risks within each business unit have been appropriately identified and also to ensure that all risk is mitigated or managed as appropriate. we did not make it clear that the stretch to achieve this potentially bigger pay out was increasing significantly. this represents considerable stretch over and above previous target levels given the significant step up in capital invested in fy16 (including seven new manufacturing facilities commissioned, built or acquired during the year) and reflecting the normal timescale for new facilities to ramp up to full capacity which means a time lag before anticipated growth and returns are fully delivered. uk – 41% north america – 29.5% rest of europe – 29.5% segmentation of tsr peer group by country of listing tsr peer group by

performance targets a central aspect of our consultation with shareholders was the target range for the roic measure under the psp . in december 2016, we completed the acquisition of peacock foods for

directors has been determined. vesting is based on eps and roic performance measured over the three years to fy19, weighted 50/50. in line with our new policy, a two-year post-vesting holding period will apply to the fy17 and future psp awards for executive directors. remuneration principles the following principles have been adopted during fy17 as a framework to guide our remuneration decisions: remuneration principle in action alignment and fairness • encouraging all employees to become shareholders; • operating a psp for senior employees; • offering employee share plans; • shareholding

the eu in 2017 with an effective date of 1 january 2019. there are no other ifrs standards or interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the group. the carrying amounts of definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date and are subject to impairment testing when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. freehold buildings held as investment property are depreciated over their expected useful life, normally assumed to be 40–50 years. after initial recognition, interest- bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. the group uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency swaps and interest rate swap agreements, to hedge these exposures. notes to the group financial statements continued year ended 29 september 2017 123 greencore group plc | annual report and financial statements 2017 1. group statement of accounting policies continued taxation continued deferred tax assets and liabilities are not subject to discounting and are measured at the tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. the group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. we consider the range of possible outcomes and record a liability based on the most likely single outcome, rather than alternative approaches which could include a weighted average probability of outcomes or an ‘all or nothing’ approach. government grants government grants for the acquisition of assets are recognised at their fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and any conditions attached to them have been fulfilled. an asset is recognised only when all the conditions set out in ias 38 intangible assets are met. the group’s primary reporting segment, for which more detailed disclosures are made, is by class of business. where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in total shareholders’ equity. segment performance is predominantly evaluated based on operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquisition related intangible assets.

exceptional item in operating costs in the group income statement (note 7). the funds received were swapped (using cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges under ias 39 financial instruments: recognition and measurement) from floating euro to fixed us dollar rates. the different levels have been defined as follows: level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. the group’s policy is to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings. liquidity risk the group’s policy on funding capacity is to ensure that it always has sufficient long-term funding and committed bank facilities in place to meet foreseeable peak borrowing requirements with an appropriate level of additional headroom. during the period the group put in place a new $249m bank facility to part fund the acquisition of peacock foods, which completed on 30 december 2016. in march 2017 the maturity of the primary bank facility of £300m was extended by 1 year to march 2022. in addition, the group also extended the maturity of a £50m bilateral facility bank for a further 18 months to march 2020. the following are the carrying
