Our strategy, customer relationships and business model sets us up well to ensure that we have Great Food available at whatever point of purchase customers demand. The Group has built strong long-term partnerships with our customers who are also looking to this category for growth. This was primarily driven by our Food to Go business which accounted for approximately 60% of divisional revenue in the period. We will work with our customers to maximise product returns through collaborating on initiatives including sourcing, ordering, merchandising, and waste management. This will involve the implementation of a more compact divisional structure, overhead reduction, upgraded operational capability, greater functional centralisation and standardisation. Develop enduring customer partnerships Strong relationships with our customers has been a critical element of Greencore’s success for many years. We will develop strategic relationships with our customers to achieve the best outcome for them, their consumers and Greencore. Through these relationships, we will move beyond food manufacturing to provide distribution, innovation, new product development and category management solutions. The Group has identified these KPIs to measure progress of our strategic imperatives in delivering profitability, returns and cashflow generation. In FY17, our UK manufacturing sites have maintained a 0% disposal rate with all solid waste being reused, recycled or recovered. The Group develops long-term relationships with its customers that are based on several factors including quality, service, innovation and costs effectiveness. They are subject to a significant number of audits by internal teams, customers and independent bodies auditing against recognised global food safety standards. The Group is continually reviewing and improving its recruitment processes to reflect changing market conditions, including rigorous compliance checks. 0.57 0.57 0.57 0.57 0.60 FY16 FY17 FY14 FY13 FY15 Group accident rate per 100 employees In the UK, we have introduced three lines of defence to our health and safety governance. slavery, we have a number of activities in place related to preventing or tackling this and wider human rights issues.

This year, our Manton Wood team received the ‘National Employer Award’ for outstanding performance working with Job Centre Plus to get people into employment. This has been supported by training with colleagues receiving formal qualifications in Lean Six Sigma Yellow, Green and Black belts. This process has enabled us to share and learn from alternative ways of working, recognising practices that support the Business Effectiveness principle. We have developed a tool to assess sites against the best practice guide, and during FY17, piloted this within our Prepared Meals division.

As an example we have undertaken environmental risk assessment to help prioritise future actions on external environmental issues impacting on the Group, and following this, we are developing strategies for longer-term compliance with the Medium Combustion Plant Directive and F-Gas Regulations (high Global Warming Potential F-Gas replacement options). All UK and US sites are subject to independent third party audits under the Global Food Safety Initiative (‘GFSI’) Standard. We provide choice for those with particular dietary restrictions, such as gluten intolerance or meat-free preference by innovating in these products within our ranges. We manage our complex raw material supply base through a supplier approval process, which in the UK, is operated by central technical and purchasing functions. Our specialist subject matter experts carry out regular visits to suppliers and provide a detailed understanding of supply chains. A substantial portion of divisional revenue is generated on contracts where these material costs are passed through directly to the customer. Secondly, there is an increased focus on innovation as customers seek to develop and enhance their commercial strategies in fresh, prepared, ‘perimeter of store’ food offerings.
