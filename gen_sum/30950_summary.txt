introduced in 2011, the pinmar paint standard was the industry’s first comprehensive statement of how a client’s expected paint finish should be measured and agreed. superyachts require a major survey service every five years to comply with certain class, maritime laws and insurance requirements. wha t we do the pinmar standard an objective solution to a subjective process 2.0 06 gyg plc refit gyg has unrivalled experience in the superyacht refit market and has painted more yachts over 30m than any other company. our equipment is developed to accommodate advancing technology whilst always being conscious of the environment. it is a key factor in ensuring the end product looks exceptional upon delivery. through its close relationships with new build shipyards, gyg is involved at the outset of any project. electrostatic shooting offers significant advantages over conventional paint spraying, not least being a reduction in the time required to top-coat larger superyachts as well as a 60% improvement in paint transfer which massively reduces the environmental impact. as such, our strengthened financial position provides us with a strong platform to support future growth and development of the group. the enhanced credibility and profile that we have gained as a result of the ipo will continue to help us secure larger orders and develop further growth opportunities to generate long-term value for shareholders. results we have delivered solid revenue growth in the year, up 14.7% to ¤62.6m (fy16: ¤54.6m), reflecting a good performance across all divisions. the group aims to
