Superyachts require a major survey service every five years to comply with certain  class, maritime laws and insurance requirements. WHA T WE DO THE PINMAR STANDARD An objective solution   to a subjective process 2.0 06 GYG plc REFIT GYG has unrivalled experience in the  Superyacht refit market and has painted  more yachts over 30m than any other  company. Our equipment is developed to  accommodate advancing technology whilst  always being conscious of the environment. Through its close relationships with new  build shipyards, GYG is involved at the  outset of any project. Electrostatic shooting offers significant  advantages over conventional paint  spraying, not least being a reduction in the  time required to top-coat larger Superyachts  as well as a 60% improvement in paint  transfer which massively reduces the  environmental impact. As such, our strengthened financial position provides us with   a strong platform to support future growth and development  of the Group. RESULTS We have delivered solid revenue growth in the year, up 14.7%   to ¤62.6m (FY16: ¤54.6m), reflecting a good performance  across all divisions. The Group aims to increase its market share in new build  through an organic growth strategy. Management anticipates SYC to form a major part of the   US growth strategy as this shipyard capacity comes fully   on stream in Q3 2018.

CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are  tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there  is an indication that the unit may be impaired. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and  recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised   at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded   as their cost). Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in  a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated  amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same  basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately. You should not consider “Adjusted EBITDA” as  an alternative for Revenue or Operating Profit which are IFRS  measures. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable  temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised  to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be  available against which deductible temporary differences   can be utilised. Where the  actual future cash flows are less than expected, an impairment  loss may arise. Diluted earnings/(losses) per share have been calculated on a similar basis taking into account dilutive potential shares under the  agreements disclosed in note 24. The Group recognises an allowance for doubtful debts of 100% against those  receivables overdue that after a specific analysis are considered not recoverable.
