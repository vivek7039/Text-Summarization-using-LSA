of the group into four principal divisions which reflect the increased healthcare focus • grayling restructuring completed with a return to profitability huntsworth made strong progress in 2017 , led by its healthcare agencies. i was delighted to welcome tceg into the group in july, an excellent team with a passion for their work. we have made significant progress in executing our strategy of transforming the group into a healthcare marketing services focused business. so it is with much sadness that, given my other commitments, i will step down as chair, subject to an orderly succession process. whilst each business is focused on the specific needs of its clients, we can create integrated teams – within or across our divisions – to address challenges that require a multidisciplinary solution. short and long-term cashflow forecasting also ensures that we continue to operate well within our facility limits whilst delivering an optimum capital structure. 113% cash conversion customers we help our customers engage, adapt and evolve in fast-changing landscapes, building brand resilience and creating measurable advantage to achieve their business objectives – whether that’s building awareness, affinity or improving reputation leading to increased sales, visits or sign-ups. following a decision to streamline how we organise ourselves, the group now has two distinct areas of focus; healthcare and communications. clients are increasingly looking for a single agency solution as healthcare marketing becomes more integrated, digital and seeks to reach multiple stakeholders. paul taaffe chief executive officer 5 march 2018 customer partnerships we help our customers engage, adapt and evolve in fast-changing landscapes, building brand resilience and creating measurable advantage to achieve their business objectives – whether that’s building awareness, affinity or improving reputation leading to increased sales, visits or sign-ups. this is driven by increased evidence requirements; market access hurdles; proliferation of stakeholders including patients who require information about clinical studies; and the strict regulatory environment meaning that activities prior to launch are increasingly medically led. revenue +18% like-for-like 2017: £30.9m (2016: £25.3m) profits +34% like-for-like 2017: £8.3m (2016: £6.0m) huntsworth plc annual report

group works with an international blue- chip client base with a particular strength in healthcare. it provides seamless communication consultancy across the world’s business centres, with a particular focus on major cross-border financial transactions and large multi- nationals looking to broaden their global footprint. all risks are documented in the group’s risk register which is reviewed at least six monthly or more frequently as required. the group has a wide spread of clients both across geography and industry sector, reducing reliance on any one particular economic environment. foreign exchange exposure is continually monitored, and the group uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate this risk where deemed necessary. this leads to growing end-user demand which is relatively unaffected by economic cycles, thereby mitigating against the risk of a downturn. this report outlines the group’s approach to responsible business practices and details some of the activities that we have undertaken in 2017. we remain dedicated to growing our business and delivering shareholder value while maintaining an uncompromising stance on unethical practices, products or organisations. before accepting work that may pose an ethical risk, employees are required to seek advice from the responsible person or committee in their company and/or division. each of our group companies also operate their own internal training programmes to keep staff up to date with developments in their sectors and provide additional skills in areas such as people management, leadership development, client management and international client director training. neil is a member of the institute of chartered accountants in england & wales, qualifying with price waterhouse in 1990. andy boland independent non-executive director andy boland was appointed to the huntsworth board as independent non-executive director on 11 august 2014, and was appointed as huntsworth’s senior

governance strategic report other information 2017 board evaluation due to its size, the company is not required to have an externally facilitated board evaluation once every three years. all non-executive directors are appointed for an initial period of three years, subject to annual re-election at each agm. furthermore, the board has in place measures to manage any actual or potential conflict of interest situations that may arise, which operate effectively. pwc were initially appointed in december 2016, following a tender process and their reappointment was approved by shareholders at the 2017 agm. we welcome the opportunity to engage with shareholders about any aspect of our remuneration policy and its implementation. executive directors will be required to retain 50% of after-tax vested share awards until their shareholding requirement is met. during the year ended 31 december 2017, no shares were transferred out of treasury to satisfy obligations under employee share plans. the companies act defines ‘donations’ and ‘expenditure’ very broadly such that this sort of activity falls within its ambit. we concluded that classifying this item as highlighted is appropriate and consistent with prior years’ treatments of such items. how we determined it 5% of profit before tax adjusted for highlighted items as defined in note 2 to the financial statement. david snell (senior statutory auditor) for and on behalf of pricewaterhousecoopers llp chartered accountants and statutory auditors london 5 march 2018 huntsworth plc annual report and

accordance with international financial reporting standards (‘ifrs’), as adopted in the european union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the companies act 2006. on 5 march 2018 the consolidated financial statements of the group were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors. goodwill comprises the value of expected synergies arising from an acquisition that do not qualify for separate recognition. if the balance is expected to be recovered in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. after initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. for fixed fee projects, revenue is only recognised once the final outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty. highlighted items the group presents highlighted items charged to profit before tax by making adjustments for costs and credits which management believe to be significant by virtue of their size, nature or incidence or which have a distortive effect on current year earnings. acquisition related costs of £395,000 were incurred and these are included within highlighted items in the consolidated income statement. the amortisation charge in respect of intangible assets is excluded from adjusted results as they relate to historic business combinations rather than normal ongoing operations. these costs were excluded from adjusted results as they relate to historic business combinations rather than ongoing operations. growth rates in years two to five are based on management’s medium- term forecasted revenue and operating margins for each of the businesses. assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amounts and fair value less costs to sell. overseas dividends received on or after 1 july 2009 are largely exempt from uk tax but may be subject to foreign withholding taxes. • level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. the period of total uninterrupted engagement is two years, covering the years ended 31 december 2016 to
