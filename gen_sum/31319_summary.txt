I was delighted to welcome TCEG into the Group in July, an excellent team with a passion for their work. We have made significant progress in executing our strategy of transforming the Group into a Healthcare marketing services focused business. Red has had a good year despite some client attrition, but recent wins emphasise its fundamental strength. Citigate Dewe Rogerson has had a solid year despite difficult market conditions in the UK and Asia. So it is with much sadness that, given my other commitments, I will step down as Chair, subject to an orderly succession process. Macro developments Huntsworth plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report Other Information 06 07 82% 90% 70% of Healthcare professionals (‘HCPs’) used a computer, smartphone and tablet for professional purposes in 2014 of HCPs used smartphones for professional purposes in 2014 of Primary Care Physicians use Social Media for professional purposes The world is getting older The global population is getting older all the time. This creates additional opportunities for agencies which are best able to navigate the complex regulatory and institutional environment surrounding these drugs. Whilst each business is focused on the specific needs of its clients, we can create integrated teams – within or across our divisions – to address challenges that require a multidisciplinary solution. Short and long-term cashflow forecasting also ensures that we continue to operate well within our facility limits whilst delivering an optimum capital structure. 113% cash conversion Customers We help our customers engage, adapt and evolve in fast-changing landscapes, building brand resilience and creating measurable advantage to achieve their business objectives – whether that’s building awareness, affinity or improving reputation leading to increased sales, visits or sign-ups. Following a decision to streamline how we organise ourselves, the Group now has two distinct areas of focus; Healthcare and Communications. Clients are increasingly looking for a single agency solution as healthcare marketing becomes more integrated, digital and seeks to reach multiple stakeholders. The agency won a number of significant new mandates, and we anticipate little net effect on trading in 2018. Paul Taaffe Chief Executive Officer 5 March 2018 Customer partnerships We help our customers engage, adapt and evolve in fast-changing landscapes, building brand resilience and creating measurable advantage to achieve their business objectives – whether that’s building awareness, affinity or improving reputation leading to increased sales, visits or sign-ups. This is driven by increased evidence requirements; market access hurdles; proliferation of stakeholders including patients who require information about clinical studies; and the strict regulatory environment meaning that activities prior to launch are increasingly medically led.

It provides seamless communication consultancy across the world’s business centres, with a particular focus on major cross-border financial transactions and large multi- nationals looking to broaden their global footprint. All risks are documented in the Group’s risk register which is reviewed at least six monthly or more frequently as required. Subdued global financial markets can result in reductions to the level of transactional activity, reducing client mandates. The Group has a wide spread of clients both across geography and industry sector, reducing reliance on any one particular economic environment. Exchange rates have also continued to prove volatile, particularly in light of the ongoing uncertainty over Brexit. Foreign exchange exposure is continually monitored, and the Group uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate this risk where deemed necessary. This leads to growing end-user demand which is relatively unaffected by economic cycles, thereby mitigating against the risk of a downturn. We remain dedicated to growing our business and delivering shareholder value while maintaining an uncompromising stance on unethical practices, products or organisations. Our Code of Ethics, which covers personal conduct and the professional standards of behaviour we expect from our employees, is published on the Group’s intranet and all employees have access to Group policies via a dedicated policy management system. Before accepting work that may pose an ethical risk, employees are required to seek advice from the responsible person or committee in their company and/or division. Each of our Group companies also operate their own internal training programmes to keep staff up to date with developments in their sectors and provide additional skills in areas such as people management, leadership development, client management and international client director training.

Huntsworth plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 58 59 Implementation of remuneration policy in 2018 Executive Directors Salary The Committee reviewed Executive Director salaries during 2017, and it was determined that Neil Jones would receive an increase in his salary equivalent to 2.8%, with effect from 1 January 2018. His US Dollar salary shown in the above table of $936,000 has applied from 1 October 2016 onwards, as explained on page 50. During the year ended 31 December 2017, no shares were transferred out of treasury to satisfy obligations under employee share plans. The Companies Act defines ‘donations’ and ‘expenditure’ very broadly such that this sort of activity falls within its ambit. We concluded that classifying this item as highlighted is appropriate and consistent with prior years’ treatments of such items. How we determined it 5% of profit before tax adjusted for highlighted items as defined in note 2 to the financial statement. Goodwill comprises the value of expected synergies arising from an acquisition that do not qualify for separate recognition. If the balance is expected to be recovered in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. For fixed fee projects, revenue is only recognised once the final outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty. Highlighted items The Group presents highlighted items charged to profit before tax by making adjustments for costs and credits which management believe to be significant by virtue of their size, nature or incidence or which have a distortive effect on current year earnings. Acquisition related costs of £395,000 were incurred and these are included within highlighted items in the Consolidated Income Statement.

The Grayling, CDR and Red CGUs will remain as management continue to monitor goodwill at this level.
