i was delighted to welcome tceg into the group in july, an excellent team with a passion for their work. we have made significant progress in executing our strategy of transforming the group into a healthcare marketing services focused business. so it is with much sadness that, given my other commitments, i will step down as chair, subject to an orderly succession process. whilst each business is focused on the specific needs of its clients, we can create integrated teams – within or across our divisions – to address challenges that require a multidisciplinary solution. short and long-term cashflow forecasting also ensures that we continue to operate well within our facility limits whilst delivering an optimum capital structure. following a decision to streamline how we organise ourselves, the group now has two distinct areas of focus; healthcare and communications. clients are increasingly looking for a single agency solution as healthcare marketing becomes more integrated, digital and seeks to reach multiple stakeholders. paul taaffe chief executive officer 5 march 2018 customer partnerships we help our customers engage, adapt and evolve in fast-changing landscapes, building brand resilience and creating measurable advantage to achieve their business objectives – whether that’s building awareness, affinity or improving reputation leading to increased sales, visits or sign-ups. this is driven by increased evidence requirements; market access hurdles; proliferation of stakeholders including patients who require information about clinical studies; and the strict regulatory environment meaning that activities prior to launch are increasingly medically led. revenue +18% like-for-like 2017: £30.9m (2016: £25.3m) profits +34% like-for-like 2017: £8.3m

pgs 12-15 the creative engagement group works with an international blue- chip client base with a particular strength in healthcare. it provides seamless communication consultancy across the world’s business centres, with a particular focus on major cross-border financial transactions and large multi- nationals looking to broaden their global footprint. all risks are documented in the group’s risk register which is reviewed at least six monthly or more frequently as required. the group has a wide spread of clients both across geography and industry sector, reducing reliance on any one particular economic environment. foreign exchange exposure is continually monitored, and the group uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate this risk where deemed necessary. this leads to growing end-user demand which is relatively unaffected by economic cycles, thereby mitigating against the risk of a downturn. before accepting work that may pose an ethical risk, employees are required to seek advice from the responsible person or committee in their company and/or division. prior to joining addison lee in 2015, andy served as the chief financial officer of aa plc for six years. further details in respect of the company’s major shareholders can be found on page 60. huntsworth plc annual report and accounts 2017 38 39 financial statements corporate governance strategic
