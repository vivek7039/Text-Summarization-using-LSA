restructuring and has now returned to profitability, with a notably strong performance from its uk operation. red has had a good year despite some client attrition, but recent wins emphasise its fundamental strength. citigate dewe rogerson has had a solid year despite difficult market conditions in the uk and asia. so it is with much sadness that, given my other commitments, i will step down as chair, subject to an orderly succession process. as such each of our businesses operates in markets with their own characteristics and dynamics. while the political and economic environment has remained relatively stable to date despite these changes, significant policy changes may have an impact, whether in respect of us tax reform, healthcare reform in the us, or wider economic policy. currency headwinds are currently anticipated into 2018, primarily as a result of the weaker us dollar. macro developments huntsworth plc annual report and accounts 2017 financial statements corporate

for professional purposes in 2014 of primary care physicians use social media for professional purposes the world is getting older the global population is getting older all the time. healthcare professionals are twice as likely to use online sources than print when making clinical decisions. in our communications division we work with a range of blue chip companies and household names. whilst each business is focused on the specific needs of its clients, we can create integrated teams – within or across our divisions – to address challenges that require a multidisciplinary solution. short and long-term cashflow forecasting also ensures that we continue to operate well within our facility limits whilst delivering an optimum capital structure. 113% cash conversion customers we help our customers engage, adapt and evolve in fast-changing landscapes, building brand resilience and creating measurable advantage to achieve their business objectives – whether that’s building awareness, affinity or improving reputation leading to increased sales, visits or sign-ups. the group has made significant progress over the past two years in improving its profitability but we aim to drive further operational and cost efficiencies, as well as focusing on higher value-add services, in order to deliver market-leading margins. our four divisions each have sector or service specialisations which are aligned to group objectives. following a decision to streamline how we organise ourselves, the group now has two distinct areas of focus; healthcare and communications. paul

and marketing communications. reduced losses on operations disposed of in either 2016 or 2017 added a further £0.1 million to profits. clients are increasingly looking for a single agency solution as healthcare marketing becomes more integrated, digital and seeks to reach multiple stakeholders. huntsworth plc annual report and accounts 2017 financial statements corporate governance strategic

and just, is focused on providing deeply immersive experiences in exhibitions, events, training and internal communications, mostly for healthcare clients. the communications division is comprised of grayling, red and specialist financial agency citigate dewe rogerson (cdr). this was led by the uk business which saw a particularly strong rebound in performance. paul taaffe chief executive officer 5 march 2018 customer partnerships we help our customers engage, adapt and evolve in fast-changing landscapes, building brand resilience and creating measurable advantage to achieve their business objectives – whether that’s building awareness, affinity or improving reputation leading to increased sales, visits or sign-ups. its overwhelmingly digital work is focused in marketing, advertising, crm, public relations, social media and analytics. this is driven by increased evidence requirements; market access hurdles; proliferation of stakeholders including patients who require information about clinical studies; and the strict regulatory environment meaning that activities prior to launch are increasingly medically led. revenue +18% like-for-like 2017: £30.9m (2016: £25.3m) profits

chief executive’s statement pgs 12-15 the creative engagement group works with an international blue- chip client base with a particular strength in healthcare. it provides seamless communication consultancy across the world’s business centres, with a particular focus on major cross-border financial transactions and large multi- nationals looking to broaden their global footprint. net expenditure on acquisitions and disposals was £20.3 million, primarily relating to the acquisition of tceg. all risks are documented in the group’s risk register which is reviewed at least six monthly or more frequently as required. subdued global financial markets can result in reductions to the level of transactional activity, reducing client mandates. the group has a wide spread of clients both across geography and industry sector, reducing reliance on any one particular economic environment. exchange rates have also continued to prove volatile, particularly in light of the ongoing uncertainty over brexit. foreign exchange exposure is continually monitored, and the group uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate this risk where deemed necessary. this leads to growing end-user demand which is relatively unaffected by economic cycles, thereby mitigating against the risk of a downturn. reviews of all new business opportunities won and lost across the group are performed regularly. ethical matters that are not identified or managed appropriately could cause reputational damage to the group. referral processes, including divisional committees, are in place to manage all perceived ethical and conflict issues. management closely monitors all covenants on the group’s facilities and actively manages undrawn headroom. this report outlines the group’s approach to responsible business practices and details some of the activities that we have undertaken in 2017. we remain dedicated to growing our business and delivering shareholder value while maintaining an uncompromising stance on unethical practices, products or organisations. our code of ethics, which covers personal conduct and the professional standards of behaviour we expect from our employees, is published on the group’s intranet and all employees have access to group policies via a dedicated policy management system. before accepting work that may pose an ethical risk, employees are required to seek advice from the responsible person or committee in their company and/or division. each of our group companies also operate their own internal training programmes to keep staff up to date with developments in their sectors and provide additional skills in areas such as people management, leadership development, client management and international client director training. employees are trained in video-conferencing and webinar facilities, with virtual meetings being conducted where possible. derek has an historical career as founder of tom cobleigh pub chain and leapfrog day nurseries. neil is also a non- executive director of taptica international, an aim listed ad- tech business. neil is a member of the institute of chartered accountants in england & wales, qualifying
