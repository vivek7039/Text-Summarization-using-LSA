It is the Group’ s policy not to undertake  speculative transactions which create  additional exposures over and above those  arising from normal trading activity. These forward-looking  statements reflect management’ s  assumptions made on the basis of  information available to it at this time. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc and its  Directors accept no liability to third parties in  respect of this Report save as would arise  under English law. – In consultation with our internal valuation specialists we audited key assumptions based on external market data  including the EBIT margin, discount and short term growth rate. For all components, we held close calls after they reported into us and as deemed  necessary, conducted share screen reviews. Net cash flows between any two currencies of less than  £1.0 million per annum would not usually be considered sufficiently material to warrant forward cover. All gains and losses arising  from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Transactional (or non-structural) exposures give rise to net currency gains and losses that are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. Over the  longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings. At 31st December 2017 , it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates  would decrease the Group’s profit after tax and equity by approximately £1.5m (2016: £nil).
