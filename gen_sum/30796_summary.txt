introduction my last full year as chairman was a successful and eventful one. t wo months later, in july, electrical process heating and temperature management solutions provider, chromalox, joined the group. the spirax sarco business also performed well with organic sales up 5% and gains in all segments. movements in exchange rates are often volatile and unpredictable, therefore the actual impact could be significantly different. − almost thirty new products were launched during 2017. watson-marlow launched the innovative and award-winning quantum peristaltic bioprocessing pump with patented renu su t echnology® cartridge, which offers a step change in pump technology enabling higher downstream process yields with minimum pulsation throughout the pressure range. amongst other new product introductions, chromalox introduced the ccx cast block heater, for use in high pressure environments; and the cxhxd corrosion-resistant, explosion-proof unit heater, for use in hazardous or challenging environments, such as offshore drilling platforms. acquisitions should: − have the potential to create significant shareholder value and either increase our addressable market into related sectors or expand the capabilities of our niche businesses through new skills, technologies or geographic coverage; − serve customers through a direct sales business model; − increase sales in our core markets; − provide products or services where there is a high cost of non-performance to the customer; − have the potential for geographical or technology expansion; − have strong maintenance, repair and overhaul demand and recurring revenues; and − be capable of achieving group margins. gestra’ s strength in a number of product areas, such as industrial boiler control systems, and end applications, such as the german chemical industry, complement the spirax sarco steam specialties division’ s product offering and industry reach. chromalox represents an excellent opportunity to expand our addressable markets through the acquisition of a clearly related business that is also dedicated to transferring heat energy into industrial processes and shares our strong direct sales business model. this year we engineered opportunities to strengthen the group’ s basis for organic growth; served over 100,000 direct buying customers, enabling them to improve process efficiency and reduce their environmental impacts; invested extensively in developing the skills and capabilities of our employees; developed new products; expanded our geographical reach; engaged with our local communities to help meet their needs; reduced our own co 2 emissions intensity; maintained the group operating margin and delivered the 50th year of dividend progress, all of which has been achieved whilst delivering strong organic growth. oem machinery original equipment manufacturers (oems) are companies that build and supply machines for use in industry. our activities with oems vary from

in delivering thermal energy management solutions to customers, with the decision between using steam or electricity as a heating medium being driven by application needs or customer circumstances. how do you plan to ensure that management won’t be distracted by the integration process? during 2016 and 2017, spirax sarco korea undertook a programme to increase the sectorisation of its direct sales force. spirax sarco korea is already seeing the benefits of these changes with increased sales efficiency and revenue generated from key industries. each graduate will experience four six-month placements, tailored to their individual interests and designed to provide a broad range of business experience across functions such as product development, manufacturing, sales, business development, marketing, or health, safety & the environment. the ccx heater, part of the xtremeduty™ platform due to its ability to handle high pressures, has asme (american society of mechanical engineers) and ped (eu pressure equipment directive) pressure certification; marine grade casting, making it suitable for salt-laden environments such as offshore platforms; an explosion-proof terminal enclosure (junction box); and is iecex (international trade of electrical equipment used in explosive atmospheres) and atex (eu equipment directive) rated, meaning that it can be safely used in hazardous environments. historically, sales companies across asia pacific have sourced core stock directly from our regional manufacturing centre in china and supplementary stock from our manufacturing sites in europe or the americas, leading to a complex supply chain and limited visibility of regional product availability. bonus targets are driven off annual plans and therefore

watson-marlow’ s operating margin fell due to the full year dilutionary impact of aflex. at £66.1 million, reported operating profit was ahead 32%, consisting of 7% organic growth, an 11% exchange benefit and 13% from acquisitions. organic growth was primarily driven by leveraging good operating profit from sales growth, price management initiatives and tight control of overheads, enabling investments to be made to strengthen our direct sales presence in the region while maintaining the margin. through improving our strategic account management processes we are forming and strengthening mutually- beneficial, long-lasting relationships with key customers. going forward we will further develop gestra, maintaining its own brand, visual identity, product range and sales force, while also looking for product and supply synergies to increase the efficiency of the steam specialties division as a whole. if exchange rates continue at their current levels we do not anticipate a significant impact on the margin due to transaction effects although we would expect to see some dilution from having a full year of gestra. operating profit grew 7% organically to a reported £56.9 million.” paul

their operational sustainability through increasing efficiency, reducing energy, water or chemical use, or reducing waste. the products and services of our steam specialties division can deliver efficiencies in water use, reducing total site consumption. performance in 2017 we estimate that a select range of energy management products sold during 2017 will reduce our end users’ co 2 emissions by 5.8 million tonnes annually. the methodology used was updated during 2017 to include an expanded range of spirax sarco steam business products (see actions in 2017) and to ensure that the underlying principles are consistent with current data on steam system operations as well as taking revised emission factors into account. the calculation is based on a selected range of energy saving products for which we can quantify savings with reasonable accuracy. additional products included within the metric in 2017 are: smart electro-pneumatic positioners, which have industry-leading low levels of air consumption and reduce compressed air usage, having a direct impact on energy consumption and co 2 emissions; bsa bellows sealed stop valves, which eliminate stem seal leakage; and spirax easiheat packages, which generate hot water using steam, avoiding the energy losses associated with the storage of hot water. next steps for 2018 − conduct a customer trial to analyse the impact of de-scaling management on heat exchanger efficiency − assess the impact of single use systems on energy and water savings in the biotechnology industry − complete a customer trial to examine the energy saving benefits of using qdos pumps in a moulded fibre application − explore the feasibility of using watson-marlow technology to pump solid butter in a dairy application and assess the energy saving benefits sustainability report continued engineering sustainable solutions case study: spirax sarco australia helps customer reduce gas use by 23% in a drive to increase energy efficiency and reduce gas consumption at their meat processing plant in dubbo, new south wales, fletcher international exports identified steam system efficiency improvements as an effective way to

those arising from normal trading activity. these forward-looking statements reflect management’ s assumptions made on the basis of information available to it at this time. spirax-sarco engineering plc and its directors accept no liability to third parties in respect of this report save as would arise under english law. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. – in consultation with our internal valuation specialists we audited key assumptions based on external market data including the ebit margin, discount and short term growth rate. there is a significant risk due to the potential for fraud through possible manipulation of this balance. we focused our procedures on those components with a significant volume of trade in the final quarter. group materiality £9.8m pbt £192.5m component materiality range £2.9m to £3.9m

unrealised losses − annual improvements to ifrs 2014-2016 cycle including ifrs 12 relating to interests in subsidiaries and associates held for sale otherwise the accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to both years presented in these consolidated financial statements. identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at their respective acquisition date fair values. capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation (see below) and any impairment losses. depreciation is charged on a consistent basis with similar owned assets or over the lease term if shorter. basic and diluted eps calculated on an ifrs profit basis are included in note 10. further details on the tax effects of the change in us tax rate are included

acquisition costs of £10.3m (2016: £0.5m) and a foreign exchange gain on borrowings £2.5m (2016: £nil). a further reduction to 17% (effective from 1st april 2020) was substantially enacted on 15th september 2016. this will reduce the group's future current tax charge accordingly. net cash flows between any two currencies of less than £1.0 million per annum would not usually be considered sufficiently material to warrant forward cover. all gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. transactional (or non-structural) exposures give rise to net currency gains and losses that are recognised in the consolidated income statement. at this time the amount deferred in equity will be reclassified to profit or loss. a profit on derivative financial instruments of £0.2m (2016: £0.4m) was recognised in other comprehensive income during the period. as at 31st december 2017 no ineffectiveness has been recognised in profit or loss arising from hedging foreign currency transactions. the undrawn committed facilities available at 31st december in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date were as follows: 2017 £m 2016 £m expiring in one year or less 39.9 14.6 expiring in more than one year but no more than two years 70.0 52.0 expiring in more than two years but no more than three years – – expiring in more than three years – – total group undrawn committed facilities 109.9 66.6 fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities fair values of financial assets and liabilities at 31st december 2017 are not materially different from book values due to their size or the fact that they were at short-term rates of interest. over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings. at 31st december 2017 , it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the group’s profit after tax and equity by approximately £1.5m (2016: £nil). the movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows: 2017 £m 2016 £m balance at 1st january 12.2 10.3 additional impairment 3.1 1.9 amounts written off as uncollectable (1.7) (1.0) amounts recovered (0.2)
