Termination fee income is reported as a separately disclosed item given the materiality and nature. Amortisation is calculated, when the product or system is available for use, so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows: X Amortisation 10% on cost straight line Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately from third parties are recognised as assets and measured at cost. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets include temporary differences related to employee benefits settled via the issue of share options. Within SMS plc no existing contracts have been identified where more than one performance obligation exists. Occasionally, SMS plc also engages in some longer-term contracts which fall under connections revenue within the asset installation business – SMS connections accounts for approximately 7% of Group revenue and only a small proportion of this comprise longer-term contacts. As a lessor, the new standard does not make any significant changes to the way leases are accounted for currently under IAS 17 but it does provide additional guidance on what is defined as a lease.
