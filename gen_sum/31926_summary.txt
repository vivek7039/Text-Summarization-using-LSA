This performance has maintained a net debt to EBITDA ratio of less than 1x, in line with our Vision 2020 target. This year was an important one for Kier as we continued to make good progress against our strategy, Vision 2020. Importantly, our core operations not only traded well but managed to gain market share and deepen client relationships. Currently c.30% of our revenue is generated from clients that work with two or more businesses in the Group, a trend we aim to increase. These services – for example school and hospital extensions, road network maintenance – are required all year round, regardless of the prevailing political agenda. This should come as no surprise, because our people chose these values based on the qualities that matter most to them. These efforts include initiatives for ex- offenders, school leavers from disadvantaged backgrounds, former service personnel and workplace returnees. I believe that by looking at new ways to share ideas and solve problems, we can develop Group-wide solutions which will provide further growth opportunities. There is cross-party support for UK infrastructure spend, both to create this capacity and as a fiscal stimulus. Kier is well positioned to navigate macro uncertainty because of its strong market positions, customer relationships and financial strength. With increased focus on innovation, Kier is also looking at ways of using technology directly to improve operational efficiency and develop customer-centric offerings. 28% Average annual improvement in AIR since 2014 91% Improved BITC score 10% 2020 carbon footprint reduction target achieved early 19,741 Employee community hours Safe and sustainable Turn to pages 30-33 for more information Our strategy in action As part of Kier’s corporate responsibility strategy, Kier has a goal to reduce its use of energy by 30% by 2030. › Our Residential division established a joint venture with Cross Keys Homes to enable more efficient use of capital.

RBPO is not only a strategic priority in its own right but enables the delivery of several important objectives. While these areas will always be important, there is an increasing emphasis on social value in public procurement contracts. This is illustrated by the approach we took last year to simplify and then roll-out our Code of Conduct. A copy of the code was provided to all employees and Kier is now delivering supplementary relevant training. 2014 2015 2016 2017 Accident incidence rate (AIR) HSE Benchmark 0 100 200 300 400 500 Kier AIR 32 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 Diversity 1 Male – 77% Female – 23% Recognising our responsibilities Our stakeholders have worked with us to identify material issues that help define us as a responsible and sustainable business in the communities where we operate. We operate in sectors where there is strong competition for skilled workers and which are likely to be disrupted by new technology. › We maintain a disciplined focus on honing the portfolio by divesting non-core businesses and making acquisitions in line with strategy. › In further mitigation of this risk, the Group’s commercial training programme for all front line staff has progressed positively. Instead, greater volatility materialised in this market providing a number of opportunities post the Brexit vote for our Property division.

With greater budgetary challenges, there is an increasing trend for public sector clients to procure capital building works through frameworks. The acquisition builds on Kier’s strategy to accelerate growth and hold leading positions in its chosen markets. With UK population growth expected to increase, the demand for services is increasing across a broad range of markets including water, energy and telecoms. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 49 Property services – Housing maintenance The sector continues to undergo significant change, with social landlords challenged by budget reductions and the recently introduced Universal Credit arrangements providing impetus to review how housing associations manage their portfolios. This provides good long-term visibility of our workload, with potential extensions adding a further £2.5bn, which is more than 90% target revenue secured for FY18. Total units completed increased by 3% to 2,200 of which two-thirds were generated from mixed tenure businesses where the division operates in partnership with local authorities, registered providers and other clients. Firstly, that year end net debt (including finance leases) will be less than earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA). Secondly, that peak net debt will be less than the Group’s combined investment in property and residential assets. The Group advances into 2018 with a strong balance sheet and focused operations whilst maintaining its strict risk management disciplines. Actual facility usage is monitored on a daily basis, with non-treasury cash, primarily within joint venture accounts, consolidated weekly.

Our audit approach Overview › £6.3m (2016: £6.2m) – Group financial statements › Based on 5% of consolidated profit before tax from continuing operations excluding non-underlying items. We did not encounter any issues through our audit procedures that indicated the land or properties tested were impaired. Our work identified certain items that management had classified as non-underlying which we considered to be more judgemental in nature than others. All five reporting divisions are cons idered financially significant and were in scope for the Group au dit. Our audit approach was designed to obtain coverage over 95% of the Group’s revenue which in cluded UK and overseas operations. We believe that underlying profit before tax is the most appropriate measure as it eliminates any disproportionate effect of exceptional charges and provides a consistent year-on-year basis for our work. They have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments which are stated at their fair value. 118 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 Kier Group plc | www.kier.co.uk 119 The general principles for profit recognition are as follows: › Profits on short duration contracts are taken when the contract is complete; › Profits on other contracts are recognised on a percentage of completion basis when the contract’s outcome can be estimated reliably; › Provision is made for losses incurred or foreseen in bringing the contract to completion as soon as they become apparent; › Claims receivable are recognised as income when received or certified for payment, except that in preparing contract forecasts to completion, a prudent and reasonable evaluation of claims receivable may be included to mitigate foreseeable losses and only to the extent that there is reasonable certainty of recovery; and › Variations and compensation events are included in forecasts to completion when it is considered highly probable that they will be recovered. Profit is recognised on a site-by-site basis by reference to the expected out- turn result from each site. Re-measurements of the net defined pension liability, including actuarial gains and losses, are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. The scheme awards to senior employees a number of shares which will vest after three years if particular criteria are met. Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated at their initial cost reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Trade payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land purchases, are discounted and recorded at their present value. At 30 June 2017 the aggregate amount outstanding on these intere st- bearing debts against which interest rate derivatives are held is £82.9m (2016: £121.9m). Other joint venture disposals On 13 July 2016, the Group disposed of its investment in Saudi Comedat Company Limited for £4.6m. 8 Joint operations are contracted agreements to co-operate on a specific project which is an extension of the Group’s existing business.
