complete; › profits on other contracts are recognised on a percentage of completion basis when the contract’s outcome can be estimated reliably; › provision is made for losses incurred or foreseen in bringing the contract to completion as soon as they become apparent; › claims receivable are recognised as income when received or certified for payment, except that in preparing contract forecasts to completion, a prudent and reasonable evaluation of claims receivable may be included to mitigate foreseeable losses and only to the extent that there is reasonable certainty of recovery; and › variations and compensation events are included in forecasts to completion when it is considered highly probable that they will be recovered. the scheme awards to senior employees a number of shares
