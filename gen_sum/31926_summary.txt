strategy i am honoured and delighted to be the newly appointed chairman of kier. this performance has maintained a net debt to ebitda ratio of less than 1x, in line with our vision 2020 target. this acquisition builds on kier’s strategy to maintain its leading positions in chosen markets. importantly, our core operations not only traded well but managed to gain market share and deepen client relationships. in 2017, we increased the number of visible leadership tours to help refocus attention on safety. there are very few uk competitors who can match the breadth and scale of services we offer. currently c.30% of our revenue is generated from clients that work with two or more businesses in the group, a trend we aim to increase. these services – for example school and hospital extensions, road network maintenance – are required all year round, regardless of the prevailing political agenda. even with major projects that require government intervention and approval, our position is somewhat protected. strategic report chief executive’s strategic review continued for example, if there were delays in major capital works due to brexit, funds are likely to be redeployed into other areas – such as power distribution and utilities – where our core infrastructure businesses operate. this should come as no surprise, because our people chose these values based on the qualities that matter most to them. this activity will also help to recruit older students for our apprenticeship programmes and graduate schemes. these efforts include initiatives for ex- offenders, school leavers from disadvantaged backgrounds, former service personnel and workplace returnees. we remain focused on delivering our vision 2020 strategy – continuing to develop the business remains a priority. i believe that by looking at new ways to share ideas and solve problems, we can develop group-wide solutions which will provide further growth opportunities. there is cross-party support for uk infrastructure spend, both to create this capacity and as a fiscal stimulus. kier is well positioned to navigate macro uncertainty because of its strong market positions, customer relationships and financial strength. with increased focus on innovation, kier is also looking at ways of using technology directly to improve operational efficiency and develop customer-centric offerings. › create a supply chain portal to help suppliers understand kier standards, process and safe systems of work. › introduced front-line it systems in our services division, to drive efficiency and improve customer response times. › our residential division established a joint venture with cross keys homes to enable more efficient use of capital. › continue use of joint ventures in our property division to

there is an increasing emphasis on social value in public procurement contracts. rbpo has four themes that directly support vision 2020, each with five performance areas (see table opposite). this is

increasingly focused on mixed tenure development, with two-thirds of its activity working with local authorities, housing associations and other clients. the launch of joint ventures such as new communities partnership and northern ventures in 2016 has generated significant interest and discussion with local authority partners as they seek new ways to extract value from their land assets. with greater budgetary challenges, there is an increasing trend for public sector clients to procure capital building works through frameworks. in the education sector, over £200m worth of projects have been awarded or are at preferred bidder status. given the higher risk profile of some infrastructure contracts, the business is focused on improving margins by winning high quality work with repeat key clients, whilst continuing to focus on risk management, contract terms and conditions and cash performance. the division has a well balanced workload, split equally between private and public sector clients. we expect the current level of spending to continue with funding for road investment strategy 1 remaining positive. the acquisition builds on kier’s strategy to accelerate growth and hold leading positions in its chosen markets. with uk population growth expected to increase, the demand for services is increasing across a broad range of markets including water, energy and telecoms. strategic report governance financial statements kier group plc | report and accounts 2017 49 property services – housing maintenance the sector continues to undergo significant change, with social landlords challenged by budget reductions and the recently introduced universal credit arrangements providing impetus to review how housing associations manage their portfolios. against a backdrop of financial pressures for our clients, there are opportunities to discuss future procurement models, as well as look at opportunities arising from the new mayoral authorities, which will result in greater regional budgetary control and increased collaboration between authorities. this provides good long-term visibility of our workload, with potential extensions adding a further £2.5bn, which is more than 90% target revenue secured for fy18. group revenues, including the share of joint ventures, have increased by 5% with all divisions reporting organic growth. total units completed increased by 3% to 2,200 of which two-thirds were generated from mixed tenure businesses where the division operates in partnership with local authorities, registered providers and other clients. ifrs15 will impact on a number of judgemental areas currently accounted for under ias11 ‘construction contracts’ and ias18 ‘revenue’. operating lease charges included in administrative

year end net debt (including finance leases) will be less than earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda). secondly, that peak net debt will be less than the group’s combined investment in property and residential assets. during the year our working capital disciplines were maintained, with a small inflow of £4m being recorded. the group advances into 2018 with a strong balance sheet and focused operations whilst maintaining its strict risk management disciplines. the group continues to benefit from hedging against bond yields and inflation within the pension schemes’ asset portfolios, and this combined with a strong equity performance has seen total assets increase by £76m to £1,637m (2016: £1,561m) representing 95% (2016: 95%) of total obligations.

residential › we reviewed management’s expected build cost per square foot by comparing to the build costs for similar units on other sites and where there were differences, validating explanations against third-party confirmations including quantity surveyor cost estimates, correspondence with suppliers or comparable properties on other sites; › we challenged management on their intention to develop these sites; and › we challenged management’s forecast sales prices to supporting third-party evidence from management’s external sales agents and by comparing the forecast sales price of a sample of sales prices achieved and the list prices of comparable assets as published by estate agents. we did not encounter any issues through our audit procedures that indicated the land or properties tested were impaired. our work identified certain items that management had classified as non-underlying which we considered to be more judgemental in nature than others. all five reporting divisions are cons idered financially significant and were in scope for the group au dit. our audit approach was designed to obtain coverage over 95% of the group’s revenue which in cluded uk and overseas operations. how we determined it 5% of consolidated profit before tax from continuing operations and excluding non-underlying items. we believe that underlying profit before tax is the most appropriate measure as it eliminates any disproportionate effect of exceptional charges and provides a consistent year-on-year basis for our work. 114 kier group plc | report and accounts 2017

adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with those used by the group. it also includes the group’s proportion of work carried out under jointly controlled operations. 118 kier group plc | report and accounts 2017 kier group plc | www.kier.co.uk 119 the general principles for profit recognition are as follows: › profits on short duration contracts are taken when the contract is complete; › profits on other contracts are recognised on a percentage of completion basis when the contract’s outcome can be estimated reliably; › provision is made for losses incurred or foreseen in bringing the contract to completion as soon as they become apparent; › claims receivable are recognised as income when received or certified for payment, except that in preparing contract forecasts to completion, a prudent and reasonable evaluation of claims receivable may be included to mitigate foreseeable losses and only to the extent that there is reasonable certainty of recovery; and › variations and compensation events are included in forecasts to completion when it is considered highly probable that they will be recovered. where invoicing exceeds the amount of revenue recognised these amounts are included in deferred income. profit is recognised on a site-by-site basis by reference to the expected out- turn result from each site. re-measurements of the net defined pension liability, including actuarial gains and losses, are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. the scheme awards to senior employees a number of shares which will vest after three years if particular criteria are met. property inventory, which represents all development land and work in progress, is included at cost less any losses foreseen in completing and disposing of the development less any amounts received or receivable as progress payments or part disposals. trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated at their initial cost reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. trade payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land purchases, are discounted and recorded at their present value. the group enters into forward contracts in order to hedge against transactional foreign currency exposures. in cases where these derivative instruments are significant, hedge accounting is applied as described above. other key inputs in assessing each cgu are revenue growth, operating margin and discount rate. deferred tax liabilities are generally provided for in full and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is judged probable that future taxable profit will arise against which the temporary differences will be utilised. 8 retirement benefit obligations the group operates a number of pension
