financial forecasts approved by management. a change of 1% in the pre-tax discount rate, with all other assumptions held constant, would impact discounted cash flows by £24m. total cash consideration

bank facilities, which provide partial mitigation against balance sheet risk. at 31 march 2017, if sterling had weakened or strengthened by 10% against the us dollar (to which key middle eastern currencies are linked) with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been £0.3m (2016: £0.2m) higher or lower respectively. over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings. at 31 march 2017 it is estimated that a general increase of 1% in interest rates would decrease the group’s profit before tax by approximately £0.3m. neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements. the directors do not consider any provision is
