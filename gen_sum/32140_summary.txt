The Group has a strong balance sheet and substantial headroom under its banking facilities, which expire in September 2019. The Group operates a joint venture in Kazakhstan which has performed well this year following cyclical shutdown activity. Outlook These results demonstrate the success of our turnaround plan with significant improvements across all financial and operational performance measures. We have re-enforced the importance of providing customer excellence to our employees through a comprehensive employee communications and training programme. The system data enables us to quantifiably measure our levels of service and identify overall areas for improvement. Internal advocacy and engagement During FY2017 we re-launched our employee survey ‘People Matters’, last conducted in 2012, with a commitment to running this on an annual basis. During FY2017 we completed the roll out of new mobile Smart Devices for frontline colleagues who deliver and collect our assets from site. BIM allows the total energy footprint of our equipment to be detailed for use in public sector tendering. Contract wins By forging strong customer relationships we have won and renewed a number of contracts with our larger customers. t radePoint Partnership We are establishing new customer relationships through our agreement with TradePoint as their preferred partner for hire services. The survey achieved a 69% response rate which is an excellent result when we benchmark it against similar companies. During FY2017 we recruited apprentices into our Multi-Service Centre network to develop them through the Plant Maintenance apprenticeship, and they are working towards achieving an nVQ level 3 qualification. It’s particularly pleasing that during this period we collected our third ROSPA Gold award for health and safety. Some of these issues are occurring on a daily basis but can affect workers health for their whole life.

Future revenue has been secured through a number of contract wins and renewals, including an agreement with Carillion Plc, which in total could be worth up to £45m over three years. Overheads were tightly controlled, with the UK regional operating divisions restructured into two in order to increase efficiency and reduce costs. One off cyclical shutdown activity in Kazakhstan helped increase our share of profit from the joint venture to £1.7m (2016: £0.7m).

This revised Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be put to shareholders for approval in a binding vote at the AGM on 12 July 2017. In addition, the Remuneration Committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements to replace deferred or incentive pay forfeited by an executive leaving a previous employer. l ong-term incentive plans The 2014 Performance Share Plan (PSP) will continue to operate as the Company’s primary long-term incentive arrangement, whereby awards over shares will normally vest three years from grant, subject to continued employment and performance conditions based on relative total shareholder return (TSR) and earnings per share (EPS) growth. It is intended that Executive Director award levels in FY2018 will be over shares worth no more than 100% of salary. 3 No PSP awards held by Executive Directors vested during FY2017 (or after the year end based on performance to 31 March 2017).

The number of regional operating divisions was reduced from three to two, with consequent reductions in staff numbers and associated redundancy costs. A change of 1% in the pre-tax discount rate, with all other assumptions held constant, would impact discounted cash flows by £24m. Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings. At 31 March 2017 it is estimated that a general increase of 1% in interest rates would decrease the Group’s profit before tax by approximately £0.3m. 7 Registered office: Sector # MW5, Inside ESNAAD Base, ICAD-1, Musafah Industrial Area, Near National Petroleum Construction Company, PO BOX 127149, Abu Dhabi, UAE.
