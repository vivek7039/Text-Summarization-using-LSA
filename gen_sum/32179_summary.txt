within this total, there has once again been a significant improvement in customer quality, with 102,126 (2016: 76,764) residential members now taking all our core services (landline, broadband, mobile, gas and electricity). and although new suppliers enjoy a significant initial cost advantage by being exempt from certain policy costs, these cease to apply as they gain scale. since making these changes, the quality of new members being gathered by partners has remained exceptionally high, with over 50% switching all their services to us. whilst we welcomed their proposals to remove the current restrictions on discounts, bundling, and the number of tariffs each supplier can offer, we believe they are fundamentally misconceived in believing their proposed database of disengaged customers will achieve anything other than greater bureaucracy, more costs and increased confusion. we hope this proposal will be quickly abandoned once the mooted price cap on standard variable tariffs takes effect. chairman’s statement continued strategic report governance financial statements telecom plus plc report and accounts 2017 11 prospects successfully navigating the constant stream of changes flowing across all the sectors in which we operate is challenging, however our experienced senior management team have demonstrated a consistent ability to do so in a way which creates significant and growing value for all our stakeholders. our strategy of achieving consistent high quality growth through delivering savings, simplicity and exceptional customer service continues to bear fruit. we believe their approach is not only fundamentally unfair on loyal customers, but less likely to create a sustainable long term business, as customers who have chosen to switch once based solely on the headline price on a comparison site will have a higher propensity to do so again when their introductory deal expires; this view is supported by recent switching data within the electricity market for domestic customers, where reported churn amongst small and medium suppliers (excluding ourselves) is now running at an annualised rate of over 30%. financial review strategic report governance financial statements telecom plus plc report and accounts 2017 21 administrative expenses increased during the year by £2.8m to £55.2m (2016: £52.4m) mainly as a result of continued investment in growing staff headcount to sustain our current high standards of customer service as the business grows, and higher it related charges. this could damage the group’s brand and distributor confidence which might take an extended period of time to rebuild. this is proving to be very successful and we believe will play an important role in our long-term recruitment plans. we now have a nurse who comes in periodically to assist our staff with general well-being and health issues. participants can choose their own contribution level, which is matched by the company within certain limits, depending on length of service. since 2006, nick was group finance director of hanover acceptances, a substantial diversified private company with holdings in the food manufacturing, real estate, and agribusiness sectors. strategic report governance financial statements telecom plus plc report and accounts 2017 39 table of attendance at formal meetings during the year ended 31 march 2017 name of director board remuneration committee audit committee nomination committee number of meetings 10 3 3 - charles wigoder 10 - - - julian schild 10 3 3 - andrew lindsay 10 - - - nick schoenfeld 10 - - - andrew blowers 1 2 1 - - beatrice hollond 1 6 1 2 - melvin lawson 10 2 2 - michael pavia 1 4 2 1 - 1 michael pavia retired from the board on 22 july 2016, beatrice hollond and andrew blowers were appointed to the board on 26 september 2016 and 21 november 2016 respectively. however it recognises that any system can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. the committee believes this is best achieved by using share-based incentives granted at market value, and that issuing growth shares under ltip 2016 provides a far more transparent method of directly aligning each director’s interests with all shareholders compared with paying annual cash bonuses linked to short/medium term performance measures. non-executive directors are appointed for an initial term of one year which is then reviewed by the board on annual basis thereafter. non-executive directors have a three month notice period and there is no provision for compensation if required to stand down. as such two new share option plans will be submitted for approval by shareholders at the forthcoming agm in july. these costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives of up to 5 years when each system is brought into use by the company. 9. deferred tax deferred tax recognised in the financial statements is as follows: group company 2017 2016 2017 2016 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 tax effect of temporary differences: accelerated capital allowances (1,212) (1,166) (1,216) (1,172) other short term temporary differences 14 16 14 16 employee benefits expected in excess of amount expensed 593 311 593 311 (605) (839) (609) (845) group company 2017 2016 2017 2016 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 at 1 april (839) (551) (844) (561) charged to the statement of comprehensive income 234 (288) 235 (284) at 31 march (605) (839) (609) (845) notes to the consolidated financial statements strategic report governance financial statements telecom plus plc report and accounts 2017 113 10. other non-current assets group company 2017 2016 2017 2016 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 hire purchase agreements receivable 3,174 3,330 - 3,330 loan to jsop share trust - - 2,275 2,275 trade receivables 7,523 7,020 2,705 2,492 other non-current receivables 4,036 3,450 3,688 3,450 total non-current receivables 14,733 13,800 8,668 11,547 unamortised bank loan arrangement fees 860 - 860 - total other non-current assets 15,593 13,800 9,528 11,547 no amounts receivable under hire purchase agreements are due after five years. in accordance with note (r) of the significant accounting policies, trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances. interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash receipts over the short credit period is not currently considered material.
