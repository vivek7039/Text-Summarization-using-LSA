with our more competitive market position, led to an increase in partner activity as we progressed through q4, taking full year customer and service numbers to 607,802 (2016: 598,613) and 2,288,918 (2016: 2,181,704) respectively – an increase of more than 107,000 services during the year. within this total, there has once again been a significant improvement in customer quality, with 102,126 (2016: 76,764) residential members now taking all our core services (landline, broadband, mobile, gas and electricity). if implemented, we believe these manifesto proposals will create a fairer energy market, with lower energy bills for millions of disengaged households who are currently paying more than they should, simply because (for whatever reason) they are not switching supplier on a regular basis. although undoubtedly positive for us, this gap still remains significantly wider than we would have liked, due partly to the continuing practice by some suppliers of simultaneously offering both an expensive standard variable tariff (‘svt’) and a cheap introductory fixed price deal, and also the decision by a number of new suppliers to price their energy at near zero gross margin in order to attract market share. and although new suppliers enjoy a significant initial cost advantage by being exempt from certain policy costs, these cease to apply as they gain scale. we have also taken steps to simplify our customer proposition, replacing the previous choice of benefits available to double gold members with an extra 10% discount on the fixed monthly cost of their broadband (including landline rental) worth between £31.80 and £46.79 per year. we remain focussed on growing our business to one million households (and beyond) over the medium term. outlook recent trading our annual sales conference took place on 18/19 march 2017, and was attended by over 5,000 partners. since making these changes, the quality of new members being gathered by partners has remained exceptionally high, with over 50% switching all their services to us. it appears that the incoming government is committed to introducing a widespread cap on standard variable tariffs. whilst we welcomed their proposals to remove the current restrictions on discounts, bundling, and the number of tariffs each supplier can offer, we believe they are fundamentally misconceived in believing their proposed database of disengaged customers will achieve anything other than greater bureaucracy, more costs and increased confusion. we hope this proposal will be quickly abandoned once the mooted price cap on standard variable tariffs takes effect. as previously highlighted, the financial benefits from this programme (excluding any timing differences which may arise between when costs are incurred and when they are recovered) will depend on the speed and efficiency of our roll-out relative to other suppliers. chairman’s statement continued strategic report governance financial statements telecom plus plc report and accounts 2017 11 prospects successfully navigating the constant stream of changes flowing across all the sectors in which we operate is challenging, however our experienced senior management team have demonstrated a consistent ability to do so in a way which creates significant and growing value for all our stakeholders. our strategy of achieving consistent high quality growth through delivering savings, simplicity and exceptional customer service continues to bear fruit. we continue to follow a different strategy to that of our competitors in both the energy and communications markets, focussing on delivering an integrated multi-utility proposition that includes three key benefits: savings (compared with the prices they were previously paying), simplicity (just one convenient monthly bill making it easier to manage a significant part of their monthly household budget), and service (delivered by our award-winning uk-based support teams). we believe their approach is not only fundamentally unfair on loyal customers, but less likely to create a sustainable long term business, as customers who have chosen to switch once based solely on the headline price on a comparison site will have a higher propensity to do so again when their introductory deal expires; this view is supported by recent switching data within the electricity market for domestic customers, where reported churn amongst small and medium suppliers (excluding ourselves) is now running at an annualised rate of over 30%. we are therefore broadly supportive of the nationwide smart meter programme, albeit we remain concerned over the significant additional costs that are being incurred as a result of an ill-conceived and sub-optimum rollout strategy – a cost that will ultimately be met by consumers. distribution expenses reduced slightly to £21.1m (2016: £21.4m), mainly reflecting lower energy commissions (following the reduction in energy revenues previously highlighted), partly offset by increased commissions paid to partners on the larger number of services being taken by our growing membership base. financial review strategic report governance financial statements telecom plus plc report and accounts 2017 21 administrative expenses increased during the year by £2.8m to £55.2m (2016: £52.4m) mainly as a result of continued investment in growing staff headcount to sustain our current high standards of customer service as the business grows, and higher it related charges. this could damage the group’s brand and distributor confidence which might take an extended period of time to rebuild. in order to maintain its competitive position, there is a consistent focus on ways of improving operational efficiency. this is proving to be very successful and we believe will play an important role in our long-term recruitment plans. we now have a nurse who comes in periodically to assist our staff with general well-being and health issues. participants can choose their own contribution level, which is matched by the company within certain limits, depending on length of service. since moving to an online member application process, we have increasingly reduced the amount of printed marketing materials we are using, and seen a significant increase in the proportion of new members choosing not to receive a paper bill each month. andrew rowed for great britain at the sydney olympic games in 2000, where he won a gold medal. since 2006, nick was group finance director of hanover acceptances, a

shareholders. however it recognises that any system can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. the committee believes this is best achieved by using share-based incentives granted at market value, and that issuing growth shares under ltip 2016 provides a far more transparent method of directly aligning each director’s interests with all shareholders compared with paying annual cash bonuses linked to short/medium term performance measures. telecom plus plc report and accounts 2017 56 how component supports strategic objectives
