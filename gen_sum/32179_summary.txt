over 600,000 members • encouraging launch of home insurance • over 1.7m led bulbs provided and installed free of charge in over 40,000 households throughout the uk • which? insurance we have recently started providing a branded home insurance service to members, offering competitive pricing and the convenience of paying their premiums monthly at no extra charge alongside all the utility services we are providing to them. this enhancement, combined with our more competitive market position, led to an increase in partner activity as we progressed through q4, taking full year customer and service numbers to 607,802 (2016: 598,613) and 2,288,918 (2016: 2,181,704) respectively – an increase of more than 107,000 services during the year. within this total, there has once again been a significant improvement in customer quality, with 102,126 (2016: 76,764) residential members now taking all our core services (landline, broadband, mobile, gas and electricity). in addition to being ranked amongst the top suppliers for all our core services (energy, broadband/telephony and mobile) in each of their sector surveys, we received recommended provider awards for both our broadband and mobile services. we attribute this to a combination of factors including a reduction in the gap between standard variable tariffs and introductory deals, increased investment by us in retention activities, and the steadily improving quality of our customer base. if implemented, we believe these manifesto proposals will create a fairer energy market, with lower energy bills for millions of disengaged households who are currently paying more than they should, simply because (for whatever reason) they are not switching supplier on a regular basis. although undoubtedly positive for us, this gap still remains significantly wider than we would have liked, due partly to the continuing practice by some suppliers of simultaneously offering both an expensive standard variable tariff (‘svt’) and a cheap introductory fixed price deal, and also the decision by a number of new suppliers to price their energy at near zero gross margin in order to attract market share. and although new suppliers enjoy a significant initial cost advantage by being exempt from certain policy costs, these cease to apply as they gain scale. we have also taken steps to simplify our customer proposition, replacing the previous choice of benefits available to double gold members with an extra 10% discount on the fixed monthly cost of their broadband (including landline rental) worth between £31.80 and £46.79 per year. we continue to increase our investment in it and have completed a number of important it projects during the year including strengthening our cyber-defences, pci compliance, launching home insurance, and preparing for the mass rollout of smart metering. we remain focussed on growing our business to one million households (and beyond) over the medium term. it is encouraging that despite the absence of ‘loss leader’ introductory deals for new members, the combined impact of our improved training courses, effective partner incentive structure, the unique multi-service proposition and attractive benefits we offer to our members, means we are continuing to see a consistently high proportion of new partners making a successful start to building their utility warehouse business. outlook recent trading our annual sales conference took place on 18/19 march 2017, and was attended by over 5,000 partners. since making these changes, the quality of new members being gathered by partners has remained exceptionally high, with over 50% switching all their services to us. it appears that the incoming government is committed to introducing a widespread cap on standard variable tariffs. telecom plus plc report and accounts 2017 10 our wholesale arrangements, retail pricing structure and low cost base mean the impact of this price cap (when implemented) on our profitability is likely to be significantly less than other major suppliers. whilst we welcomed their proposals to remove the current restrictions on discounts, bundling, and the number of tariffs each supplier can offer, we believe they are fundamentally misconceived in believing their proposed database of disengaged customers will achieve anything other than greater bureaucracy, more costs and increased confusion. we hope this proposal will be quickly abandoned once the mooted price cap on standard variable tariffs takes effect. as previously highlighted, the financial benefits from this programme (excluding any timing differences which may arise between when costs are incurred and when they are recovered) will depend on the speed and efficiency of our roll-out relative to other suppliers. chairman’s statement continued strategic report governance financial statements telecom plus plc report and accounts 2017 11 prospects successfully navigating the constant stream of changes flowing across all the sectors in which we operate is challenging, however our experienced senior management team have demonstrated a consistent ability to do so in a way which creates significant and growing value for all our stakeholders. our strategy of achieving consistent high quality growth through delivering savings, simplicity and exceptional customer service continues to bear fruit. we continue to follow a different strategy to that of our competitors in both the energy and communications markets, focussing on delivering an integrated multi-utility proposition that includes three key benefits: savings (compared with the prices they were previously paying), simplicity (just one convenient monthly bill making it easier to manage a significant part of their monthly household budget), and service (delivered by our award-winning uk-based support teams). we believe their approach is not only fundamentally unfair on loyal customers, but less likely to create a sustainable long term business, as customers who have chosen to switch once based solely on the headline price on a comparison site will have a higher propensity to do so again when their introductory deal expires; this view is supported by recent switching data within the electricity market for domestic customers, where reported churn amongst small and medium suppliers (excluding ourselves) is now running at an annualised rate of over 30%. by treating our members fairly, as we would like to be treated ourselves, we aim to earn both their loyalty (which delivers long term, sustainable revenues) and their enthusiasm for our business model (which creates growth through referrals). we continue to invest in our it systems, which enable us to integrate all the services we supply into a single monthly bill, supported by just one set of central overheads (including all administrative and membership support functions). we are extremely pleased with the further progress we have made this year in taking advantage of our multiple key points of differentiation, and towards securing our position as the nation’s most trusted utility provider. it gives our members the opportunity to achieve additional savings of between 3% and 7% on their shopping at a wide range of participating retailers, which they receive as an automatic credit on their next monthly bill from us. we are therefore broadly supportive of the nationwide smart meter programme, albeit we remain concerned over the significant additional costs that are being incurred as a result of an ill-conceived and sub-optimum rollout strategy – a cost that will ultimately be met by consumers. andrew lindsay mbe chief executive officer 12 june 2017 telecom plus plc report and accounts 2017 20 overview of results continuing

from adjusted profit before tax and adjusted basic eps. these negative factors were partly offset by an increase in telephony revenues, resulting from an increasing penetration of fibre broadband and some higher fixed monthly charges, and the overall increase in the number of services provided to members. distribution expenses reduced slightly to £21.1m (2016: £21.4m), mainly reflecting lower energy commissions (following the reduction in energy revenues previously highlighted), partly offset by increased commissions paid to partners on the larger number of services being taken by our growing membership base. financial review strategic report governance financial statements telecom plus plc report and accounts 2017 21 administrative expenses increased during the year by £2.8m to £55.2m (2016: £52.4m) mainly as a result of continued investment in growing staff headcount to sustain our current high standards of customer service as the business grows, and higher it related charges. overall, administrative expenses increased during the year by £2.8m to £55.2m (2016: £52.4m) mainly as a result of higher staff costs and increased investment in it, partly offset by the recovery of previously incurred smart meter rollout costs mentioned above. telecom plus plc report and accounts 2017 24 we believe our strong underlying cash flow, rising adjusted earnings and strong credit profile will enable us to refinance any remaining borrowings as they fall due, whilst maintaining a progressive dividend policy. this could damage the group’s brand and distributor confidence which might take an extended period of time to rebuild. in order to maintain its competitive position, there is a consistent focus on ways of improving operational efficiency. energy industry estimation risk a significant degree of judgement and estimation is required in order to determine the actual level of energy used by members and hence that should be recognised by the group as sales. this year we have introduced our own technical advisor apprenticeships, working with an accredited provider. this is proving to be very successful and we believe will play an important role in our long-term recruitment plans. we now have a nurse who comes in periodically to assist our staff with general well-being and health issues. participants can choose their own contribution level, which is matched by the company within certain limits, depending on length of service. since moving to an online member application process, we have increasingly reduced the amount of printed marketing materials we are using, and seen a significant increase in the proportion of new members choosing not to receive a paper bill each month. andrew rowed for great britain at the sydney olympic games in

committee report continued strategic report governance financial statements telecom plus plc report and accounts 2017 51 directors’ remuneration report annual statement dear shareholder, as newly appointed chairman, and in accordance with best practice, i am pleased to provide my first introduction to the remuneration committee report which appears in full on pages 51 to 73. the committee continues to believe that remuneration packages should be simple, competitive, align the interests of management with those of external shareholders, and both incentivise and reward superior long term performance in a highly transparent manner. the committee believes this is best achieved by using share-based incentives granted at market value, and that issuing growth shares under ltip 2016 provides a far more transparent method of directly aligning each director’s interests with all shareholders compared with paying annual cash bonuses linked to short/medium term performance measures. in relation to new directors the company will pay for reasonable relocation expenses where required. these shares are then expected to be retained for the director’s period of service. telecom plus
