INSURANCE We have recently started providing a branded home insurance service to Members, offering competitive pricing and the convenience of paying their premiums monthly at no extra charge alongside all the utility services we are providing to them. This enhancement, combined with our more competitive market position, led to an increase in Partner activity as we progressed through Q4, taking full year customer and service numbers to 607,802 (2016: 598,613) and 2,288,918 (2016: 2,181,704) respectively – an increase of more than 107,000 services during the year. Within this total, there has once again been a significant improvement in customer quality, with 102,126 (2016: 76,764) residential Members now taking all our core services (landline, broadband, mobile, gas and electricity). We remain committed to a progressive dividend policy consistent with the underlying strong cash generation of our business. We attribute this to a combination of factors including a reduction in the gap between standard variable tariffs and introductory deals, increased investment by us in retention activities, and the steadily improving quality of our customer base. If implemented, we believe these manifesto proposals will create a fairer energy market, with lower energy bills for millions of disengaged households who are currently paying more than they should, simply because (for whatever reason) they are not switching supplier on a regular basis. Although undoubtedly positive for us, this gap still remains significantly wider than we would have liked, due partly to the continuing practice by some suppliers of simultaneously offering both an expensive Standard Variable Tariff (‘SVT’) and a cheap introductory fixed price deal, and also the decision by a number of new suppliers to price their energy at near zero gross margin in order to attract market share. And although new suppliers enjoy a significant initial cost advantage by being exempt from certain policy costs, these cease to apply as they gain scale. We have also taken steps to simplify our customer proposition, replacing the previous choice of benefits available to Double Gold Members with an extra 10% discount on the fixed monthly cost of their broadband (including landline rental) worth between £31.80 and £46.79 per year. We continue to increase our investment in IT and have completed a number of important IT projects during the year including strengthening our cyber-defences, PCI compliance, launching Home Insurance, and preparing for the mass rollout of smart metering. We remain focussed on growing our business to one million households (and beyond) over the medium term. It is encouraging that despite the absence of ‘loss leader’ introductory deals for new Members, the combined impact of our improved training courses, effective Partner incentive structure, the unique multi-service proposition and attractive benefits we offer to our Members, means we are continuing to see a consistently high proportion of new Partners making a successful start to building their Utility Warehouse business. OUTLOOK Recent Trading Our annual sales conference took place on 18/19 March 2017, and was attended by over 5,000 Partners. Since making these changes, the quality of new Members being gathered by Partners has remained exceptionally high, with over 50% switching all their services to us. It appears that the incoming Government is committed to introducing a widespread cap on standard variable tariffs. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 10 Our wholesale arrangements, retail pricing structure and low cost base mean the impact of this price cap (when implemented) on our profitability is likely to be significantly less than other major suppliers. Whilst we welcomed their proposals to remove the current restrictions on discounts, bundling, and the number of tariffs each supplier can offer, we believe they are fundamentally misconceived in believing their proposed database of disengaged customers will achieve anything other than greater bureaucracy, more costs and increased confusion. We hope this proposal will be quickly abandoned once the mooted price cap on standard variable tariffs takes effect. As previously highlighted, the financial benefits from this programme (excluding any timing differences which may arise between when costs are incurred and when they are recovered) will depend on the speed and efficiency of our roll-out relative to other suppliers. CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT CONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 11 Prospects Successfully navigating the constant stream of changes flowing across all the sectors in which we operate is challenging, however our experienced senior management team have demonstrated a consistent ability to do so in a way which creates significant and growing value for all our stakeholders. Our strategy of achieving consistent high quality growth through delivering savings, simplicity and exceptional customer service continues to bear fruit. We continue to follow a different strategy to that of our competitors in both the energy and communications markets, focussing on delivering an integrated multi-utility proposition that includes three key benefits: Savings (compared with the prices they were previously paying), Simplicity (just one convenient monthly bill making it easier to manage a significant part of their monthly household budget), and Service (delivered by our award-winning UK-based support teams). We believe their approach is not only fundamentally unfair on loyal customers, but less likely to create a sustainable long term business, as customers who have chosen to switch once based solely on the headline price on a comparison site will have a higher propensity to do so again when their introductory deal expires; this view is supported by recent switching data within the electricity market for domestic customers, where reported churn amongst small and medium suppliers (excluding ourselves) is now running at an annualised rate of over 30%. By treating our Members fairly, as we would like to be treated ourselves, we aim to earn both their loyalty (which delivers long term, sustainable revenues) and their enthusiasm for our business model (which creates growth through referrals). We continue to invest in our IT systems, which enable us to integrate all the services we supply into a single monthly bill, supported by just one set of central overheads (including all administrative and membership support functions). We are therefore broadly supportive of the nationwide smart meter programme, albeit we remain concerned over the significant additional costs that are being incurred as a result of an ill-conceived and sub-optimum rollout strategy – a cost that will ultimately be met by consumers. These negative factors were partly offset by an increase in telephony revenues, resulting from an increasing penetration of fibre broadband and some higher fixed monthly charges, and the overall increase in the number of services provided to Members. Distribution expenses reduced slightly to £21.1m (2016: £21.4m), mainly reflecting lower energy commissions (following the reduction in energy revenues previously highlighted), partly offset by increased commissions paid to Partners on the larger number of services being taken by our growing membership base. FINANCIAL REVIEW Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 21 Administrative expenses increased during the year by £2.8m to £55.2m (2016: £52.4m) mainly as a result of continued investment in growing staff headcount to sustain our current high standards of customer service as the business grows, and higher IT related charges. This could damage the Group’s brand and distributor confidence which might take an extended period of time to rebuild. In order to maintain its competitive position, there is a consistent focus on ways of improving operational efficiency. ENERGY INDUSTRY ESTIMATION RISK A significant degree of judgement and estimation is required in order to determine the actual level of energy used by Members and hence that should be recognised by the Group as sales. This is proving to be very successful and we believe will play an important role in our long-term recruitment plans. We now have a nurse who comes in periodically to assist our staff with general well-being and health issues. Participants can choose their own contribution level, which is matched by the Company within certain limits, depending on length of service. Since moving to an online Member application process, we have increasingly reduced the amount of printed marketing materials we are using, and seen a significant increase in the proportion of new Members choosing not to receive a paper bill each month.

In addition, a review involving each director (excluding those who had joined during the year), was carried out. However, the Code requires that all directors of FTSE 350 companies be subject to annual re-election by shareholders. However it recognises that any system can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Committee believes this is best achieved by using share-based incentives granted at market value, and that issuing growth shares under LTIP 2016 provides a far more transparent method of directly aligning each director’s interests with all shareholders compared with paying annual cash bonuses linked to short/medium term performance measures. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 56 How component supports strategic objectives Operation of component Maximum potential value of component Performance metrics used, weighting and time periods Existing share plans (“Share Incentive Schemes”) and new LTIP (“LTIP 2016”) - continued LTIP 2016 Grants are expected to be made in a single tranche following adoption of the plan (although new joiners or promoted individuals may be invited to join at a later stage). Targets for Adjusted EPS are set by reference to internal budgeting plans and external market expectations. Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial term of one year which is then reviewed by the Board on annual basis thereafter. Non-executive directors are all subject to annual re-election by shareholders at the Company’s AGM each year. Non-executive directors have a three month notice period and there is no provision for compensation if required to stand down.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 95 (b) Basis of preparation (continued) The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to both years presented, unless otherwise stated. This will have been estimated by using historical consumption patterns, prevailing weather data and other industry information. These estimates are based on historical usage information adjusted for known factors such as variations in weather. Revenue recognition – Other services The Group also generates revenues from providing Members with bill protection cover, and CashBack cards. Financial expenses comprise bank interest and non- utilisation fees associates with the Company’s debt facilities. These costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives of up to 5 years when each system is brought into use by the Company. IFRS 15, as amended, is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018; it has not yet been adopted by the EU. Such deferred costs could be related to the provision of deliverables (other than mobile handsets) to customers that do not qualify as performance obligations and for which revenue is not recognised; currently such costs are generally expensed as incurred. Customer Acquisition revenues mainly comprise sales of equipment including mobile phone handsets and wireless internet routers to customers. DEFERRED TAX Deferred tax recognised in the financial statements is as follows: Group Company 2017 2016 2017 2016 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 Tax effect of temporary differences: Accelerated capital allowances (1,212) (1,166) (1,216) (1,172) Other short term temporary differences 14 16 14 16 Employee benefits expected in excess of amount expensed 593 311 593 311 (605) (839) (609) (845) Group Company 2017 2016 2017 2016 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 At 1 April (839) (551) (844) (561) Charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income 234 (288) 235 (284) At 31 March (605) (839) (609) (845) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 113 10. In accordance with note (r) of the Significant Accounting Policies, trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances. Interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash receipts over the short credit period is not currently considered material. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED) Liquidity risk The Group’s treasury management policies are designed to ensure continuity of funding.
