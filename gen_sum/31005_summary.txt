assessment revalidation has been completed on all our high risk sites and prioritised action plans are being implemented to address identified gaps. it also reduces maturation time thus enabling glove manufacturing lines to run at higher throughput providing manufacturers with increased capacity without capital expenditure, and additionally eliminates certain additives introduced to nitrile latex formulations reducing the risk of potential allergic reactions with end users. given the global mega-trends of urbanisation, aging demographics, evolving middle class, increasing mobility and the ever more stringent environmental legislation, there is increasing demand from the market for more of our speciality chemicals and for enhancements to our product portfolio, and we have invested accordingly with capacity as well as capability expansions in a number of our sites. • nitrile latex: 90ktes expansion of our pasir gudang (malaysia) site due for completion in late 2018 with a

in 2016 has been substantially completed with a number of actions taken this year: • our small manufacturing site in leuna (germany) was disposed of on 1 january 2018. this small site lacked the operational scale required for our manufacturing network and, while the site will continue to manufacture products for synthomer for a short period, its production will be moved to other facilities in our network in due course; and • during december 2017, we commenced a restructuring programme at our manufacturing site in ribécourt (france) to right size and simplify the site operations commensurate with its core activities of dispersion and spray drying redispersible powders. a new management team has been now put in place to take the site forward. university level sponsorship has been a core part of building synthomer’s technology and innovation capability. this year our phd sponsored student at manchester university successfully completed his studies and joined our r&d team in kluang, and in asia the group continued its collaboration with universiti teknologi malaysia (utm), where a masters level student has been sponsored to work on a synthomer defined emulsion polymerisation project. in september 2017, synthomer’s innovation group responded to the demand of end users and glove manufacturers by launching synovus ® , a ground breaking patented new product. this new product was warmly received by industry leaders at a dedicated launch event in kuala lumpur. we have now completed all the major construction work with commissioning later in 2018 when our installed capacity will increase by approximately 40%. we use a barrier based “bow tie” method to help management define and assess the most critical risk events. ico, cma, fca) investors and rating

storage facilities will be secured to both enhance security of supply and provide greater flexibility in sourcing key raw materials. single sourced materials are identified and inventory retained, where appropriate, to mitigate risk of supply chain failure. 2 technically qualified personnel and control systems are in place around the group to ensure products meet agreed standards. the group has a number of leading and lagging performance indicators which are reviewed monthly. malpractice reporting and whistleblowing protection are similarly covered in the group policy on protecting our reputation. we plan to enhance the existing e-learning modules with an improved monitoring process, refresher training, and roll out of additional compliance areas. we are working to ensure our data

that diversity helps me as i’m working towards becoming a chartered engineer with the icheme. synthomer will comply with uk gender pay gap legislation and has a diversity & inclusion action plan. incident root causes identified for further focus included poor risk assessment, human factors and asset integrity issues. the group publishes an annual corporate social responsibility (csr) report which is available on line. high hazard activities in particular were targeted and 4-eyes validation of all such work is now required. revised training packs were also developed for permit issuers that are being rolled out early in 2018. new indicators were developed to track and analyse progress, with specific focus on live monitoring of permit controlled work and control of high hazard activities. this is being supported by work such as the line of fire cards and video roll-out noted earlier. a reportable pse incident rate is now calculated that will allow for future benchmarking of

water consumption per tonne of production; and waste disposal from our sites. absolute energy consumption (based on primary rather than metered electricity) was up 1.6% whilst group production output dropped 0.9%. looking ahead, with several major capital investment projects underway, one-off construction waste figures are expected to influence 2018 performance. calculation methods all direct energy production from fossil fuels has been aggregated on a group-wide basis and converted to co 2e by using the appropriate defra emissions factors. in accordance with uk government guidance, factors used for 2017 reporting are based on 2015 validated data. vocs have been aggregated on a group basis and converted to co 2e using a factor of 11. this figure has been used by uk cia member companies since 2005 and is at the upper end of the range for vocs. 2. emissions to air have been calculated from the usage of all fuels, excluding transport fuel. they therefore include both direct emissions and indirect emissions related to bought-in electricity, steam, compressed air, cooling water etc., with the exception of transmission and distribution losses for electricity (these losses are in scope 3, this report is for scope 1 & 2). the online surveys were completed by non-board members who are regular attendees at board and audit committee meetings as well as the directors

united kingdom under the companies act. there are no other standards that are not yet effective and that would be expected to have a material impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions. cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under ifrs 3(2008) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that: • deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised and measured in accordance with ias 12 income taxes; • liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with ias 19 employee benefits; and • assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with ifrs 5 non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations are measured in accordance with that standard. acquired intangible assets intangible assets acquired through acquisition are measured at their fair value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, on the following bases: customer relationships – between 5 and 14 years technology – 10 years where necessary the fair value at acquisition and estimated useful lives for these intangible assets are based on independent valuation reports. exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the group’s translation reserve. synthomer plc annual report 2017 103 group financial statements group financial statements 2 significant accounting policies continued cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. determination of whether these assets should be recognised requires a high degree of management judgement and is dependent on management’s ability to project future earnings from activities that may apply loss positions carried forward against future income taxes. synthomer plc annual report 2017 107 group financial statements group financial statements 4 segmental analysis continued analysis by
