The product’s  unique qualities address key customer  requirements around manufacturing  efficiency, odour, colour and chemical  resistance. Strategic M&A Our experienced management team has completed   three acquisitions over the last two years which   have expanded Synthomer’s global reach and  strengthened its leadership in key markets. A rolling programme of Process Hazard Assessment  Revalidation has been completed on all our high risk sites and  prioritised action plans are being implemented to address identified  gaps. It also reduces maturation time thus enabling  glove manufacturing lines to run at higher throughput providing  manufacturers with increased capacity without capital expenditure,  and additionally eliminates certain additives introduced to Nitrile  latex formulations reducing the risk of potential allergic reactions  with end users. These will include both bolt-on  acquisitions, similar to the ones we have completed, and more  transformational step-change strategic transactions in adjacent  chemistries. Our experienced M&A and due diligence teams will  be opportunistic but disciplined in their approach to acquisitions.

The segment achieved an improved overall margin, driven by  higher unit margins in our SBR and Specialities businesses. This year our  PhD sponsored student at Manchester University successfully  completed his studies and joined our R&D Team in Kluang, and in  Asia the Group continued its collaboration with Universiti Teknologi  Malaysia (UTM), where a Masters Level student has been sponsored  to work on a Synthomer defined emulsion polymerisation project. In September 2017, Synthomer’s  Innovation Group responded to the demand of end users and glove  manufacturers by launching SyNovus ® , a ground breaking patented  new product. This new product was warmly  received by industry leaders at a dedicated launch event in Kuala  Lumpur. We have now completed all the major construction work  with commissioning later in 2018 when our installed capacity will  increase by approximately 40%. We use a barrier based “bow tie” method to help management  define and assess the most critical risk events.

Incremental offsite storage facilities will   be secured to both enhance security of  supply and provide greater flexibility in  sourcing key raw materials. Single sourced materials are identified  and inventory retained, where appropriate,  to mitigate risk of supply chain failure. 2 Technically qualified personnel and control  systems are in place around the Group to  ensure products meet agreed standards. We plan to enhance the existing e-learning  modules with an improved monitoring  process, refresher training, and roll out   of additional compliance areas. We are working to ensure our data privacy  framework including reporting of breaches  meet the new legal requirements. 2 5    V The Group has a policy of hedging all  significant foreign exchange transactional  exposure at operating company level. Clara Colombo, Finance Manager/Mentee We offer an executive programme to our senior leaders in  partnership with CorPerformance, a company dedicated to   driving performance, improving personal resilience, enabling   lasting behavioural change, while actively reducing the long term  risk of disease in individuals as well as organisations. We are a diverse  organisation who employ significant numbers of employees  in Europe, Asia and North America. So for both those reasons, Synthomer ticked my  boxes and the opportunity to travel didn’t hurt either! Incident  root causes identified for further focus included  poor risk assessment, human factors and asset  integrity issues. This is being  supported by work such as the Line of Fire cards and video  roll-out noted earlier. A Reportable PSE incident rate is now  calculated that will allow for future benchmarking of performance  against our peers. Absolute energy consumption (based on primary rather than  metered electricity) was up 1.6% whilst Group production output  dropped 0.9%. Looking ahead, with several major capital investment projects  underway, one-off construction waste figures are expected to  influence 2018 performance. Calculation methods All direct energy production from fossil fuels has been aggregated  on a Group-wide basis and converted to CO 2e by using the  appropriate DEFRA emissions factors. At PwC, he  specialised in public and private equity transactions  across a variety of sectors including chemicals. Visits were made by individual non- executive directors to the Group’s plants in Sokolov (Czech  Republic) and Langelsheim (Germany). During 2017 the Board  held one of its meetings in Belgium and in conjunction with  that Board meeting visited the Company’s newly acquired plant  near Ghent where presentations were given by local senior  management and a plant tour took place. Lintstock is an advisory  firm that specialises in Board performance reviews and has no  other connection with the Company. The Group has nonetheless adopted a policy on equal opportunities,  diversity and human rights which is available at www.synthomer.com. We will also oversee the development  of underlying business information systems – and to look at  risk assurance mapping. We now have a dedicated  and focused in-house internal audit function, which draws on  specialist resources as required.

Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017  103 Group financial statements Group financial statements 2 Significant accounting policies continued Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are  recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. As disclosed in note 2, there are various conditions required by IAS 38 for an internally generated intangible asset to be recognised. This figure represents trade payable days for all trading operations within the Group,  calculated as a weighted average based on cost of sales. However, an actuarial valuation  of this scheme has been performed in the year, which concluded that additional contributions were required to address underfunding. Any such Fair Value adjustments are provisional and will be finalised within twelve months of the  acquisition date. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred  tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary  differences can be utilised.
