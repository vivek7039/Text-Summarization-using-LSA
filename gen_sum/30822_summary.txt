Online, our  premium content publisher and shopping  platform, intu.co.uk, continues to see  strong growth with sales through the  website increasing by 50 per cent. Corporate responsibility I have always believed that behaving  responsibly is fundamental to the best  and most sustainable businesses. In Spain, we now own three top-10  centres and are on target to begin the  construction of intu Costa del Sol. Our  challenge is no longer to build a business  in Spain – we are now an established  national player. Priorities in 2018  — grow like-for-like net rental income, currently expected to be in the  range of 1.5 to 2.5 per cent  — deliver new lettings ahead of previous rent and increasing rents  through the rent review cycle  — reduce vacancy rate year-on-year  Growing like-for-like net rental income Optimising our ﬂagship destinations intu properties plc  Annual report 2017 10 12 Our strategic focus going forward Making customers smile and helping retailers ﬂourish is what we do, and  operational excellence is how we measure our success. Hollywood Bowl, Flip Out and Puttshack  complete the leisure attractions, which along  with 11 new restaurants will further enhance  this family-oriented extension. Enclosing the  courtyard will enable trading from two levels  and add an additional 110,000 sq ft of   retail space. Our active asset management capital expenditure projects offer  attractive returns, with stabilised initial yield on costs of 6 to 10 per cent. These projects vary in scale but all focus on improving the customer  experience, whether it is retail, catering or leisure. Market overview Retail is a dynamic industry, and retailers  the world over are used to dealing with an  ever-changing environment. We are piloting new ways to employ   both our own data and that of third  parties more effectively. Demand is truly global, with Victoria’s  Secret from the US, Australian  accessories brand Lovisa and Polish  cosmetics store Inglot all expanding. Since we launched the  brand at intu Asturias there has been a 135 per cent rise in   net promoter score (NPS). This publicity helps us become the top choice when  customers think about where they want to spend their shopping  and leisure time. So now we are taking our random  acts of kindness concept online,   with the digital joy jar pilot at intu  Lakeside. Aimed at the grown-ups  this time, we use social media  monitoring tool Local Measure   in a geofenced area to spot people  who are sharing their celebrations  online. If they opted in, we can   reply to their message with   a positive response, offering   them an intu treat. Three The mobile operator’s  sponsorship of our student  nights gave them access to  120,000 students across 1 1  intu centres – and a 149 per  cent rise in SIM-only sales. We have a knowledgeable local team,  supported by experienced national  experts, who use their understanding   of the shopping centre environment in  general, and our customers in particular,  to create an iconic destination, lauded   by celebrities and locals alike – thousands  of social media mentions each month  show just how much intu Lakeside   means to its shoppers. We keep intu Lakeside at the top of its  game – great quality design, attention   to detail and a constant eye on where we  can improve the customer’s experience  means a relentless roll-call of new     projects that bring in more retailers,  customers and rental income. As a result of this initial work, in 2018   we are undertaking bespoke qualitative  research with our tenants and will be  introducing a net promoter score system  similar to Tell intu, to measure key points  along the relationship chain with tenants,  such as leases or shopﬁtting. Each year we host an annual  parliamentary dinner for MPs in whose  constituencies our centres lie, to discuss  issues of local importance.

Footfall numbers across  intu’s centres are captured  using a combination of  person or car counting  cameras located at speciﬁc  entrance and exit points  within the centre.

A ﬂight to quality has ensured prime yields  on assets with simple ownership  structures remain stable as investors look  at the quality and longevity of income  streams coupled with rental growth  potential in a market where new supply,   by way of development, remains low. Looking further ahead, the Bank of  England’s forecasts suggest that wage  growth will overtake inﬂation as we go  into 2018. Reﬂecting changing  customer preferences, over the last   ﬁve years, this market has increased to  around 13 per cent of total rental income. Over the same period, we have seen a  reduction in rental income from fashion  outlets to around 25 per cent. In  2017 we launched intu Accelerate, an  incubator for these technologies and  services, identifying start-ups to pilot   Hill respectively. We own all these  screens and, in many instances, produce  the content in-house – an area of growth  for us. In addition, we have three  development sites with the most  advanced project being intu Costa   del Sol, near Málaga. The investment market remains strong  with continuing investor conﬁdence in  Spanish real estate supported by an  economy that is growing. More than  one in ﬁve took advantage of the working  days intu makes available for volunteering  activity, double last year’s number. We work with our suppliers, retailers and  associated companies to ensure they   meet acceptable standards of human  dignity in their own sourcing policies. We work  with our stakeholders to address social  and environmental issues that deliver  value beyond immediate ﬁnancial return. In January 2016 Matthew also assumed  responsibility for intu’s centre-based operations Other appointments: Non-Executive Director  and Audit Committee Chairman of Marston’s PLC Adèle Anderson Chairman of the Audit Committee Senior Independent Director  Age 52     Appointed to the Board: 22 February 2013,  Audit Committee Chairman from 1 August 2013  and Senior Independent Director on 3 May 2017 Career: Adèle commenced her career at KPMG  where she became a partner and held senior  roles including Chief Financial Officer. 68 intu properties plc  Annual report 2017  Communication Directors are kept fully informed of  progress on key matters, including  operational and ﬁnancial performance,  between formal meetings. Our aim is to focus management on delivering sustainable long-term performance  and support the retention of critical talent. For a two month period they will be on garden leave but available as required to effect an orderly handover. Since 2009, a key driver for growth in value within the UK real estate market has been exposure to  central London properties. For additional context, the following two charts have been provided to show intu’s absolute total return (NAV growth plus dividends)  and total property return (capital value growth adjusted for capex and net income expressed as a percentage of capital employed)  over the same period. David Fischel also holds an  external appointment as a Non-Executive Director of Marlowe Investments (Kent) Limited, a UK private company which relates to  his family affairs, does not require any signiﬁcant time commitment and does not conﬂict in any way with his role as Chief Executive  of intu. John Whittaker does not receive a fee in  respect of his position as Deputy  Chairman and Non-Executive Director. A cash alternative may be offered   in certain circumstances, for example  where HMRC statutory limits have   been reached. We also considered the reasonableness of other assumptions that are  not so readily comparable to published benchmarks, such as Estimated  Rental Value, void rates and rent-free periods. Based on this legal advice,  discussions held with management and the Valuers, we concur that  planning status is now sufficiently advanced for a development   appraisal valuation methodology to be appropriate. We  have used underlying earnings  before tax and associates as a more  consistent benchmark, which is not  impacted by valuation movements. For share options an option pricing model is used applying  assumptions around expected yields, forfeiture rates, exercise  price and volatility. Underlying earnings is considered to be a key  measure in understanding the Group’s financial performance,  and excludes exceptional items. – Group as lessor  Investment properties are leased to tenants under operating  leases, with rental income being recognised on a straight-line  basis over the lease term. At each balance sheet date the Group reviews whether there is  any indication that an impairment loss recognised in previous  periods may have decreased. The valuers use this and other inputs including market transactions for similar properties to  produce valuations (see valuation methodology below). This is based  on evidence available at the date of valuation and does not assume future increases in market rent.

Prospective tenants are assessed via a review process, including obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial information,   which is conducted internally. Awards may be made in the form of nil cost options, a conditional share award or a joint share ownership award and fixed-value  zero-cost option, and eligible employees may be granted any combination of such awards subject to any individual limits. Conditional awards of shares have previously been made to executive directors under the Company’s annual bonus scheme. However, a debt service  cover ratio is assessed quarterly and where this falls below specified levels restrictions come into force. 3 Based on latest certified figures, calculated in accordance with loan agreements, which have been submitted between 31 December 2017 and 31 January 2018.
