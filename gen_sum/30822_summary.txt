been trialling a range of new ideas in our shopping centres, from robotic customer services assistants to an online personal shopper service. in spain, we now own three top-10 centres and are on target to begin the construction of intu costa del sol. our challenge is no longer to build a business in spain – we are now an established national player. priorities in 2018 — grow like-for-like net

both international and domestic investors. a ﬂight to quality has ensured prime yields on assets with simple ownership structures remain stable as investors look at the quality and longevity of income streams coupled with rental growth potential in a market where new supply, by way of development, remains low. this growth was partially offset by the 1.4 per cent impact of units closed for redevelopment and/or repositioning, mainly from the former bhs stores which are now substantially relet with excellent lettings to quality retailers such as next, primark and uniqlo. victoria’s secret, the us lingerie brand, and lovisa, an australian accessories store, have both added three stores. tenants have invested around £89 million in these stores, a signiﬁcant demonstration of their commitment to our centres. reﬂecting changing customer preferences, over the last ﬁve years, this market has increased to around 13 per cent of total rental income. over the same period, we have seen a reduction in rental income from fashion outlets to around 25 per cent. in 2017 we launched intu accelerate, an incubator for these technologies and services, identifying start-ups to pilot hill respectively. our in-house team, intu experiences, which generated income of £22 million, is crucial in delivering immersive brand partnerships, mall commercialisation and advertising which is complementary to the asset strategy of each centre and meets our quality standards. we own all these screens and, in many instances, produce the content in-house – an area of growth for us. in addition, we have three development sites with the most advanced project being intu costa del sol, near málaga. we have very strong interest from tenants and would anticipate being on site in the next 12 months. the investment market remains strong with continuing investor conﬁdence in spanish real estate supported by an economy that is growing. over the medium term, we see good reversionary potential, with further growth opportunities from key asset management initiatives which will enhance the centre’s status as a truly regional retail and leisure resort, drawing visitors from a wider catchment. nav per share includes a timing impact within retained earnings of 4 pence in relation to our spanish development partner eurofund’s expected future interest in the share capital of the

neither david fischel nor matthew roberts received a season ticket or other loan from the group during 2017 . since 2009, a key driver for growth in value within the uk real estate market has been

the reasonableness of other assumptions that are not so readily comparable to published benchmarks, such as estimated rental value, void rates and rent-free periods. based on this legal advice, discussions held with management and the valuers, we concur that planning status is now sufficiently advanced for a development appraisal valuation methodology to be appropriate. the assets and liabilities relating to intu chapelfield have therefore been classified as ‘held for sale’. we have used underlying earnings before tax and associates as a more consistent benchmark, which is not impacted by valuation movements. 105 financial statements 106 consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 31 december 2017 intu properties plc annual report 2017 notes 2017 £m
