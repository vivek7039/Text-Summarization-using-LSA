report 2017 strategic report compass group plc annual report 2017 4 the global leader we estimate that the addressable global food services market is currently worth around £200 billion. we have around a 10% share of that market by sales which makes us the leading global provider. the five sectors in which compass operates are: business & industry; healthcare & seniors; education; sports & leisure and defence, offshore & remote. the defence, offshore & remote sector offers significant opportunities to build lasting strategic relationships with large local and international operators. support services remains an important market for compass, particularly in healthcare & seniors and defence, offshore & remote. in these sectors, we are recognised for fulfilling the needs of clients who require excellent services with uncompromising quality. scale is a benefit in terms of food procurement, labour management and back office costs. that is why we segment the market into various sectors and sub-sectors using our portfolio of b2b brands. education — 18% of group underlying revenue from kindergarten to college, we provide fun, nutritious dining solutions that help support academic achievement at the highest levels. for our defence sector clients, we are a partner that runs efficient operations outside areas of conflict. i would like to thank them for their commitment and hard work during the year. there is still much more to do but i am pleased with the progress that we have made so far. i am delighted that richard will be succeeded by dominic blakemore, our former chief operating officer, europe. dominic became deputy chief executive officer on 1 october 2017, and will take over as group chief executive officer on 1 april 2018. in the ensuing period, he and richard will work closely to ensure a smooth transition. organic growth is occasionally supplemented by small and medium sized acquisitions that add capability or scale in our existing markets. we have a disciplined approach to long term growth and remain focused on delivering shareholder value. map 5: above unit overheads having reduced costs considerably when map was first introduced in 2006 by creating a simpler organisational model with fewer layers of management and less bureaucracy, we now strive to leverage those gains by maintaining overheads low whilst we continue to grow revenue. within this framework we promote the links between sustainable operations and long term financial success. we conduct regular employee engagement surveys that follow a similar format to allow comparison between different markets. scale is a benefit in terms of food procurement, labour management and back office costs. 2018 outlook our expectations for fy2018 are positive, with growth and margin improvement weighted to the second half. together, we have built the foundations of a truly great company, and i am confident that dominic will take compass onto continued future success. new contract wins include mayo foundation, university of cincinnati health system, cleveland clinic and arkansas children’s hospital. increased participation at some sporting events, with the benefit of additional playoffs, contributed to strong organic revenue growth. our improving new business performance reflects good levels of wins in the uk, turkey and iberia. these are not recognised under international financial reporting standards (ifrs) or other generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). adjusting for this, free cash flow on an underlying basis would have grown by £66 million or 7.3%. the borrowings in each currency can give rise to foreign exchange differences on translation into sterling. compass group plc annual report 2017 32 we therefore adopt an approach to tax that supports this strategy and also balances the various interests of our stakeholders including shareholders, governments, employees and the communities in which we operate. in an increasingly complex international environment, a degree of tax risk and uncertainty is, however, inevitable. we recognise that these risks remain important to the business and they are kept under review. all management meetings throughout the group feature a health and safety update as their first substantive agenda item. our business model is structured so that we are not reliant on one particular sector, geography or group of clients. a rigorous tender review process is in place, which includes a critical assessment of contracts to identify potential risks (including social and ethical risks) and rewards, prior to approval at an appropriate level in the organisation. service delivery and contractual compliance 2017 2016 the group’s operating companies contract with a large number of clients. regulation and compliance risk is also considered as part of our annual business planning process. in djsi robecosam, we scored 70% across all three dimensions (economic, environmental and social) which is well above the industry average of 39%. we will continue to set ourselves more ambitious targets and actively support the sustainable production of forest risk commodities through supplier engagement. having a responsible global supply chain is important for us to deliver the quality of food service which is a key business driver for compass and of paramount importance to our clients and consumers. this year, with a continued focus on embedding a strong safety leadership culture, we have achieved an improvement in our performance compared to last year, resulting in 15% less lost time incidents across our global business. • sadly, we had two work-related fatalities in our europe business as the result of vehicle accidents. the lessons learned are shared to ensure that other parts of our business can learn from serious events. • this year, audit results identified that some of our developing markets, including south east asia and latin america, required further support to implement effective controls. we have responded by investing in upskilling our teams and securing additional resource to help them embed the required operational standards. • many of our businesses have implemented wellbeing programmes to encourage healthy behaviours amongst colleagues and consumers. these include healthy lifestyle campaigns, raising workplace awareness of mental health and employee assistance programmes. we have established an organisational boundary, reporting on emissions originating from our top 20 countries, accounting for 94% of group activity by revenue. 2014 2015 2016

commitment to maintain a well defined and effective system of governance which supports our corporate strategy to deliver sustainable organic growth. board composition and changes as announced on 21 september 2017, dominic blakemore was appointed deputy group chief executive from 1 october 2017. following a period of transition, dominic will succeed richard cousins as group chief executive on 1 april 2018 and richard will retire from the group on 30 september 2018. the decision to appoint dominic as richard’s successor was taken after a rigorous selection process, more detail of which can be found in the nomination committee report on pages 65 to 67. in february 2017, susan murray stepped down from the board and its committees, having completed her nine year tenure as a non-executive director, and was succeeded by nelson silva as chairman of the corporate responsibility committee. in the run up to the company’s annual general meeting (agm) in february, votes were lodged against mrs vittal’s reappointment as a director based on concerns expressed by some shareholders that she was overboarding. we will endeavour to meet lord davies’ target of having 33% female representation on the board by 2020, which has been eroded by the retirement of susan murray, and will also consider sir john parker’s initial recommendations on diversity. he will take over as group chief executive on 1 april 2018. dominic will become a member of the corporate responsibility and nomination committees from 1 april 2018. key skills and competencies dominic has extensive financial management

indemnity would not provide any coverage where a director is proved to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly. the company has also arranged appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal action against its directors and officers. this was the second occasion on which ecl had conducted an independent, externally facilitated board evaluation. however, in accordance with the code, all directors submit themselves for annual re-election by shareholders. it is board policy that non-executive director appointments should last for no more than nine years. the group general counsel and company secretary also acts as an important focal point for communications on corporate governance matters throughout the year, but with a particular intensity leading up to, during and after shareholder meetings. governance and directors’ report corporate governance continued all of our shareholders are invited to attend our agm which provides a forum in which shareholders can put questions to the board and the committee chairmen. terms of reference are reviewed annually by their respective committees and updated when necessary to reflect changes in legislation or best practice. areas of focus as in previous years, our primary focus has been centred on key issues related to the group’s financial reporting, such as accounting judgements, internal control activities, compliance matters and the ongoing quality of related disclosures. external auditor kpmg has been the company’s auditor since 2014. in line with applicable legislation and best practice, no one can act as an engagement partner for a listed company for more than five years and, thereafter, there has to be a five year gap before the same individual can undertake that role in the company. the board has formal procedures in place for the approval of client contracts, capital investment and acquisition projects, with clearly designated levels of authority, supported by post investment review processes for selected acquisitions, client contracts and major capital expenditure. we have introduced improved global policy standards and colleague engagement materials designed to boost employee awareness of the potential risks resulting from unsafe driving behaviour. i am particularly proud of the progress being made related to farm animal welfare in our supply chain. this year, we appointed an executive sponsor to help shape our farm animal welfare policy. this policy and its supporting standards are part of a clear road map to help drive continuous improvement in our sourcing practices. a positive safety culture has been further reinforced by linking key metrics to the bonus outcomes of our global leadership team. we are actively piloting innovative programmes to encourage more inspirational safety leadership from our management teams, as well as exploring ways in which we can use technology to improve visibility of risks and hazards within our business. to help us improve visibility of any potential wrongdoing, we operate a free, independent and confidential helpline called speak up. you can find out more about our global commitments towards the 2030 goals on pages 38 to 41. each of the non-executive directors, including myself, as well as mr cousins, completed a survey in which we selected key past experiences and leadership competencies that we all felt were important to see in the next group chief executive. i am delighted that richard will be succeeded by dominic blakemore, our former chief operating officer, europe. dominic became deputy group chief executive officer on 1 october 2017, and will take over as group chief executive officer on 1 april 2018. in the ensuing period, he and richard will work closely to ensure a smooth transition. the recommendation, which the board approved, was that dominic blakemore should be appointed as deputy group chief executive from 1 october 2017 and that he should succeed mr cousins from 1 april 2018 to enable a smooth transition. compass group plc annual report 2017 68 strategic alignment of incentives we estimate that approximately 75% of the £200 billion 1 global food services market is currently serviced by regional or in-house providers and there is a significant structural growth opportunity. we are highly focused on our operating margin and the delivery of efficiencies to ensure profitable growth. our return on capital employed (roce) is, however, at a high level and so we believe that to place too much emphasis on further improving this rate of return on our capital risks having the unintended result of discouraging investments in profitable opportunities at attractive margins if it is dilutive to group roce in the short term. this results in an overall package with a larger proportion of remuneration at risk and improved alignment to the shareholder experience. given dominic blakemore’s transition to group ceo on 1 april 2018, our policy, if approved by shareholders, will be implemented for executive directors from that date. this means that salary levels for new appointments may be set below the market, and if so, they may subsequently receive increases which exceed those of the wider workforce for high performance and growth in experience over a phased period. for new appointees (such as mr blakemore) following the approval of the policy, this will commence with immediate effect and for incumbent executives, it will be on a phased basis starting in january 2019 over three years in increments of -5% per annum. we will extend the period by which executive directors are expected to achieve this revised level from four years to five years and will measure achievement pro rata over the five year period. 69 compass group plc annual report 2017 governance shareholder engagement in may 2017, we started our review process by inviting key investors to share their views on the existing remuneration arrangements at compass as part of an initial assessment process. compass group plc annual report 2017 70 carol arrowsmith chairman of the remuneration committee 21 november 2017 director changes details of the remuneration terms for mr blakemore, our incoming group ceo, are set out on page 81 and these are completely aligned to our proposed policy as described above. as a result, higher than average increases may apply in future to mr blakemore’s salary. we are using these efficiencies to invest in exciting opportunities for growth around the group. this led to a range of bonus outcomes as set out in the annual remuneration report. for gary green a salary increase of 4% is awarded with effect from january 2018. as previously indicated, johnny thomson was appointed to the role of group finance director below the market rate to reflect that this was his first plc director role. having engaged extensively with shareholders over the course of this review at critical points, we have taken a fully considered approach to devising these proposals. 71 compass group plc annual report 2017 governance governance and directors’ report directors’ remuneration report continued remuneration in 2016-2017 measuring performance measuring

salaries are reviewed annually with any increases normally taking effect on 1 january of each year. the performance measures and their percentage weightings may vary, depending upon a director’s area of responsibility. performance measures may include, but are not limited to, profit, revenue, margin and cash flow. awards will vest on a straight line basis between median and top quartile performance achievement. no share price growth or dividend accrual has been incorporated in the values relating to ltip. dominic blakemore and johnny thomson’s service contracts fully comply with the policy in effect from june 2008. all executive directors’ service contracts impose a clear obligation to mitigate such payment should a departing executive director take on new employment or receive alternative remuneration. all of the executive directors’ service contracts, with the exception of that of johnny thomson who was appointed to the board on 1 december 2015, and dominic blakemore whose
