The five sectors in which Compass operates are: Business & Industry; Healthcare & Seniors; Education; Sports & Leisure and Defence, Offshore & Remote. The Defence, Offshore & Remote sector offers significant opportunities to build lasting strategic relationships with large local and international operators. In these sectors, we are recognised for fulfilling the needs of clients who require excellent services with uncompromising quality. EDUCATION — 18% OF GROUP UNDERLYING REVENUE From kindergarten to college, we provide fun, nutritious dining solutions that help support academic achievement at the highest levels. There is still much more to do but I am pleased with the progress that we have made so far. Organic growth is occasionally supplemented by small and medium sized acquisitions that add capability or scale in our existing markets. MAP 5: ABOVE UNIT OVERHEADS Having reduced costs considerably when MAP was first introduced in 2006 by creating a simpler organisational model with fewer layers of management and less bureaucracy, we now strive to leverage those gains by maintaining overheads low whilst we continue to grow revenue. Together, we have built the foundations of a truly great company, and I am confident that Dominic will take Compass onto continued future success. New contract wins include Mayo Foundation, University of Cincinnati Health System, Cleveland Clinic and Arkansas Children’s Hospital. Increased participation at some sporting events, with the benefit of additional playoffs, contributed to strong organic revenue growth. However, the rate of decline has slowed in recent months and we expect this trend to continue into 2018. As previously noted, we are likely to see a continuing period of significant uncertainty in the international corporate tax environment. All management meetings throughout the Group feature a health and safety update as their first substantive agenda item. Our business model is structured so that we are not reliant on one particular sector, geography or group of clients. In DJSI RobecoSAM, we scored 70% across all three dimensions (economic, environmental and social) which is well above the industry average of 39%. We will continue to set ourselves more ambitious targets and actively support the sustainable production of forest risk commodities through supplier engagement. The lessons learned are shared to ensure that other parts of our business can learn from serious events. • This year, audit results identified that some of our developing markets, including South East Asia and Latin America, required further support to implement effective controls. We have responded by investing in upskilling our teams and securing additional resource to help them embed the required operational standards. We have established an organisational boundary, reporting on emissions originating from our top 20 countries, accounting for 94% of Group activity by revenue. 2014 2015 2016 2017 2014 2015 2016 2017 2014 2015 2016 2017 16,715 16,900 17,576 17,980 2014 2015 2016 2017 7.3 6.7 6.7 6.0 39 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED UNITED NATIONS’ SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS THE GLOBAL CHALLENGE OUR ROLE FOR EXAMPLE END HUNGER, ACHIEVE FOOD SECURITY AND IMPROVED NUTRITION AND PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE By 2050, the world’s population is expected to increase by two billion. Since 2014, our Imperfectly Delicious Produce programme run by our US business has used over 4.5 million lbs of imperfect fruit and vegetables that would otherwise have rotted in fields or been sent to composting or landfill for simply not meeting an artificial standard of attractiveness. Since 2010, we have worked towards a target that 100% of our units will provide Balanced Choices or similar healthy eating programmes by 2016.

BOARD COMPOSITION AND CHANGES As announced on 21 September 2017, Dominic Blakemore was appointed Deputy Group Chief Executive from 1 October 2017. The indemnity would not provide any coverage where a director is proved to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly. The Company has also arranged appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal action against its directors and officers. Terms of reference are reviewed annually by their respective committees and updated when necessary to reflect changes in legislation or best practice. In line with applicable legislation and best practice, no one can act as an engagement partner for a listed company for more than five years and, thereafter, there has to be a five year gap before the same individual can undertake that role in the Company. We have introduced improved global policy standards and colleague engagement materials designed to boost employee awareness of the potential risks resulting from unsafe driving behaviour. I am particularly proud of the progress being made related to farm animal welfare in our supply chain. This policy and its supporting standards are part of a clear road map to help drive continuous improvement in our sourcing practices. A positive safety culture has been further reinforced by linking key metrics to the bonus outcomes of our global leadership team. To help us improve visibility of any potential wrongdoing, we operate a free, independent and confidential helpline called Speak Up. This results in an overall package with a larger proportion of remuneration at risk and improved alignment to the shareholder experience. Given Dominic Blakemore’s transition to Group CEO on 1 April 2018, our Policy, if approved by shareholders, will be implemented for executive directors from that date. Share ownership: We increased the minimum guidelines for all executive directors to 200% of base salary with effect from September 2017. Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 70 Carol Arrowsmith Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 21 November 2017 DIRECTOR CHANGES Details of the remuneration terms for Mr Blakemore, our incoming Group CEO, are set out on page 81 and these are completely aligned to our proposed Policy as described above. Having engaged extensively with shareholders over the course of this review at critical points, we have taken a fully considered approach to devising these proposals. 71 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 GOVERNANCE GOVERNANCE AND DIRECTORS’ REPORT DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED REMUNERATION IN 2016-2017 MEASURING PERFORMANCE MEASURING PERFORMANCE STRATEGIC KPI BONUS WEIGHTING 1 LTIP WEIGHTING Growing and retaining our customer base and driving volumes Organic Revenue Growth (ORG) 25% – Delivering profit from our operations Profit Before Interest & Tax (PBIT) 55% – Turning profit into cash Adjusted Free Cash Flow (AFCF) 15% 33.3% Delivery against investments Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) – 33.3% Effectiveness of our Safety First culture Lost Time Incident Frequency Rate (LTIFR) 2.5% – Providing safe food and of the right quality Food Safety Incident Rate (FSIR) 2.5% – Delivering returns for shareholders Total Shareholder Return (TSR) – 33.3% 1. DILUTION LIMITS All of the Company’s equity based incentive plans incorporate the current Investment Association Share Capital Management Guidelines (IA Guidelines) on headroom which provide that overall dilution under all plans should not exceed 10% over a 10 year period in relation to the Company’s issued share capital (or reissue of treasury shares), with a further limitation of 5% in any 10 year period for executive plans. All of the executive directors’ service contracts, with the exception of that of Johnny Thomson who was appointed to the Board on 1 December 2015, and Dominic Blakemore whose service contract was restated with effect from 1 October 2017, were entered into GOVERNANCE AND DIRECTORS’ REPORT DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Remuneration Policy continued Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 82 before 27 June 2012 and have not been modified or renewed on or after that date. In such circumstances, awards vesting will normally be prorated on a time apportioned basis, unless the Committee determines otherwise. Non-executive directors are not eligible for pension scheme membership, bonus, incentive arrangements or other benefits, save reimbursement of travel costs. Details of all employee equity incentive schemes are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 68 to 94. This UN initiative encourages companies to make human rights, labour standards, environmental responsibility and anti-corruption part of their business agenda. We recognise revenue for each separate performance obligation in respect of food and support services as these are provided. Life insurance policies used by overseas companies to meet the cost of unfunded post employment benefit obligations included in note 20.

CRISP is a contracted-in money purchase arrangement whereby the Group will match employee contributions up to 6% of pay (minimum 3%). Within CRISP a new defined contribution section was established from April 2006 known as the Compass Higher Income Plan (CHIP). Employees who are not already in one of these registered compliant arrangements have been automatically enrolled into the National Employment Savings Trust (NEST). Other than where required by local regulation or statute, the defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants. However, it is generally accepted that the yield on these investments will contain a premium to compensate investors for this additional risk. The trustee manages these risks by holding approximately 50% of those investments in funds which are hedged against currency movements. The expected yield on bond investments with fixed interest rates can be derived exactly from their market value. Certain Group companies have taken out life insurance policies and invested in mutual funds which will be used to meet unfunded pension obligations.
