ideas into world-changing businesses. ip group is a leading intellectual property commercialisation company which focuses on evolving great ideas, mainly from its partner universities, into world-changing businesses. secondly, the group competes for capital to develop these great ideas into viable businesses against other investment opportunities. ip group has access to intellectual property from universities whose academic staff have published 16.8% of the world’s top research. when approaching new opportunities, potential funders, including the group, will often act in a collaborative manner through syndication of investment. ip group’s approach to building businesses is one of the ways in which it differentiates itself from more traditional venture funds. in the uk, the group also considers tax-advantaged enterprise investment scheme (‘eis’) funds to be an increasingly important source of financing for early- stage technology companies and has seen a strong operating performance from its new subsidiary, parkwalk, the uk’s largest eis growth fund manager focused on university spin-outs, which has strong links to leading institutional wealth managers and university partners. working with technology transfer teams and academics, we assess initial ‘disclosures’ for their potential commercial viability alongside possible exploitation pathways. as the
