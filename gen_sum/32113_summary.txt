Through this we will maximise value for our shareholders by delivering long-term sustainable growth in earnings per share and cash flow. – Post-investment performance of refurbished estate continues to be encouraging with like- for-like sales up by 6.8% on average. While there is much left to do, we made tangible progress across the year in key areas such as product offering, promotional effectiveness, brand perception, store standards and customer service. We are redressing this bias by substantially extending our offer in the hard flooring area to better reflect consumer tastes. As at the end of April 2017, we had refurbished an initial nine stores and they have achieved excellent sales growth post- refurbishment. Further improving our reputation and being readily identified as a brand that customers can trust is vital to Carpetright’s future success. We have supported this move with extensive brand sponsorship on UKTV featuring Lucy, who is a credible home improvement personality. Customer research shows this activity is yielding positive results on brand metrics such as awareness, trust and consideration. Trusted Trader’ status for our recommended fitting service is another important element to improving brand perception and ‘Making it Easy’. ‘Who we are’ also incorporates our new colleague uniform which was successfully rolled out last year to give teams a comfortable, contemporary identity. We have enjoyed particularly good growth in hard flooring as we have introduced ranges into all of our stores, with a clear product and price architecture, for customers from budget spend right through to £100 per square metre and over, with sufficient cross-over between categories to allow customers to trade up if they choose: – Vinyl – from roll stock, for the take away and DIY market, to premium quality sample vinyl which is specifically ordered for professional fitting; – Laminate – again in the budget, DIY take away form or in a new range of sampled product for third party fitting; – Luxury Vinyl Tile (LVT) has now been introduced across the estate, becoming our fastest growing category (albeit from a low base), offering customers the natural look of wood or stone but with the features and benefits of easy to maintain vinyl; and – Engineered Wood – a superior and more stable product than traditional solid wood, supplied to us by Kahrs, the leading Swedish supplier of environmentally friendly and sustainable flooring products. In carpet, we continue to strengthen our range authority as market leader, with a focus on all budgets, from £2.99 per square metre roll stock in our ‘Essentials’ range through to outstanding quality wool carpets from British manufacturers such as Westex, Brintons and Ulster. We have identified an opportunity to create exclusives that allow for differentiation of Carpetright versus the independent sector and our national competitors. As a simple guide, where a store team delivers 15% or more interest free credit participation, 50% plus underlay penetration and 75% or more “highly satisfied” responses under ‘Do We Measure Up?’ surveys, they can, on average, expect to deliver like-for-like sales growth 3% ahead of the total UK estate. Against this backdrop, we will not be diverted from our plan to transform the Carpetright business. Culture change is also something that has had to evolve over time – when practice becomes ingrained over an extended period of time, people can become institutionalised and resistant to change and addressing that has been the biggest challenge. Undoubtedly – we cannot do anything about the economy, what Government in its infinite wisdom throws at us or consumer confidence. I don’t have an ideal number, if the stores are making a contribution we want to keep them. An improved performance, with a profit growth and increasing market share, especially in hard flooring, whatever the economic conditions. The combination of volume and rate improvements led to cash gross profit in local currency terms increasing by 3.9%. 2017 £m 2016 £m Underlying profit before tax 14.4 18.3 Property related – Loss on disposal of properties (1.9) (3.6) – Freehold property reversal/(impairment) 2.2 (0.4) – Store asset (impairment)/reversal (0.4) 0.1 – Net onerous lease charge (11.0) (0.6) Strategy – Store refurbishment – asset write-offs (1.4) – Other – Share based payments (1.0) (1.0) Total separately reported items (13.5) (5.5) Statutory profit before tax 0.9 12.8 The charge reported in the 2016 Annual report and accounts was £4.5m.

Gross bank borrowings at the balance sheet date were £20.1m (FY16: £7.1m), being a combination drawn down from overdraft and revolving credit facilities. It achieves this through undertaking reviews which are approved by and reported to the Audit Committee. Should an individual become disabled while working for the Company, efforts are made to continue their employment and retraining is provided, if necessary. In October 2016 we introduced a new social learning platform, “Fuse”, which enables all colleagues to take control of their own development with access to bite-sized learning anywhere, any time and on any device, including the use of an app. In 2016 we started using Fuse as an additional communication tool, enabling us to reach all UK and RoI colleagues instantly for the first time. So far 80% of colleagues have engaged with the platform, and, on average Fuse receives 72,000 page views per day. We will review from time-to- time whether a specific human rights policy is needed in the future, over and above our existing policies. During the year ended 2017, we were able to reduce our electricity consumption by a combination of reducing store numbers, introducing LED lighting into our refurbished stores and installing motion- sensor technology to ensure lights are only being used when necessary. In his role as Chief Financial Officer he also has responsibility for property and supply chain activities. Directors receive weekly sales updates, monthly trading results, commentary, briefing notes and reports for their consideration in advance of each Board meeting, including reports on the Group’s operations, to ensure that they remain briefed on the latest developments and are able to make fully informed decisions. An external search consultancy is ordinarily used in relation to the appointment of both Executive and Non-Executive Directors. This is a new policy for the three years from the Annual General Meeting to be held in September 2017 and will be put to a binding shareholder vote at that meeting; and – Our annual remuneration report, which sets out how our current remuneration policy has been implemented. This alignment is (or will be, if the New Policy is adopted by shareholders) achieved through a combination of s etting appropriate performance targets, a retention period for vested LT IP awards and share ownership gu idelines which require executives to build up holdings of Carpetright shares. These guidelines, whic h are reviewed at least annually, require Executive Directors t o build up and maintain a target holding having a value equal to the same multip le of base salary as awards are made under the LTIP (150% for Wilf Walsh, 125% for Neil Page). Generally reviewed annually (with any change effective in May) but exceptionally at other times of the year. The Committee may decide that participants will receive a divide nd equivalent payment (in cash and/or shares). Neil Page and Wilf Walsh have contracts of an indefinite term, subject to a 12 month notice pe riod. Tax equalisation may also be considered if an executive is adversely affected by taxation due to their employm ent with the Company. It is understood that this principally related to the absence of a two-year post-vesting holding period for LTIPs. The awards will vest according to performance against the cumulative underlying earnings per shar e, as set out below: Cumulative underlying earnings per share over the performance period Vesting level % of award that vests (on a straight line basis between points) Equivalent to compound profit growth from financial year ending 2017 Less than 64.8p Nil 0% <14.8% 64.8p Threshold 25% 14.8% 79.2p Maximum 100% 22.8% Non-Executive Directors’ fees Non-Executive Directors’ fees have been reviewed and no changes were made. Darren Shapland stood down on 3 October 2013, at which point Lord Harris was appointed as full-time Executi ve Chairman. Wilf Walsh joined as Chief Executive on 21 Jun e 2014, at which point Lord Harris ceased to fulfil that role. The Company does not have agreements with any Director or officer that would provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover, except that provisions in the Company’s share plans may cause options and awards granted under such plans to vest on a takeover. Shareholders’ views There is a formal investor relations programme based around the results presentations and interim management statements. All Directors normally attend the Annual General Meeting and are available to answer any questions that shareholders may raise. A resolution seeking renewal of the authority will be proposed at this year’s Annual General Meeting.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognised to the e xtent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available agains t which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffer impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of impa irment at each reporting date. The Group has also reviewed any trading loss-making stores and provided for those leases considered to be o nerous. Other key assumptions for pension obligations, including mortality rates, are based in part on current market conditions. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimat es of whether additional taxes will be due.

Other intangibles are amortised and also tested for impairment when there is an indication that the a sset may be impaired. The sensitivity analysis is based on a change in one assumption while holding all others con stant. Other fi nancial instruments which arise directly from the Group’s opera tions include trade receivables and payables. The carrying values of all other financial assets an d liabilities are deemed to reflect fair value. (i) LTIP Under this scheme, participants may receive annual awards in the form of contingent entitlements to Company shares. Our analysis found that there had been a slight deterioration in the commercial property market from December 2014 to April 2017. This analysis is then assessed for other factors such as performance improvement plans potential property deals or closure of nearby stores which should positively impact the poorer performing store.
