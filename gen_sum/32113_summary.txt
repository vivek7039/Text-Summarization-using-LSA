through this we will maximise value for our shareholders by delivering long-term sustainable growth in earnings per share and cash flow. – post-investment performance of refurbished estate continues to be encouraging with like- for-like sales up by 6.8% on average. while there is much left to do, we made tangible progress across the year in key areas such as product offering, promotional effectiveness, brand perception, store standards and customer service. delivering a turnaround in these conditions is not easy, but we continue to believe that the strategic plan we are implementing will ensure the business better capitalises on its market leading position and provides resilience against weaker trading conditions. i am confident that these will deliver long-term profitable growth for the benefit of our shareholders. we are redressing this bias by substantially extending our offer in the hard flooring area to better reflect consumer tastes. as at the end of april 2017, we had refurbished an initial nine stores and they have achieved excellent sales growth post- refurbishment. further improving our reputation and being readily identified as a brand that customers can trust is vital to carpetright’s future success. our recruitment of lucy alexander, previously a presenter on bbc tv’s cult home improvement programme ‘homes under the hammer’, as carpetright brand ambassador in the summer of 2016 has been a key initiative in this area. we have supported this move with extensive brand sponsorship on uktv featuring lucy, who is a credible home improvement personality. customer research shows this activity is yielding positive results on brand metrics such as awareness, trust and consideration. trusted trader’ status for our recommended fitting service is another important element to improving brand perception and ‘making it easy’. ‘who we are’ also incorporates our new colleague uniform which was successfully rolled out last year to give teams a comfortable, contemporary identity. we have enjoyed particularly good growth in hard flooring as we have introduced ranges into all of our stores, with a clear product and price architecture, for customers from budget spend right through to £100 per square metre and over, with sufficient cross-over between categories to allow customers to trade up if they choose: – vinyl – from roll stock, for the take away and diy market, to premium quality sample vinyl which is specifically ordered for professional fitting; – laminate – again in the budget, diy take away form or in a new range of sampled product for third party fitting; – luxury vinyl tile (lvt) has now been introduced across the estate, becoming our fastest growing category (albeit from a low base), offering customers the natural look of wood or stone but with the features and benefits of easy to maintain vinyl; and – engineered wood – a superior and more stable product than traditional solid wood, supplied to us by kahrs, the leading swedish supplier of environmentally friendly and sustainable flooring products. in carpet, we continue to strengthen our range authority as market leader, with a focus on all budgets, from £2.99 per square metre roll stock in our ‘essentials’ range through to outstanding quality wool carpets from british manufacturers such as westex, brintons and ulster. we have identified an opportunity to create exclusives that allow for differentiation of carpetright versus the independent sector and our national competitors. as a simple guide, where a store team delivers 15% or more interest free credit participation, 50% plus underlay penetration and 75% or more “highly satisfied” responses under ‘do we measure up?’ surveys, they can, on average, expect to deliver like-for-like sales growth 3% ahead of the total uk estate. our strategy in response to competitor activity is simple and it applies in a variety of locations, specifically: – we refurbish our store with our new ‘graphite’ shop fit, effectively minimising the potential of any negative store environment factor; – we ensure the team are appropriately resourced for taking on the challenge of a new competitor; and – we introduce enhanced local promotions. against this backdrop, we will not be diverted from our plan to transform the carpetright business. it’s two years since you launched the new strategy – how much progress has been made? culture change is also something that has had to evolve over time – when practice becomes ingrained over an extended period of time, people can become institutionalised and resistant to change and addressing that has been the biggest challenge. do you have any evidence that consumers are now beginning to re-appraise the carpetright brand? “we have a clear plan with a robust set of actions which i think will mitigate some very serious headwinds which most retailers are feeling right now.” 14 | annual report and accounts 2017 the outlook for the uk consumer looks more uncertain – do the self-help measures being taken have enough potential for you to drive improved performance even if times in retail get tougher? undoubtedly – we cannot do anything about the economy, what government in its infinite wisdom throws at us or consumer confidence. i don’t have an ideal number, if the stores are making a contribution we want to keep them. an improved performance, with a profit growth and increasing market share, especially in hard flooring, whatever the economic conditions. these factors combined to generate underlying profit before tax of £14.4m (2016: £18.3m), a 21.3% decrease on the prior year. the average eur/gbp rate in 2017 was 12% lower at €1.20 (2016: €1.36); – measures to address intensified competition including a ‘free fitting’ offer in selected stores, an adverse impact of 60bps; – a dilutive impact of 30bps from product categories which attract lower average gross margins; and – a favourable impact of 150bps from the improvement in underlying floorcovering margin through improved sourcing, promotional planning and selected price increases. the combination of volume and rate improvements led to cash gross profit in local currency terms increasing by 3.9%. 2017 £m 2016 £m underlying profit before tax 14.4 18.3 property related – loss on disposal of properties (1.9) (3.6) – freehold property

group completed a refinancing arrangement of its principal facilities, providing £58.0m of debt capacity split between a revolving credit facility (rcf) and multi-option facilities (principally overdrafts) in a mixture of sterling and euro currencies. gross bank borrowings at the balance sheet date were £20.1m (fy16: £7.1m), being a combination drawn down from overdraft and revolving credit facilities. consequently, it can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. it achieves this through undertaking reviews which are approved by and reported to the audit committee. should an individual become disabled while working for the company, efforts are made to continue their employment and retraining is provided, if necessary. in october 2016 we introduced a new social learning platform, “fuse”, which enables all colleagues to take control of their own development with access to bite-sized learning anywhere, any time and on any device, including the use of an app. in 2016 we started using fuse as an additional communication tool, enabling us to reach all uk and roi colleagues instantly for the first time. so far 80% of colleagues have engaged with the platform, and, on average fuse receives 72,000 page views per day. we will review from time-to- time whether a specific human rights policy is needed in the future, over and above our existing policies. this includes scopes 1 and 2 but excludes any emissions from scope 3. the period used is 1 may 2016 to 30 april 2017. this code has been updated in order to make it clearer that modern slavery is unacceptable. we continue to benefit from the introduction of automatic meter readers for electricity and gas, which enable us to identify high-use locations and take corrective action where necessary, together with proactive management preventing us heating stores overnight. during the year ended 2017, we were able to reduce our electricity consumption by a combination of reducing store numbers, introducing led lighting into our refurbished stores and installing motion- sensor technology to ensure lights are only being used when necessary. it ensures that the development needs of executive directors and other senior managers are addressed appropriately. an external search consultancy is ordinarily used in relation to the appointment of both executive and non-executive directors. in each case the issues were investigated, a judgment was made and action taken where appropriate. the committee received a detailed audit plan from pwc, identifying their assessment of these key risks. pwc have been auditors to the company since 2005 when they were appointed following a competitive tender. this is a new policy for the three years from the annual general meeting to be held in september 2017 and will be put to a binding shareholder vote at that meeting; and – our annual remuneration report, which sets out how our current remuneration policy has been implemented. however, the committee decided that, for grants made this year, only one measure will be used. subject to commercial confidentiality, performance against these targets will be disclosed in next year’s report. this alignment is (or will be, if the new policy is adopted by shareholders) achieved through a combination of s etting appropriate performance targets, a retention period for vested lt ip awards and share ownership gu idelines which require executives to build up holdings of carpetright shares. these guidelines, whic h are reviewed at least annually, require executive directors t o build up and maintain a target holding having a value equal to the same multip le of base salary as awards are made under the ltip (150% for wilf walsh, 125% for neil page). generally reviewed annually (with any change effective in may) but exceptionally at other times of the year. annual increases generally in line with the level of standard increase awarded to other employees. bonuses are awarded by reference to performance against specific targets measured over a single financial year. these measures will be disclosed in the annual report on remuneration, where not deemed commercially sensitive. the committee may decide that participants will receive a divide nd equivalent payment (in cash and/or shares). neil page and wilf walsh have contracts of an indefinite term, subject to a 12 month notice pe riod. tax equalisation may also be considered if an executive is adversely affected by taxation due to their employm ent with the company. they are

accordance with ifrs. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognised to the e xtent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available agains t which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffer impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of impa irment at each reporting date. the group also receives discounts/rebates from certain suppliers for one off, targeted marketing and promotional events. the recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use calculations. the group has also reviewed any trading loss-making stores and provided for those leases considered to be o nerous. other key assumptions for pension obligations, including mortality rates, are based in part on current market conditions. the group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimat es of whether additional taxes will be due. the segment information provided to the board of directors for the reportable segments for the 52 weeks ended 29 april 2017 is as follows: 52 weeks to 29 april 2017 52
