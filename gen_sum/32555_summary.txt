capital (2016: 3.20 pence per share). the goodwill carrying value is more than supported by expected future cash flows discounted back to present day values. if sales are transferred to a replacement business centre in the same vicinity no such adjustment is made. if a business centre is opened where none previously existed, all sales for the first twelve months will be excluded. this policy has been extended to all colleagues through the provision of a saye share scheme. booker is an inclusive organisation where no-one receives less favourable treatment on the grounds of gender, nationality, marital status, colour, race, ethnic origin, creed, sexual orientation or disability. the promotion of equal opportunities for all employees is regarded as an important group priority. in the last five years we have donated over two million meals to local charities. examples of initiatives this year are: • following on from work started last year, 35 business centres, one distribution centre and two distribution centre freezer rooms have now been converted to led energy efficient lighting with a projected annualised average saving of 22% electricity per annum. we are pleased to report that video conferencing is now set up at all our main business locations. the increase was due to additional energy consumption of 13 gwh by booker retail partners, which is included for the first time for a full year, as well as an increase in gas usage during a colder winter period. page title booker group plc annual report & accounts 2017 / strategic report 12 corporate social responsibility report continued environment continued greenhouse gas emissions continued overall our total scope 1, 2 and 3 ghg emissions have shown a decrease of 7,418 tonnes, or 4% due to a marked reduction in refrigerant gas emissions and reduction in electricity from a change in opening hours and led lighting conversions. the award demonstrates booker’s long term commitment to successfully measuring, managing and reducing its carbon footprint. we have invested across the estate in balers, instigated waste league tables and continually focus on improvements. we seek to understand, manage and mitigate any issues associated with a particular commodity or country. its impact includes deforestation, habitat loss of critically endangered species and a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions. the marine conservation society has identified a number of fish species which are from unsustainable, over- fished, highly vulnerable or poorly managed fisheries. this could have an adverse impact on the group’s reputation, sales, operating profits and cashflow. we have well prepared procedures for crisis management in order to act quickly when required. substantial investment is made to improve environmental risk management, with a focus on energy efficiency when investing in new capital projects. the group produces a forecast three year business plan which incorporates projections for income and cash flow. special dividend since 2014, the company has annually returned capital to shareholders by way of a “b share scheme”. applications for employment and promotion of disabled persons are treated on the same basis as those from other applicants. prior to this he held senior executive roles with rothmans international and british american tobacco plc. he read economics at the university of cambridge and qualified as a chartered accountant with kpmg. arrangements can also be made through the company secretary for major shareholders to meet with newly appointed directors. accordingly, we agreed to recommend kpmg as statutory auditor until completion of the merger with tesco. the results were positive, confirming such areas as effective planning, appropriate focus on risk, continuity, commitment and integrity. accordingly, we agreed to retain kpmg as statutory auditor until completion of the merger with tesco. the committee believes that there are sound commercial and practical reasons for this work being conducted by the external auditor and that it is not of a nature which would affect its independence as external auditor. additional areas that are addressed by this procedure include criminal activities, improper or unethical behaviour and risks to the environment. this accords with grants made to our two executive directors, excluding charles wilson, in the 2 previous years. accordingly, the committee’s policy, in a competitive market, is to design remuneration packages which reward executive directors and executives fairly for their contribution. any such changes, should they occur, will be fully explained to shareholders in the next remuneration report. none booker group plc annual report & accounts 2017 / governance strategic

and tax (‘ebit’) bonus scheme, which is consistent with the prior year’s bonus scheme, covers executive directors, executives, branch managers and sales teams, comprising approximately 1,700 colleagues of the group. vesting for points between threshold and maximum is calculated on a straight line basis, as follows: • 50% of each award will be linked to an absolute tsr performance target with 25% of this element vesting at 8% growth per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting for 15% growth per annum, when measured over the 3 years from the award date. booker group plc annual report & accounts 2017 / governance 40 remuneration report continued fixed and variable pay mix individual reward elements for all executive directors (excluding charles wilson, chief executive, who does not participate in any incentive schemes) are designed to provide a balance between fixed remuneration and variable ‘at risk’ reward, linked to the performance of the company. the amounts shown in relation to bonus and psp do not take account of any share price appreciation or depreciation. as an alternative, the company may, at its discretion, pay in lieu of that notice. in such circumstances, the board may agree that an executive’s departure will be by mutual agreement. in case of resignation after financial year end but before award date, cash will be paid. notice periods would not usually be included when calculating the pro-rata amount of bonus and psp awards that vest. this group of approximately 1,700 people also participates in and receives payments under the ebit bonus scheme. further details are set out on page 18. all executive directors will stand for re-election at the 2017 annual general meeting. external appointments executive directors are not permitted to hold directorships or offices of companies whose shares are listed on a recognised stock exchange and, accordingly, no executive director serves as a non-executive director of any such company. in addition, the uk corporate governance code requires that all non-executive directors stand for re-election annually. director salary £’000 2017 salary £’000 2016 taxable benefits £’000

equity booker group plc annual report & accounts 2017 / financial statements 62 notes to the group financial statements 1. general information a) overview booker group plc is a public limited company incorporated in the united kingdom (registration number 05145685). strategic report governance financial statements booker group plc annual report & accounts 2017 / financial statements 63 e) new ifrs and amendments to ias and interpretations there are a number of standards and interpretations issued by the international accounting standards board that are effective for financial statements after this reporting period but have not yet been endorsed by the european union as follows: effective for accounting periods starting on or after amendments to ias12 ‘recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses’ 1 january 2017 disclosure initiative – amendments to ias7 1 january 2017 amendments to ifrs2 ‘classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions’ 1 january 2018 ifrs15 ‘revenue from contracts with customers’ 1 january 2018 ifrs9 ‘financial instruments’ 1 january 2018 ifrs16 ‘leases’ 1 january 2019 ifrs15 ‘revenue from contracts with customer’ – the standard was endorsed on 22 september 2016 and applies to an entity’s first annual statements beginning on or after 1 january 2018. the standard will replace ias18 revenue and ifric13 customer loyalty programmes. the model features a contract-based five-step analysis of transactions to determine whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. defined benefit schemes are accounted for in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary but significant estimates are required in relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension increases, inflation, investment returns and mortality that underpin their valuations. the group is party to a number of leases on properties that are no longer required for trading. all actuarial gains and losses were recognised as at 1 april 2006, the date of transition to adopted ifrss. subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that, following an assessment of the quantum and timing of future taxable profits, it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. the deferred tax assets and liabilities as at 24 march 2017 have been calculated based on these rates. b) budgens and londis – goodwill allocated £3.1m (2016: £3.1m) a pre tax discount rate of 12.0% (2016: 12.0%) has been applied to the projected cash flows. c) remaining business – goodwill allocated £448.9m (2016: £448.9m) a pre tax discount rate of 9.5% (2016: 9.5%) has been applied to the projected cash flows. fair value hierarchy the table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value, into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine fair value: • level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities • level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) • level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). the revolving credit facility bears floating interest rates linked to libor plus a margin of 0.8%. there is no difference between the discounted and undiscounted cash flows associated with trade payables due to their short term nature. the group has £160.7m of net cash as at 24 march 2017 and is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. 18. post employment benefits the group operates a variety of post employment benefit arrangements, covering both funded defined benefit and funded defined contribution schemes to provide benefits to both full-time and part-time employees.

investment risk: the present value of defined benefit liabilities is calculated using a discount rate set by reference to high quality corporate bond yields. this would be partially offset by an increase in the value of bond investments held. this would be partially offset by an increase in the value of index-linked bond investments held. this shortfall is expected to be recovered through returns on the scheme assets, and no contributions are required. the awards are granted in two tranches: i) earnings per share (eps) condition 50% of each award will be linked to an absolute eps performance target with 25% of this element vesting for achieving growth of 6% per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting requiring 12% growth per annum, as measured at the year end prior to the grant and then 3 years later. psp 2008–2013 the awards under these 5 schemes have all vested and 5.2 million remain to be exercised. the leases are typically of 5 to 15 years duration, although some have lessee only break clauses. at the balance sheet date, the group (including booker retail partners (gb) limited) had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: land and buildings others 2017 £m 2016 £m 2017 £m 2016 £m within one year 64.4 65.3 14.4 15.0 within two to five years 226.6
