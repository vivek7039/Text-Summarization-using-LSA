It should also help the Booker catering, retail and small business customer prosper in a challenging market. We launched Chefs Larder Premium Chips, these are gluten free and have already achieved sales of £4m. Customer satisfaction is a key measure within the business and we have made signifi cant progress since 2006. Every week we monitor prices versus competitors and during the year our price index remained competitive (see graph). Booker has consistently offered low prices on core products and maintains its promise of helping the customer during challenging times. Ritter had a good year growing sales through the Makro business centres and direct to customers. This helps our customers save money, increase recycling levels and support more sustainable communities throughout the UK. This is part of a longer term plan to up- skill and develop our future Butchery Managers who are all currently working through an in house Craft Butcher training programme, which has been developed with and is endorsed by The Institute of Meat. We currently have over 50 Drivers working towards becoming a Van or Large Goods Vehicle Driver in our Booker and Makro Business Centres. It should also help the Booker catering, retail and small business customer prosper in a challenging market. The goodwill carrying value is more than supported by expected future cash flows discounted back to present day values. If sales are transferred to a replacement Business Centre in the same vicinity no such adjustment is made. If a Business Centre is opened where none previously existed, all sales for the first twelve months will be excluded. Booker is an inclusive organisation where no-one receives less favourable treatment on the grounds of gender, nationality, marital status, colour, race, ethnic origin, creed, sexual orientation or disability. Examples of initiatives this year are: • Following on from work started last year, 35 business centres, one distribution centre and two distribution centre freezer rooms have now been converted to LED energy efficient lighting with a projected annualised average saving of 22% electricity per annum. We are pleased to report that video conferencing is now set up at all our main business locations. The award demonstrates Booker’s long term commitment to successfully measuring, managing and reducing its carbon footprint. We have invested across the estate in balers, instigated waste league tables and continually focus on improvements. Its impact includes deforestation, habitat loss of critically endangered species and a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions. The Marine Conservation Society has identified a number of fish species which are from unsustainable, over- fished, highly vulnerable or poorly managed fisheries. This could have an adverse impact on the Group’s reputation, sales, operating profits and cashflow. Substantial investment is made to improve environmental risk management, with a focus on energy efficiency when investing in new capital projects. The Group produces a forecast three year business plan which incorporates projections for income and cash flow. Special Dividend Since 2014, the Company has annually returned capital to shareholders by way of a “B Share Scheme”. Applications for employment and promotion of disabled persons are treated on the same basis as those from other applicants. He read Economics at the University of Cambridge and qualified as a Chartered Accountant with KPMG. The Board believes that it is appropriate to have a Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and Karen Jones has fulfilled this role since 6 July 2016. Karen Jones is available to shareholders where concerns have not been resolved through the normal channels and for when such contact would be inappropriate. The Board meets regularly on at least twelve scheduled occasions during each year and more frequently, if necessary. Re-election of Directors All Directors are required by the Company’s Articles of Association to submit themselves to shareholders for re-election at the first Annual General Meeting after their appointment and thereafter by rotation at least once every three years. Arrangements can also be made through the Company Secretary for major shareholders to meet with newly appointed Directors. Accordingly, we agreed to recommend KPMG as statutory auditor until completion of the merger with Tesco. The results were positive, confirming such areas as effective planning, appropriate focus on risk, continuity, commitment and integrity. Additional areas that are addressed by this procedure include criminal activities, improper or unethical behaviour and risks to the environment. This accords with grants made to our two Executive Directors, excluding Charles Wilson, in the 2 previous years. Accordingly, the Committee’s policy, in a competitive market, is to design remuneration packages which reward Executive Directors and executives fairly for their contribution. Any such changes, should they occur, will be fully explained to shareholders in the next Remuneration Report. None Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Governance Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 37 How the reward element supports our strategic objectives Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance framework Bonus (100% cash) Drives and rewards annual performance against financial metrics. Annual awards over Company shares, which vest after 3 years, subject to the achievement of corporate performance targets. There is no re-testing of performance targets under the PSP, and awards lapse if they are not met. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Governance 40 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Fixed and Variable Pay Mix Individual reward elements for all Executive Directors (excluding Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, who does not participate in any incentive schemes) are designed to provide a balance between fixed remuneration and variable ‘at risk’ reward, linked to the performance of the Company. The amounts shown in relation to Bonus and PSP do not take account of any share price appreciation or depreciation. In such circumstances, the Board may agree that an executive’s departure will be by mutual agreement. Notice periods would not usually be included when calculating the pro-rata amount of Bonus and PSP awards that vest. This group of approximately 1,700 people also participates in and receives payments under the EBIT Bonus scheme. In addition, the UK Corporate Governance Code requires that all Non-Executive Directors stand for re-election annually. In accordance with Remuneration Policy, Bryn Satherley’s award has been pro-rated for time served up until 31 March 2016. c) PSP Options Granted in 2015 Executive Director Award Date Maximum Shares Awarded Price per Share at Grant 1 Face Value of Award at Grant Number of Shares received if Threshold Performance Achieved Jonathan Prentis 25 Nov 15 499,242* £1.783 £890,149 124,810* Guy Farrant 25 Nov 15 476,804 £1.783 £850,142 119,201 Notes: 1.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 / Financial Statements 62 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. The model features a contract-based five-step analysis of transactions to determine whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. Defined benefit schemes are accounted for in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary but significant estimates are required in relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension increases, inflation, investment returns and mortality that underpin their valuations. The Group is party to a number of leases on properties that are no longer required for trading. All actuarial gains and losses were recognised as at 1 April 2006, the date of transition to Adopted IFRSs. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that, following an assessment of the quantum and timing of future taxable profits, it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. The deferred tax assets and liabilities as at 24 March 2017 have been calculated based on these rates. b) Budgens and Londis – goodwill allocated £3.1m (2016: £3.1m) A pre tax discount rate of 12.0% (2016: 12.0%) has been applied to the projected cash flows. c) Remaining business – goodwill allocated £448.9m (2016: £448.9m) A pre tax discount rate of 9.5% (2016: 9.5%) has been applied to the projected cash flows. Fair value hierarchy The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value, into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine fair value: • Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) • Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). There is no difference between the discounted and undiscounted cash flows associated with trade payables due to their short term nature. The Group has £160.7m of net cash as at 24 March 2017 and is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. Investment Risk: The present value of defined benefit liabilities is calculated using a discount rate set by reference to high quality corporate bond yields. This shortfall is expected to be recovered through returns on the scheme assets, and no contributions are required. Other provisions relate to third party property guarantees, for which the timing and quantum of payments is uncertain. The awards are granted in two tranches: i) Earnings Per Share (EPS) condition 50% of each award will be linked to an absolute EPS performance target with 25% of this element vesting for achieving growth of 6% per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting requiring 12% growth per annum, as measured at the year end prior to the grant and then 3 years later.
