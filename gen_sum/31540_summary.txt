meeting the needs of highly demanding clients for oil & gas, gaming, transport & infrastructure, and high security & public space applications, synectics engineers sector-specific, tailored security solutions that its customers rely upon to safeguard their people, facilities and assets – across the world. great technology, a flexible attitude and deep sector expertise – from decades of experience – are what set synectics apart. visit our investor website for up-to-the-minute news and announcements: synecticsplc.com we safeguard over 5 billion passenger journeys every year worldwide. monitoring vast, crowded facilities in low-light conditions where massive amounts of cash constantly changes hands creates a distinctive and challenging surveillance environment for our clients. our commercial and public sector customers require sophisticated yet user-friendly solutions to protect critical infrastructure, often in large scale, operationally difficult environments, which present great technical complexity. other underlying factors that influenced our results include a global gaming market that remained buoyant, increased demand from infrastructure customers, such as utilities, data centres and transport hubs, and a sharp decline in new bus deliveries in the uk. consistent with our growth strategy, the board has authorised a significant increase in research & development expense to capitalise on those opportunities. this is an organisation with a culture of high expectations for commitment and performance, especially in delivering on our promises to customers. our annual employee opinion survey last summer demonstrated high and upward-trending results across most areas of the business. throughout its 30-year history, synectics has consistently demonstrated the combination of deep technical capability and practical, expertise-based sales approach needed to benefit from such opportunities. the integration & managed services division continues to perform well, and we expect further growth in profits this year. we see an opportunity to provide sophisticated end users with real improvements in the capability, breadth and cost-effectiveness of their security systems. with its established customer base and trusted reputation for successful technical innovation, synectics is ideally positioned to benefit from the increasing pace of developments in the wider information technology sphere, which we believe can now be profitably applied to our markets. our strategy has always been to focus on a limited number of specific industry verticals for which security, surveillance, and control systems are absolutely critical, organisations where often the stakes could not be higher. today, we serve leading organisations in the transport, oil & gas, gaming, critical infrastructure, and retail sectors. pre-emption, too, is another strong theme as our clients assess the potential applications of artificial intelligence for anticipating threats and responding proactively. for example, hardware costs will continue to fall over time, as even the most specialist equipment benefits from new technologies and efficiencies. this combination of commercial stability and excellent growth potential makes synectics plc an attractive proposition for investors. the industry itself is in transition and we are successfully navigating our way through what continues to be an extremely tough market. consequently, they demand solutions that are rigorously proven under these circumstances, and which also satisfy the constantly changing requirements of compliance legislation. they must also facilitate remote monitoring and analysis, often thousands of miles away from the site itself. the system incorporates full hd class 1, division 1 coex™ c3000 camera stations to monitor both hazardous and safe area zones. darren alder, synectics’ divisional director for oil & gas, says: “to suggest it has been a challenging few years for the oil & gas industry would be an understatement, yet during this time we have continued to secure key contracts by offering tailored end-to-end solutions which meet precise needs, based upon our specialist technology. meeting the industry’s demanding regulatory requirements is a ‘must have’ – no casino can operate without fulfilling these responsibilities. casino operators value synectics for our ability to deliver ultra-reliable, scalable, end-to-end solutions, backed up by proven experience, industry knowledge, and technically expert staff who respond fast. today, we offer a turnkey approach that includes hardware, software, cameras and the integration of all these into one solution. each of these diverse clients has its own specific needs; running a city bus company presents very different challenges to operating an international airport. many customers are now looking for integrated systems and sophisticated applications whose capabilities go way beyond the minimum requirements. organisations responsible for transport infrastructures, whether urban mass transit networks or international airports, are engaging with many of the same issues. we offer smart, flexible, user-friendly solutions, founded on our synergy 3 software, to customers who have complex needs and face challenges which justify serious investment. this provides a better service for the customer, and avoids distracting the drivers from their ultimate responsibility, which is to ensure that passengers arrive at their destination safely.” strategic review 16 synectics plc annual report and accounts 2017 high security & public space integrated, turnkey solutions for urban environments our very first clients, 30 years ago, came from these sectors. synectics’ systems division serves these customers globally, while our ims teams at quadrant and sss operate primarily in the uk market. within this overall marketplace, synectics and quadrant support a series of more specific customer groups, each with distinct needs. these are more prevalent in sectors such as energy (including nuclear), defence, borders, custodial, heritage buildings, and universities. greg alcorn, synectics’ divisional director for transport & infrastructure, emphasises that the whole solution has been designed with both efficiency and operator support in mind: “for any customer of this scale, providing immediate understanding of an incident is essential, but this solution goes much further to give operators at the arc the support they need to protect such a vast number of sites.” 18 synectics plc annual report and accounts 2017 strategic review our proprietary technology it all started with three people working after hours in a research & development lab. today, our core technologies are applied primarily in four main sectors: oil & gas, gaming, transport & infrastructure, and high security & public space. offshore oil rigs, casinos, buses and power stations – the working environments really could not be more different. our view has always been that security experts deserve technologies which mould easily and intuitively around their requirements. where industry standard components are perfectly suited to the job in hand, we use what is already available and integrate it into our systems. synergy 3’s business intelligence engine, dataveillance, extrapolates data from multiple sources to deliver real-time or historical statistics and trend analysis. our management dashboards enable immediate access to critical data-driven insight.” david aindow business strategy director i

february 2018 28 synectics plc annual report and accounts 2017 performance review synectics’ systems division provides specialist electronic surveillance systems, based on its own proprietary technology, to global end customers with large-scale highly complex security requirements, particularly for oil & gas operations, gaming, transport & infrastructure protection, and high security & public space applications. oil prices have now roughly doubled from their lows of 2015/16 and early-cycle businesses in the sector are already experiencing significantly increased activity. nevertheless, a proportion of synectics’ revenue has traditionally derived from large-scale upstream projects, and these will take longer to ramp up. significant investment in a new operating system has allowed us to focus on providing actionable management information rather than just large quantities of data. these are not new issues but their profile and ambit have clearly risen in recent years, for reasons we all understand. with its emphasis on high levels of commitment and an ethos of never letting customers down, the work environment in the group is demanding, and can be sometimes unwittingly harsh on very good, uncomplaining people who always want to help. synectics also engages independent experts to conduct an annual survey of our customers, named or anonymous at their option. agenda items scheduled for every board meeting include strategy, business performance, operations, human resources, finance and governance. progress against these actions arising from performance evaluations is then monitored and reported on throughout the following year. individual meetings are conducted with those substantial shareholders who so request following the announcement of final and half-year results. governance governance 40 synectics plc annual report and accounts 2017 audit committee report continued significant financial statement reporting issues the audit

exposed to cost overruns and claims for contractual liabilities as a result of this failure. the group also uses other publicly available information and its own trading records to rate major customers. where possible credit risk is mitigated through deposit and milestone payment requirements which at least cover the cost of work performed. synectics will continue to focus on customer sectors where electronic security systems have a critical cost of failure, or an extreme environmental requirement, rather than the mass volume markets. in addition synectics will maintain a core of increasingly software-based proprietary technology giving higher-margin opportunities, and focus on developing recurring revenues. responsibility for implementing sound and effective systems of
