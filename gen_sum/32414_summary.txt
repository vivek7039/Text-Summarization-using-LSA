Accoya has properties that match or exceed those of the best tropical hardwoods, yet is manufactured from sustainable FSC ® certified wood. In addition, they benefit from all positive attributes of wood (sustainability, strength, beauty) without the downfalls (poor durability and stability). This represents a long-term and substantial growth opportunity, noting last year we sold 39,790 cubic meters of Accoya. SCALABLE GROWTH STRONG MANAGEMENT TEAM See pages 10 and 18 for further details of current additions to manufacturing capacity See pages 40 to 43 for details of the team Accoya boardwalk – Norway Visit our Investor Relations site at www.accsysplc.com/investor-relations ACCSYS TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 06 ARCHITECT CHOOSES MEDITE TRICOYA EXTREME FOR FLOATING HOUSE AND OFFICE-ARK First discovered during an exhibition in London, designer, Julius Taminiau, has created a floating house equipped with office space using Medite Tricoya Extreme. Within this total, Accoya wood revenue increased by 17% to €50.7m (2016: €43.5m) as a result of an 18% increase in sales volume, while licence and licensing related income decreased from €5.3m to €1.9m as expected, following the receipt of higher one-off fees in the prior year, including those from our Accoya licensee Rhodia Acetow. While it may take some time for Accoya to reach its full market potential, we are confident that continued strong sales growth can be generated. Accoya captures the market share in those applications which require rot, insect and water resistance, i.e. primarily outdoor products. Tricoya displaces alternative more expensive or less easily handled products and opens up major new market opportunities in the construction sector. We develop, motivate and retain a committed team with necessary skills to help us meet our objectives. Different species of wood will enable Accoya to be used for new purposes while opening up greater supply chain opportunities. SOLID WOOD WOOD ELEMENTS OUR KEY STRENGTHS OUR TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 15 Investment in R&D, People and Partnerships SUSTAINABILITY They are natural building materials with low maintenance and consistent qualities of the highest performing non- sustainable man-made materials. They benefit from all positive attributes of wood (sustainability, strength, beauty) without the downfalls (poor durability and stability). Desire to retain equity interest in manufacturing of our products where possible through partnership or consortium arrangements. The Tricoya process is based on our core acetylation knowledge but may present unexpected design issues requiring more complex engineering. Extensive field trials of pre- commercial products creating options for wider species use consideration when capacity is increased. Roll out corporate brand messaging through all communications to grow awareness of the Accsys Group and its sustainable vision.

Extensive field trials of pre- commercial products creating options for wider species use consideration when capacity is increased. Roll out corporate brand messaging through all communications to grow awareness of the Accsys Group and its sustainable vision. I would also like to welcome Martin Robinson, who joined our Senior Management Team in April 2017 as Head of Group Operations. We also expect to benefit from potential customers gaining greater confidence of Accoya’s enduring position in the market place. This success has led us to estimate Accoya now represents approximately 12% of the UK wooden window market. Sales of Tricoya to date have been relatively small scale for market development and based upon Accoya manufactured in Arnhem. By working closely with our distributors, direct customers and joinery companies we are now seeing consumers specifying Accoya too. Available for sale investments Accsys Technologies PLC has previously purchased a total of 21,666,734 unlisted ordinary shares in Diamond Wood China Limited. €18.1m net proceeds were received in respect of Loan Notes issued by Accsys Technologies PLC to Business Growth Fund (‘BGF’) and Volantis. No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. Per hectare, more cubic metres of radiata pine can be grown (20–28m 3 / ha/year) compared to slower growing wood species such as teak (6m 3 /ha/ year) or even most bamboo (10m 3 /ha/year). FSC certification is focused on benign environmental performance but also safeguards social interests for all stakeholders involved. Accoya wood also recently received Platinum status for Material Health meaning manufacturers are trusted with the way to communicate their work towards chemically optimised products. The aging units – 242 in total – had seriously suffered from fogging, failing glass, air leakage, and broken balances that rendered them inoperable. Experts in their fields, the Senior Management Team boasts a broad range of sector knowledge and specialism. After gaining further experience in private practice, he has since spent over ten years working in-house for growth companies, advising on a broad range of corporate, commercial and other business matters. He was appointed General Manager of Tricoya Technologies in 2012 and has led the company since its inception. • The Group’s forward-looking Directors’ Remuneration Policy which was approved by shareholders at our 2015 AGM and is therefore binding. 2 Represents annual bonus awarded in form of Ordinary shares, relating to performance for the previous financial year. The main principles are to: • ensure that salaries are set at a market competitive level by benchmarking against appropriate external comparators, • support high performance culture by rewarding upper quartile performance with upper quartile reward, • maintain an appropriate balance between fixed and performance related pay, • align long-term rewards with shareholders; and • ensure that the overall package reflects market practice and takes account of remuneration elsewhere in the Group. Executive Directors are able to participate in all-employee share plans on the same terms as other Group employees. On each occasion a 1:1 match for shares subscribed is offered subject to still being employed by the Company after one year. It may, however, be necessary in some cases to make buy-out awards on terms that are more bespoke than the existing annual and equity-based pay structures. Executive Director service contracts, which do not contain expiry dates, provide that compensation provisions for termination without notice will only extend to salary, certain fixed benefits and pension. The Directors recognise, however, that such a system of internal financial control can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. 71 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION as at 31 March 2017 Registered Company 05534340 Note 2017 €’000 2016 €’000 Non–current assets Intangible assets 16 10,839 10,980 Property, plant and equipment 17 21,681 20,272 Available for sale investments 18 – – 32,520 31,252 Current assets Inventories 21 11,796 8,345 Trade and other receivables 22 7,612 5,647 Cash and cash equivalents 41,173 8,186 Corporation tax receivable 687 412 61,268 22,590 Current liabilities Trade and other payables 23 (12,524) (8,063) Obligation under finance lease 28 (455) (354) Corporation tax payable (1,620) (1,425) (14,599) (9,842) Net current assets 46,669 12,748 Non–current liabilities Obligation under finance lease 28 (2,621) (1,947) Other Long Term Borrowing 29 (20,097) – (22,718) (1,947) Net assets 56,471 42,053 Equity Share capital 24 4,531 4,495 Share premium account 128,792 128,792 Other Reserves 25 113,356 107,441 Accumulated loss (202,840) (198,842) Own shares (33) (47) Foreign currency translation reserve 45 153 Capital value attributable to owners of Accsys Technologies PLC 43,851 41,992 Non–controlling interest in subsidiaries 12,620 61 Total equity 56,471 42,053 The financial statements were approved by the Board and authorised for issue on 19 June 2017, and signed on its behalf by: Paul Clegg William Rudge Director Director The notes on pages 74 to 102 form an integral part of these financial statements.

These internal development costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful economic life, between 10 and 20 years. Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset, except freehold land, over its expected useful life on a straight line basis, as follows: Plant and machinery These assets comprise pilot plants and production facilities. Where it is not possible to obtain a reliable fair value, these investments are held at cost less provision for impairment. These calculations require the use of judgements in relation to discount rates and future forecasts (See note 16). Available for sale investments The Group has an investment in unlisted equity shares carried at nil value. All costs of sales are allocated against manufacturing activities in Arnhem unless they can be directly attributable to a licensee. BP Chemicals will contribute up to €13.7 million as equity in TVUK, aligning its interest with the plant it is supplying. This equity subscription is funded by the Group’s issue of Loan Notes to BGF and Volantis. Unless discretion is exercised by the Nomination & Remuneration Committee, all options are forfeit following an option holder’s termination of contract.
