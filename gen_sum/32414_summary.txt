funded production capacity expansions underway: − agreements to build and operate new 30,000 metric tonne tricoya chip plant in hull; work has commenced with the plant expected to be operational in early 2019; − expansion of arnhem accoya plant continues to progress with completion of the first stage of expansion to 60,000 cubic meters capacity expected by the end of 2017; • future success of the projects is reinforced by minimum off- take agreements with medite in addition to existing agreement with rhodia acetow (formerly solvay acetow); and • sale and leaseback of land in arnhem completed, with significant new warehouse facilities under construction by our landlord to improve our operating environment. accoya has properties that match or exceed those of the best tropical hardwoods, yet is manufactured from sustainable fsc ® certified wood. accoya is the material of choice for a wide range of demanding outdoor applications, from windows and doors, decking to cladding, bridges to exterior structures and applications that are presently only feasible with non– sustainable or man-made materials. www.tricoya.com new tricoya consortium formed see our focus story on pages

facing the substantial building materials industry. in addition, they benefit from all positive attributes of wood (sustainability, strength, beauty) without the downfalls (poor durability and stability). this represents a long-term and substantial growth opportunity, noting last year we sold 39,790 cubic meters of accoya. the new tricoya plant in hull is being constructed with a view to further significant expansion. scalable growth strong management team see pages 10 and 18 for further details of current additions to manufacturing capacity see pages 40 to 43 for details of the team

annual report 2017 12 our market the superior qualities that our technology brings are driving customers to choose our materials over established wood and non-wood products giving enormous scope to increase our penetration of this vast global market. while it may take some time for accoya to reach its full market potential, we are confident that continued strong sales growth can be generated. accoya captures the market share in those applications which require rot, insect and water resistance, i.e. primarily outdoor products. tricoya displaces alternative more expensive or less easily handled products and opens up major new market opportunities in the construction sector. we develop, motivate and retain a committed team with necessary skills to help us meet our objectives. different species of wood will enable accoya to be used for new purposes while opening up greater supply chain opportunities. solid wood wood elements our key strengths our technology overview

group operations. we also expect to benefit from potential customers gaining greater confidence of accoya’s enduring position in the market place. this success has led us to estimate accoya now represents approximately 12% of the uk wooden window market. sales of tricoya to date have been relatively small scale for market development and based upon accoya manufactured in arnhem. d) business growth fund (‘bgf’) and volantis have invested a total of €22m as financial investors. however in the last 10 years, gordon has only maintained the cladding once by cleaning with a mild soapy water solution, restoring it to an ‘as new’ appearance, a truly remarkable testimony to accoya’s now proven properties. by working closely with our distributors, direct customers and joinery companies we are now seeing consumers specifying accoya too. this also includes any finance charges payable in respect of the group’s working capital facilities. available for sale investments accsys technologies plc has previously purchased a total of 21,666,734 unlisted ordinary shares in diamond wood china limited. known for their high quality urban renovation work, wesselink were tasked with carrying out this project. accsys technologies plc annual report 2017 32 €0.3m of cash out-flow was attributable to cash-flows from operating activities before changes in working capital (excluding exceptional items) (2016: €3.5m in-flow), as a result of the increase in operating loss to €3.9m (excluding exceptional items). the first phase resulted in proceeds of €2.2m which has been accounted for as a finance lease. €18.1m net proceeds were received in respect of loan notes issued by accsys technologies plc to business growth fund (‘bgf’) and volantis. we are committed to increase the use of these products globally through sales from our manufacturing facility, and on a substantially larger scale by licensing our technologies to other companies so that they too can manufacture these products. per hectare, more cubic metres of radiata pine can be grown (20–28m 3 / ha/year) compared to slower growing wood species such as teak (6m 3 /ha/ year) or even most bamboo (10m 3 /ha/year). fsc certification is focused on benign environmental performance but also safeguards social interests for all stakeholders involved. accoya wood also recently received platinum status for material health meaning manufacturers are trusted with the way to communicate their work towards chemically optimised products. both are based on various building related environmental indicators including

state capitol building in st. paul, minnesota was in a state of deterioration: on the outside the regal marble exterior design, completed in 1905, was crumbling. the aging units – 242 in total – had seriously suffered from fogging, failing glass, air leakage, and broken balances that rendered them inoperable. many of the accoya installed windows were tested for air and water infiltration by an independent testing agency and it was determined that they were twice as tight as the published ratings for modern replacement windows. patrick began his career working for british coal where he qualified as a chartered management accountant. since then he has held senior positions at various investment banks including james capel and schroders. william rudge finance director william, born february 1977, had been the financial controller for accsys since joining the company in january 2010 before being appointed finance director on 1 october 2012. prior to this he qualified as a chartered accountant with deloitte in 2002 and subsequently gained a further six years’ experience in their audit and assurance department, focusing on technology companies including small growth companies and multinational groups. experts in their fields, the senior management team boasts a broad range of sector knowledge and specialism. angus qualified as a corporate solicitor with international law firm ashurst morris crisp (now known as ashurst llp) in september 2002. after gaining further experience in private practice, he has since spent over ten years working in-house for growth companies, advising on a broad range of corporate, commercial and other business matters. he was appointed general manager of tricoya technologies in 2012 and has led the company since its inception. however, there can be no assurance that the group will successfully execute this strategy for growth. – for 2014, following environmental reporting guidelines of defra (2013), carbon offsets due to e.g. purchase of renewable energy credits may be accounted for separately as a ‘net’ figure, while the original electricity consumption figures are presented as a ‘gross’ figure.

for the previous financial year. 2 represents annual bonus awarded in form of ordinary shares, relating to performance for the previous financial year. given the competitive nature of the company’s sector these performance measures have been considered to be commercially sensitive and that comparable aim companies are not subject to equivalent disclosure obligations and accordingly are not disclosed. the main principles are to: • ensure that salaries are set at a market competitive level by benchmarking against appropriate external comparators, • support high performance culture by rewarding upper quartile performance with upper quartile reward, • maintain an appropriate balance between fixed and performance related pay, • align long-term rewards with shareholders; and • ensure that the overall package reflects market practice and takes account of remuneration elsewhere in the group. the committee expressly reserves discretion to make such awards as it considers appropriate within these limits. executive directors are able to participate in all-employee share plans on the same terms as other group employees. on each occasion a 1:1 match for shares subscribed is offered subject to still being employed by the company after one year. however, as an external recruitment has not taken place for a considerable period of time, the preparation of this policy is challenging as it provides for an event which has not been the company’s practice. it may, however, be necessary in some cases to make buy-out awards on terms that are more bespoke than the existing annual and equity-based pay structures. executive director service contracts, which do not contain expiry dates, provide that compensation provisions for termination without notice will only extend to salary, certain fixed benefits and pension. the directors recognise, however, that such a system of internal financial control can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. 71 overview governance strategic report financial statements consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 march 2017 registered company 05534340 note 2017 €’000 2016
