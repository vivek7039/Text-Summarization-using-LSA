In order to recycle this equity, further acquisitions totalling €72.8 million were either completed or notarised after the year end. This attracts a large number of tenants to our sites whilst generating higher income and asset value growth from space that would often be left vacant or rented at low prices. These acquisitions have a higher concentration of office space as well as higher vacancy which provides the Company with much greater opportunity to enhance income and values going forward than would have been achievable on the mature and non-core assets that these are replacing. 8 Sirius Real Estate Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Chairman’s statement Building momentum In summary: » Sirius has continued to grow organically through its capex investment programme and its asset management techniques as well as acquisitively using the proceeds of two successful capital raisings in the period. An additional mature asset, located in Kiel, was notarised for sale at €7.0 million after the period end. Furthermore this creates the opportunity to recycle capital from mature sites into assets with more future potential. Our asset management team has already identified good potential to enhance the income streams and capital values of these. * Reported profit before tax adjusted for property revaluation, change in fair value of derivative financial instruments and other adjusting items including expense relating to the Long Term Incentive Plan.

Sirius focuses attention on community causes in which employees have a personal interest and wish to be actively involved. The Akademie has been running since 2009 and in 2016 alone there were 15 training courses available to staff with a total of 184 employees attending. If true, then it provides further support for the high returns that are potentially achievable from our investment programme. As mentioned above, total shareholder return, comprising adjusted NAV growth plus dividends paid in the period, was 15.3% (31 March 2016: 16.0%). Outlook Sirius has completed another strong financial year with profits again reaching levels not seen before and valuations continuing to rise. The focus remains on delivering risk-adjusted returns by growing recurring income and capital values through these asset management activities. Investment activity – the risk of being prevented from executing investments or that returns are not in line with expectations. This section describes how these risks are identified, managed and mitigated appropriately in order to deliver the Group’s strategic objectives. » Property assets are inherently difficult to value as there is no liquid market or standard pricing mechanism. Potential impact » Valuations are conducted half-yearly by an expert, independent, reputable major corporation in the property sector. » The Group holds seven assets on an unencumbered basis which are more liquid to sell or could be injected into bank security pools if necessary. » The Group continues to concentrate its investment activity in markets where prior experience, in-depth knowledge of local demand drivers and operational synergies can be utilised. » All prospective tenants go through a robust credit check to provide comfort over their suitability and financial state. » The Board receives reporting from Intertrust Fund Services (Guernsey) Limited’s Compliance Officer on a quarterly basis. Andrew’s responsibilities to Sirius Real Estate include formulating and agreeing the strategy for delivering shareholder value. Upon appointment, Non-executive Directors undertake an induction process to familiarise themselves with the Group’s activities, policies and key issues. Corporate governance continued 45 Sirius Real Estate Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The Group Chief Financial Officer is normally invited to attend meetings, along with other members of management as appropriate. The Committee has discretion to amend pay-outs should any formulaic output not reflect their assessment of performance. Performance targets are set each year by the Committee, taking into account a number of different factors. » Additional fees may also be paid for other Board responsibilities or roles, such as the Senior Independent Director. The Committee’s intention is that such awards would be made on a “like-for-like” basis to those forfeited. The discretion will not be used to make non-performance related incentive payments (for example, a “golden hello”). This is a legacy arrangement in their service contracts and will not be replicated for future appointments. Any deferred amounts from bonus earned in previous years will normally be retained unless the Executive Director resigns or is summarily dismissed. However, as there is no current long-term incentive plan in the policy the Committee considers that this does not provide a useful illustration and will therefore seek to include it next year when a new long-term plan has been developed. All Non-executive Directors have initial fixed term agreements with the Group for no more than three years. 31 March 2017 Salary/fees Benefits Pension Bonus MSP Total Executive Directors Andrew Coombs €351,928 €42,133 €47,992 €300,085 €164,005 €906,143 Alistair Marks €308,574 €25,072 €35,699 €269,340 €171,063 €809,748 Non-executive Directors Neil Sachdev* €71,187 — — — — €71,187 Robert Sinclair** €55,433 — — — — €55,433 Justin Atkinson*** €2,450 — — — — €2,450 Wessel Hamman €44,538 — — — — €44,538 James Peggie**** €57,112 — — — — €57,112 * Neil Sachdev was appointed as a Non-executive Director on 6 July 2016 and was subsequently appointed as Chairman on 26 September 2016.

Consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended 31 March 2017 75 Sirius Real Estate Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 1. Significant accounting policies (a) Basis of preparation The consolidated financial information has been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for investment properties, investment properties held for sale and derivative financial instruments, which have been measured at fair value. Investment properties are initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs when ownership of the property is transferred. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The clarifications relate principally to identifying performance obligations, accounting for licences of intellectual property and agent vs principal considerations. In particular, companies will now recognise a front-loaded pattern of expense for most leases, even when they pay annual rents. The Cushman & Wakefield LLP valuation is based upon assumptions including future rental income, anticipated maintenance costs and an appropriate discount rate. Market value was primarily derived using a ten year discounted cash flow model supported by comparable evidence. Budgeted profit margins were estimated based on actual performance over the past two financial years and expected market changes. Prepayments include costs totalling €6,547,000 (2016: €2,147,000) relating to the acquisition of two new sites that completed post period end (see note 30). On 28 April 2016, the Group agreed to refinance this facility which had an outstanding balance of €110.4 million at 31 March 2016. The Group has various financial assets, such as trade receivables and cash, which arise directly from its operations. Similarly, accounts receivable are due either in advance (e.g. rents and recharges) or within ten days (e.g. service charge reconciliations), further bolstering the Group’s liquidity level. If properties do not generate sufficient revenues to meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditure, the Group’s revenue will be adversely affected. Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Market risk continued In addition, the Group’s revenue would be adversely affected if a significant number of tenants were unable to pay rent or its properties could not be rented on favourable terms. The Group monitors capital using a gross debt to property assets ratio, which was 42.3% as at 31 March 2017 (2016: 42.8%). Capital and other commitments The Group’s commitments derived from office rental contracts are as follows: 2017 €000 2016 €000 Less than one year 528 497 Between one and five years 1,959 1,938 More than five years 245 727 2,732 3,162 As at 31 March 2017, the Group had contracted capital expenditure on existing properties of €5,951,000 (2016: €4,636,000).
