report chairman’s statement building momentum in summary: » sirius has continued to grow organically through its capex investment programme and its asset management techniques as well as acquisitively using the proceeds of two successful capital raisings in the period. an additional mature asset, located in kiel, was notarised for sale at €7.0 million after the period end. furthermore this creates the opportunity to recycle capital from mature sites into assets with more future potential. our asset management team has already identified good potential to enhance the income streams and capital values of these. * reported profit before tax adjusted for property revaluation, change in fair value of derivative financial instruments and other adjusting items including expense relating to the long term incentive plan. our new lettings, renewals and service charge initiatives are also producing good results and we have seen a further 2.8% increase in the like-for-like rent roll for properties held throughout the reporting period despite operating in a low inflationary environment. opportunities going forward – where do you see value being created looking ahead into the current financial year and beyond? the type of asset that the group acquires and develops can be divided into three categories as follows: » traditional industrial business parks – typically large production sites built many years ago by owner/occupiers and developed for their specific needs. sirius’ main objective is to maximise income and value of all assets through active asset management throughout the period in which they are owned. the main asset management initiatives are designed to convert properties into improved, more efficient, higher yielding conventional and flexible workspaces. this translates to approximately a 12% conversion rate of all enquires into new lettings which the company believes is best in class. expected three year returns total expected improvement geared irr 32.7%

profits again reaching levels not seen before and valuations continuing to rise. the focus remains on delivering risk-adjusted returns by growing recurring income and capital values through these asset management activities. as such, a risk-based approach is taken on all major decision making and strategic initiatives. 2. investment activity – the risk of being prevented from executing investments or that returns are not in line with expectations. this section describes how these risks are identified, managed and mitigated appropriately in order to deliver the group’s strategic objectives. » bank facilities are only entered into where attractive rates and long facility terms can be secured. » property assets are inherently difficult to value as there is no liquid market or standard pricing mechanism. potential impact » valuations are conducted half-yearly by an expert, independent, reputable major corporation in the property sector. » the group holds seven assets on an unencumbered basis which are more liquid to sell or could be injected into bank security pools if necessary. » the group continues to concentrate its investment activity in markets where prior experience, in-depth knowledge of local demand drivers and operational synergies can be utilised. principal risks » the group’s operating platform includes an acquisition team which is focused specifically on sourcing potential acquisition opportunities, analysing their suitability for purchase and presenting those assets to the investment committee for further review and consideration. mitigation customer 6 » reduced tenant demand for the group’s offerings and lower take-up of vacant space. » all prospective tenants go through a robust credit check to provide comfort over their suitability and financial state. » the board receives reporting from intertrust fund services (guernsey) limited’s compliance officer on a quarterly basis. all three systems have service level

neil sachdev non-executive chairman (58) a r n d i neil sachdev joined sirius in july 2016. prior to this, neil held the post of group property director of j sainsbury plc and before that served for 29 years with tesco, where he was stores board director, responsible for property and operations for the entire uk business. neil has recently stepped down as chairman of market tech holdings limited and has also stepped down from the board of intu properties plc (formerly capital shopping centres) where he had served as a non-executive director for ten years. prior to working in the property sector, andrew held a number of general management roles. andrew’s responsibilities to sirius real estate include formulating and agreeing the strategy for delivering shareholder value. directors do not participate in the discussion or vote regarding their own conflicts of interest. upon appointment, non-executive directors undertake an induction process to familiarise themselves with the group’s activities, policies and key issues. the board believes that annual evaluations are helpful and provide a valuable opportunity for continuous improvement. the investment committee was formed in 2017 and has not yet had its first formal meeting. the group’s system of internal control is designed to manage and mitigate rather than eliminate altogether the risk of failure to meet business objectives and can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material financial misstatement or loss. corporate governance continued 45 sirius real estate limited annual report and accounts 2017 the group chief financial officer is normally invited to attend meetings, along with other members of management as appropriate. the committee uses external search consultants or open advertising for recruitment purposes as deemed most appropriate. the committee has not undertaken its first formal meeting as it was only recently formed. engagement with shareholders the board is committed to providing shareholders with timely announcements of significant events or transactions affecting the company, including its financial performance and any changes to strategy as well as material investment commitments and realisations. the committee has discretion to amend pay-outs should any formulaic output not reflect their assessment of performance. performance targets are set each year by the committee, taking into account a number of different factors. » additional fees may also be paid for other board responsibilities or roles, such as the senior independent director. the committee’s intention is that such awards would be made on a “like-for-like” basis to those forfeited. the discretion will not be used to make non-performance related incentive payments (for example, a “golden hello”). this is a legacy arrangement in their service contracts and will not be replicated for future appointments. any deferred amounts from bonus earned in previous years will normally be retained unless the executive director resigns or is summarily dismissed. however, as there is no current long-term incentive plan in the policy the committee considers that this does not provide a useful illustration and will therefore seek to include it next year when a new long-term plan has been developed. all non-executive directors have initial fixed term agreements with the group for no more than three years. 31 march 2017 salary/fees benefits pension bonus msp total executive directors andrew coombs €351,928 €42,133 €47,992 €300,085 €164,005 €906,143 alistair marks €308,574 €25,072

appointment, setting out, among other things, their role and duties and that they are expected to allocate sufficient time to perform their duties effectively, making themselves available for all regular and ad hoc meetings, as well as providing for them to sit on committees of the board as required during their tenure. any such system of internal control can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. any such notifications are reviewed at the next board meeting and, if considered appropriate, authorised. directors do not participate in the discussion or vote regarding their own conflicts of interest. upon appointment, non-executive directors undertake an induction process to familiarise themselves with the group’s activities, policies and key issues. valuation the group holds investment properties which consist primarily of business retail parks located in germany. 2. significant accounting policies (a) basis of preparation the consolidated financial information has been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for investment properties, investment properties held for sale and derivative financial instruments, which have been measured at fair value. investment properties are initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs when ownership of the property is transferred. directors can make discretionary impairments of non-core assets when strong evidence exists to support an adjustment. after initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. the remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics. the equity component of a compound financial instrument is not remeasured subsequent to initial recognition. the clarifications relate principally to identifying performance obligations, accounting for licences of intellectual property and agent vs principal considerations. in particular, companies will now recognise a front-loaded pattern of expense for most leases, even when they pay annual rents. the cushman & wakefield llp valuation is based upon assumptions including future rental income, anticipated maintenance costs and an appropriate discount rate. accordingly, these unrecognised assets may have an impact on future corporate tax changes in certain circumstances. administrative expenses year ended 31 march 2017 €000 re-presented year ended 31 march 2016 €000 audit fee 293 535 legal and professional fees 2,128 1,661 other

financial assets, such as trade receivables and cash, which arise directly from its operations. similarly, accounts receivable are due either in advance (e.g. rents and recharges) or within ten days (e.g. service charge reconciliations), further bolstering the group’s liquidity level. if properties do not generate sufficient revenues to meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditure, the group’s revenue will be adversely affected. 97 sirius real estate limited annual report and accounts 2017 21. financial risk management objectives and policies continued market risk

monitors capital using a gross debt to property assets ratio, which was 42.3% as at 31 march 2017 (2016: 42.8%). the table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine fair value: level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). the interest rate swap is measured at fair value with changes recognised in profit or loss. the loan notes were issued at par and carried a coupon rate of 5% per annum. the property is an office building with basement space and has a net lettable area of 7,996sqm. the property comprises two connected multi-let office buildings
