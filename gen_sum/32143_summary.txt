strategic report | at a glance chairman’s statement the expertise of our people is in high demand as customers look for innovative ways to defeat new threats to security. our previous cfo david mellors left qinetiq at the end of 2016 to join cobham plc. on behalf of the board i would like to thank david mellors for his contribution to qinetiq; he drove a significant strengthening of the balance sheet providing a solid foundation for our future growth. we would also like to thank dr malcolm coffin, qinetiq group financial controller, who assumed the cfo role on an interim basis. 4 strategic report qinetiq group plc annual report and accounts 2017 strategy over the last 18 months, steve and his executive team led an integrated strategic business planning process, which was thoroughly discussed in a two-day meeting with the board. during the year, board members visited a number of sites including qinetiq north america in waltham, ma, and mod boscombe down, where a number of activities associated with the group’s strategic priority to modernise uk test and evaluation are currently under way. these visits provided the opportunity to see at first-hand how we are implementing strategy and managing risk. qinetiq’s leaders play a vital role of delivering day-to-day operational performance and driving change. steve’s first decision as ceo was to establish a leadership community at qinetiq and bring together the top 100 leaders every month. i value their considerable experience and the significant contribution that they have made this year. “our strategy is inherently outward looking... we have been building positive momentum with its implementation during the year.” market environment fy17 was another year in which threats to global security from both state and non-state actors increased. fy17 performance during the year we successfully achieved both good operational delivery and significant progress implementing our strategy. this will provide a platform for growth in the uk t&e market, which we estimate to be double that which we currently access, and improve our ability to win work with customers outside the uk. in december 2016 we acquired meggitt’s target systems business, now renamed qinetiq target systems (qts), both to reinforce our core t&e value proposition and accelerate the delivery of our strategic priority to drive international growth. in january 2017, we also acquired rubikon group which brings integrated logistics support capabilities to qinetiq australia. however, turning creativity and technical innovation into tangible value for our customers increasingly requires innovative thinking across the broader range of activities. during the year we successfully introduced a new operating model based on matrix working to improve our responsiveness and operational effectiveness. moving into fy18, supporting and developing the culture required to deliver our transformation is a particular goal. we are actively supporting the subsequent official inquiries and will respond to all recommendations made. over the longer term this strategy will create and sustain value for all our stakeholders. our customer relationships and domain know-how have been developed over many years of working in partnership. the division is underpinned by long-term contracts providing good visibility of revenue and cash flows. the division is technology- based and has shorter order cycles so can have a more variable revenue profile. as a company we often fulfil an innovation integrator role, establishing partnerships with other organisations and building networks of suppliers. these networks bring together government, industry, smes and academia in collaborating teams to facilitate innovation. growth is forecast in adjacent areas such as security of civil infrastructure due to continued concerns about unrest and insecurity. we also deploy the expertise of our people to help customers meet their own efficiency challenges. in some cases, this requires the introduction of innovative business models such as our strategic enterprise model for the delivery of uk aircraft engineering services where we are delivering both improved services and savings for our customers. on 16 september 2016, the secretary of state for defence launched a new defence innovation initiative for the uk focused on ensuring that britain remains a credible military force against major adversaries, using traditional lethal and non-lethal effects to respond to evolving threats with pace and agility. a defence and security accelerator has been launched as part of the initiative to administer an £800m innovation fund. our top 100 leaders completed a leadership development programme and are being supported with ongoing coaching. a strategy and planning function has been created to help position qinetiq for future growth. delivery and operational excellence during the year, we successfully introduced a new operating model that allows us to resource as one company. david smith, our new chief financial officer, is driving a renewed focus on operational excellence in tandem with his role of executive sponsor for transformation. our three part strategy: 1. modernise uk t&e 2. build an international company 3. invest in innovation our values are the foundation: – integrity – collaboration – performance 14 strategic report qinetiq group plc annual report and accounts 2017 1. lead and modernise uk defence test & evaluation. fy17 progress – a year of building momentum in september 2016, we signed an 11-year, £109m contract extension for naval combat system integration support services (ncsiss) to the mod. andreas ward, previously vice president nordic and baltics at saab, was also appointed to run our operations in sweden. with growing defence ambitions and close to the rapidly evolving asia pacific region, australia is a particularly attractive market. in january 2017, the dragonfire consortium – led by mbda and including qinetiq as well as other industry partners – was awarded a £30m programme by the uk mod to deliver a defensive laser directed energy weapon (ldew) capability demonstrator. through this survey, employees share their views about working at qinetiq under the headings of management, leadership, company, personal growth, my team, giving something

broadly consistent performance across all business units within the division. fy17 underlying operating profit* included a £5.2m credit relating to the release of engine servicing obligations as we invest in new aircraft for test aircrew training. investment in new aircraft and a revised syllabus will allow it to pursue opportunities for growth. – it secured an 11-year contract extension worth £109m for the naval combat systems integration & support services based at portsdown technology park. investing in innovation – the business leads research framework contracts for the uk mod, managing a network of more than 100 uk smes, as well as innovation initiatives for local and regional governments to support local business growth. – qinetiq australia continued to develop its core capabilities, extending contracts for the provision of integrated engineering services at the defence science and technology group’s fishermen’s bend workshop in port melbourne, and for aircraft structural integrity services. – our business in australia also grew order intake, including contracts to support tanker aircraft, navy guided weapons systems, ground-based air defence, and the australian artillery regiment. qinetiq is enabling royal air force typhoon pilots to train together in virtual environments from different locations by linking simulators at the squadrons’ main operating bases. the division is technology-based and has shorter order cycles than emea services so can have a more lumpy revenue profile. order flow in qinetiq north america (qna) was strong, including $41m of us aircraft carrier orders during the year. – it also secured further funding to continue the development of its international berthing and docking mechanism (ibdm) for spacecraft. focus to date has been on integration and realising synergies, with early contract wins in the united arab emirates. we continue to support the uk’s sovereign capability in this area and deliver projects for other allied nations. the strategy is based on four integrated elements that work together to develop ‘engaged people in winning teams’. we regularly communicate with employees to ensure they understand qinetiq’s strategy, performance and business priorities. we are actively supporting the subsequent official inquiries and will respond to all recommendations made. the lti rate has

rates and interest rates on financial assets and liabilities as at 31 march 2017 is set out in the following table. in may 2014, the company initiated a £150m capital return to shareholders by way of a share buyback and this programme was complete at 31 march 2016. a further £50m share buyback was announced in november 2015 and was completed at 31 march 2017. rights attaching to the special share qinetiq carries out activities which are important to uk defence and security interests. qinetiq obtained mod consent to changes in its special shareholder rights, which were approved by shareholders at the 2012 agm. the balance sheet net pension liability is a snapshot view which can be significantly influenced by short-term market factors. risks through its defined benefit pension plan, the group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: volatility in market conditions results under ias 19 can change dramatically depending on market conditions. this is a 25-year contract with a total revenue value of up to £5.6bn, dependent on the level of usage by the mod, under which qinetiq limited is committed to providing t&e services with increasing efficiencies through cost saving and innovative service delivery. provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent management’s best estimate of the likely outcome. however, no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties unless management, taking into account professional advice received, assesses that it is more likely than not that such proceedings may be successful. the fair value of cash-settled awards for share-based payments is determined at each period end until they are exercised or lapse. the governance framework is used to manage tax risks, establish controls and monitor their effectiveness. there is also an impact of deferred tax movements, whereby the income statement bears a charge (e.g. in respect of accelerated capital allowances) but for which there is no corporation tax paid in the year. as a uk-listed company, the group is required to adopt eu endorsed ifrss and comply with the companies act 2006 150 additional information qinetiq group plc annual
