Emerging technology continues to be a focal  area in the real estate industry and also for  our business. Jeremy will be succeeded by Mark  Ridley, currently CEO of Savills UK and Europe,  with effect from 1 January 2019. More detail of our governance structure,  policies and practices can be found later   in this Annual Report on pages 38 to 59. We work hard to ensure that our people  enjoy working at Savills’ promoting their  personal and professional development. 08 Savills plc   Report and Accounts 2017 Outstanding   people Local knowledge Entrepreneurial  approach Long-term client  relationships Client care  programmes High quality   servicer Intellectual   property Market   intelligence Brand and   reputation Financial Prudent capital  structure Strong cash  generation Defensive, scale business Cyclical high-margin  businesses Revenue   by business Property  and facilities  management 32% Commercial  transactions 36% Consultancy 17% Residential  transactions 11% Investment  management 4% Our values  Pride in everything we do Take an entrepreneurial approach   to business Help our people fulfil their   true potential Always act with integrity Governance  Board oversight High standards of governance Disciplined   approach to risk Risk mitigation to limit exposure   to any one market or economy Business and geography   diversification Underpinned by People Training and development  Restructured training  programme Employee engagement  Achieved One Star status Diversity  UK Diversity Group Reducing   environmental impact  Carbon emission reduction Community investment  Community engagement  programmes Clients High quality service Client care  Client relationship   management team Community Shareholders Dividends 30.2p Underlying  earnings   per share 75.8p Underlying  profit £140.5m Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview 09 Savills plc  Report and Accounts 2017 Spotlight on Europe  The European economy enjoyed the strongest period of  economic growth in more than a decade, despite lingering  political uncertainty. Just under half of last year’s acquisitions were by non-domestic investors, with this  proportion rising to 80% in the Greater London market. Elsewhere price adjustments have been much less significant, though prices for high  value homes fell marginally across the commuter zone. Hong Kong also saw a notable growth in  land sales (+78% YoY) supported by buyers from the mainland. We note that investors are also beginning to explore a  broader realm of asset classes beyond simply office and retail. PERE noted that the trend for more  opportunistic and value added funds fell in 2017, from 63% to  60% of investors strategies. Savills Investment Management was also recognised with three  funds winning best performer awards from MSCI/IPF and Property Investor Europe during  the year. In China, the  Government continues to impose restrictions  on second home ownership, impacting  negatively both sales and profitability. Investment performance continued strongly  with the majority of our Fund products  continuing to exceed their benchmarks over  a five year term.

The Group does not engage  in trades of a speculative nature and only  uses derivative financial instruments to  hedge certain risk exposures. When considering new market entry we undertake due  diligence including the impact assessment of political and  economic issues in that particular country. We recognise that our brand strength is vital to maintaining  market share in established and new markets. Business continuity and disaster recovery plans are in place to  cover the residual risks that cannot be mitigated. Our compliance environment, at all levels, is subject   to regular review by internal audit and external  assurance providers. In Asia, we are progressively extending our  CPD programme, tailoring it as appropriate  to best meet local requirements. We have launched  “unconscious bias” training led by the UK Executive Committee, which is now part of  all development programmes including Company induction. Savills with schools Our current graduates attend a local state secondary school to deliver presentations about  careers in property. Ultimately this approach provides a complete  insight into our clients’ priorities so that we can  make the appropriate skills, expertise and  resources available. In consequence,  we are now reporting on GHG emissions at  a more granular level from our UK, Europe,  US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong  Kong, Japan, Singapore, and key Chinese  operations. This substantial reduction has been achieved  through progressive initiatives to improve the  environmental efficiency of our offices,  including more energy efficient lighting, better  climate control and IT upgrades. Board papers are circulated electronically via a secure portal, giving Directors sufficient time  to consider and digest their contents. He later  served as Chairman of SVG Capital plc, a  publicly quoted private equity group, from  April 2005 to November 2012. Simon was Chief Operating  Officer of Profile Therapeutics plc for five  years and also worked as a corporate  financier, latterly at Hambros   Bank Limited. Justin previously held a number   of senior positions at Henderson   Global Investors, Lend Lease and the  AMP Society. Other appointments Christian also serves as non-executive  director in Savills Asset Advisory, the  wholly-owned asset management  subsidiary of Savills Japan Co, Ltd   created in May 2012 Jeremy Helsby Group Chief Executive   (See Board of Directors on pages 44 and 45 for photograph and full biography). The Group’s website includes a specific  investor relations section containing all RNS  announcements, share price information and  annual reports available for download. Those risks and how they are being  managed or mitigated is set out in the  Annual Report at pages 25 to 29. This approach  also ensures that our reward arrangements  are consistent with and sensitive to the  cyclical nature of real estate markets. An overview of the key decisions for  2018 is as follows: • Base salaries: we have an established  approach of offering low base salaries,  relative to market medians (which approach  applies to the Executive Directors, Group  Executive Board Members and other senior  fee earners). FIT Remuneration Consultants’  fees are based on a time and material basis, within the parameters  of an overall annual budget. In line with the Group’s philosophy that there is  greater emphasis (than under listed company norms)  on variable performance-related pay. Consequently,  50% of any award payable above an amount equal   to base salary is deferred into shares for three years. The remaining 25% of annual performance-related profit share awards was based on individual performance against key strategic and  operational objectives. Pensions disclosure  From March 2015, the Group Chief Executive Officer has received a non-pensionable salary supplement equal to 14% of pensionable  earnings. In line with the Group’s philosophy,  there is greater emphasis on variable  performance-related pay, while base  salaries are set significantly below  market median levels. Unless the Committee determines  otherwise, this scale will normally be  adjusted for any acquisitions/disposals   in a single year which impact (on an  annualised basis) UPBT by more than 7.5%. Performance conditions are currently  based on two measures: • Relative TSR against the FTSE  250 (excluding investment trusts)  or other appropriate comparator  group • Earnings per share. Executive Directors are expected to purchase  and/or retain all shares (net of tax) which vest  under the Group’s share plans (or any other  discretionary long-term incentive arrangement  introduced in the future) until such time as they  hold a specified value of shares. Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to  participate in any of the Group’s incentive  arrangements or share schemes. By order of the Board Chris Lee Group Legal Director & Company Secretary 14 March 2018 Savills plc  Registered in England No. We tested a sample of revenue transactions to underlying contracts  and third party completion documentation, for example, property  sales completion statements, or asset or property management  contracts, determining that these sales had taken place and were  recorded in the correct period. Based upon Group materiality, we did not carry out detailed audit procedures on Savills Europe other than Aguirre Newman. How we  determined it 5% of Group underlying profit before tax as defined in note 2.2 to the  financial statements. We believe  that underlying profit before tax is the most appropriate measure as  it eliminates any disproportionate effect of exceptional charges and  provides a consistent year-on-year basis for our work. The Group also refers to revenue and underlying profit on a constant currency basis which are both non-GAAP measures. The Group’s investment in associates includes goodwill (net of any accumulated  impairment loss) identified on acquisition (see Note 17.1). Prior impairments of non-financial assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible  reversal at each reporting date. (b) Commercial transactional fees Generally, revenue is recognised on the date of completion or when unconditional contracts have been exchanged. (e) Investment management Revenue represents commissions and fees receivable, net of marketing costs in accordance with the relevant fee agreements. A risk control framework is used to  assess the credit quality of clients, taking into account financial position, past experience and other factors. No credit limits were exceeded during the  reporting year, and management does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counterparties. These borrowings, together with cash  generated from operations, are then on-lent or contributed as equity to certain subsidiaries. This assessment involves assumptions relating to potential future revenues, appropriate discount rates  and the useful life of such assets. Asia Pacific segment operations are based in Hong Kong, Macau, China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore,   Vietnam, Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar. Continental Europe segment operations are based in Germany, France, Spain, the  Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Italy, Ireland, Poland and Czech Republic. Other geographical areas, although largely commercial-based, also  provide residential services, in particular Hong Kong, China, Vietnam, Singapore, Australia, Taiwan and Thailand. These calculations use discounted cash flow projections  based on financial budgets and strategic plans approved by management covering a five-year period. The risk-adjusted discount range of rates used in  each region for impairment testing are as follows:  2017  Discount rate range   2016  Discount rate range  United Kingdom 10.0% 10.0% Continental Europe 10.0% 10.0% Asia Pacific 11.2%–18.1% 11.6%–18.1% North America 10.0% 10.0% 121 S a v ill s p l c   Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview (c) Long-term growth rate To forecast beyond the five years covered by detailed forecasts, a terminal value was calculated, using average long-term growth rates. 129 S a v ill s p l c   Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview As at the reporting date the Group did not recognise deferred tax income tax assets of £1.4m (2016: £0.4m) in respect of losses amounting  to £5.9m (2016: £1.2m) that can be carried forward indefinitely against future taxable income. The credit quality of receivables is managed at a local subsidiary level with  uncollectible amounts being impaired where necessary. The Company had £0.1m of employee benefit obligations as at 31 December 2017 (2016: £0.1m), relating to holiday pay and long service leave. 2021 Jiuzhou West Avenue, Zhuhai Savills Real Estate Valuation (Beijing) Company Ltd China Unit 01, 21/F, East Tower, Twin Towers, B-12 Jianguomenwai Avenue,   Chaoyang District, Beijing 100022 Savills Real Estate Valuation (Guangzhou) Company Ltd China Room 2105, R&F Center, No.10 Hua Xia Road, Zhujiang New Town,   Guangzhou 510623 Savills Valuation and Professional Services (BJ) Ltd China Unit 07, 21/F, East Tower, Twin Towers, B-12 Jianguomenwai Avenue,   Chaoyang District, Beijing 100022 143 S a v ill s p l c   Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview Fully-owned subsidiary Country of  incorporation Registered office Savills Valuation and Professional Services (GZ) Ltd China Room 2105, R&F Centre, No.10 Hua Xia Road, Zhujiang New Town,  Guangzhou  Shenzhen Guardian Property Management Ltd China Room 3, Unit A, 5/F, Anlian Plaza, No.4018 Jintian Road, Futian District,  Shenzhen 518026 Swan Property Services (Beijing) Company Ltd China 2101 East Tower, Twin Towers, B-12 Jianguomenwai Avenue,   Chaoyang District, Beijing 100022 Savills CZ s.r.o. 2 Jalan Raja Abdullah, Off Jalan Sultan Ismail, 50300 Kuala Lumpur Rootcorp Ranganatha Ltd 25.00 Mauritius 4/F, Raffles Tower, 19 Cybercity, Ebene Monaco Real Estates SARL 51.00 Monaco 10 Ter Boulevard Princesse Charlotte Huttons Asia Pte Ltd 48.00 Singapore 3 Bishan Place, #02-01 CPF Bishan Building, S 579838 (i) Directly owned by Savills plc. 151 S a v ill s p l c   Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview Shareholder information Key dates for 2018   Annual General Meeting 8 May 2018  Financial half year end 30 June 2018  Announcement of half year results 9 August 2018 Website Visit our investor relations website www.savills.com for full up-to-date investor relations information, including the latest share price, recent  Annual and Half Year Reports, results presentations and financial news.
