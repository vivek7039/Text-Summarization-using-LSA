non-domestic investors, with this proportion rising to 80% in the greater london market. elsewhere price adjustments have been much less significant, though prices for high value homes fell marginally across the commuter zone. investor interest in the industrial sector remained high — it was the only asset class to see sales volumes increase in 2017. case study w.w. norton savills studley advised

financial officer chief financial officer’s review “ a combination of resilience and growth across our businesses contributed to a strong performance which supports an improved distribution to shareholders for 2017” financial highlights group revenue up 11% to £1.6bn (£1.55bn in constant currency, 2016: £1.45bn) underlying profit up 3.5% to £140.5m (£136.6m in constant currency, 2016: £135.8m) 22 savills plc report and accounts 2017 underlying profit margin underlying profit margin decreased to 8.8% (2016: 9.4%), reflecting a decline in substantial transaction activity in the us, the anticipated reduction in investment management profits following the reduced level of disposal transactions from the seb german open ended funds and the costs of expansion in a number of regions. these charges have been excluded from the calculation of underlying profit in line with group policy. adjusted on a consistent basis for exceptional restructuring, acquisition- related costs, impairment charges, profits and losses on disposals, certain share- based payment adjustments and amortisation of acquired intangible assets (excluding software), underlying basic earnings per share increased by 5% to 75.8p (2016: 72.5p). these policies are subject to continuous review in light of developing regulation, accounting standards and practice. the group does not engage in trades of a speculative nature and only uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. group earnings and/ or our financial condition could be adversely affected by these and other macro-economic uncertainties. when considering new market entry we undertake due diligence including the impact assessment of political and economic issues in that particular country. we recognise that our brand strength is vital to maintaining market share in established and new markets. for example: • in accepting client engagements, group companies may be subject to duty of care obligations. business continuity and disaster recovery plans are in place to cover the residual risks that cannot be mitigated. environmental reporting requirements place data-gathering responsibilities on our business in common with other listed companies. our compliance environment, at all levels, is subject to regular review by internal audit and external assurance providers. all of our businesses are required to comply with local legal standards as an absolute minimum. • recognise that our people’s diverse strengths combined with good teamwork produce the best results. all of this is supported by a dedicated training team, who offer individual career development advice and a dedicated page on the company intranet which pulls together all the information our people need to plan their personal development. in asia, we are progressively extending our cpd programme, tailoring it as appropriate to best meet local requirements. we take employee wellbeing seriously and have introduced a wellbeing programme, which includes savills focused events and committing to the time to change pledge, for increased recognition of mental health in the workplace, on world mental health day. we have launched “unconscious bias” training led by the uk executive committee, which is now part of all development programmes including company induction. we also ran a number of internal diversity events for our gender and lgbt groups. savills plc report and accounts 2017 32 excellent client service is at the core of our business. ultimately this approach provides a complete insight into our clients’ priorities so that we can make the appropriate skills, expertise and resources available. in consequence, we are now reporting on ghg emissions at a more granular level from our uk, europe, us, canada, australia, new zealand, hong kong, japan, singapore, and key chinese operations. this substantial reduction has been achieved through progressive initiatives to improve the environmental

present in person, directors may attend by audio or video conference. he was co-founder of schroder ventures (the private equity group which later became permira) of which he served as chairman from 1984 to 2001. he later served as chairman of svg capital plc, a publicly quoted private equity group, from april 2005 to november 2012. other appointments nicholas was chairman of sky plc from april 2012 to may 2016, having been appointed to the board as a non- executive director in june 2004 and having previously served as deputy chairman and senior independent non-executive director. simon was chief operating officer of profile therapeutics plc for five years and also worked as a corporate financier, latterly at hambros bank limited. he was subsequently appointed chief executive in january 2006. justin previously held a number of senior positions at henderson global investors, lend lease and the amp society. other appointments christian also serves as non-executive director in savills asset advisory, the wholly-owned asset management subsidiary of savills japan co, ltd created in may 2012 jeremy helsby group chief executive (see board of directors on pages 44 and 45 for photograph and full biography). the group’s website includes a specific investor relations section containing all rns announcements, share price information and annual reports available for download. three independent non-executive directors, liz hewitt, tim freshwater and rupert robson are members of the committee. this includes items that the committee considers regularly in accordance with its terms of reference. this approach also ensures that our reward arrangements are consistent with and sensitive to the cyclical nature of real estate markets. an overview of the key decisions for 2018 is as follows: • base salaries: we have an established approach of offering low base salaries, relative to market medians (which approach applies to the executive directors, group executive board members and other senior fee earners). • benefits & pension: no changes are proposed and these continue to be set below market rates. he will also receive a performance share plan grant in line with the other executive directors. fit remuneration consultants’ fees are based on a time and material basis, within the parameters of an overall annual budget. the objective is to set targets which provide an appropriate balance between being achievable and stretching. in line with the group’s philosophy that there is greater emphasis (than under listed company norms) on variable performance-related pay. consequently, 50% of any award payable above an amount equal to base salary is deferred into shares for three years. the committee reserves its ability to vary these proportions or apply different/additional measures in future years. the remaining 25% of annual performance-related profit share awards was based on individual performance against key strategic and operational objectives. the psp awards for 2018 will be up to two times each executive director’s base salary. were achieved from the strong 2017 eps base starting position, this would represent outstanding performance for shareholders. 67 savills plc report and accounts 2017 financial statements governance strategic report overview the performance share plan (‘psp’) number of shares directors at 31 december 2016

significantly below market median levels with greater emphasis on the performance-related elements of reward. new recruits would normally participate in defined contribution arrangements or take a non-pensionable salary supplement. in the event that an existing executive director or new executive director is required by the group to relocate, other benefits may be provided including (but not limited to) a relocation allowance, housing allowance and tax equalisation. in line with the group’s philosophy, there is greater emphasis on variable performance-related pay, while base salaries are set significantly below market median levels. for 2018 the weighting will be 75% in relation to the group’s annual profit performance, defined as underlying profit before tax performance, and 25% in relation to delivery against a mix of personal, strategic and operational objectives. unless the committee determines otherwise, this scale will normally be adjusted for any acquisitions/disposals in a single year which impact (on an annualised basis) upbt by more than 7.5%. performance conditions are currently based on two measures: • relative tsr against the ftse 250 (excluding investment trusts) or other appropriate comparator group • earnings per share. n/a shareholding guidelines • to encourage share ownership by the executive directors and ensure interests are aligned. executive directors are expected to purchase and/or retain all shares (net of tax) which vest under the group’s share plans (or any other discretionary long-term incentive arrangement introduced in the future) until such time as they hold a specified value of shares. once shareholding guidelines have been met, individuals are expected to retain these levels as a minimum. non-executive directors are not entitled to participate in any of the group’s incentive arrangements or share schemes. shares under the sip normally vest after five years, free from income tax and national insurance contributions. by order of the board chris lee group legal director & company secretary 14 march 2018 savills plc registered in england no. forward-looking statements should be regarded with caution due to uncertainties in economic trends and business risks. we designed audit procedures at group and significant component level to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. we compared management’s forecast with the latest board-approved budget and found them to be consistent. we tested a sample of revenue transactions to underlying contracts and third party completion documentation, for example, property sales completion statements, or asset or property management contracts, determining that these sales had taken place and were recorded in the correct period. there were no material issues identified by our testing of revenue recognition in the period. our procedures did not identify any further legal cases other than those identified by management. this risk is factored into our audit approach with respect to the provision against trade receivables. accounting for the acquisition required a provisional fair value exercise, including valuing separately identifiable intangible assets. specific audit procedures were also performed by a local team in spain over the aguirre newman balance sheet, following the acquisition on 29 december 2017. based upon group materiality, we did not carry out detailed audit procedures on savills europe other than aguirre newman. how we determined it 5% of group underlying profit before tax as defined in note 2.2 to the financial statements. we believe that underlying profit before tax is the most appropriate measure as it eliminates any disproportionate effect of exceptional charges and provides a consistent year-on-year basis for our work. 89 s a v ill s p l c report and accounts 2017 financial statements governance strategic report overview company statement of changes in equity

this may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss. the group’s investment in associates includes goodwill (net of any accumulated impairment loss) identified on acquisition (see note 17.1). prior impairments of non-financial assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date. subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against ‘other operating expenses’ in the income statement. trade payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. a defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors, such as age, years of service and compensation. (b) commercial transactional fees generally, revenue is recognised on the date of completion or when unconditional contracts have been exchanged. (e) investment management revenue represents commissions and fees receivable, net of marketing costs in accordance with the relevant fee agreements. it applies to all contracts with customers, except those in the scope of other standards. the group has policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before engaging with them. a risk control framework is used to assess the credit quality of clients, taking into account financial position, past experience and other factors. as at the reporting date, no significant credit risk existed in relation to banking counterparties. no credit limits were exceeded during the reporting year, and management does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counterparties. for more information on savills
