We have started the new financial year with an improved operational structure and strong financial footing, which, combined with increasing levels of recurring revenue, leaves me optimistic for the Group’s growth prospects ahead. We believe that the foundations are now firmly laid for us to capture growth in our chosen markets and complement these with carefully considered acquisitions. This desire to embrace the best of breed technologies which can drive these efficiencies means that knowledge of better, more cost effective, reliable and secure solutions in a changing environment drives customers to partner with us as we help guide and advise them along their journey. We become part of our customers’ IT function and our close and increasing engagement with them is demonstrated by an overall net increase in customer spend year on year for the past three years. Our target market is servicing the UK corporate sector that has traditionally managed and housed their own IT infrastructure on premise. As our customers develop, the opportunity grows and results in more of their services being outsourced to us. Acquisitions In July 2016 the Group acquired Sys-Pro for an initial consideration of £4.0m, paid 85% cash and 15% in new ordinary shares at 60 pence per share, funded by way of a placing raising £5.0m gross. Market drivers and overall trend underline the substantial opportunity to us in this base. As at 31 March 2017 there is £0.47m of deferred revenue (2016: £0.71m) which will be released to profit in future periods. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) for the year to 31 March 2017 is £0.81m (2016: £0.67m). Balance Sheet Net cash inflow from operating activities during the year amounted to £1.22m (2016: £0.65m). This figure includes an amount of £0.47m (2016: £0.71m) for deferred revenue which will be released to profit in future years. Contingent consideration on the acquisition of Q4Ex Ltd has now been fully settled given all performance criteria were satisfied. Post period end however this has now been settled by a one-off payment of £150,000. This is a post balance sheet event and has also removed some operational challenges by removing certain approval processes required with the vendors allowing for integration to be accelerated and is explained in more detail in note 24.

If any of these suppliers fail in the provision of their services it may have an adverse effect on the Group’s ability to provide services to its customers. The Group has designed its network to have no single point of failure, it connects with transit providers at different geographical locations. The risk is that we may not be able to find suitable acquisition targets. We have achieved our objectives of fundamentally transforming the business to focus on high growth managed services whilst delivering enhanced profitability and results in line with market expectations, while at the same time integrating a large acquisition. This Strategic Report was approved and signed by order of the board. He has also been on the Board of Manchester United Football Club since 1982. Christopher Evans Chief Executive Officer Chris studied Software Engineering at Liverpool John Moores University before founding Switch Media Ltd, a web hosting provider. In recent years, Amy managed Livingbridge’s investment in Onyx, the IT infrastructure services provider and was also a non-executive director of Onyx up until its sale to Pulsant, one of the UK’s largest datacentre providers. Prior to Livingbridge, Amy spent six years at KPMG where she qualified as an accountant before joining the TMT Transaction Services team helping to advise private equity and corporate clients on due diligence and strategic option development across a wide variety of transactions. Short-term flexibility is achieved through available cash balances and its revolving credit facility. In order to manage credit risk, the agreement with the customer states preferred collection by direct debit and limits are set for customers based on a combination of payment history and third party credit references. Executive Directors who are entitled to receive pension contributions may nominate a defined contribution scheme into which the Company makes payments on their behalf. Consequently, decisions are made promptly following consultation amongst the Directors concerned where necessary and appropriate. Any system of internal controls can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that material financial irregularities will be detected or that risk of failure to achieve business objectives is eliminated. It aims to increase market integrity and investor protection, enhancing the attractiveness of securities markets for capital raising. The Group has a range of polices which are aimed at retaining and providing incentives for key staff.

Statement of Compliance These Group and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs and IFRIC interpretations) as endorsed by the European Union (“endorsed IFRS”) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies preparing their accounts under endorsed IFRS. Revenue from value added resale is recognised as these products or services are delivered. Basis of Consolidation Where the company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value and an impairment provision will be recognised if there is evidence that the amount is irrecoverable and will be shown in administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. SysGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 56 Share Based Payments The fair value of employee options granted is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding increase in equity. Obligations under such agreements are included in payables net of the finance charge allocated to future periods. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Depreciation is provided at annual rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset over its expected useful life, as follows: IT hardware 20% - 33.3% both reducing balance and straight line Furniture and fittings 20% – 33.3% reducing balance Investment in Subsidiaries Fixed asset investments in the Parent Company are shown at cost less any provision for impairment as necessary. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either: • the same taxable Group company; or • different Group entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or recovered. However, the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. The Group’s objective is to ensure adequate funding for continued growth and expansion.
