We move at the speed of our audience and are in constant dialogue with them: talking, showing, listening, understanding, improving. For example, we might showcase the same product line using live activity in Facebook and through stories on Instagram. It’s boundary- pushing and inclusive, featuring diversity like no other magazine of its type – see page 41 for more. Built from scratch by us to create the very best ASOS experience, it has a rare 5-star rating in global app stores. Our on-site pattern-cutting facility means we can create samples in days and take new products from ideas to shipping within weeks. Brand partners We stock c.850 brands of all shapes and sizes: from big global names to virtually unknown local designers. So we broke the mould by offering true size options for our entire range of styles – from normal everyday items to hot trends. We’ve also run a series of workshops on women’s health, family finance and eye care in rural villages around SOKO Kenya. They want to know where their orders are, so we now have tracked services on 98% of global deliveries. Constant care We’re here for our customers 24/7 and 365 days a year, with native support in eight languages. This is one reason why we never split an order, but bundle multiple items into a single delivery.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 19 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT I’m pleased to be writing this as we mark another year of continued strong growth, with a 33% increase in sales across all markets. I’d like to thank them on behalf of the Board and our shareholders for all they do. The Group retail sales growth of 34% to £1,876.5m (2016: £1,403.7m) was once again driven by strong product, proposition improvements and further price investments across major markets. ASOS’s Click & Collect delivery proposition has now been expanded globally, UK total coverage increased to 9,000 locations with an improved Next Day order cut off of 7pm, whilst Click & Collect launched into Italy and the United States in September, giving an additional 11,000 collection points across those two territories. There will be continued expansion of Click & Collect points globally, targeting the UK, France, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden and Australia. ASOS offers customer support 24/7 365 days a year across email, live chat, social media and telephony in nine languages. Planning permission for a small office extension has been granted and building works will commence in the next few weeks. The new platform handled record volumes of transactions during peak trading period, which at one point reached 33 orders per second. A critical benefit of this new platform is the enhanced ability to deliver technological change and innovation at pace. Finally, to further drive global growth, ASOS will also launch additional payment methods, new language sites and delivery propositions. Net Promoter Score, an indicator of how likely customers are to recommend ASOS, has increased as shown below. This can potentially increase costs or reduce the effectiveness of key e-commerce drivers (in particular brand and digital marketing activities). Our Executive Board frequently review margins so that adjustments can be made quickly when needed — Zonal pricing capability enables us to take into account the variability in costs including foreign exchange rates DOWN TECHNOLOGICAL RISKS Robustness of IT systems and infrastructure As an online retailer, we’re particularly reliant on our IT infrastructure. ASOS retained its first place position for unique visitors to apparel retailers in the 15-34 age range (Comscore, August 2017). Delivery receipts increased by 18% which lagged retail sales growth as customers increasingly took advantage of more extensive free shipping options. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 35 Taxation The effective tax rate from continuing operations before exceptional items increased by 60bps to 19.9% (2016: 19.3%). Over 85 senior leaders and subject experts from ASOS are participating in seven steering groups which report into a central executive board chaired by our CEO. We’re piloting an in-factory gender programme to better understand and address some of the obstacles for women in gaining equal opportunity employment. We’re also expanding team capacity in our key product sourcing regions to make sure the people responsible for driving ethical standards understand country-specific risks and engage regularly with local stakeholders. We promote alternatives to animal-derived materials by featuring faux fur, non-leather and synthetic down products in our collections. Working with others to improve supply chain practices We’re engaging in a number of initiatives to collaboratively address challenges in implementing labour standards, including: — ACT, an initiative which brings together 17 clothing brands and trade unions to address the issue of living wage in the textile and garment supply chain — Fast-forward, an auditing initiative involving other major UK retailers, aimed at addressing UK-specific supply chain issues and promoting best practice standards across the industry — Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), an alliance of companies, NGOs and trade unions which promotes labour standards in global supply chains. 4 Engaging customers on sustainability: raising awareness around an increasingly broad range of sustainable fashion and beauty products across ASOS. Customers praise our magazine for pushing boundaries and being inclusive across its content, whether this is by featuring people from diverse ethnic backgrounds or with body shapes you don’t typically see in mainstream media. One of the most important things we do for our customers is provide fraud protection and data privacy services. This has been recognised by LinkedIn, who voted us as the second most attractive UK employer, up from sixth place last year. We have a robust learning offer to support them through their journey here at ASOS, focusing on employability and personal development. We’re continuing to support this and hope that all carriers will soon be using the loose load system. Safety Our employees and everyone working on behalf of ASOS are entitled to work in a safe environment. Environment As an online business, we deliver products directly to customers without the need for bricks and mortar stores. We can only publish emissions data from the previous year in this report due to differing reporting timeframes. For example, we’re more aware of which delivery/return routes and options (i.e. standard versus fast delivery option) are the most carbon intensive. We now follow Defra best practice and account for radiative forcing in flight emissions – the higher impact of greenhouse gases when they’re released at altitude. In the UK, we started an employee car- sharing scheme at our Barnsley, Hemel Hempstead and Leavesden premises. STRATEGIC REPORT ASOS PLC 46 — We established our first Get Into Fashion course which led to nine young people being offered temporary roles in the ASOS Buying and Merchandising teams – five students were also offered 12-month Fixed Term Contract roles after finishing our Get Into Technology programme. — Ten ASOS employees were able to volunteer in India at Udayan Care this year, refurbishing living spaces and running workshops for the children as part of our fourth annual Give a Week Away. Having grown at around 30% for many years, our trajectory is impressive and we’re incredibly proud to be part of this story. Our take on corporate governance As a Board, we recognise and appreciate the uniquely special culture that is ASOS. In March 2017, Andrew was appointed Chair of the Barons Court Project a charity for people who are homeless or living with mental health problems. A series of departmental ‘deep dives’, led by senior management on operationally significant areas, were also instigated with the Board. Periodic rotation of key audit partners is also required and, in line with that policy, having overseen our external auditing for five years, the previous audit partner from PwC stood down and was replaced by Andy Latham with effect from the financial year ended 31 August 2017. But we are also conscious that several significant enhancements have been made to our remuneration mechanics over recent years. Normally measured over a one-year performance period, based on a mix of financial targets (e.g. profit before tax and exceptional items), non- financial performance and personal objectives relevant to the year, which are set taking into account the Company’s strategic objectives over that period. Not applicable Non- executive directors Provide fees appropriate to time commitments and responsibilities of each role Cash fee normally paid on a monthly basis. This helps ensure investment made to drive sales is executed while delivering a sustainable profit margin for shareholders. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to: — Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently. Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to cash-generating units (CGUs), which include the geographical business segments as described in Note 3. Any provision made against an impaired receivable is recognised within administrative expenses in the Statement of Total Comprehensive Income. On 5 May 2016, the Group discontinued its local operations in China which were undertaken by ASOS (Shanghai) Commerce Co. Limited (ASOS.cn). This does not include internal website development and maintenance costs, which are expensed as incurred unless representing a technological advance leading to future economic benefit. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the assets’ expected economic lives, normally between three to seven years. At each reporting date, property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. As at 31 August 2017, receivables from subsidiary undertakings of £1.2m (2016: £2.1m) were unimpaired and considered by management to be fully recoverable. All operating subsidiaries’ results are included in the consolidated financial statements, based on percentage of voting rights held.
