accounts 2017 19 chairman’s statement i’m pleased to be writing this as we mark another year of continued strong growth, with a 33% increase in sales across all markets. our focus continues to be on finding ways in each market to give customers more of what they want, using technology and data to provide customers with a more personalised, convenient and reliable service, as nick talks about in his operational review on page 20. we also believe that delivering fashion with integrity at scale will be a powerful – and essential – differentiator within our industry, and you can read about how we’re doing this on pages 36 to 46. we’re very aware of the possibility of disruption, having disrupted retail from the outside ourselves. i’d like to thank them on behalf of the board and our shareholders for all they do. we’re also very aware that customers are becoming more conscious of how businesses use their data. the group retail sales growth of 34% to £1,876.5m (2016: £1,403.7m) was once again driven by strong product, proposition improvements and further price investments across major markets. as previously noted, the continuing fx tailwind enabled reinvestment at a faster rate than initially planned. globally by 2020. asos’s longstanding ‘fashion with integrity’ initiative encompasses nine principal aspects of ethical trading. asos’s click & collect delivery proposition has now been expanded globally, uk total coverage increased to 9,000 locations with an improved next day order cut off of 7pm, whilst click & collect launched into italy and the united states in

instant, asos’ same day delivery service, has just launched in london, with further uk cities to follow. there will be continued expansion of click & collect points globally, targeting the uk, france, germany, netherlands, sweden and australia. asos offers customer support 24/7 365 days a year across email, live chat, social media and telephony in nine languages. planning permission for a small office extension has been granted and building works will commence in the next few weeks. the new platform handled record volumes of transactions during peak trading period, which at one point reached 33 orders per second. a critical benefit of this new platform is the enhanced ability to deliver technological change and innovation at pace. finally, to further drive global growth, asos will also launch additional payment methods, new language sites and delivery propositions. these investments will lay the foundation for c.60% more unit capacity and c.£4bn of net sales per annum. net promoter score, an indicator of how likely customers are to recommend asos, has increased as shown below. this can potentially increase costs or reduce the effectiveness of key e-commerce drivers (in particular brand and digital marketing activities). — our business model is specifically based around engagement with customers, including providing them with a range of fashion services and content as well as great fashion retail – which in turn reduces the reliance on e-commerce drivers such as digital marketing — having been one of the first movers in online fashion retail, we have greater experience in how to best use e-commerce drivers such as brand and digital marketing in a fashion context than newer entrants to the market, and we continue to drive greater effectiveness through innovation and improving efficiencies with our platform — investment in broader marketing channels while testing other new opportunities — continue to understand the drivers for loyalty and advocacy

offset price investments and a continued shift into branded sales. annual report and accounts 2017 35 taxation the effective tax rate from continuing operations before exceptional items increased by

piloting an in-factory gender programme to better understand and address some of the obstacles for women in gaining equal opportunity employment. we’re also expanding team capacity in our key product sourcing regions to make sure the people responsible for driving ethical standards understand country-specific risks and engage regularly with local stakeholders. animal welfare we strongly believe that no animals should suffer in the name of fashion or cosmetics. we promote alternatives to animal-derived materials by featuring faux fur, non-leather and synthetic down products in our collections. working with others to improve supply chain practices we’re engaging in a number of initiatives to collaboratively address challenges in implementing labour standards, including: — act, an initiative which brings together 17 clothing brands and trade unions to address the issue of living wage in the textile and garment supply chain — fast-forward, an auditing initiative involving other major uk retailers, aimed at addressing uk-specific supply chain issues and promoting best practice standards across the industry — ethical trading initiative (eti), an alliance of companies,
