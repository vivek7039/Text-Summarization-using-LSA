The CloudCall suite of products allows companies to fully integrate their telephony systems into their  existing CRM software, enabling calls to be made, recorded, logged and categorised from within the  CRM system from which detailed activity reports can be easily generated. The Group has approximately 120 staff based predominantly in Leicester (UK), Boston (US) and Minsk  (Belarus). Our business model  CloudCall is a software company that designs, develops and operates integrated communications  services for CRM systems. CloudCall software, in combination with its two core telephony platforms sited in the UK and US, delivers  data driven, intelligent, cost effective telecoms services directly to the end-users of its customers via  their CRM systems. CloudCall’s current geographic reach extends from North America, through the UK and  mainland Europe. Contracts are directly with the end-customers (typically minimum period of 2 years),  with a small percentage of recurring revenues being paid to the relevant CRM partner as long as their  customer remains a CloudCall customer. Telephony services are either  charged out via all-inclusive call packages, or on a ‘pay as you go’ (PAYG) per minute basis. These service fees  facilitate effective on-boarding, which in turn leads to higher levels of user adoption and a demonstrably  faster return on investment for customers. All new customers are regularly contacted throughout the on-boarding process to ensure they remain  satisfied and engaged. Following delivery, they are also routinely contacted for post-implementation  feedback, looking to identify and resolve any ongoing issues. This presents a significant  opportunity for the Group as Bullhorn has recently announced acquisitions which will significantly add  to their global footprint. Following the half year results in September 2017, institutional investor demand was sufficiently strong  that the Board were able to recommend a new share placing, raising £5.7m of equity finance (before  costs) at a price of 143.5 pence per share. This additional funding, combined with the enhanced Barclays facility has ensured that the investment  capital is now in place to confidently support further product development and sales and marketing  expansion, in addition to broadening our CRM partner reach during 2018. Our strengthened balance sheet when combined with our growing monthly recurring revenue base,  increasing product capabilities, strong user growth and improved customer retention, gives the Board  comfort that the business is well-placed to continue delivering its focussed growth strategy through  2018 and beyond. Cloudcall Group plc  2017 Annual Report and Financial Statements  Strategic Report     6    Cloudcall Group plc  Registered number: 05509873  Outlook  Following our most recent equity raise, the Board has conducted a review of the levels of investment  in our platform and sales channel development to optimise the cash resources available to ensure our  ambitious growth targets are delivered in 2018 and beyond. This  trend is particularly marked within the recruitment and staffing sector with several new key accounts  growing rapidly, making inroads into our top 10 customer list. It should be noted however, that their enhanced purchasing power with often  larger and longer commercial terms being negotiated has had a slight adverse impact on overall average  recurring revenue per user. Cloudcall Group plc  2017 Annual Report and Financial Statements  Strategic Report     8    Cloudcall Group plc  Registered number: 05509873  Resource limitations were also being keenly felt in product development, where for much of the year a  significant portion of our software development resource was focussed on rebuilding our core  infrastructure into a robust, multi-channel communications platform that would enable us to scale more  quickly in 2018. This exercise naturally restricted our ability to launch new revenue impacting products  and services in 2017. Continuing with this approach, would have necessitated building bespoke iterations of  any new feature, such as SMS or messaging, for each supported CRM integration. Now that this fundamental architectural change has been made, we are able to move forward at a  much faster pace. However, adjusting for that acquisition,  repositions our penetration of their revised total EMEA users to 14%. I’m delighted  to say that the various charity and community initiatives we launched in 2016 are now flourishing. I  believe this can be exemplified by numerous staff members braving the ‘Beast from the East’ cold all  night, looking out for, and helping homeless people in Leicester completely from their own initiative,  which made me particularly proud. I’m therefore pleased to announce that whilst we don’t expect to see full contribution from our  newly hired sales heads until Q2, our existing sales team have had a strong January and February and  that trading is in line with expectations. £4.86m £6.87m 42%  Gross Margin Strong gross margins within the Group’s operating units  are indicative of focus on delivering higher value  implementation services, an effective mix of pre-paid vs  pay-as-you-go telephony, effective partner management  and better procurement from upstream telecoms  partners. Share Based  Payments)  Reducing operating losses show a strong commitment  toward prudent cost management and ensuring that  operating expense growth is contained to the minimum  level required to support the Group’s growth and quality  of customer experience objectives. For a SaaS business  that is beginning to scale, operating cost growth will be  much lower than revenue growth once the core  infrastructure is built, although periods of investment in  the business will take operating expenses higher as and  when that investment takes place. (£3.01m) (£2.01m) (33%)  Cloudcall Group plc  2017 Annual Report and Financial Statements  Strategic Report     12    Cloudcall Group plc  Registered number: 05509873  KPIs (continued)  KPI Link to strategic goals 31 Dec  2016  31 Dec  2017  Growth  in 2017  Net Cash  (Outflow)  from  Operating  Activities  In maturing pre-profit SaaS businesses, cash outflows  from operating activities, (sometimes referred to as cash  burn) reduce as revenues outgrow operating costs. It should be noted, that periods  of investment to facilitate further growth will temporarily  increase cash burn in the short term. £3.17m £4.87m 54%  No of End  Users  User counts are taken at the point an order is signed,  and growth is indicative of both strong sales activity into  larger new clients, as well as successful customer  account management driving uplifts from the current  customer base. 16,217 23,520      45%  Monthly  Recurring  Revenue Per  User (RRPU)  Strength in new product / feature development and  successful upselling from within the existing customer  base and to new customers will drive growth in RRPU,  however, this will be naturally diluted as larger customers  negotiate better pricing arrangements, and geographic  expansion into the US will also dilute as VOIP costs per  user are typically lower in a more mature market. Debt and financing expenses  The Company has no outstanding debt (2016: £0.9m) and a net financing expense of £73k  (2016: £71k)  On 12 July 2017, the Company announced that it had secured a new revolving loan facility (the  “Facility”) with Barclays Bank, replacing its previous sterling term loan facility of £900,000 which was  fully drawn and due for repayment in February 2018. Funds can be drawn as required by the Company, typically for fixed periods of 3, 6 or 12 months. Staff retention is encouraged by a range of staff benefits including  competitive salaries, variable pay schemes, share based incentive plans, health care, pensions,  death in service benefits and excellent office locations, facilities and social events. Whilst these partnerships are secured by contracts and in most cases alternative  partners could be found in the short to medium term, a loss of support or disruption of service  from any key partner could have a short term detrimental impact on CloudCall’s reputation and  business. Whilst the  Group cannot necessarily quantify and negate these risks at this point in time, it is fully engaged in  active conversations with all its stakeholders to ensure it has as much warning as possible of any  potential impact to specific commercial arrangements. The Board has detailed approved budgets,  investment plans and rolling business forecasts, including cash flow projections, which it keeps under  regular review, at least monthly, to ensure the adequacy of working capital at all times. Management  closely monitors exchange rate fluctuations and will use forward contracts when considered appropriate  to reduce this risk. In addition, the Company delivers its Annual and Interim results via a webinar which is open to all  shareholders.

Cloudcall Group plc  2017 Annual Report and Financial Statements  Financial Statements     45    Cloudcall Group plc  Registered number: 05509873  This, together with a successful track record in raising new capital, are key factors in providing further  comfort that the Group will have sufficient access to the funding it needs to execute its strategy and  meet its financial commitments. Intangible assets and goodwill    All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Management  expects this standard to not have a material impact although some additional disclosure will arise. Management expects  this standard to have an impact on the Group financial statements when it is adopted. Under IFRS 15, technical installation, and set up services do not meet  the criteria to be a distinct performance obligation. The Directors have concluded that although there will be a deferral of both revenue and costs in relation  to set up and technical installation services, the impact on profit or loss is expected to be immaterial. The carrying amount of ongoing development projects on which amortisation has not yet commenced  was £550k (2016: £145k). The recoverable amount was determined using a  value in use methodology based on discounted cash flow projections. The risk free rate is based on a zero-coupon UK government bond as at 31 August 2017. On 24 October 2017, 2,457,774 ordinary shares were issued for cash at a price of 143.5 pence per  share to fund further development and working capital in the Group. On 8 December 2017, 1,505,226 ordinary shares were issued for cash at a price of 143.5 pence per  share to fund further development and working capital in the Group. Financial instruments    Exposure to currency and credit risk arises in the normal course of business. Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments    A change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased/(decreased)  equity and profit or loss by an amount which is deemed to be immaterial. Exchange differences arising on the  settlement of invoices are taken to profit or loss as incurred.
