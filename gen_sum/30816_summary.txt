calls to be made, recorded, logged and categorised from within the crm system from which detailed activity reports can be easily generated. our business model cloudcall is a software company that designs, develops and operates integrated communications services for crm systems. telephony services are either charged out via all-inclusive call packages, or on a ‘pay as you go’ (payg) per minute basis. these service fees facilitate effective on-boarding, which in turn leads to higher levels of user adoption and a demonstrably faster return on investment for customers. all new customers are regularly contacted throughout the on-boarding process to ensure they remain satisfied and engaged. following delivery, they are also routinely contacted for post-implementation feedback, looking to identify and resolve any ongoing issues. this presents a significant opportunity for the group as bullhorn has recently announced acquisitions which will significantly add to their global footprint. following the half year results in september 2017, institutional investor demand was sufficiently strong that the board were able to recommend a new share placing, raising £5.7m of equity finance (before costs) at a price of 143.5 pence per share. this trend is particularly marked within the recruitment and staffing sector with several new key accounts growing rapidly, making inroads into our top 10 customer list. it should be noted however, that their enhanced purchasing power with often larger and longer commercial terms being negotiated has had a slight adverse impact on overall average recurring revenue per user. cloudcall group plc 2017 annual report and financial statements strategic report 8 cloudcall group plc registered number: 05509873 resource limitations were also being keenly felt in product development, where for much of the year a significant portion of our software development resource was focussed on rebuilding our core infrastructure into a robust, multi-channel communications platform that would enable us to scale more quickly in 2018. this exercise naturally restricted our ability to launch new revenue impacting products and services in 2017. an improved platform to facilitate growth driven largely by the millennial generation, there is an underlying shift from the more traditional methods of communication towards texting and instant messaging. continuing with this approach, would have necessitated building bespoke iterations of any new feature, such as sms or messaging, for each supported crm integration. now that this fundamental architectural change has been made, we are able to move forward at a much faster pace. i’m delighted to say that the various charity and community initiatives we launched in 2016 are now flourishing. i’m therefore pleased to announce that whilst we don’t expect to see full contribution from our newly hired sales heads until q2, our existing sales team have had a strong january and february and that trading is in line with expectations. £4.86m £6.87m 42% gross margin strong gross margins within the group’s operating units are indicative of focus on delivering higher value implementation services, an effective mix of pre-paid vs pay-as-you-go telephony, effective partner management and better procurement from upstream telecoms partners. share based payments) reducing operating losses show a strong commitment toward prudent cost management and ensuring that operating expense growth is contained to the minimum level required to support the group’s growth and quality of customer experience objectives. for a saas business that is beginning to scale, operating cost growth will be much lower than revenue growth once the core infrastructure is built, although periods of investment in the business will take operating expenses higher as and when that investment takes place. it should be noted, that periods of investment to facilitate further growth will temporarily increase cash burn in the short term. £3.17m £4.87m 54% no of end users user counts are taken at the point an order is signed, and growth is indicative of both strong sales activity into larger new clients, as well as successful customer account management driving uplifts from the current customer base. 16,217 23,520 45% monthly recurring revenue per user (rrpu) strength in new product / feature development and successful upselling from within the existing customer base and to new customers will drive growth in rrpu, however, this will be naturally diluted as larger customers negotiate better pricing arrangements, and geographic expansion into the us will also dilute as voip costs per user are typically lower in a more mature market. funds can be drawn as required by the company, typically for fixed periods of 3, 6 or 12 months. whilst these partnerships are secured by contracts and in most cases alternative partners could be found in the short to medium term, a loss of support or disruption of service from any key partner could have a short term detrimental impact on cloudcall’s reputation and business. whilst the group cannot necessarily quantify and negate these risks at this point in time, it is fully engaged in active conversations with all its stakeholders to ensure it has as much warning as possible of any potential impact to specific commercial arrangements. management closely monitors exchange rate fluctuations and will use forward contracts when considered appropriate to reduce this risk. in addition, the company delivers its annual and interim results via a webinar which is open to all shareholders. the directors who held office during the year were as follows: appointed / re-elected peter simmonds simon cleaver re-elected 22 may 2017 paul williams
