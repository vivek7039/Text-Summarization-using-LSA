Key priorities for 2018 are as follows:  • Continued organic growth – focus on our core business • Continued strong cash conversion – focus on margin and  payment terms • Bolt on acquisitions – enhancing continued organic growth • New digital platform – differentiation in a tight labour market PeoplePlus is built on three key themes of helping people to: • Transform lives – through our work in Justice Services and Adult  Social Care • Get jobs and keep jobs – through our work with youth  employment programmes, employability programmes across   the UK, including helping people set up their own businesses • Develop careers – through our work in Apprenticeships and   Adult Education It is a trusted partner in delivering employability, skills and well- being services. The five-year  underlying operating profit target of  £30m was comfortably exceeded, being  achieved two years early, in 2015. John Crabtree OBE Chairman *  Underlying profit before tax excludes amortisation  of intangible assets arising on business  combinations, acquisition and exceptional  reorganisation costs, and the non-cash charge/ credit for share based payment costs (“SBPC”)  **  Net debt including unamortised transaction costs Revenue growth +8.5% Dividend growth +3.5% 7 Overview Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Dividends The Group is in a robust financial position  with good cash generation and a strong  balance sheet. Board changes and   senior management overview I am pleased to announce that, with  effect from 24 January 2018, Chris  Pullen is appointed as Chief Executive  of Staffline Group plc. Chris succeeds  Andy Hogarth who will step down from  his current role while remaining on the  Board as a Non-Executive Director. I am delighted that we have an experienced  management team in place to deliver the  Group’s next development plan. I would  also like to thank the whole team for all their  continued efforts, support and contribution. Underpinned with strong  compliance and ethical standards Staffline is a values-based organisation  which exists to help our customers be more  successful. During the year, we invested  heavily within Recruitment, specifically  on IT infrastructure and new senior talent,  which saw overheads rise by 7.9%, the net  result of which is that underlying operating  profit, before finance charges, increased  by 7.4%, to £20.2m (2016: £18.8m). This has meant that we have  continued to win new business in line with  prior year levels of growth. This demonstrates that  Staffline’s geographical and operational  scale means we remain the go-to  supplier across most industry sectors. PeoplePlus is built on three key   themes of helping people to: • Transform lives – through our work in   justice services and adult social care • Get jobs and keep jobs – through our work  with youth employment programmes,  employability programmes across the UK,  including helping people set up their own  businesses • Develop careers – through our work in  Apprenticeships and Adult Education On the Work Programme, following the end  of referrals in March 2017, we have focused  on effective and efficient operational  delivery to counter the revenue decline  through to March 2021. Developing our people is key to us as  an organisation and we have many  ways of encouraging this. Our first Peak Performance Camp  was held with senior leaders across  the business in February 2017. This  has resulted in some strategic projects  taking place to explore more business  opportunities for growth. As the Apprenticeship Levy came into force  this year, Recruitment and PeoplePlus  divisions have worked collaboratively to  develop our programme, with our first  60 delegates embarking on a three-day  residential at Nottingham University to start  off on their apprenticeship programmes  in June 2017. This high level of performance will put us  in a strong position for the next iteration  of these contracts, which are a strategic  priority for us as we look to grow in the  offender learning and skills market. 14 Staffline Group plc Annual Report 2017 Chief Executive   Officer’s statement Continued Gender Pay Gap Reporting (“GPGR”) Our April 2017 GPGR review has almost  been completed and we are aiming to  put the results on our website by no later  than the middle of February 2018. General Data Protection Regulation  (“GDPR”)  Staffline will comply with applicable  GDPR regulations when they take effect in  2018, including as a data processor, while  also working closely with our providers  of finance, customers and partners to  meet contractual obligations for our  procedures, products and services. I am delighted that Staffline has such an  excellent internal successor to me in Chris  Pullen. Andy Hogarth Chief Executive Officer 23 January 2018 Last five years underlying operating  profit CAGR 29% Next five years targeted underlying  diluted EPS growth 77% 16 Staffline Group plc Annual Report 2017 Recruitment “ We are a leading  workforce recruitment  and management  organisation,  specialising in labour  solutions in agriculture,  food processing,  manufacturing,   e-retail, driving and   the logistics sectors.” Our vision is to Enable the Future of Work by helping society as  people increasingly want to work with more flexibility, when they  want and where they want and helping our customers to be more  efficient by providing flexible workforces, when they want and  where they want 17 Overview Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements • Continued expansion of the OnSite model,   increased by 38 sites during the year. We acknowledge  that the adjustments made to arrive at  underlying profit may not be comparable to  those made by other companies, mainly in  respect of the adjustment for share based  payment charges, including both equity and  cash settled components. Free cashflows, being underlying EBITDA  plus working capital movement, less tax paid  and capex, amount to £37.9m in 2017 (2016:  £36.0m). Our Recruitment division revenue  accounting policy, detailed within the  accounting policies section of this Annual  Report, is unaffected by the application  of this new standard as we currently  recognise revenue once a performance  obligation has been delivered. The Board recognises that  effective risk management is a critical part of  achieving our strategic objectives. Operational Pressure on  margins by  customers Recent trends have seen Recruitment  revenues increase but with lower increases  in gross profit. Recruitment uses a pricing model to  ensure no offer is quoted or accepted  which would put unacceptable pressure  on margins. New business wins improve efficiency  (overheads spread over larger base)  and reduce the impact of one customer  demanding lower margins. New starter ID checks 150,400  (2016: 144,100) 28 Staffline Group plc Annual Report 2017 Corporate social  responsibility  Building a  sustainable  future At Staffline, we place great  importance on the role we  play in helping support  local communities and the  environment surrounding us. This will continue to focus on  our energy consumption, waste, travel  and use of sustainable materials.

The system of internal  financial control is designed to provide  reasonable, but not absolute, assurance  against material misstatement or loss. Within the payroll team we  maintain appropriate levels of ongoing  training to ensure compliance with  relevant legislation and procedures. In special circumstances, such  as when they are large scale, acquisitions  continue to be run on separate systems. However, we  have reported on certain of our Corporate  Governance arrangements by drawing upon  best practice available. In deciding appropriate levels, the  Committee takes into account objective research on comparable  companies, general market conditions and performance. Two  directors, Andy Hogarth and Chris Pullen, are participants in the  Company’s SAYE scheme. John Crabtree, Ed Barker and Tracy Lewis each have  contracts terminable on six months’ notice given by either  party. Underperformance within these acquired businesses could  impact the impairment reviews performed on a Cash Generating  Unit level. Within the PeoplePlus segment there are a number of significant  contracts which include key performance measures, bonus and/ or penalty clauses. These include rebate clauses which result in  retrospective changes being made to agreed prices, depending  on key metrics over the contract life. In setting our audit scope, we included any individual subsidiary which contributed more than 15% to revenues or the underlying profit  before taxation. 46 Staffline Group plc Annual Report 2017 Consolidated statement of changes in equity For the year ended 31 December 2017 Share capital £’m Own shares JSOP £’m Share premium £’m Share- based payment reserve £’m Profit and loss account £’m Total equity £’m At 1 January 2016 2.8 (9.0) 39.9 0.1 39.4 73.2 Dividends (note 10) – – – – (5.8) (5.8) Sale of Joint Share Ownership Plan (“JSOP”)  shares no longer required – 0.1 – – 1.4 1.5 Share options issued in equity-settled   share-based payments – – – 0.1 – 0.1 Share options vested in the year (0.1) 0.1 – Transactions with owners – 0.1 – – (4.3) (4.2) Profit for the year – – – – 15.8 15.8 Actuarial losses (note 17) – – – – (1.1) (1.1) Cumulative translation adjustments – – – – – – Total comprehensive income for the year,  net of tax – – – – 14.7 14.7 At 31 December 2016 2.8 (8.9) 39.9 0.1 49.8 83.7 Dividends (note 10) – – – – (6.7) (6.7) Issue of new shares – share options exercised – – 0.4 – – 0.4 Share options issued in equity-settled   share-based payments – – – – – – Transactions with owners – – 0.4 – (6.7) (6.3) Profit for the year – – – – 18.3 18.3 Actuarial gains (note 17) – – – – 0.2 0.2 Cumulative translation adjustments – – – – (0.1) (0.1) Total comprehensive income for the year,  net of tax – – – – 18.4 18.4 At 31 December 2017 2.8 (8.9) 40.3 0.1 61.5 95.8 The accompanying notes form an integral part of these financial statements. An impairment review is undertaken when events or circumstances indicate the carrying  amount may not be recoverable. Individual intangible assets or cash-generating units that include goodwill with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at least  annually. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss  previously recognised may no longer exist. This applies also to temporary  differences associated with shares in subsidiaries if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is  probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. The schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance  companies or trustee-administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations. In addition, long-term provisions are discounted to their present values, where time value of money is material. All provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. Share-based employee remuneration All share based payment arrangements are recognised in the consolidated financial statements. No adjustment is made to the expense recognised in prior periods if fewer share options  ultimately are exercised than originally estimated. Performance Related Share Option Plan Other than options granted to Diane Martyn and Chris Pullen (both directors of the Company), details of which are fully disclosed within  the Report on Remuneration on pages 35 to 37, no other performance related share options have been granted. Included in the trade and other receivables balance above is a bad debt provision of £0.1m (2016: £0.1m). It is also assumed that members commute 75% of  the maximum HMRC allowance based on current commutation factors. In 2016, the Group  secured a further £7.5m of working capital facility, available to be drawn down with two days’ notice. “Others” represent the £0.8m effect of intangibles acquired relating to Brightwork and Oak Recruitment this year. No sub-lease income is due as all assets  held under lease agreements are used exclusively by the Group. The Group’s trade and other receivables are actively monitored to avoid significant concentrations of credit risk. The Group has adopted a policy of carefully monitoring all customers, especially those who lack an appropriate credit history. deal fees (16.8) (37 .2) (63.7) (17 .8) 4.9 Goodwill, intangibles 115.0 117 .4 128.2 81.7 35.0 Other net assets (2.4) 3.5 8.7 0.6 5.9 Cash flows Underlying operating profit 39.1 40.0 30.3 19.4 12.8 Non–underlying cash costs – (6.6 ) (4.1) (0.7) – Depreciation, amortisation 4.4 4.9 3.6 2.0 1.0 Working capital movements 4.4 8.7 (14.0) (3.1) 6.2 Capital expenditure, inc. software (3.8) (6.9) (4.4 ) (2.7) (2.8) Taxation paid (net) (6.2) (4.0) (5.0) (2.5) (3.1) Free cash from operations 37 .9 36.1 6.4 12.4 14.1 Dividends and interest paid (9.3) (8.9) (5.8) (3.3) (2.4 ) Business acquisitions inc. debt acquired (8.5) (1.9) (45.4 ) (46.8) (2.8) Issue of share capital, share sales 0.3 1.5 – 15.4 0.5 Others – (0.3) (1.1) (0.4 ) 0.1 Reduction/(increase) in net debt 20.4 26.5 (45.9) (22.7) 9.5 82 Staffline Group plc Annual Report 2017 Company registration number: 05268636 Registered office: 19–20 The Triangle NG2 Business Park Nottingham NG2 1AE Directors: Ed Barker (Non-Executive Director) John Crabtree OBE (Non-Executive Chairman) Andy Hogarth (Group Chief Executive) Tracy Lewis (Non-Executive Director) Diane Martyn (Group Managing Director) Chris Pullen (Chief Financial Officer) Secretary: Paul Collins Nominated advisor and joint broker: Liberum Capital Ropemaker Place 25 Ropemaker Street London EC2Y 9LY Joint broker: Berenberg 60 Threadneedle Street London EC2R 8HP Registrars: Computershare Investor Services plc PO Box 859 The Pavilions Bridgewater Road Bristol BS99 1XZ  Bankers: Lloyds Bank plc 33 Old Broad Street London BX2 1LB HSBC Bank plc Grove Park Penman Way Enderby LE19 1SY Solicitors: Browne Jacobson LLP Mowbray House Castle Meadow Road Nottingham NG2 1BJ Gowlings WLG (UK) LLP 2 Snow Hill Birmingham B4 6WR Statutory auditors: PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Chartered Accountants and Statutory Auditors 19 Cornwall Street Birmingham B3 2DT Financial and trade public relations: Buchanan Communications 107 Cheapside London EC2V 6DN Company details 83 Overview Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Notes 84 Staffline Group plc Annual Report 2017 Notes  Registered office 19 – 20 The Triangle NG2 Business Park Nottingham, NG2 1AE Staffline Group plc  Annual Report 2017
