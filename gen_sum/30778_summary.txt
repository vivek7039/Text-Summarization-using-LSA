further details on the group’s dividend policy can be found within the chief financial officer’s report on page 23. board changes and senior management overview i am pleased to announce that, with effect from 24 january 2018, chris pullen is appointed as chief executive of staffline group plc. chris succeeds andy hogarth who will step down from his current role while remaining on the board as a

across most industry sectors. 24 new delegates joined the programme in november 2017 with a further 40 planned for january 2018. these apprenticeships are aimed at our first line managers, enhancing their skills and capability to be the best they can be, delivering results through others, learning more about business improvement techniques and customer excellence. a gdpr steering committee has been set up to review the impact of the new regulation, with a programme of data security improvements due to be rolled out in q1 2018. operational pressure on margins by customers recent trends have seen recruitment revenues increase but with lower increases in gross profit. recruitment uses a pricing model to ensure no offer is quoted or accepted which would put unacceptable pressure on margins. new business wins improve efficiency (overheads spread over larger base) and reduce the impact of one customer demanding lower margins. as finance director, he led the mbo and subsequent trade sale in

designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. within the peopleplus segment there are a number of significant contracts which include key performance measures, bonus and/ or penalty clauses. these include rebate clauses which result in retrospective changes being made to agreed prices, depending on key metrics over the contract life. in setting our audit scope, we included any individual subsidiary which contributed more than 15% to revenues or the underlying profit before taxation. individual intangible assets or cash-generating units that include goodwill with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at least annually. with the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. no adjustment is made to the expense recognised in prior periods if fewer share options ultimately are exercised than originally estimated.
