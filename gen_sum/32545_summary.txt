copper india, as well as significant ramp up of volumes at aluminium, power and iron ore. our focus on optimising costs across our business through operational efficiencies has delivered savings of us$814 million over two years. a disciplined ramp up of production across our zinc, aluminium, iron ore and power businesses is delivering significant growth. the top three ideas were awarded after

case study last year we ran a contest with the theme ‘waste to value’ on eureka, our new digital platform to create and incubate in-house innovation and technology. the competition, which looked at ways to reduce wastage, received over 200 ideas from across our businesses, and the top three were selected to be further developed by an expert committee consisting of business ceos and senior management. an international union for conservation of nature review panel will monitor our progress throughout the process. we have learnt from these incidents and continue to work towards our zero harm strategy. to this end, we empower local communities and proactively engage them in resolving any concerns they have. the market: returning to balance we saw an altogether better environment for our business in fy2017 . when we look at the key demand drivers, there was much concern a year ago about china. our priorities production growth and asset optimisation deleveraging the balance sheet simplify group structure create sustainable value for all stakeholders identify next generation of resources our strategy for more information see pages 32-33 20 vedanta resources plc | annual report fy2017 chief executive’s statement continued we continue to analyse every incident, and through acting on what we learn, our safety kpis have showed measurable improvements, with ltifr down to 0.39 (fy2016: 0.51). our sustainable development agenda is at the core of vedanta’s strategic priorities and governs every business decision. in south africa, we are supporting pink drive, a non-profit organisation to create awareness on breast cancer. we are a signatory to the world business council for sustainable development ‘wash’ (water and sanitation hygiene) pledge. we have also been able to control costs, producing iron ore at a cash cost comparable with some of the world’s largest operations. continuing cost savings we complemented the benefits of better market conditions by maintaining tight financial discipline. despite many analysts saying that the industry appears to have reached ‘peak savings’, our programme continues to drive down costs intelligently and safely, through optimising our plant and through achieving material efficiencies across the supply chain. on a personal note, i have elected to step down as ceo at the end of august 2017 . sust ained economic growth will lead to development , grea ter prosperity and an overall increase in per-capit a spending. in addition, as a result of the negative environment over the past few years and limited investment by mining companies, a lack of new mining projects coming on stream is leading to supply pressures for some commodities, particularly zinc. china’s growth trajectory, as has been the case for many years, also plays an important role. indian economy india is a key market for vedanta and one which we believe has huge growth potential. in addition, enhanced transparency, accountability, an auction-based forward- looking framework and liberalisation of the foreign direct investment (fdi) policy will help unlock india’s economic potential. sustained economic growth will lead to development, greater prosperity and an overall increase in per-capita spending. market drivers and opportunities world demand for aluminium is expected to increase by 4% next year. in india, growth drivers include a range of infrastructure initiatives, including the smart cities project, ‘housing for all indians by 2022’ programme, industrial corridors, national highways development project and a focus on building renewable energy projects under the national electricity policy. but as warehouse stocks are drawn down we will see a steady rise in premiums. in india, zinc consumption per capita currently stands at 0.5kg, significantly below the global average of 1 .9kg. global consumption is also expected to grow steadily, at a rate of approximately 2% per annum, and our plans to bring production online at our gamsberg growth project this year will benefit from the current favourable market conditions. however, this in turn led to a higher rig count which has exerted downward pressure on prices. during 2016-17 gas imports were at their highest level for four years as domestic production has fallen steadily. india is underexplored, with only seven of the 26 sedimentary basins currently producing oil & gas, which offers significant opportunities. this growth in steel production represents an opportunity for vedanta to grow its domestic iron ore sales. divisional reviews see pages 70–103 for more

charges in prior year. c) foreign exchange fluctuation most of our operating currencies depreciated against the us dollar during fy2017 compared with fy2016. weaker currencies are favourable to vedanta, given the local cost base and predominantly us dollar-linked pricing. we have achieved a cumulative saving of over us$814 million under this programme in last 24 months compared with the fy2015 baseline. depreciation at oil & gas was down by us$134 million due to lower entitlement interest volume. depreciation at kcm decreased by us$66 million as a major portion of nchanga underground assets were fully depreciated in fy2016 post reaching its mine life. the increase was primarily driven by improved zinc and aluminium metal prices, improved volumes on account of our aluminium ramp up, full year operations at iron ore post resumption in august 2015, and all three units being operational at talwandi saboo. this was driven by strong operating performance, continued focus on the cost saving programme and disciplined capex outflow. the positives were partly offset by a temporary increase of mined metal inventory at our zinc india and iron ore businesses.

for fy2017 was higher by 5% at us$597 million, due to cost optimisation initiatives and reduced cess on an ad-valorem basis. new prospects based on both new-play concepts and proven- play extensions have added 436mmboe of prospective resources in fy2017 . exploration prospects have been firmed up for drilling in fy2018, based on the interpretations of newly acquired 3d seismic data. outlook we remain committed to maintaining a healthy free cash flow post-capex from the oil & gas business. we expect rajasthan production volumes to remain steady at 165,000boepd with potential upside from execution of growth projects in fy2018. key projects being planned are mangala infill, surface facility upgrade, aishwariya eor, bhagyam eor, rdg and barmer hill; and ❯ pursue an alternative strategy of executing projects through an integrated project development model in partnership with consortiums led by global oil field services majors. these increases were in line with the availability of mined metal, also supported by enhanced smelter efficiencies. however, these were marginally offset by lower metal volumes and a higher cost of production. when the mining expansion projects were announced in early 2013, share of mined metal from underground mines was 15%. further commissioning of both production and service winders was completed during the year as shaft equipping work continued to progress satisfactorily. gamsberg is targeted to start production mid-cy2018, and skorpion’s mine life has been extended by three years. excluding lisheen, total production was 7% higher than fy2016, primarily due to better performances from the skorpion and black mountain mines (bmm). in fy2017 , ebitda doubled to us$138 million from us$68 million in fy2016, driven mainly by higher zinc and lead prices, lower tc/rcs, a one-off insurance claim refund at scorpion skorpion zinc and a royalty refund at bmm. as we communicated last year, pre-start activities and waste- stripping at the project have progressed well. at skorpion, the pit 112 project is progressing well and all equipment will be in place by q1 fy2018. this project, which involves high wall push back of the existing pit, will increase the mine life from 0.5 years to 3 years and increase current reserves from 0.9 million tonnes (at 6.5% grade) to 4.2 million tonnes (at 9.9% grade). this led us to review and strengthen our overall systems; some of the initiatives are as follows. the increase was due mainly to volume ramp up and better price realisations, partly offset by higher met coke prices. with positive fundamentals in place, we will now be exploring the feasibility of expanding our smelter capacity. 90 vedanta resources plc | annual report fy2017 divisional review continued copper – india / australia operations in fy2017 , copper cathode production achieved a record level of 402,000 tonnes through in-house technological upgrades at the refinery that raised the previous design level density of 310amp/m2 to 350amp/m2. this was offset by lower copper grades and a few unplanned outages spread over the year. this has led to a significant reduction of hazardous cake generation, enhancing secured land fill (slf) life. also, the materially stronger fundamental developments that contributed to this surge have increased demand in china, due to a greater impact of government stimulus on the power grid investments, as well as higher end-use demand, particularly for appliances and consumer goods. financial performance (in us$ million, except as stated) fy2017 fy2016 %

tuticorin smelter, the cost of production increased from 3.2 us cents per lb to 5.0 us cents per lb, due mainly to lower by-product credits, higher petro prices and an increased clean energy cess on coal. the focus was on accelerated dewatering and development initiatives to improve long-term production from konkola mine, smelter throughput improvements, technology interventions to improve reliability of the tailings leach plant and resumption of nchanga underground mine in fy2017 . a third party consultant reviewed three dams and found no major deviation from the standard design or management practices. we are committing more resources to this challenge and have targeted a recycling rate of 10% for fy2018. in december 2016, we completed a project that enables expired materials to be processed through neutralisation and solidification at the nkana smelter complex. the unit cost of production (excluding royalty) was higher by 5.4% at 209 us cents per lb. in january 2017 , kcm

annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018, although entities are permitted to apply them earlier. the amendments are effective for periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018. earlier application is permitted. the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018. earlier application is permitted. no amount recognized in other comprehensive income

revenue from contracts with customers has also been applied. such items are material by nature or amount to the year’s result and require separate disclosure in accordance with ifrs. the determination as to which items should be disclosed separately requires a degree of judgement. such assets are amortised on straight line basis over the balance of license period, usually between 3 to 30 years. exploration and evaluation assets acquired are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition subject to meeting the commercial production criteria mentioned above and are subject to impairment review on an event of indication for impairment. following appraisal of successful exploration wells, if commercial reserves are established and technical feasibility for extraction demonstrated, then the related capitalised exploration costs are transferred into a single field cost centre within property, plant & equipment - development/producing assets (oil and gas properties) after testing for impairment. net proceeds from any disposal of an exploration asset are initially credited against the previously capitalised costs. changes in the estimates of commercial reserves or future field development costs are dealt with prospectively. the remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics. internal and external factors, such as worse economic performance than expected, changes in expected future prices, costs and other market factors are also monitored to assess for indications of impairment or reversal of previously recognised impairment losses. exploration areas in which reserves have been discovered but require major capital expenditure before production can begin, are continually evaluated to ensure that commercial quantities of reserves exist or to ensure that additional exploration work is under way or planned. (xvi) provisions for liabilities and charges provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation (legal or constructive), as a result of past events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources, that can be reliably estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation. trade receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. this includes certain non-derivative liabilities that are designated as hedge of the foreign currency risk on future, highly probable, forecast sales. these amounts will be written off to the income statement as exploration costs unless commercial reserves are established or the determination process is not completed and there are no indications of 2 (a) accounting policies (continued) 186 vedanta resources plc | annual report fy2017 impairment. the group also reviews its property, plant and equipment, including mining properties and leases, for possible impairment if there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable. the group has also carried out a sensitivity analysis on key variables like movement in copper prices, discount rate and production. (x) provisions and liabilities provisions and liabilities are recognised in the period when it becomes probable that there will be a future outflow of funds resulting from past operations or events that can be reasonably estimated. accordingly, the consideration receivable under the ppa relating to recovery of capacity charges towards capital cost have been recognised as operating lease rentals and in respect of variable cost that includes fuel costs, operations and maintenance etc. significant judgement is required in segregating the capacity charges due from state grid, between fixed and contingent payments. business segment financial data includes certain corporate costs, which have been allocated on an appropriate basis. 2 depreciation and amortisation is also provided to the chief operating decision maker on a regular basis. 3 transfer prices for inter segment sales are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. in the current year, haridwar and pantnagar units are eligible for deduction at 30% of taxable profits respectively. 202 vedanta resources plc | annual report fy2017 19. other non-current assets (us$ million) as at 31 march 2017 as at 31 march 2016 site restoration fund 50.5 38.9 others 1 248.7 30.3 financial (a) 299.2 69.2 deposits with government authorities 57.5 99.8 claims and other receivables 187.7 68.9 non-financial (b) 245.2 168.7 total (a+b) 544.4 237.9 1 includes receivables in power business transferred from current to non-current during the year. restricted cash and cash equivalents further includes us$17 .2 million (2016: us$nil) kept in short term deposits under lien, which can be utilized by the group for the repayment of bills of exchange facilities against which these have been pledged as security.
