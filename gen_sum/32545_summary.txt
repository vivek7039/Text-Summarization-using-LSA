strong financial profile proven track record with a significant amount of our capital investment programme completed, we are now ramping up and have commenced reaping benefits of those investments. we have taken a disciplined approach to development, growing our production steadily with an ongoing focus on operational efficiency and cost savings. a disciplined ramp up of production across our zinc, aluminium, iron ore and power businesses is delivering significant growth. the top three ideas were awarded after evaluation by an expert committee comprising of business ceos and senior cross-functional managers. we have also been able to control costs, producing iron ore at a cash cost comparable with some of the world’s largest operations. sust ained economic growth will lead to development , grea ter prosperity and an overall increase in per-capit a spending. in addition, enhanced transparency, accountability, an auction-based forward- looking framework and liberalisation of the foreign direct investment (fdi) policy will help unlock india’s economic potential. it has been defined taking into consideration the group’s risk tolerance level and is clearly linked to its

contracts, but our operations also process natural resources which help provide the products these communities need to further their development. in fy2016, vedanta signed an mou with the ministry of women & child development to construct 4,000 new- age nand ghars (anganwadis) across india. health: each cluster of 25-30 anganwadis will have access to a fully functional mobile medical unit (mmu) which provides essential primary healthcare services. once identified, these individuals were then given accelerated growth opportunities by way of transformational roles for delivering business goals. finally, we have implemented an incentive programme to encourage entrepreneurship by rewarding employees who develop new and innovative technologies for the business. focus area: future leadership vedanta attracts the best talent given its core strengths of high-quality performance, governance and value- based architecture. both zinc and oil are commodities that have a particularly favourable outlook, which we expect to deliver strong results. furthermore, we are looking at various mutually beneficial outsourcing models where service providers with technology can help improve volumes, recoveries and exploration efforts. we have achieved a cumulative saving of over us$814 million under this programme in last 24 months compared with the fy2015 baseline. depreciation at kcm decreased by us$66 million as a major portion of nchanga underground assets were fully depreciated in fy2016 post reaching its mine life. the positives were partly offset by a temporary increase of mined metal inventory at our zinc india and iron ore businesses.

independent group subsidiary, declared a special dividend of us$2.1 billion including ddt at its board meeting in march 2017 . severe but plausible risks were subsequently quantified both individually and in combination, to apply additional stress testing into the viability model. these constant efforts to optimise costs across the value chain have enabled healthy project economics even at us$40 per barrel. however, ebitda for fy2017 was higher by 5% at us$597 million, due to cost optimisation initiatives and reduced cess on an ad-valorem basis. further commissioning of both production and service winders was completed during the year as shaft equipping work continued to progress satisfactorily. excluding lisheen, total production was 7% higher than fy2016, primarily due to better performances from the skorpion and black mountain mines (bmm). the increase was due mainly to volume ramp up and better price realisations, partly offset by higher met coke prices. a third party consultant reviewed three dams and found no major deviation from the standard design or management practices. in december 2016, we completed a project that enables expired materials to be processed through neutralisation and solidification at the nkana smelter complex. financial performance (in us$ million, unless stated) fy2017 fy2016 % change revenue 874.3 972.5 (10.1)% ebitda 5.9 (17.9) –

jharsuguda-ii smelter . these activities included an extensive making better risk decisions (mbrd) programme where we trained our 200 frontline leaders across the aluminium businesses including balco. the rolled product facility at balco, which was temporarily shut down in q2 fy2016, restarted operations during q2 fy2017 following optimisation of its cost structure. fy2016 ebitda was impacted by an additional one-off charge of us$36 million relating to renewable power obligations, incurred in the previous financial years. he has previously also held senior executive positions in delhi international airport ltd., idea cellular, ballarpur industries limited and pricewaterhousecoopers india. prior to joining vedanta, mr cairae headed the global industrial function for lafarge’ s 150 cement operations in over 45 countries. we are committed to making human resources a transformative, value driver by capitalising the immense and diverse talent pool across our businesses. while we have made progress and achieved our best safety performance to date, it is immensely regrettable that there were seven fatalities during the year. each of the unscheduled board meetings were called to consider and approve specific ad-hoc transactional matters and/or senior management changes. 4) the internal audit function provides an independent assurance in respect of processes, physical verification and management information system accuracy for operating companies. impairment assessment of copper operations in zambia is considered a significant issue considering lower equipment availability, throughput constraints and other operational challenges including production ramp up. t axation additional information on these matters is disclosed in note 38 to the financial statements a comprehensive tax paper outlining taxation disputes in respect of withholding taxes following past acquisitions, eligibility of tax incentives and output taxes and other matters was placed before the committee for its consideration. rgf was also provided with a brief to identify candidates that had relevant uk listed company experience within the extractive industries. i’m deeply saddened that seven people lost their lives while working for or with vedanta during the financial year under review. as a board committee we have to ensure that such events do not shake our confidence in the journey of achieving ‘zero harm’. businesses’ contribution on sustainable development goals (sdgs) is another important dimension which has become a forefront issue of deliberation and action. details of any payments to former directors will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise. 7 all of the group’s pension schemes are based on cash contribution and do not confirm an entitlement to a defined benefit. full retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be seen in next year’s annual remuneration on report. there is significant judgment required by management in assessing the exposure of each tax case and thus a risk that such cases may not be adequately provided for or disclosed. we are satisfied the accounting treatment in respect of potential tax exposures is appropriate based on our procedures performed. of these selected components 14 were subject to a full audit, in india, namibia, zambia, south africa and the uae. the new standard will come into effect for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2019. earlier application is permitted if ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers has also been applied. such items are material by nature or amount to the year’s result and require separate disclosure in accordance with ifrs. (xvi) provisions for liabilities and charges provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation (legal or constructive), as a result of past events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources, that can be reliably estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation. this includes certain non-derivative liabilities that are designated as hedge of the foreign currency risk on future, highly probable, forecast sales. the group has also carried out a sensitivity analysis on key variables like movement in copper prices, discount rate and production. 3 transfer prices for inter segment sales are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. 202 vedanta resources plc | annual report fy2017 19. other non-current assets (us$ million) as
