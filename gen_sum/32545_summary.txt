We have taken a disciplined approach to development, growing our production steadily with an ongoing focus on operational efficiency and cost savings. The top three ideas were awarded after evaluation by an expert committee comprising of business CEOs and senior cross-functional managers. We have also been able to control costs, producing iron ore at a cash cost comparable with some of the world’s largest operations. In addition, enhanced transparency, accountability, an auction-based forward- looking framework and liberalisation of the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy will help unlock India’s economic potential. It has been defined taking into consideration the Group’s risk tolerance level and is clearly linked to its strategic priorities. ❯ Early redemption of 2018 bonds in line with the stated strategy to deleverage at plc level and extend average debt maturity. ❯ Strong management team continues to work towards sustainable low cost of production, operational excellence and securing key raw material linkages. ❯ Business model ❯ Future performance ❯ Liquidity ❯ Reputation ❯ Management team reviewing operations and engaging with all stakeholders in light of operating challenges. However, large or prolonged movements in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s businesses, operating results, financial condition and/or prospects. ❯ Our business leadership teams have periodic engagements with the local communities to build relations based on trust and mutual beneﬁt. of employees covered VAL – Jharsuguda 8 160 IOB – Sesa Goa 4 80 Balco 2 40 Sterlite Copper 2 40 Total 16 320 GEARING UP FOR ZERO HARM Once identified, we mitigate risks through stronger processes, effective training and better safety mechanisms. We not only drive economic growth through taxes, royalties, wages and supplier contracts, but our operations also process natural resources which help provide the products these communities need to further their development. In FY2016, Vedanta signed an MoU with the Ministry of Women & Child Development to construct 4,000 new- age Nand Ghars (Anganwadis) across India. Health: Each cluster of 25-30 Anganwadis will have access to a fully functional Mobile Medical Unit (MMU) which provides essential primary healthcare services. Finally, we have implemented an incentive programme to encourage entrepreneurship by rewarding employees who develop new and innovative technologies for the business. FOCUS AREA: FUTURE LEADERSHIP Vedanta attracts the best talent given its core strengths of high-quality performance, governance and value- based architecture. Furthermore, we are looking at various mutually beneficial outsourcing models where service providers with technology can help improve volumes, recoveries and exploration efforts. We have achieved a cumulative saving of over US$814 million under this programme in last 24 months compared with the FY2015 baseline. Depreciation at KCM decreased by US$66 million as a major portion of Nchanga underground assets were fully depreciated in FY2016 post reaching its mine life. The positives were partly offset by a temporary increase of mined metal inventory at our Zinc India and Iron Ore businesses.

Zinc India, an independent Group subsidiary, declared a special dividend of US$2.1 billion including DDT at its Board meeting in March 2017 . Severe but plausible risks were subsequently quantified both individually and in combination, to apply additional stress testing into the viability model. These constant efforts to optimise costs across the value chain have enabled healthy project economics even at US$40 per barrel. However, EBITDA for FY2017 was higher by 5% at US$597 million, due to cost optimisation initiatives and reduced cess on an ad-valorem basis. Further commissioning of both production and service winders was completed during the year as shaft equipping work continued to progress satisfactorily. Excluding Lisheen, total production was 7% higher than FY2016, primarily due to better performances from the Skorpion and Black Mountain Mines (BMM). The increase was due mainly to volume ramp up and better price realisations, partly offset by higher met coke prices. In December 2016, we completed a project that enables expired materials to be processed through neutralisation and solidification at the Nkana Smelter Complex. We continue to focus on the refinery ramp up and gaining greater cost efficiencies by installing oil-fired boilers for electrolyte heating. These activities included an extensive Making Better Risk Decisions (MBRD) programme where we trained our 200 frontline leaders across the Aluminium businesses including BALCO. The rolled product facility at BALCO, which was temporarily shut down in Q2 FY2016, restarted operations during Q2 FY2017 following optimisation of its cost structure. FY2016 EBITDA was impacted by an additional one-off charge of US$36 million relating to renewable power obligations, incurred in the previous financial years. He has previously also held senior executive positions in Delhi International Airport Ltd., Idea Cellular, Ballarpur Industries Limited and PricewaterhouseCoopers India. We are committed to making Human Resources a transformative, value driver by capitalising the immense and diverse talent pool across our businesses. While we have made progress and achieved our best safety performance to date, it is immensely regrettable that there were seven fatalities during the year. 4) The Internal Audit function provides an independent assurance in respect of processes, physical verification and management information system accuracy for operating companies. Impairment assessment of copper operations in Zambia is considered a significant issue considering lower equipment availability, throughput constraints and other operational challenges including production ramp up. T axation Additional information on these matters is disclosed in Note 38 to the financial statements A comprehensive tax paper outlining taxation disputes in respect of withholding taxes following past acquisitions, eligibility of tax incentives and output taxes and other matters was placed before the Committee for its consideration. RGF was also provided with a brief to identify candidates that had relevant UK listed company experience within the extractive industries. I’m deeply saddened that seven people lost their lives while working for or with Vedanta during the financial year under review. As a Board Committee we have to ensure that such events do not shake our confidence in the journey of achieving ‘Zero Harm’. Businesses’ contribution on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is another important dimension which has become a forefront issue of deliberation and action. Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise. 7 All of the Group’s pension schemes are based on cash contribution and do not confirm an entitlement to a defined benefit. Full retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be seen in next year’s Annual Remuneration on Report. There is significant judgment required by management in assessing the exposure of each tax case and thus a risk that such cases may not be adequately provided for or disclosed. Such items are material by nature or amount to the year’s result and require separate disclosure in accordance with IFRS. (XVI) PROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES AND CHARGES Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive), as a result of past events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources, that can be reliably estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation. This includes certain non-derivative liabilities that are designated as hedge of the foreign currency risk on future, highly probable, forecast sales. The Group has also carried out a sensitivity analysis on key variables like movement in copper prices, discount rate and production. 3 Transfer prices for inter segment sales are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. 208 Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017 (B) NON-CURRENT TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES (US$ million) As at 31 March 2017 As at 31 March 2016 Security deposits and retentions 0.2 15.7 Project creditors 47.1 46.0 Others 21.2 3.7 Financial (A) 68.5 65.4 Advance from customers1 – 150.5 Others – 7.6 Non- Financial (B) – 158.1 Total (A+B) 68.5 223.5 1 Advance from customers include amounts received under long term supply agreements.

Hedging is used primarily as a risk management tool to secure future cash flows in cases of high volatility by entering into forward contracts or similar instruments.
