The Company and its directors accept no liability to third parties in respect of this document save as would arise under English law. By design, it will be one which is much better than if we had simply waited at the bus-stop of opportunity for something serendipitous – or not – to come along. So while the rates of decline may be a little slower than in electronics markets, they are nevertheless there. We have not changed or deviated from this mission one bit since I became the Chairman of Smiths, though I’m proud to say that under the dynamic leadership of our Chief Executive Andy Reynolds Smith and his team, we are now executing against this mission much faster. Following Chris O’Shea stepping down from his role as Chief Financial Officer in May, we were pleased that my Board colleague and Audit Committee Chairman Bill Seeger agreed to step into the Chief Financial Officer role on an interim basis while we seek a permanent replacement. For example, there’s no reason to believe that border crossing and airport security challenges will become easier in the future than they are today. Energy needs, petrochemical-sourced feedstocks and electronics-oriented products will continue to be huge features of our daily life, in fact, ever more so. There is no question that electric vehicles, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence, robotics, advanced materials and nanotechnologies will all have their increasing place in this new world. ANDY REYNOLDS SMITH CHIEF EXECUTIVE Technology is moving faster than ever before and we‘re committed to being at the cutting edge. Our Group-wide innovation framework, i 3 , will consistently drive increased, smarter investment in R&D and convert it into sales more quickly. John Crane continued its expansion into non-oil and gas industries, which now represent c. 45% of total revenue, with sales up 2%, on an underlying 1 basis. Headline operating profit was down 4% on an underlying 1 basis, as lower sales and strategic investments in OE projects were only partially offset by operational efficiencies. Headline operating profit margin increased by 110 basis points to 23.0% benefiting from the disposal of Artificial Lift and continued operational efficiencies. Global demand for chemical warfare agent detection equipment and other threat-specific sensors required by the military is forecast to grow steadily in our key NATO-oriented markets. Consumers demand improved accuracy, efficiency and cost- effectiveness in healthcare services, meaning aligning our technologies with the cost-control mindset of this market is a key consideration. Performance During the year Smiths Interconnect completed significant strategic and structural change to focus on fewer, higher-growth end markets. During the year Smiths Interconnect’s engineering function was realigned with our strategic market segments of defence, aerospace, space, rail, medical and semiconductor test, with significant emphasis on driving improved time to market for new product development and an increased focus on developing product platforms over bespoke solutions. SUPPLIERS We source key materials from world-class companies selected to provide the quality, service and value needed for mission-critical components. GROWTH DRIVERS • Steady growth of the US housing construction market • Continued increase in large commercial aircraft production • Growth of medical devices and their increased use of flexible tubing • Growing presence in Europe and Asia with further expansion potential COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS • A strong performance in residential gas tubing • High-performance flexible tubing products for aerospace • Leading capability in the design and manufacture of heating solutions for bespoke applications • Strong customer relationships STATUTORY OPERATING PROFIT £68M HEADLINE OPERATING MARGIN 1 9.3% Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2017 50 F LE X - TE K C O N T I N U E D DID YOU KNOW...

With improved electrical efficiency, a wider range of watt densities, and symmetrical design to ensure versatility, our Tutco business line is driving innovation in the duct heater market. Fluid Management revenue was down 2% on an underlying 1 basis, primarily due to order timing issues associated with a specific customer. The four-year Fuel for Growth programme has now concluded, with total spend of £185m and cumulative benefits to date totalling £70m. The Group additionally collected £224m on behalf of tax authorities, primarily from employees but also other indirect taxes such as VAT (2016: £210m). The Group aims to ensure that these resources are placed on deposit with highly-rated relationship bank counterparties at short-notice availability. In establishing this provision no account has been taken of any recoveries from insurers as their nature and timing are subject to pending litigation. Our divisions also conduct an annual assessment of strategic risk with formal presentations to the Audit Committee each year. The ERM process Running any business involves constant risk management – it is an integral and often implicit part of day-to-day operations. Our information assets and the systems we depend on are exposed to risks that could result in theft, corruption or breach of confidentiality. With around 22,000 people working in more than 50 countries, it is important that we maintain the highest standards of corporate responsibility. By installing more energy- efficient equipment, implementing water reuse programmes and focusing on green energy contracts, we have made good progress against these objectives. Safety Leading Indicator Activities assess initiatives undertaken by sites to improve performance and are established as a company KPI. Specific diversity-focused questions were added to the engagement survey, and an online training course addressing unconscious bias was piloted across several business functions. This innovation helped slash methane emissions from centrifugal compressor shaft seals by a factor of 10 – helping natural gas processing and transmission companies reduce their carbon footprint across the world. P R OD U C T S By developing leading-edge, mission-critical solutions, we help to drive safety, security, health, productivity, reliability, connectivity and progress around the world, every day.

At BP she held a number of executive positions, including Group Vice President in the US, UK, Belgium, and Colombia. I was also delighted that Mark Seligman agreed to take on a key non-executive role as Audit Committee Chair. A copy of the Code published in 2016, and applying to financial years beginning on or after 17 June 2016, can be found at www.frc.org.uk. This is underpinned by a strong framework of good governance, including the Board’s responsibility for setting risk appetite. This will include meeting senior individuals in the business, receiving copies of previous Board papers, and visits to operational sites. Using online questionnaires, Lintstock produced an anonymised report which was presented to the Board for discussion at its meeting in November 2016. It also leads the process for their removal or retirement (giving full consideration to succession planning and leadership needs). This commitment extends to appointments at all levels in Smiths, as evidenced by the appointment of a senior leader with responsibility for culture and diversity. Succession planning increases the availability and development opportunities for our talent pipeline, which is prepared to assume these roles as they become available. Andy Reynolds Smith and Chris O’Shea did not participate in this LTIP cycle as it pre-dates their appointment. Salary increases for the executive directors will normally be in line with those awarded to Smiths wider employee population. The balance is deferred into shares and released after a further period of three years, subject to continued employment only. 50% of any net vested share awards (after sales to meet tax liabilities) must be retained until the minimum shareholding requirements are met. Please note, however, that actual pay delivered will further be influenced by factors such as share price appreciation or depreciation and the value of dividends paid. Buyout awards As disclosed in last year’s Annual Report on Remuneration, Andy Reynolds Smith and Chris O’Shea were made certain buyout awards to replicate the structure and fair value of incentives forfeited by each director as a consequence of their joining Smiths Group. This facility has certain financial covenants however these are not expected to prevent utilisation at the Group’s discretion if required. In John Crane, Inc. we used our own internal experts to challenge management’s assumptions underlying the adverse judgment and defence cost provisions. A detailed review is completed for inventory lines identified in the initial assessment considering sales activity, order flow, customer contracts and current selling prices. Claims history from other defendants is not used to calculate the provision because JCI’s defence strategy generates a significantly different pattern of legal costs and settlement expenses. It has also had to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties, including product liability and insurance subrogation claims. For products which are technically innovative, highly customised or require complex installation, revenue is recognised when the customer has completed its acceptance procedures. Available for sale financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses being recognised in other comprehensive income. ‘IFRS 13: Fair value measurement’ requires fair value measurements to be classified according to the following hierarchy: • level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; • level 2 – valuations in which all inputs are observable either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices); and • level 3 – valuations in which one or more inputs that are significant to the resulting value are not based on observable market data. The scheme has investments in diversified growth funds and a portfolio of exchange traded equity index futures managed by BlackRock.

It has also had to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties, including product liability and insurance subrogation claims. Developments in the Garlock Sealing Technologies LLC Chapter 11 proceedings have provided additional data on plaintiff claims to 524 (g) trusts.
