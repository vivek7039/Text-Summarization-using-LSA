the company and its directors accept no liability to third parties in respect of this document save as would arise under english law. by design, it will be one which is much better than if we had simply waited at the bus-stop of opportunity for something serendipitous – or not – to come along. so clearly, there is no way to succeed in the competitive game by simply standing still. so while the rates of decline may be a little slower than in electronics markets, they are nevertheless there. in broad brush strokes, this is the kind of company and ‘new future’ we are determined to build. we have not changed or deviated from this mission one bit since i became the chairman of smiths, though i’m proud to say that under the dynamic leadership of our chief executive andy reynolds smith and his team, we are now executing against this mission much faster. higher sales growth, margin expansion, improved working capital turns, lower taxation rates and an improving p/e multiple. if margins go too high, customers complain and even greater competition is enticed into your market. following chris o’shea stepping down from his role as chief financial officer in may, we were pleased that my board colleague and audit committee chairman bill seeger agreed to step into the chief financial officer role on an interim basis while we seek a permanent replacement. the wonderful thing we can observe about growth and innovation is that it’s an ‘everybody wins’ strategy. for example, there’s no reason to believe that border crossing and airport security challenges will become easier in the future than they are today. energy needs, petrochemical-sourced feedstocks and electronics-oriented products will continue to be huge features of our daily life, in fact, ever more so. the wonderful thing about grow th and innovation is that it’s an ‘e verybody wins’ str ategy. there is no question that electric vehicles, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence, robotics, advanced materials and nanotechnologies will all have their increasing place in this new world. those will have tremendous effects on virtually every product we make over the next 10 years. the solution to all creative problems requires a blend of optimism, curiosity, imagination and relentless execution. we’ve also made improvements in our use of working capital, with a £85m reduction this past year. andy reynolds smith chief executive technology is moving faster than ever before and we‘re committed to being at the cutting edge. our group-wide innovation framework, i 3 , will consistently drive increased, smarter investment in r&d and convert it into sales more quickly. this is not just about planning for the future – we are already generating meaningful revenue from digital. headline operating margin

opening new service centres in selected higher-growth markets. john crane continued its expansion into non-oil and gas industries, which now represent c. 45% of total revenue, with sales up 2%, on an underlying 1 basis. this was offset by reduced oil and gas underlying 1 sales, down 7% reflecting the challenging market conditions. these market conditions also impacted total original equipment (oe) underlying 1 sales that fell 11% during the year. headline operating profit was down 4% on an underlying 1 basis, as lower sales and strategic investments in oe projects were only partially offset by operational efficiencies. headline operating profit margin increased by 110 basis points to 23.0% benefiting from the disposal of artificial lift and continued operational efficiencies. this decrease was driven by a one-off regulatory situation in china which has now been resolved. prior to the sale, wallace revenue was £5m, with operating profit of £4m and net assets sold were £32m. global demand for chemical warfare agent detection equipment and other threat-specific sensors required by the military is forecast to grow steadily in our key nato-oriented markets. highly targeted investment in products and software development should enable us to outperform our chosen markets. revenue from ports and borders decreased by 2% on an underlying 1 basis as growth in emea, including major deliveries in africa, italy and the middle east, was offset by last year’s strong comparator due to the completion of a number of key programmes. revenue from higher-growth regions represented 21% of sales, broadly in line with prior year on an underlying 1 basis. global defence spending has been constrained in recent years, as governments maintained tight budget control. consumers demand improved

fuel for growth programme has now concluded, with total spend of £185m and cumulative benefits to date totalling £70m. the group additionally collected £224m on behalf of tax authorities, primarily from employees but also other indirect taxes such as vat (2016: £210m). centrally directed cash management systems exist globally to manage overall liquid resources efficiently across the divisions. in establishing this provision no account has been taken of any recoveries from insurers as their nature and timing are subject to pending litigation. our divisions also conduct an annual assessment of strategic risk with formal presentations to the audit committee each year. the erm process running any business involves constant risk management – it is an integral and often implicit part of

activity such as collusion with competitors. our information assets and the systems we depend on are exposed to risks that could result in theft, corruption or breach of confidentiality. this includes ensuring the code is upheld, implementing supporting policies, setting targets and reviewing performance across key areas. at smiths, being a responsible business is firmly embedded in the ways we think and operate. with around 22,000 people working in more than 50 countries, it is important that we maintain the highest standards of corporate responsibility. it supports our ambition to establish smiths as one of the world’s leading technology companies. they are supported by the hse technical committee who track performance, and identify areas for improvement. they drive continuous improvement and provide the externally verified framework behind a consistent, best-practice approach to hse management. we use external auditors to check compliance at sites, often as part of their management system certification. audit findings drive corrective action plans and are shared with other sites to promote best practice. by installing more energy- efficient equipment, implementing water reuse programmes and focusing on green energy contracts, we have made good progress against these objectives. safety leading indicator activities assess initiatives undertaken by sites to improve performance and are established as a company kpi. fy2018 priorities • continue to improve our safety performance and draw ever closer to our target of zero injuries • develop a new set of

sectors to the board, as well as his expertise and depth of knowledge of government. in may 2017 chris o’shea stepped down as chief financial officer to pursue his career outside the group. i was also delighted that mark seligman agreed to take on a key non-executive role as audit committee chair. as further detailed in its report, the nomination committee continues to keep board composition and succession plans under regular review, but with an eye to maintaining a good measure of stability and continuity during a time of significant change for the group. a copy of the code published in 2016, and applying to financial years beginning on or after 17 june 2016, can be found at www.frc.org.uk. this is underpinned by a strong framework of good governance, including the board’s responsibility for setting risk appetite. this will include meeting senior individuals in the business, receiving copies of previous board papers, and visits to operational sites. some of the key areas identified and actions taken or underway are set out below. the committee holds one scheduled meeting each year when it conducts its annual review of senior management talent and succession plans with a view to ensuring a strong and robust plan exists in all parts of the group. it also leads the process for their removal or retirement (giving full consideration to succession planning and leadership needs). mark is well placed to do this with his finance background and previous experience of chairing audit committees. this commitment extends to appointments at all levels in smiths, as evidenced by the appointment of a senior leader with responsibility for culture and diversity. succession planning increases the availability and development opportunities for our talent pipeline, which is prepared to assume these roles as they become available. as set out on page 87, the independence of sir kevin tebbit is kept under frequent review. the committee held a dedicated meeting in may to discuss and review those risks identified by management. in addition, uncertainty around brexit remains and the board as a whole will keep this area under review. in addition, during 2018 an independent third party review of the function’s effectiveness will be undertaken. it is intended that there will be a poll vote on each resolution at the 2017 agm. any awards vesting to chris o’shea before 18 november 2017 are unaffected by his stepping down from the board. on behalf of the board, i would like to thank shareholders for their continued support. salary increases for the executive directors will normally be in line with those awarded to smiths wider employee population. not applicable pension enables executive directors to save for their retirement in a cost-efficient manner. the balance is deferred into shares and released after a further period of three years, subject to continued employment only. for awards made in 2016 onwards, vested shares may also be subject to a post vesting holding period. these include, but are not limited to, relocation allowances, as well as any other future benefits made available either to all employees globally or all employees in the region in which the executive director is employed. all uk employees (including executive directors) may save up to a maximum monthly savings limit (as determined by uk legislation, or other such lower limit as the committee may determine at its discretion) for three or five years. not applicable shareholding guidelines encourages ownership of shares in the company and alignment with shareholder interests. 50% of any net vested share awards (after sales to meet tax liabilities) must be retained until the minimum shareholding requirements are met. please note, however, that actual pay delivered will further be influenced by factors such as share price appreciation or depreciation and the value of dividends paid. other the committee may make an award in recognition of incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer. existing service contracts or other applicable agreements are available for viewing at the company’s registered office. he ceased to be an

director has taken all the steps he or she should have taken as a director in order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company’s auditors are aware of that information. key audit matter how our audit addressed the key audit matter revenue recognition (occurrence), together with accounting for complex programmes and contract accounting in the smiths detection and smiths interconnect divisions (group) refer also to accounting policies we focused on revenue recognition for all divisions in the group to check that revenue has been appropriately recognised upon fulfilment of obligations. this can include cost overruns which require further negotiation and settlements resulting in the need for provisions. in john crane, inc. we used our own internal experts to challenge management’s assumptions underlying the adverse judgment and defence cost provisions. the expectation that the benefit of these assets will be realised is dependent on a number of factors, including appropriate taxable temporary timing differences, and whether there will be sufficient taxable profits in future periods to support recognition. smiths

financial reporting standards (ifrs) and international financial reporting interpretations committee (ifrs ic) interpretations, as adopted by the european union, on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention modified to include revaluation of certain financial instruments, share options and pension assets and liabilities, held at fair value as described below. contract profitability smiths detection has multi-year contractual arrangements for the sale of goods and services. margins achieved on these contracts can reflect the impact of commercial decisions made in different economic circumstances. it has been concluded that there are sufficient taxable profits in future periods to support recognition. a 5% reduction in expected future operating profits would reduce the level of deferred tax recognised by £8m (2016: £9m), and a 5% increase in expected future operating profits would increase the level of deferred tax recognised by £11m (2016: £11m). a detailed review is completed for inventory lines identified in the initial assessment considering sales activity, order flow, customer contracts and current selling prices. claims history from other defendants is not used to calculate the provision because jci’s defence strategy generates a significantly different pattern of legal costs and settlement expenses. it has also had to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties, including product liability and insurance subrogation claims. for products which are technically innovative, highly customised or require complex installation, revenue is recognised when the customer has completed its acceptance procedures. financial assets are initially recognised at transaction price when the group becomes party to contractual obligations. available for sale financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses being recognised in other comprehensive income. ‘ifrs 13: fair value measurement’ requires fair value measurements to be classified according to the following hierarchy: • level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; • level 2 – valuations in which all inputs are observable either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices); and • level 3 – valuations in which one or more inputs that are significant to the resulting value are not based on observable market data. the impacts of business combination fair value adjustments, including amortisation of intangible assets, impairment or unwinding, have been excluded from headline measures on the basis that these charges result from acquisition accounting and do not relate to current trading activity. smiths group plc annual report 2017 154 n o te s t o

management the key management of the group comprises smiths group plc board directors and executive committee members. for all schemes, pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries. however smiths has adopted a common approach of closing defined benefit schemes to cap members’ entitlements and supporting trustees in adopting investment strategies which match assets to future obligations, after allowing for the funding position of the scheme. ti group pension scheme (“tigps”) tigps with a mature member profile, and a strong funding position, has been able to progress its matching strategy to the point where roughly 50% of liabilities are covered by matching annuities, eliminating investment return, longevity, inflation and funding risks. the scheme has investments in diversified growth funds and a portfolio of exchange traded equity index futures managed by blackrock. as at 31 july 2017 the sips portfolio of exchange traded equity index futures generated a £73m (2016: £163m) exposure to equities. asset valuation liquidity funds, equities and bonds are valued using quoted market prices in active

including product liability and insurance subrogation claims. any claim brought against the group (with or without merit), could be costly to defend. the group also co-operates with relevant authorities in investigating business conduct issues whenever requested to. the group is not aware of any issues which are expected to generate material financial exposures. the jci products generally referred to in these cases consist of industrial sealing product, primarily packing and gaskets. established incidence curves can be used to estimate the likely future pattern of asbestos related disease. however, jci’s claims experience is also significantly impacted by other factors which influence the us litigation environment. developments in the garlock sealing technologies llc chapter 11 proceedings have provided additional data on plaintiff claims to 524 (g) trusts. jcis defence strategy also generates a significantly different pattern of legal costs and settlement expenses from other defendants, so jci is in an extremely rare position, and evidence from other litigation cannot be used to improve the reliability of the projections. smiths group plc annual report 2017 182 n o
