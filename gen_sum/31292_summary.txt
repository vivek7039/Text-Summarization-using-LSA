Where the Company has control over an entity, it is classified as a subsidiary. It is stated after deduction of certain bonuses, jackpots and prizes granted to players. Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Group has not classified any of its financial assets as held to maturity. Available-for-sale investments Non-derivative financial assets not included in the above categories are classified as available-for-sale and comprise principally the Group’s strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities. Bank overdrafts are shown within trade and other payables in current liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position. Following their classification as held for sale, non-current assets (including those in a disposal group) are not depreciated. Deferred consideration arising from business combinations is recognised at present value and unwound over the period until settlement. Based on management’s review to date, IFRS 9 is not expected to have any financial impact on the financial statements other than the classification of investments currently classified as available for sale investments. Deferred tax assets will be recognised when the Group has established a track record of expected future taxable profit.

The Group’s potentially dilutive securities consist of share options, performance shares and a convertible bond. Value in use is calculated as the net present value of future cash flows derived from those assets and is based on several assumptions which feed into a forecast model based on past player lifetime values and experience. These CGUs have been considered for impairment and sensitivities have been calculated around the terminal growth rates and discount factors used together with specific scenarios including the loss of revenue where those revenues might be considered to be at risk. The convertible loan has a duration of 5 years and carries interest at 3-month LIBOR plus 5.5%. The fair value as at 31 December 2017 was £0.6m based on a probability assessment of conversion and future share price. Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition or in certain circumstances on modification. Financial assets of the Group classified as loans and receivables or available for sale. A 20% weakening in the exchange rate would, on same basis increase loss after tax and decrease net assets by £116,367.
