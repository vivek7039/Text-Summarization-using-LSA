we shall be building on our recent investment in echo-scan, a network of radiology and diagnostic laboratories that has provided us with an attractive entry point into the country. with its fragmented and largely unestablished healthcare services market, we see huge potential for fu- ture growth to match our successful track record in egypt. understanding that protracted high inflation in egypt has had the most significant impact on our patients who pay for their own healthcare, we have developed our market- ing programs to target them with a strong health aware- ness message in combination with a compelling value component. we are well posi- tioned with our strong brands and geographic position- ing to capitalise on the structural drivers that support future growth in medical diagnostic services including idh annual report 2017 14 large, rapidly-growing populations; a high prevalence of lifestyle-related medical conditions; and a growing health consciousness in our emerging markets. i am honoured to have you with us on this journey as a rapidly-growing consumer healthcare company across the middle east and africa. • there is a rising prevalence of diseases commanding high test volumes, indicating an expanding need gap compared with more developed markets. this has been achieved by: • idh’s accreditations, which underscore the high- quality and safety of its testing capabilities, are key to attracting patients. idh annual report 2017 16 on our way to realising our full po- tential as a leading consumer health- care company in the middle east and africa, we are pleased to have added nigeria, africa’s largest and most populous country, to our geographic footprint in early 2018 idh annual report 2017 17 jordan strategic report jordan has one of the most modern health care infrastructures in the mid- dle east. whilst biolab’s 18 central labs perform many of the +1,000 pathology tests offered, four that are considered spe- cialty labs perform particular types of tests including, but not limited to, haematology, endocrinology, immu- nochemistry, parasitology, oncology, transfusion medicine, molecular genet- ics and antenatal diagnostics and gene sequencing. furthermore, biolab does not share purchasing, supply and lo- gistics, it, marketing or sales functions with its egyptian parent company. this 4,000-square- metre facility will connect more than 40 hospitals and diagnostic centres that are part of the evex network. notably, consensus expectations are for further economic improvement in egypt, idh’s largest market, in 2018. idh’s hub, spoke and spike business model provides the group with an ef- ficient low-capital intensive platform for organic expansion over a wide geo- graphic area. in paral- lel, the company’s asset-light business model notably translates into minimal borrowings while allowing for signifi- cant strategic flexibility. it is noteworthy that management has been able to negoti- ate an agreement with its main suppliers not to increase prices during 2018. idh annual report 2017 27 strategic report our business model idh operates an easily scalable busi- ness model, allowing for expansion in a capital-efficient manner and geared toward operational efficiency. b-labs (spokes) are capable of process- ing routine tests, and they effectively reduce traffic to the mega lab where warranted. across its brand portfolio, idh maintains international-quality accredi- tations with a stringent internal audit process to ensure best-in-class service. the company’s iso 9001:2008 accredita- tions for both al mokhtabar and al borg passed year end accreditation reviews in 2017 and will next be renewed in 2018. college of american pathologists (cap) unlike iso accreditation, cap certification is awarded to individual labs, rather than the group’s operations as a whole. the group’s mega lab, inaugurated in 2015, replaced two smaller, independent “a-labs” one of which was also cap certified. employee training the group views education as an essential means of ensur- ing quality across its laboratories. in 2017, the training centre employed one director, eight full-time specialists, three ad- ministrators, two consultants and seven part-time instruc- tors. idh annual report 2017 31 strategic report growth strategy idh’s growth strategy rests on leveraging its established business model to achieve four key strategic goals, namely: (1) continue to expand customer reach; (2) increase tests per patient by expanding the group’s services portfolio; (3) expand into new geographic markets through selec- tive, value-accretive acquisitions; and (4) introduce new medical services by leveraging the group’s network and reputable brand position. nigeria is facing security challenges on several fronts, in- cluding re-emerging ethnic tensions and resurgent attacks by islamist militants in the northeast. idh has strong, longstanding relationships with its suppli- ers, to whom it is a significant regional client. as a provider of medical diagnostic services, idh’ s operations in sudan are not subject to sanctions. the group’s quality assurance (qa) function ensures com- pliance with best practices across all medical diagnostic functions. all changes to pricing and contracts are ar- rived at through discussion rather than blanket imposition by idh. similarly, business interruption at one of the group’s larger laboratory facilities could result in significant losses and reputational damage to the group’s business as a result of external factors such as natural disasters, fire, riots or extended power failures. on a 29% year-on-year revenue increase in 2017, ebitda gained 18%, constrained somewhat by ongoing pressure from higher raw material costs. within the contract segment, idh also provides lab-to-lab services for hospitals and other laboratories not able to process certain tests in house. idh signed 311 new corporate contracts with insurers last year versus 456 in 2016. revenues from walk-in clients also rose 29% year-on-year, helped by improving patient volumes. nevertheless, we have endeavoured to ensure that this an- nual report is, as a whole, fair, balanced and understandable. hussein choucri chairman, remuneration committee 20 march 2018 hussein choucri chairman, remuneration committee corporate governance idh annual report 2017 62 figures in egp base

investment arm of the mansour group, called dynasty holding group (“dynasty”), which is 51% owned and controlled by idh. for the residual 2 components, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no signifi- cant risks of material misstatement within these. if not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. after initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method (“eir”), less impairment. these calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year. goodwill is tested for impairment annually as at 31 october and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. prior impairments of non-financial assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date. idh annual re por t 2017 88 additionally, the testing and assessment of controls over new it systems has not been complete. as a provider of medical diagnostic services, idh’s operations in sudan are not subject to sanctions. the projected cash flows from 2018- 2022 have been based on detailed forecasts prepared by management for each cgu and a terminal value thereafter. in addition, a large number of minor receivables are grouped into homogenous groups and assessed for impairment collectively. investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty. such forecasting takes into consideration the group’s compliance with internal financial position ratio targets and, if ap- plicable external regulatory or legal requirements – for example, currency restrictions. ** international fertility (ivf) is a company whose
