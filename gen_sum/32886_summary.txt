IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 6 Egypt Jordan Sudan Nigeria our Brands In Egypt, IDH’s largest market, the Group’s core brands include Al Borg and Al Mokhtabar, each of which is well-known and enjoys a loyal fol- lowing. We shall be building on our recent investment in Echo-Scan, a network of radiology and diagnostic laboratories that has provided us with an attractive entry point into the country. With its fragmented and largely unestablished healthcare services market, we see huge potential for fu- ture growth to match our successful track record in Egypt. We are proud to be investing in Nigeria alongside Man Capital LLC and the IFC. Lord St John of Bletso Chairman 20 March 2018 IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 11 Strategic Report A Note from Our CEO Fellow shareholders, In 2017, IDH again delivered superior operational and financial performance despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges in Egypt, our largest market. Understanding that protracted high inflation in Egypt has had the most significant impact on our patients who pay for their own healthcare, we have developed our market- ing programs to target them with a strong health aware- ness message in combination with a compelling value component. I am especially pleased that we will be joining forces with Man Capital, an organisation that matches our more than four decades of operating experience in the industry with similarly long experience working on the ground in West Africa. We are well posi- tioned with our strong brands and geographic position- ing to capitalise on the structural drivers that support future growth in medical diagnostic services including IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 14 large, rapidly-growing populations; a high prevalence of lifestyle-related medical conditions; and a growing health consciousness in our emerging markets. I am honoured to have you with us on this journey as a rapidly-growing consumer healthcare company across the Middle East and Africa. • There is a rising prevalence of diseases commanding high test volumes, indicating an expanding need gap compared with more developed markets. This has been achieved by: • IDH’s accreditations, which underscore the high- quality and safety of its testing capabilities, are key to attracting patients. The Mega Lab, inaugurated in 2015, replaced two smaller, independent “ A labs” that were also CAP certified. IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 16 On our way to realising our full po- tential as a leading consumer health- care company in the Middle East and Africa, we are pleased to have added Nigeria, Africa’s largest and most populous country, to our geographic footprint in early 2018 IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 17 Jordan Strategic Report Jordan has one of the most modern health care infrastructures in the Mid- dle East. Whilst Biolab’s 18 central labs perform many of the +1,000 pathology tests offered, four that are considered spe- cialty labs perform particular types of tests including, but not limited to, haematology, endocrinology, immu- nochemistry, parasitology, oncology, transfusion medicine, molecular genet- ics and antenatal diagnostics and gene sequencing. Furthermore, Biolab does not share purchasing, supply and lo- gistics, IT, marketing or sales functions with its Egyptian parent company. This 4,000-square- metre facility will connect more than 40 hospitals and diagnostic centres that are part of the EVEX network. IDH’s Hub, Spoke and Spike business model provides the Group with an ef- ficient low-capital intensive platform for organic expansion over a wide geo- graphic area. Brand Equity and Reputation Patients are loyal to leading brands with a strong track record. In paral- lel, the Company’s asset-light business model notably translates into minimal borrowings while allowing for signifi- cant strategic flexibility. B-labs (Spokes) are capable of process- ing routine tests, and they effectively reduce traffic to the Mega Lab where warranted. Across its brand portfolio, IDH maintains international-quality accredi- tations with a stringent internal audit process to ensure best-in-class service. The Group’s Mega Lab, inaugurated in 2015, replaced two smaller, independent “A-labs” one of which was also CAP certified. Employee training The Group views education as an essential means of ensur- ing quality across its laboratories. In 2017, the training centre employed one director, eight full-time specialists, three ad- ministrators, two consultants and seven part-time instruc- tors. IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 31 Strategic Report Growth Strategy IDH’s growth strategy rests on leveraging its established business model to achieve four key strategic goals, namely: (1) continue to expand customer reach; (2) increase tests per patient by expanding the Group’s services portfolio; (3) expand into new geographic markets through selec- tive, value-accretive acquisitions; and (4) introduce new medical services by leveraging the Group’s network and reputable brand position. Nigeria is facing security challenges on several fronts, in- cluding re-emerging ethnic tensions and resurgent attacks by Islamist militants in the northeast. IDH will capitalise on its regional agreements with suppli- ers to procure kits at competitive prices. Banking regulation risk: A priority list and allocation mechanism imposed by the CBE was in effect through- out 2016 to prioritise essential imports. IDH has strong, longstanding relationships with its suppli- ers, to whom it is a significant regional client. IDH management has agreed with its main suppliers that no price increases will be imposed during 2018. As a provider of medical diagnostic services, IDH’ s operations in Sudan are not subject to sanctions. The Group’s quality assurance (QA) function ensures com- pliance with best practices across all medical diagnostic functions. All laboratory staff participate in ongoing pro- fessional education with quality assurance emphasised at each juncture. All changes to pricing and contracts are ar- rived at through discussion rather than blanket imposition by IDH. IDH carries out an annual impairment test on goodwill and other intangible assets in line with IAS 36. Similarly, business interruption at one of the Group’s larger laboratory facilities could result in significant losses and reputational damage to the Group’s business as a result of external factors such as natural disasters, fire, riots or extended power failures. On a 29% year-on-year revenue increase in 2017, EBITDA gained 18%, constrained somewhat by ongoing pressure from higher raw material costs. Within the contract segment, IDH also provides lab-to-lab services for hospitals and other laboratories not able to process certain tests in house. We consider EBITDA to be an appropriate alter- native performance measure, as it is a metric commonly followed by the institutional investment community. Corporate Governance IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 54 Details of our Directors’ attendance at Board and Com- mittee meetings are shown in the table on page 57. I review Board minutes in my capacity as Chairman before these minutes are circulated to all Directors in attendance and then tabled for approval at the next meeting, at which time any necessary amend- ments are made. The Group’s second Annual General Meeting as a listed com- pany will be held in London on 14 May 2018. Nevertheless, we have endeavoured to ensure that this An- nual Report is, as a whole, fair, balanced and understandable. External Auditor KPMG has acted as the Group’s external auditor since ap- pointment in July 2015, with Mr. Adrian Wilcox serving as audit partner until August 2017, when the role was as- sumed by Mr. David Neale on behalf of KPMG. A detailed discussion of the basis on which the aforemen- tioned (as well as one key member of senior management) were remunerated for their service in 2017 appears below and is summarised in tabular form on page 63.

It is the Group’s policy that payments to suppliers are made in accordance with all relevant terms and conditions. post-Balance Sheet Events In a transaction that closed in January 2018, IDH formed a joint venture with Man Capital LLC (“Man Capital”), the London-based investment arm of the Mansour Group, called Dynasty Holding Group (“Dynasty”), which is 51% owned and controlled by IDH. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For the residual 2 components, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no signifi- cant risks of material misstatement within these. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method (“EIR”), less impairment. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. A long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as at 31 October and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Prior impairments of non-financial assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date. For patients served under contract, rates are agreed in advance on a per-test, client-by-client basis.

The projected cash flows from 2018- 2022 have been based on detailed forecasts prepared by management for each CGU and a terminal value thereafter. Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss. In addition, a large number of minor receivables are grouped into homogenous groups and assessed for impairment collectively. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty. Such forecasting takes into consideration the group’s compliance with internal financial position ratio targets and, if ap- plicable external regulatory or legal requirements – for example, currency restrictions.
