believe the industry will regain some of that lost trust and be viewed in a more positive light. our digital operations are based out of, but not licensed in, gibraltar (we hold both uk and alderney

rank’s analysis of historic player behaviour amongst digital customers, improving our ability to recognise risk and to know when a responsible gambling intervention may be helpful. one such initiative to which rank remains firmly committed is the ongoing development and improvement of multi-operator self-exclusion schemes. the ability for anyone recognising they have a problem to prevent their own access to gambling in the most effective way, so they may focus on their recovery and not be at risk of temptation, is incredibly important. teamwork – we pull together across brands, channels and locations to perform at our very best. in addition, employees are asked questions on different aspects of their working life at rank. employees have also given up their own time to volunteer at local carers’ services across the uk. 2 well-to-tank emissions for fuels (electricity, gas, petrol, diesel and aviation fuel), which would sit within scope 3, are not included in the report. 3 this is

centres. alan morgan managing director – mecca strategic report 34 | the rank group plc | annual report and financial statements 2017 operating review | uk digital rank’s uk digital business continued to grow strongly, with revenue 1 up 15% and operating profit 2 up 63% in the year. operating profit 2 grew strongly in the year, up 63%, due to higher revenue and good cost control as a result of combining both digital businesses. benefits from these actions will continue into 2017/18 as a number of savings were delivered during the second half. rank works hard to ensure that it actively provides and promotes an environment in which customers can play safely, supported by its long-running ‘keep it fun’ brand which gives customers clear advice and guidance. increasing macroeconomic conditions directly impact customers’ propensity to spend, which could have an adverse effect on revenues. european political uncertainties are fuelling exchange rate weakness which impacts directly on some business costs, reducing profitability. the vip population is closely managed to ensure that strong long-term relationships are developed through dedicated customer handling and specialised incentive schemes. ensuring that serious disruptive events such as fire, flood, pandemic or security incident can be managed to restore operations swiftly and smoothly is of critical importance. plans for the recovery of critical it services are likewise in place and reviewed on an ongoing basis. the robust protection of this data is critical to ensuring that rank acts responsibly in protecting these stakeholders from risk as well as complying with relevant data protection regulation, including the forthcoming eu general data protection regulations due to come into force in may 2018. in order to deliver commercial improvements and new customer experiences there is an ongoing programme of it changes, additions and improvements. additionally, potential consequences of a breach could include compensation payments to those affected, or significant fines. the broader impact of rank’s operations, including taxes paid by supplier companies, is harder to quantify but no less significant. this was driven by commercial factors which include improved customer service by being able to offer dealer-operated tables 24 hours a day, consistency of play for customers, more optimal use of licenced gaming space across the casino estate and labour-saving costs through one dealer being able to cover more than one casino. tax fact file continued strategic report 46 | the rank group

inadvertent breaches of legislation, as well as reviewing the group’s corporate risk register. the viability statement can be found on page 41. internal control framework our system of internal

gambling service provider must be actively involved and investing in developing our collective understanding of gambling-related harm. these outcomes were lower than last year reflecting underperformance against the group profit after tax target. i and my fellow committee members will be present at the annual general meeting to answer any questions that shareholders might have. committee’s approach to setting pay policy the committee intends that the base salary and total remuneration of executive directors should be competitive against other similar gaming peers and companies of a broadly similar size. remuneration is benchmarked against rewards available for equivalent roles in suitable comparator companies, with the aim of paying neither significantly above nor below market levels for each element of remuneration at target performance levels. ordinarily any increases in executive directors’ base salaries will be limited to those received by the wider workforce during the year (except for reasons of promotion or salary being determined to be significantly out of line with market median). if provided, the committee aims to ensure payments are not excessive and support business needs. however, the resulting pay-out, as a percentage of salary, will vary year-on-year in line with bonus pool funding. ordinarily any increases in executive

from financial budgets, discounted by selecting an appropriate rate for each cash- generating unit. both estimates are dependent on limited publicly available information and judgement regarding the future success of a relatively new start-up business. the group’s current operating lease commitments on an undiscounted basis under ias 17 are disclosed in note 29. ifrs 9 ‘financial instruments’ and ifrs 15 ‘revenue from contracts with customers’ will be effective for our next financial reporting period. revenue for digital products, including interactive games, represents gaming win before deduction of gaming-related duties. bank overdrafts are shown within loans and borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet. depreciation is calculated on assets using the straight-line method to allocate their cost less residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows: ◊ freehold and leasehold property 50 years or lease term if less ◊ refurbishment of property 5 to 20 years or lease term if lower ◊ fixtures, fittings, plant and machinery 3 to 20 years land is not depreciated. these costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (three to five years). computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives (three to five years). assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or where they indicate a previously recognised impairment may no longer be required. once an asset has been written down to its fair value less costs of disposal then any remaining impairment is allocated equally amongst all other assets. deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current taxation assets against current taxation liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis. www.rank.com | 109

treated as a separate cgu for impairment testing purposes. each individual bingo club has been treated as a separate cgu, and tested for impairment on that basis. no further reversals are expected as

risk management objectives and policies continued (ii) cash flow and fair value interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. due to current low interest rates, any further decline would not have a material impact on income and equity for the year. the group did not enter into any fixed-to-floating or floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps in either year. investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty. no credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any material losses from non-performance of its counterparties. ebitda is calculated as operating profit before exceptional items, depreciation and amortisation from continuing operations. the group has overseas tax losses of £nil (30 june 2016: £3.5m) that are carried forward for offset
