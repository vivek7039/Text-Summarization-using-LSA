David was previously Grosvenor’s human resources director, and will continue to hold this position alongside his Group role. Inspiring people We employ over 10,000 talented and dedicated individuals who have a desire to create the best experience for our customers. As part of Rank’s strategy to build a compelling multi-channel offer, numerous multi- channel customer events were held in the year; below are some examples. In May 2017, digital bingo VIP customers were invited to experience both the Group’s UK retail brands. In the course of 2017/18, we will launch a single account and wallet product across our Grosvenor channels. We have just opened our first new Luda site, bringing bingo-led entertainment to the high street, in August 2017. From August 2017, remote gaming duty at 15% will be due on any bonuses or freebets given to digital customers. As this develops we believe the industry will regain some of that lost trust and be viewed in a more positive light. Supply As at 30 June 2017, the number of casino licences operating in Great Britain was estimated to be 146. Supply At 30 June 2017, there were an estimated 358 bingo clubs operating in Great Britain, down five from a year earlier. One such initiative to which Rank remains firmly committed is the ongoing development and improvement of multi-operator self-exclusion schemes. Teamwork Ambition Responsibility Celebrating our values Employees from across Rank attended the STARS launch event in July 2016. 2 Well-to-tank emissions for fuels (electricity, gas, petrol, diesel and aviation fuel), which would sit within scope 3, are not included in the report. 3 This is categorised as outside scopes rather than scope 3, in line with the Defra 2015 emission factor guidance. Grosvenor plans to relocate these spare licences once the required planning and licensing approvals have been obtained.

Two more Luda venues are due to open in Leeds and Weston-super-Mare during the first half of 2017/18. It is designed to target a different demographic from Mecca and will typically be located in town or city centres. Alan Morgan Managing Director – Mecca Strategic report 34 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Operating review | UK digital Rank’s UK digital business continued to grow strongly, with revenue 1 up 15% and operating profit 2 up 63% in the year. Operating profit 2 grew strongly in the year, up 63%, due to higher revenue and good cost control as a result of combining both digital businesses. Benefits from these actions will continue into 2017/18 as a number of savings were delivered during the second half. European political uncertainties are fuelling exchange rate weakness which impacts directly on some business costs, reducing profitability. The VIP population is closely managed to ensure that strong long-term relationships are developed through dedicated customer handling and specialised incentive schemes. Ensuring that serious disruptive events such as fire, flood, pandemic or security incident can be managed to restore operations swiftly and smoothly is of critical importance. Plans for the recovery of critical IT services are likewise in place and reviewed on an ongoing basis. The broader impact of Rank’s operations, including taxes paid by supplier companies, is harder to quantify but no less significant. Gambling taxes United Kingdom Online gaming became subject to tax on a place of consumption basis from 1 December 2014. This was driven by commercial factors which include improved customer service by being able to offer dealer-operated tables 24 hours a day, consistency of play for customers, more optimal use of licenced gaming space across the casino estate and labour-saving costs through one dealer being able to cover more than one casino. Tax fact file continued Strategic report 46 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Spain In 2011, the Spanish government invited online operators to apply for remote gaming licences and introduced tax changes which levied gaming duty on a place of consumption basis.

Each individual bingo club has been treated as a separate CGU, and tested for impairment on that basis. Amounts charged to the provision for impairment are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash. Due to current low interest rates, any further decline would not have a material impact on income and equity for the year. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty. No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any material losses from non-performance of its counterparties. The Group has overseas tax losses of £nil (30 June 2016: £3.5m) that are carried forward for offset against suitable future taxable profits.
