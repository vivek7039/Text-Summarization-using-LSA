service by being able to offer dealer-operated tables 24 hours a day, consistency of play for customers, more optimal use of licenced gaming space across the casino estate and labour-saving costs

chief operating decision-maker utilises internal reporting within the business. each individual bingo club has been treated as a separate cgu, and tested for impairment on that basis. amounts charged to the provision for impairment are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash. due to current low interest rates, any further decline would not have a material impact on income and equity for the year. investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty. no credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any material losses from non-performance of its counterparties. the group has overseas tax losses of £nil (30 june 2016: £3.5m) that are
