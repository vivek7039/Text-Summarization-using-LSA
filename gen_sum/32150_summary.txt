group’s security solutions are underpinned by sophoslabs, a world- leading 24/7 threat intelligence operation, employing over 150 people across four continents. this is seen as a significant opportunity, with just 9.6% of customers using both endpoint and utm products today. strong performance above the board’s expectations, driven by growth in billings and close control of working capital. the comparative has been restated as it is now measured on a total group basis. billings $632.1m (fy16: $534.9m) cash ebitda $150.1m (fy16: $120.9m) revenue $529.7m (fy16: $478.2m) unlevered

strategic report governance financial statements 15 chief executive officer’s statement fy17 was another strong year for sophos, in which we made significant progress against our strategic goals, and delivered operational and financial performance above our expectations overview among the many highlights, the group saw an 18.2 percent increase in total reported billings to $632.1 million, underpinned by 21.4 percent subscription billings growth to $513.1 million, as we again delivered growth in excess of the market in both network and enduser security. september 2016 saw the launch of intercept x, an exciting next-generation endpoint protection application, featuring signature-less anti-exploit, anti-ransomware and root cause analytics capabilities. in just two quarters since its launch, more than 8,000 customers have purchased intercept x on the sophos central cloud-management platform. acquisitions in february 2017 sophos announced the acquisition of invincea, inc., a leading developer of advanced next- generation malware protection, consistently ranked as among the best performing signature-less, next- generation endpoint technologies in third-party testing, rated highly both for high detection and low false- positive rates. invincea complements and enhances sophos’ existing presence in next-generation endpoint protection, a dynamic new segment that is serving to increase meaningfully the size and growth rate of the multi- billion dollar endpoint security market as a whole. security continues to be a mission-critical, board-level priority for organisations of every size that only rises in importance with each passing year. kris hagerman chief executive officer 16 may 2017 an early commitment to the cloud has given sophos a real and growing competitive advantage chief executive officer’s statement continued 18 q&a with members of the sophos senior management team michael valentine senior vice president, worldwide sales q. when you talk to customers, what are their most pressing issues? the opportunities offered by msp and iaas models are appealing as more customers move to aws or azure. everyone wants to be on the winning team and that’s what we

group finished the year strongly and is increasingly well positioned to achieve growth from both new and existing customers in fy18 and beyond the key metrics of billings, cash ebitda and cash flow were all strong in the year. billings by region americas billings attributable to the americas increased by $29.7 million to $217.6 million in the year-ended 31 march 2017, representing 15.8 percent growth on a reported basis and 15.9 percent on a constant currency basis. enduser products the group’s billings attributable to enduser products increased by $51.5 million to $289.7 million in the year- ended 31 march 2017 , representing 21.6 percent growth on a reported basis and 24.4 percent growth at constant currency. sophos central, incorporating the new next- generation endpoint product, intercept x, was a key driver for enduser billings growth. introduction strategic report governance financial statements 29 financial review continued billings by type subscription billings increased by $90.3 million to $513.1 million in the year-ended 31 march 2017, representing 21.4 percent growth on a reported basis and 23.3 percent growth on a constant currency basis. retention rates the

billings. + 16.5% deferred revenue growth +12.3% constant currency revenue growth introduction strategic report governance financial statements 31 financial review continued underlying general finance and administration expenses have increased by 10.1 percent yoy and have decreased as a proportion of billings as the group continued to leverage its strong back office function. on a reported basis, cash ebitda increased by 24.2 percent to $150.1 million in the year-ended 31 march 2017 . prior-year working capital changes included outflows for significant accrued and payable amounts expensed in fy15. if the group’s products restrict important files or applications based on falsely identifying them as malware or some other item that could be restricted, this could adversely affect end customers’ systems and cause material system failures. what we are doing about it sophos is committed to investment in its world class virus labs facility with emphasis placed on staff training, testing and quality procedures. what we are doing about it sophos has a dedicated cybersecurity team that is focused on investigation and mitigation of risks related to cyber-attack. sophos customer and partner communities continue to be invaluable resources in guiding portfolio management decisions. employees the group operates by its core values: simplicity, empowerment, passion, innovation and

approval the strategic report on pages 10 to 39 was approved by the board on 16 may 2017 and signed on its behalf by: kris hagerman chief executive officer 16 may 2017 education is a core element of the project and sophos’ aims include preventing drop-outs after 8th grade through providing uniforms, bags, books and transportation to students as well as providing skill development courses. cloud-based analytics sophos acquired a start-up company that had created a real-time security monitoring and analysis technology that leverages machine learning to monitor users and devices for anomalous behaviour, significantly enhancing the ability to identify malicious or suspicious activity. qualifications: first class ba in civil engineering, aston university, uk and a qualified

audit and risk committee, with effect from the conclusion of the company’s 2017 annual general meeting (“agm”). board evaluation sophos supports the code principle that each ftse 350 company should undertake a thorough review of board process, practice and culture on an annual basis; with the input of an external facilitator at least once every three years. the board will keep this position under review, and it is their intention to comply in due course. notwithstanding this arrangement, the board considers paul to be independent in character and judgement. executive directors serve on the basis of service agreements which are also available for inspection upon request. all directors have access to an online portal to which board materials are published and board resources, including information about the company and helpful guidance documents for their reference as directors of a uk listed company, are available. internal successors were categorised by their relative readiness to assume any such role and where it was not possible to identify a suitable internal successor, an external successor would be identified, as and when appropriate. • only engage executive search firms who have signed up to the voluntary code of conduct on gender diversity and best practice. additionally, the finance director or controller of the reporting entity completes a self-certified quarterly financial reporting review questionnaire which is used to identify control strengths and weaknesses across all financial areas with any weaknesses being subsequently addressed. regular reporting of risk management ensures each risk is re-evaluated on a timely basis to ensure that all relevant risks are identified and managed appropriately and that the board is focused on the principal risks identified. the internal audit plan continues to be developed through a review of formal risk assessments, together with consideration of the group’s key business processes and functions that could be subject to audit. the committee has been conscious of uk institutional investors’ preference for packages to be weighted towards performance-related pay. executive directors’ salary increases will normally be in line with those for the wider employee population. directors’ remuneration policy 67 introduction strategic report governance financial statements purpose and link to strategy operation maximum opportunity performance metrics fixed pay: pension provide post- retirement benefits for participants in a cost-efficient manner. other than in exceptional cases (such as to replace existing arrangements for new recruits) the committee does not anticipate pension benefits as being at a cost to the company that would exceed 20 percent of base salary. in extreme cases of misconduct, the committee may claw back annual bonus payments previously made. the maximum bonus opportunity for executive directors will be up to 200 percent of salary. the annual bonus will be based on achievement of stretching financial targets (e.g. billings, ebitda) and personal performance. it is anticipated that no more than 25 percent of aggregate awards in any one year will be over restricted shares or options. additional fees may be paid if there is a material increase in time commitment required. further details are set out on page 83. none

other than minor text changes to ensure this policy remains clear for the reader, a few other minor changes have been made to provide additional clarity, including updated scenario charts shown below. differences in remuneration policy operated for other employees other employee remuneration has the same components as set out in the policy, being base salary, annual bonus, long-term incentive participation, pension, life assurance and benefit provision. the assumptions made in illustrating potential reward opportunities are shown in the table below: performance scenario fixed pay annual bonus ltip (performance-based awards) ltip (time- based awards) minimum salary as at most recent review date. other than in exceptional cases (such as to replace existing arrangements for new recruits) the committee does not anticipate pension benefits as being at a cost to the company that would exceed 20 percent of base salary. in addition to the remuneration arrangements set out above, the committee may make an award in respect of a new appointment to ‘buy out’ incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, using listing rule 9.4.2 r if necessary. they are not eligible to participate in the annual bonus, nor do they receive any additional pension or benefits (other than nominal travel expenses) on top of the fees disclosed on page 83. non-executive directors appointment may be terminated at any time upon written notice or in accordance with the articles and receive no compensation on termination. in specified circumstances (not involving a change of control, in which case the severance payment applicable is as described below), each executive director is entitled to terminate his employment without notice and receive a severance payment. the table below summarises how incentives are typically treated in different circumstances: reason for leaving treatment bonus summary dismissal, resignation awards lapse. following consultation with shareholders, the committee has worked to improve disclosure of retrospective annual bonus targets. the targets set for fy16 are no longer considered commercially sensitive and are disclosed in full below, along with performance against those targets: performance measure threshold (12.5% payout) target (50% payout) stretch (100% payout) achievement implied vesting (percent of

the performance against targets for each of the financial years fy17 to fy19 and is based on the lower of the implied payouts for billings and cash ebitda (i.e. the measures are equally weighted); sliding scale vesting applies between threshold and stretch, and super stretch and maximum. 81 introduction strategic report governance financial statements dilution limits it is proposed that sophos will continue to manage dilution within the context of maintaining award levels within a 10 percent limit over five years, the limit that has applied since our incentive plans were approved at ipo.

of profit or loss, except for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the group’s net investment in a foreign operation. tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those borrowings are also dealt with in equity. service and non-market performance conditions attached to the transactions are not taken into account in determining fair value. after initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment, at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. an intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. 109 introduction strategic report governance financial statements notes to the consolidated financial statements continued for the year-ended 31 march 2017 3 significant accounting policies continued 3.9 intangible assets continued intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised over their expected useful lives as follows: intangible assets arising on acquisition of subsidiaries intellectual property 5 – 15 years reducing balance basis brand names 15 – 20 years reducing balance basis customer base 6 – 14 years reducing balance basis other purchased intangible assets all other intangibles 3 years straight-line basis the amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as a general finance and administration cost. intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash- generating unit level. cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition. provided the conditions specified by ias 39 — financial instruments are met, hedge accounting may be used to mitigate this volatility. where the group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance policy, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when recovery is virtually certain. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 3.17 pensions and other post-retirement benefits the group operates defined contribution pension schemes for its employees. transfer prices between geographical segments are set on an arm's length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. as like-for-like billings growth has been previously disclosed, and in accordance with best practice for a transition in metric disclosures, the figures for the current and comparative periods are, on this occasion, shown below. depreciation and unrealised foreign exchange differences are adjusted as they do not represent cash costs of the business. uncertain tax positions are monitored regularly and a provision made in the accounts where appropriate. there is no guarantee that these incentives will continue to be applicable in future years. 123

comparability with other uk listed companies. during the period ended 31 march 2017 a provision for impairment of $0.1m (2016: $0.3m) was recognised in operating expenses against receivables. for more information about the group's exposure to interest rate, foreign currency and liquidity risk, see note 27. where appropriate, cost effective and practicable, the group uses various financial instruments to manage these risks. to mitigate this risk, cash and deposits are only held with reputable banking institutions. year-ended 31 march 2017 $m year-ended 31 march 2016 $m 10% movement in
