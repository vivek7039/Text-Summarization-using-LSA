The Directors do not anticipate that the IFRSs will have a significant effect on the Group’s consolidated financial information: Effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 2017: Amendments to IAS 7 – Statement of Cash Flows Amendment to IAS12 – Income Taxes Effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 2018: IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments Amendments to IFRS 2 – Share-based Payment Transactions IFRS 15 – REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS IFRS 15 “Revenue from contracts with customers” is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those borrowings are also dealt with in equity. Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the transactions are not taken into account in determining fair value. After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment, at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash- generating unit level. Provided the conditions specified by IAS 39 — Financial Instruments are met, hedge accounting may be used to mitigate this volatility. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. The fair value is determined by using an appropriate pricing model, further details of which are given in note 30. Transfer prices between geographical segments are set on an arm's length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. Depreciation and unrealised foreign exchange differences are adjusted as they do not represent cash costs of the business. This change of basis has been made to ensure better comparability with other UK listed companies. During the period ended 31 March 2017 a provision for impairment of $0.1M (2016: $0.3M) was recognised in operating expenses against receivables. For more information about the Group's exposure to interest rate, foreign currency and liquidity risk, see note 27. Where appropriate, cost effective and practicable, the Group uses various financial instruments to manage these risks. Transactions entered into, and trading balances outstanding with other related parties, are as follows: Softcat Plc, an entity related through common Director’s interest from 3 January 2017, is a leading provider of IT infrastructure and a customer of the Group. During the year-ended 31 March 2017, no provisions were made for doubtful debts relating to amounts owed by related parties (2016: $Nil).
