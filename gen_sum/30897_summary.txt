NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 52 Ubisense Group plc Annual Report 2017 3 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Research and development Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Internally-generated intangible assets, consisting mainly of direct labour costs, are amortised on a straight-line basis over their  useful economic lives. Other intangible assets Intangible assets that are purchased separately, such as software licences that do not form an integral part of related hardware,  are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic life which is typically 3 years.
