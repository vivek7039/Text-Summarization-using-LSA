life sciences markets with photonics engineering solutions from across the company’s technology portfolio. scientific research g&h works with some of most prestigious big science projects in the world. we are a primary supplier of many critical optical components such as very large frequency conversion crystals used in the world’s most powerful laser system at the national ignition facility (nif) at lawrence livermore national laboratory. stingray was a particularly significant acquisition as it provides g&h with advanced optical systems design capabilities for harsh and demanding applications. in successfully responding to the challenges of 2017 an exceptional effort was required by many people. gareth jones chairman 28 november 2017 stra tegic report “gooch & housego is stronger today than at any time in its past.” chairman’s statement ceo mark webster accepting the 2017 aim award for global achievement gooch & housego plc annual report 2017 | 11 stra tegic report overview fy2017 performance gooch & housego (“g&h”) benefited from positive market conditions and strong demand across its main sectors of industrials, aerospace & defence (“a&d”) and life sciences. strategically important investments in people, processes, systems and the latest capital equipment were made during the year, enabling us to address high levels of demand in fy2017 and provide an important platform for g&h’s future growth. these business areas have customer bases which include tier one a&d and medical diagnostic companies, who often prefer g&h to provide sub systems or systems rather than solely critical components, providing a strong impetus to move up the value chain. their product range is focused on laboratory, ground based, airborne, unmanned aerial vehicles (‘uavs”) and space applications for key us defence customers. the group consists of scientists and engineers who bring a wide range of skills such as electronic, software and mechanical engineering, which are required in order to present a complete sub system or system to our customers. the established business development executives have brought enhanced access to tier 1 a&d companies and multi-national medical diagnostic organisations and have been instrumental in the development of some of our most notable r&d projects. g&h provides some of the more technically challenging elements to both land and undersea optical communications. we also have a number of r&d collaborations with medical diagnostic companies in cardiovascular and cancer detection. we acquired usa based stingray optics llc in february 2017, which has integrated well into the wider organisation and performed strongly. we believe the introduction of three well defined and focused manufacturing centres will provide a scalable platform for enhanced lean manufacturing practice these strategic initiatives combined with a record year end order book mean the board remains confident that g&h is well positioned to deliver further progress in fy 2018 and beyond mark webster chief executive officer 28 november 2017 chief executive officer’s statement gooch & housego plc 14 | annual report 2017 applications, products and markets industrial lasers for materials processing applications. a move towards new laser enabled production techniques has driven strong growth in the microelectronic materials processing end market. this

technologies. the products supplied into this market are based upon fibre optic, acousto-optic and non-linear optics technologies. g&h provides system level products for harsh environments, to an impressive list of blue chip defence companies. the business provides system level optical products for use in harsh environments to key us defence customers. gooch & housego provides a family of fibre optic products in this market, ranging from discrete components to full optical systems. this market grew in 2017 and we continue to work on the next generation of products with key customers. the products supplied into this market are based upon electro-optic, fibre optic and acousto-optic technologies. this market remained buoyant in the year and continues to be a growth area. a small number of “big science” projects, which are reliant on government funding, dominate this market. this growth was largely driven by a combination of our industrial laser and telecommunications businesses. revenue from the group’s industrial laser business segment grew strongly, driven by high demand for precision lasers used in microelectronic manufacturing. operations as reported in our interim statement, the company has committed to upgrading its cleveland, ohio facility. stingray’s product range covers laboratory, ground based, airborne, unmanned aerial vehicles and space applications. financial and operating review gooch & housego plc 26 | annual report 2017 stra tegic report strategy overview stra tegies diversification to develop, through r&d and acquisition, a

incorporated and domiciled in the united kingdom. this will entail the recognition of right of use assets and lease liabilities relating to existing operating leases, although we do not currently envisage a material effect on the group’s net assets or profit before tax. a market segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns which are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments. impairment of non-financial assets the group assesses at each balance sheet date whether an asset may be impaired. they are included in current assets, except those with maturities greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date. subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against ‘administration costs’ in the income statement. the group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates. no individual customer made up more than 6% of revenue in either the current or prior year. for the year ended 30 spetember 2017 aerospace & defence £’000 life sciences £’000 industrial £’000 scientific research £’000
