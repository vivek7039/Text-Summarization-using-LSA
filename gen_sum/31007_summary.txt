This was due to continued strong  revenue growth coupled with a slightly lower percentage  increase in underlying operating costs (1) . Underlying operating profit (1)  is reported before share-based  payments, which are a significant non-cash charge driven by   a valuation model, and National Insurance on share-based  incentives, which is driven by reference to the Rightmove plc  share price and so subject to volatility , rather than operational  activity. This may  result in increased competition from  existing competitors or new entrants  targeting the Group’s primary revenue  markets. We also offer private  healthcare complemented by a cash plan scheme for all   our employees’ medical needs. It is important that our people can directly benefit from their  contribution to the success of Rightmove and we offer two   all-employee share plans. The Rightmove Share Incentive Plan was launched in 2015  with an award of 100 free shares for all employees. We recognise that a diverse workforce reflects Rightmove’s  broad consumer base and our many customers. We conduct an annual ‘Have your Say’ people survey to  gauge what our employees think and how they feel about  working for Rightmove. As an internet-based business with most staff employed in  two office locations, our environmental footprint is small. We are very proud that the fund has raised over £1 million  since 2014 for charitable causes supported by our customers.

The Board reviews non-executive director independence   on an annual basis taking into account such factors as their  contribution to unbiased and independent debate during  meetings. Governance | Corporate governance report continued Issue Committee review Revenue As more fully described on page 17  and 93 the majority of the Group’s  revenue is derived from subscriptions  for core listing fees and advertising  products on Rightmove’s platforms. •  How do these judgements compare with the risks that KPMG are planning to include   in their Auditors’ Report? Membership  The Committee is comprised entirely of non-executive  directors, whose biographical details can be found on pages  30 to 31. Numis Securities receives a  standard commission from Rightmove for the share buyback  programme and there is no retainer or special fees agreement  in relation to brokerage or research; the commission  payments of c£100,000 per annum are immaterial to  Rightmove.

The Policy was developed in line with Rightmove’s approach,  that our executive directors should be rewarded with  demonstrably lower than market base salaries and benefits  and higher than market equity rewards subject to the  achievement of challenging performance targets. Relevant market  comparators are selected for  comparison, which include other  companies of a similar size and  complexity. The Committee considers both  individual and Group performance  in a broad context when  determining base salary increases. For the PSP, awards are subject to a combination of  underlying basic earnings per share (EPS) and relative   TSR performance conditions. EPS targets are set based on sliding scales that take account  of internal financial planning and external analyst forecasts. Flexibility will be retained to set equivalent  objectives for any new executive joining part way through a year. However ,  depending on the timing and nature of appointment it may be necessary to set tailored performance  criteria for their first bonus plan. Long-term incentives A new appointment will be eligible to receive PSP awards as outlined in the Policy table. Scott Forbes’ appointment may be terminated by either  party giving to the other not less than three months’ notice  in writing. The Committee reviews  its relationship with external advisors on a regular basis and  continues to believe that there are no conflicts of interest. The performance measures and weightings will be as follows: Measure As a % of maximum bonus opportunity Financial targets Underlying operating profit (1)  65% Strategic targets T raffic market share (2)  15% Other revenue (3)  15% Employee engagement (4)   5%   (1)  Operating profit before share-based payments and NI on   share-based incentives. (4)  Reflects base salary through to resignation as Chief Executive Officer and director on 9 May 2017 together with pro rata vesting of PSPs awarded in March 2015. As this level  of outperformance is 70% higher than the Index, these options will vest in full on 2 March 2018. On 9 May 2017, the Committee approved a top-up award  of performance shares for Peter Brooks-Johnson,  following his promotion to CEO. PSP awards which have already vested but remain unexercised will be exercisable until 30 June 2018,  being 12 months from Nick’s leaving date. The average salary for all employees increased by 2% due to a universal cost of living increase in January 2017. Additional  information on the number of employees, total revenue and underlying operating profit has been provided for context. Irregularities – ability to detect We identified areas of laws and regulations that could  reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the  financial statements from our sector experience, through  discussion with the directors and other management (as  required by auditing standards). The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to both years presented, unless otherwise stated. Rightmove plc annual report 2017 91 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 1 General information continued The Directors believe that these non-GAAP measures provide a more appropriate measure of the Group’s business performance  as share-based payments are a significant non-cash charge and are driven by a valuation model, and NI on share-based  incentives is driven by reference to the Rightmove plc share price and so subject to volatility, rather than reflecting operational  activity. Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical knowledge and  understanding, is recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Agency, Overseas and Commercial services are typically billed in advance with revenue deferred until the service commencement  date. rightmove.co.uk 94 2 Significant accounting policies continued (k) Segmental reporting An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues   and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. The Group’s revenue model is largely subscription-based, which results in a regular level of cash conversion allowing it to service  working capital requirements. During the year we have accrued amounts in relation to a number of employee related provisions principally holiday pay. These shares were  bought in 2008 at an average price of £4.76 and may be used to satisfy certain share-based incentive awards. Other reserves This represents the Capital Redemption Reserve in respect of own shares bought back and cancelled. 34,720 PSP awards were made on 1 March 2017 (the Grant Date) subject to Earnings Per Share (EPS) and T otal Shareholders  Return (TSR) performance.
