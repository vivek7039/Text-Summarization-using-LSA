report 2017 15 we use the metrics set out below to track our financial performance. this was due to continued strong revenue growth coupled with a slightly lower percentage increase in underlying operating costs (1) . underlying operating profit (1) is reported before share-based payments, which are a significant non-cash charge driven by a valuation model, and national insurance on share-based incentives, which is driven by reference to the rightmove plc share price and so subject to volatility , rather than operational activity. the group’s internal control framework is aligned to a ‘three lines of defence’ model. this may result in increased competition from existing competitors or new entrants targeting the group’s primary revenue markets. we also believe that long-term commitment from rightmove employees is key to our culture and success. our technology teams took on four computer and data science interns from university college london. we also offer private healthcare complemented by a cash plan scheme for all our employees’ medical needs. it is important that our people can directly benefit from their contribution to the success of rightmove and we offer two all-employee share plans. the rightmove share incentive plan was launched in 2015 with an award of 100 free shares for all employees. further awards of 50 free shares have been made annually in subsequent years to all qualifying employees. we recognise that a diverse workforce reflects rightmove’s broad consumer base and our many customers. in line with the hampton-alexander review, rightmove has set a target for 33% female leadership by 2020. we offer flexible working arrangements, fully support part- time working and reduced hours to allow our employees to balance their work and family commitments. we conduct an annual ‘have your say’ people survey to gauge what our employees think and how they feel about working for rightmove. as an internet-based business with most staff employed in two office locations, our environmental footprint is small. we are very proud that the fund has raised over £1 million since 2014 for charitable causes supported by our customers. scope 2 and 3 emissions per employee have declined year on year due in part to an increase in average headcount which has not had a proportionate impact on emissions from running our offices or the outsourced data centres. ashley martin non-executive director appointment to the board 11 june 2009 committee membership audit (chairman), nomination current external commitments non-executive
