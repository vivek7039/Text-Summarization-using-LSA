This is  achieved through works  management systems,  conservative accounting  policies and a culture of  giving attention to detail. This has been most  evident recently where we have seen a lower rate than normal in  the conversion of new contract opportunities. We supported our clients in postponing this planned work,  knowing that it will return once they have confirmed their  housing is fully compliant. While significantly bigger in scale than the  Group’s previous bids, they remain true to our core approach of  focusing on services around a tenant, funded by public money . The Group will increasingly focus its Care bidding activity  towards those clients where there are opportunities to provide  Housing services. → Mears has evolved its strategic focus towards housing  management and Placemaking activities where we are  using our broader service capability to create stronger,  more sustainable communities. → We firmly believe in our long-term Care strategy and that  Mears is best placed to benefit as the market evolves. The Mears  operations are performing very well and I am encouraged that  this excellent performance is putting us in a good position to  secure new opportunities. We firmly believe in our long-term Care strategy and that  Mears is well placed to benefit as the market evolves. We have continued to grow our broader housing expertise,  with Mears playing an ever increasing role in helping clients  shape their placemaking plans. Sustainability and corporate social responsibility  have always been an important part of the Mears  ethos; do you see that continuing? This  includes an increasing role in using our  broad range of services to create stronger,  more sustainable communities, or  placemaking as it is known. ’ 4 Investment After decades of underfunding, there are real   signs now that the political landscape for social   care is improving. An additional £2 billion has been promised over the next   three years from central Government pots, and at a local level  through ring-fenced council tax increases. → Began work on tendering for the two biggest opportunities  that Mears has ever seen, reflecting how we have been able   to develop our services in line with changing client needs. We anticipate  particularly active contract bidding in  2018, but would be satisfied to maintain  the order book at current levels. Profit to cash conversion (Group) This is a working capital management  KPI, which remains the cornerstone of  our business. The Group is committed to protection of its assets through an  effective risk management process, supported by insurance  where appropriate. They are also responsible for reporting   and monitoring key risks in accordance with established  processes under the Group operational policies. → We have comprehensive safe systems  of work which are well communicated  through a robust and coordinated  internal training regime. IT and data Increased gross risk exposure Definition Mitigation A major incident or catastrophic event  could impact on the Group’s ability to  trade. Consideration was given to a number of key assumptions,  namely future revenue growth, operating margins and working  capital management. Mears through its dedicated training arm, is now  delivering a wide range of apprenticeships which  include plumbing, gas, multi-trade, carpentry  and plastering. Mears is an accredited training provider , currently  training five apprentices from other companies in  the South Yorkshire area, and has a contract with  Rotherham College to deliver adult programmes,  including introduction into construction,  Construction Skills Certification Scheme  (CSCS) cards, and help with employability  skills – our success rate for getting our  attendees into employment is currently 80%. We are often being  asked by clients and other stakeholders to  have greater involvement in helping them  deliver appropriate housing outcomes for  a range of tenants. This terrible event  affected the timing of our planned maintenance  workloads as clients’ attentions have naturally  been diverted towards ensuring that their housing  portfolios are safe and fully compliant. This is enabling us to bid for  opportunities of a scale and  breadth that would previously  have been impossible. Focus on building sustainable,  long-term partnerships Our broader service offering  is enabling us to generate  multiple revenue streams  from single client relationships. We are looking to achieve this through maintaining a high level of  selectivity on bidding new works, further operational improvements  and support function efficiencies flowing from improved processes. Whilst we have experienced some improvement in  carer turnover during the year, with attrition rates reducing  from 44% to 42%, this still remains at an unsustainable level. Invest in the workforce  to ensure that it is both  motivated and well trained We have minimum pay  levels for our staff which are  set ahead of NLW. To support this activity, the Group has put in place  a £30m revolving credit facility for an initial two-year term. At 31 December 2017, £13.9m of this funding line had been  drawn with the associated asset disclosed within assets  held for resale. Mears has taken legal advice and believes there is a realistic  expectation that these funds will be recovered in due course. The remaining unamortised value of £9.6m (2016: £19.8m),  relating to order book and customer relationships, will be written  off over their estimated lives. We are developing opportunities in this area that look to  not require any forward funding, which is our natural  preference and better fits the Mears’ model. At 31 December 2017,  £13.9m of this funding line had been drawn, with the associated  asset disclosed within assets held for resale. As detailed above, the Group secured a property acquisition  credit facility of £30m to acquire and build portfolios for  resale.

On a positive note, the increased transparency   over leases may drive more economic lease decisions and  so deliver cost savings. We aim to lead the way with Social Value, delivering lasting  and meaningful outcomes through positive community  engagement projects. Sue Husband, Director of the National  Apprenticeship Service, said: “Mears has   been highly commended and I would like to  congratulate them on their achievement. This year, teams across the Group have been taking part  in a variety of events, specifically focusing on social isolation. This is an innovative scheme that supports older men who  want to get together, share and learn new skills - all in the  welcoming space of a shed. Once the Victorian building  has been renovated it will become a treatment and recovery  centre for former soldiers living with Post-Traumatic Stress  Disorder (PTSD). This approach, whilst supporting our wider social  value objectives, ensures that any reusable items are reused/recycled as waste to  landfill is minimised.

The Executive Directors receive additional benefits  including a company-provided car or an allowance in  lieu, life assurance and private medical insurance. There  will, however, be no automatic entitlement to bonus payments  or share incentive grants during the period of notice. Non-Executive Directors  also receive reimbursement of  reasonable expenses (and any  tax thereon) incurred through  undertaking their duties and/or  Company business. Our process for identifying  and managing risks is set out in more detail within the Corporate  Governance Statement. Key observations Based on our audit work, we found the valuation methodologies and assumptions  made in management’s assessment of goodwill impairment were appropriate. Small  variations in those actuarial assumptions  can lead to a materially different value of  pension liabilities being recognised within  the Group financial statements. We determined a lower level of specific materiality  for certain areas such as directors’ remuneration  and related party transactions. In addition, all internal activities related to the  research and development of new software are continually monitored by management. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for  indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. Current tax assets and/or liabilities comprise those obligations to, or claims from, fiscal authorities that are unpaid at the  balance sheet date. All employee services  received in exchange for the grant of any share-based remuneration are measured at their fair values. Bank overdrafts are presented  as current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
