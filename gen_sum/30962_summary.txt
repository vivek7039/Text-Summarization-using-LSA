There is clearly a global need  for new anti-infective drugs that are  effective and reduce the growing  danger of antimicrobial resistance  (“AMR”). Together with the  Board, we are all committed to  building a valuable drug development  company.

The US Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention confirm that each year  in the US at least two million people  become infected with bacteria that are  resistant to antibiotics and at least  23,000 die each year as a direct result  of such infections.

Funding Destiny Pharma has a track record  of raising funds in both private and  public markets. Destiny  Pharma has already proven it can  develop intellectual property,  identify lead candidates and bring  selected compounds through early  testing to be ready for late stage  Phase 2b clinical trials. Destiny Pharma is well  connected with expert groups across  the world and will continue to explore  such opportunities. Financial statements Governance Strategic report Destiny Pharma plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 09 Destiny Pharma’s strategic aim is to become  one of the world’s leading developers of novel  anti-infective drugs. A longer duration of illness  and treatment, often in hospitals,  increases health care costs as  well as the economic burden on  families and societies.”   “ A n t i m ic r o b i a l r e s i s ta n ce  jeopardizes health care gains  to society: The achievements of  modern medicine are put at risk  by antimicrobial resistance. Without effective antimicrobials  for prevention and treatment of  infections, the success of organ  transplantation, cancer  chemotherapy and major surgery  would be compromised.” Antimicrobial resistance  Fact sheet N°194  15 July 2015  WHO CEO’s operational and strategic review XF-73 is potent against all strains tested of  Staphylococcus aureus, including MRSAs, killing  the bacteria so rapidly that no bacterial resistance  has been observed. The XF drugs can therefore potentially  operate within existing antibiotic  markets and may also be able to  open new preventative and therapeutic  drug markets that are closed to, or  restricted for, traditional antibiotics  because of the existence and/or  threat of AMR. Our pipeline Destiny Pharma is focused on markets restricted or blocked  by antibiotic resistance CEO’s operational and strategic review continued Destiny Pharma plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 12 Multi drug-resistant  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  can be deadly for patients in  critical care. An estimated  51,000 healthcare-associated  infections are caused by this  bacteria in the United States  each year. QIDP status identifies XF-73  as a drug that is intended to treat  serious or life-threatening infections,  including those caused by antibiotic  resistant pathogens. Staphylococcus aureus load after 0, 1 and 5 days’ dosing Financial statements Governance Strategic report Destiny Pharma plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 13 The medical need to combat  surgical infections is significant  Patient carriage of Staphylococcus  aureus strains, including MRSA, is  recognised as a growing problem  and the testing of patients entering  hospital for surgery is widespread in  many countries, including the US. This market has a  potential patient population of over  eight million people in the US alone. In Europe, similar guidelines exist  recommending decolonisation of  Staphylococcus aureus positive  patients prior to certain surgeries. The antibiotic, mupirocin, is often  used off-label in the US for these  applications, although it has two key  disadvantages in that it is slow acting,  requiring five days of dosing, and  staphylococcal resistance to mupirocin  can develop rapidly and become  widespread. It is therefore apparent that there  has been a move from screening  and treatment of just MRSA carriage  in patient populations to also now  include all Staphylococcus aureus  strains (MRSA and MSSA), an  approximate five to tenfold  increase in the number of patients  who can benefit. Destiny Pharma believes that there  is significant demand for the XF-73  product and have identified the  following additional drivers for adoption: • current practice guidelines have  identified patient populations that  can benefit while highlighting that  antibiotic resistance as an issue with  current products; • from 2017, US general, acute-care  and short-term hospitals with  the highest MRSA infections  will have 1% of their Medicare  reimbursements withheld; • on 20 September 2016, the UN  General Assembly called for new  drugs to tackle antibiotic resistance; • US hospital administrators are keen  to reduce infection to ensure high  ratings in rankings tables; • XF-73, having QIDP approval,  benefits from five years of extra US  market exclusivity; • XF-73 could be the first drug  approved into a new US indication  with first to market advantages; and • XF-73 has both QIDP and Fast Track  regulatory status in the US. As XF-73 is differentiated from  antibiotics due to its superior bacterial  resistance profile, it is likely that its use  can be widespread, preserving antibiotic  use and could potentially be used  without the need for bacterial screening. In this aspect, XF-73 can be viewed as  a preventative pharmaceutical more  akin to vaccines than antibiotics. CEO’s operational and strategic review continued Exciting earlier pipeline of anti-infective programmes Several additional projects have been identified for the XF platform Destiny Pharma plans in the next  two years to develop two additional  products from its pipeline towards  clinical development, and to conduct  earlier stage research work in respect  of biofilm action. VAP is a  subset of HAP that occurs in  mechanically ventilated patients more  than 48 hours after tracheal intubation. There are over 1.7 million  mechanically ventilated patients in the  US each year who could benefit from  preventative treatment. Destiny Pharma will also establish a  number of discovery stage research  programmes through collaborations  and where possible seek non-dilutive  funding support. Concurrently, Destiny Pharma will  continue to apply for non-dilutive  funding grants when suitable structures  are available. Taxation The company’s research and  development activities are eligible  for the UK research and development  small or medium-sized enterprise  (“R&D tax credit”) scheme, which  provides additional taxation relief for  qualifying expenditure on R&D  activities, with an option to surrender  a portion of tax losses arising from  qualifying activities in return for a cash  payment from HM Revenue & Customs  (“HMRC”). However, as  at the date of this report these amounts  have not yet been agreed with HMRC. The Board has put in place  investor relations and partnering strategies that should  support future cash requirements. The virtual business  model maintains a low overhead base which allows some  flexibility in managing spending commitments. Destiny Pharma may not be able to enter into  partnering relationships for the commercialisation  of its drug pipeline assets. Key risks are monitored by senior  management on an ongoing basis  and the risk register is reviewed  regularly at Board meetings. C Destiny Pharma conducts commercial market analysis  to ensure that development activities are directed  towards viable markets. Destiny Pharma also has a  network of key opinion leaders who assist with this  ongoing review. Dependence on key personnel, the loss of whom  through departure, ill health or death, may cause  delays in delivering company strategy.

Dr Love was a founding member of the BEAM Alliance, an  EU SME group focused on promoting antimicrobial drug  development. He is an expert advisory board member of  Global AMR Innovation Fund, appointed by Professor Dame  Sally Davies in October 2016. In 1997, Mr Clark joined CeNeS Pharmaceuticals plc,  a venture capital backed private UK biotech company. He also served as an independent non-executive  director of China Medical System Holdings Ltd between  2007 and 2010. In addition, he was a non-executive director of China  Medstar, an AIM-listed medical device company.

Where considered appropriate  performance materiality may be  reduced to a lower level, such as,  for related party transactions and  Directors’ remuneration. Errors below that  threshold would also be reported to it  if, in our opinion as auditor, disclosure  was required on qualitative grounds. These matters  were addressed in the context of our  audit of the financial statements as a  whole, and in forming our opinion  thereon, and we do not provide a  separate opinion on these matters.
