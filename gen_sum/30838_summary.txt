ITV is an increasingly global and diversiﬁed organisation, with  signiﬁcant non-advertising revenue streams reducing its  dependency on UK advertising. However, linear  television viewing remains resilient and is still the most popular way to consume content  for all demographics. We estimate that the global content market is growing at around 5% per annum, with  some genres such as drama rising faster than others. The large independent production companies, such as Endemol  Shine Group and Fremantle Media, continue to be ITV Studios’ main competitors in  non-scripted content. The platform mix between free-to-air and linear pay television has remained  constant for a number of years at around 50:50. Historically, we have seen that television advertising loses share  in an economic downturn, however it recovers quickly when the cycle reverses. This increase is because of ITV’s unique ability to deliver mass audiences  across multiple regions and in key demographics. Remain responsive to a changing   media environment Linear television viewing remains resilient  despite signiﬁcant changes in the availability  and delivery of content. Younger viewers are watching less linear  television than they used to, but through  delivering great content such as The Voice,  Britain’s Got Talent, Saturday Night Takeaway  and Love Island, television reaches around  90% of young people each week and  remains their dominant choice of media. In 2018, we will explore  opportunities for BritBox on other platforms,  include original commissions, and look to  roll it out further internationally. 31 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional information  Operating and Performance Review We balance our ﬁnancial exposure through  building a portfolio of programmes across  genres and across their content life cycle,  with successful international dramas  offsetting the risk that we will not recover  the full deﬁcit on every show. 5 Gold Rings is a new entertainment format  co-produced by Talpa Media and Possessed (part  of ITV Studios UK). We commenced  roll-out of a bespoke artist payment system, which has reduced duplication across the  business and uses less paper. As a ring-fenced cost,  rental payments will continue to be excluded from our adjusted measures until we move back, which is expected in 2023. Performance Non-NAR revenue increased by 11% in 2017 as we continue to rebalance the business  away from a reliance on NAR.

Our SOB has always been based on our estimate of the pure spot advertising market, excluding  sponsorship, VOD and all broadcasters’ self-promotion revenues on their own channels, which  this year has seen a signiﬁcant increase and therefore further distorts the external spot market. Our SOB has always been based on our estimate of the pure spot advertising market, excluding  sponsorship, VOD and all broadcasters’ self-promotion revenues on their own channels, which  this year has seen a signiﬁcant increase and therefore further distorts the external spot market. By basing a signiﬁcant part of the  consideration on future performance in this way, not only can we  lock in creative talent and ensure our incentives are aligned, but  we also reduce our risk by only paying for the actual, not expected,  performance delivered over time. However, we exclude them from adjusted proﬁts and adjusted EPS  as an exceptional item, as in our view, for the reasons set out above,  these items are part of capital consideration reflecting how we  structure our transactions and do not form part of the core  operations. 6 Salman Amin   Non-executive Director N     Appointed: January 2017  Key areas of prior experience:  General management, marketing,  advertising and media planning.

In preparing the segmental information, centrally managed costs have been allocated between reportable segments   on a methodology driven principally by revenue, headcount and building occupancy of each segment. Details of Directors’ emoluments, share options, pension entitlements and long-term incentive scheme interests are  set out in the Remuneration Report. Adjustments to prior periods primarily arise where an outcom e is obtained on certain tax matters, which differs from  expectations held when the related provision was made. This year, losses arising in higher taxed jurisdictions,  which we recognise through deferred tax, give rise to a reconciling benefit. The provision for   these insured receivables, net of insurance excess, has been recognised as an exceptional expense (see note 2.2). Formats Straight-line up to 8 years Expected future cash flows from those assets existing at the  date of acquisition are estimated. Financial Statements 144 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017      145  Determining the fair value of intangible assets arising on acquisition requires judgement. Tetra Media Studios SAS  On 28 February 2017, the Group purchased 65.04% of the share capital of Tetra Media Studios SAS, a French television  production group which specialises in drama, including flagship crime series Profilage, now in its seventh series, and  political crime thriller Les Hommes de l’Ombre. Management concluded that the best prospect of delivering a strong and sustainable  Irish broadcaster was to bring UTV Ireland under common ownership with TV3. Other fair value adjustments   have been made to the opening balance sheet, though none of them are individually significant. Financial Statements 150 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017      151  3.5   Investments  Keeping  it simple    The Group holds non-controlling interests in a number of different entities. Schemes can be funded, where regular cash contributions are made by   the employer into a fund which is invested, or unfunded, where no regular money   or assets are required to be put aside to cover future payments but in some cases  security is required. At 31 December 2017, the Scheme’s assets were invested in a diversified portfolio   that consisted primarily of equity and debt securities. At 31 December 2017, the Scheme’s assets were invested in a diversified portfolio that consisted primarily of equity   and debt securities. The  Group also reviews other significant receivables and will seek to take out credit insurance on an individual basis where  appropriate. Long-term funding comes from the UK and European capital markets, while any short to medium-term debt  requirements are provided through bank credit facilities totalling £930 million (see below). The Group mainly employs three types of derivative financial instruments when  managing its currency and interest rate risk:  • Foreign exchange swap contracts are derivative instruments used to hedge   income statement translation risk arising from short-term intercompany loans  denominated in a foreign currency;  • Forward foreign exchange contracts are derivative instruments used to hedge  transaction risk so they enable the sale or purchase of foreign currency at a known  fixed rate on an agreed future date; and  • Cross-currency interest rate swaps are derivative instruments used to exchange the  principal and interest coupons in a debt instrument from one currency to another. A transaction will be classed as share-based compensation where the Group receives  services from employees and pays for these in shares or similar equity instruments. All transactions with associated undertakings and joint ventures arise in the normal course of business on an arm’s  length basis. None of these items are expected to have   a material effect on the Group’s results or financial position. A transaction will be classed as share-based compensation where the Company receives services from employees   and pays for these in shares or similar equity instruments. Note iii  Investments  in subsidiary  undertakings     The Company operates an intra-group cash pool policy with certain 100% owned UK subsidiaries. None of these items are expected to have   a material effect on the Company’s results or financial position.
