non-advertising revenue streams reducing its dependency on uk advertising. however, linear television viewing remains resilient and is still the most popular way to consume content for all demographics. we estimate that the global content market is growing at around 5% per annum, with some genres such as drama rising faster than others. original scripted content is brand deﬁning for broadcasters and ott players in an increasingly competitive global environment. our 2017 scripted deliveries included good witch, sun records, somewhere between and a pilot of snowpiercer. we are a major producer of scripted content and have further reinforced this position through our acquisition of world productions in 2017. our 2017 scripted deliveries in the uk included victoria, cold feet,

their free and pay television with other forms of paid content including svod services such as netflix, or by purchasing additional channels through ‘no-contract’ providers such as now tv or talktalk tv store. historically, we have seen that television advertising loses share in an economic downturn, however it recovers quickly when the cycle reverses. the uk television advertising market is extremely difﬁcult to measure as all broadcasters have different deﬁnitions. while online advertising continues to grow, advertisers are challenging its effectiveness and what it actually delivers – we are now starting to see many more questions being asked about unacceptable content, measurability and trust in online media. six nations rugby championships was successfully broadcast on itv main

we have a strong balance sheet and the business continues to be highly cash generative. we launched the sixth weekly episode of coronation street in september, which has further strengthened its performance. our broadcast & online business is robust and evolving to take advantage of the signiﬁcant opportunities for growth. we continued to drive signiﬁcant audiences with our returning brands

changing media environment linear television viewing remains resilient despite signiﬁcant changes in the availability and delivery of content. younger viewers are watching less linear television than they used to, but through delivering great content such as the voice, britain’s got talent, saturday night takeaway and love island, television reaches around 90% of young people each week and remains their dominant choice of media. developing itv’s digital broadcast assets we are further developing our social media assets across our international portfolio of programmes as live television continues to demonstrate a growing relevance as viewers increasingly connect and engage through social media. our programmes generated over 100 million interactions in 2017. strong advertising proposition while political and economic uncertainty has led advertisers to reduce their current spend, television remains one of the most efﬁcient and effective mediums for advertisers to achieve mass simultaneous reach. over the last few years we have also established a number of smaller pay propositions. we also have a general entertainment channel, itv choice, for emerging markets available in over 100 countries. we are trialling itv box ofﬁce, a direct to consumer pay per view offering which currently focuses on boxing and we have a number of live events based around our key brands, which build relationships directly with our viewers. in 2018, we will explore opportunities for britbox on other platforms, include original commissions, and look to roll it out further internationally. we continue to grow our sales to itv, which were up 13% with deliveries including the voice, the voice kids, love island, next of kin, bancroft, fearless, unforgotten, little boy blue and an extra episode of coronation street. 31 strategic report governance financial statements additional information operating and performance review we balance our ﬁnancial exposure through building a portfolio of programmes across genres and across their content life cycle, with successful international dramas offsetting the risk that we will not recover the full deﬁcit on every show. we are seeing increasing demand from ott platforms for original long-form content and secondary rights. we currently have over 250 programme supply agreements in place with online platforms including netflix, amazon and hulu. 5 gold rings is a new entertainment format co-produced by talpa media and possessed (part of itv studios uk). we always seek to recruit and promote internally where possible

acquisition-related costs, including legal and advisory fees on completed deals or signiﬁcant deals that do not complete, are also treated as an expense (under accounting rules) and therefore on a statutory basis form part of our reported results. we consider each project individually to determine whether its size and nature warrant separate disclosure. property costs in 2018, itv will relocate to various properties on a temporary basis while its headquarters are redeveloped. as these costs are acquisition-related, and in line with our treatment of other acquisition- related costs, we consider them to be capital in nature and they do not reflect the underlying trading performance of the group. alternative performance measures 35 strategic report governance financial statements

additional information finance review itv delivered a strong operational performance in a challenging year with ongoing economic and political uncertainty in the uk. operating exceptional items principally relate to acquisition-related expenses, which are mainly performance based employment-linked consideration. the increase in adjusted ﬁnancing costs was offset by lower unrealised foreign exchange and other net ﬁnancial losses. a full reconciliation between statutory and adjusted eps is included within the alternative performance measures section. itv plc had £1.6 billion of distributable reserves at 31 december 2017 available immediately to support the dividend policy. we have further strengthened our international business with a number of other small investments and acquisitions. by basing a signiﬁcant part of the consideration on future performance in this way, not only can we lock in creative talent and ensure our incentives are aligned, but we also reduce our risk by only paying for the actual, not expected, performance delivered over time. however, we exclude them from adjusted proﬁts and adjusted eps as an exceptional item, as in our view, for the reasons set out above, these items are part of capital consideration reflecting how we structure our transactions and do not form part of the core operations. this adjusted leverage measure better reflects how the credit rating agencies look at our balance sheet. we have an open communication culture where information is shared and issues are escalated as appropriate. • the current economic environment is uncertain, which may impact demand for advertising • itv has made signiﬁcant progress in rebalancing the business and 56% of our total revenue comes from sources other than television spot advertising • growing non-nar in areas such as itv studios and online, pay & interactive, remains a key priority of the business • the company has adequate ﬁnancial liquidity and balance sheet flexibility to continue to invest as itv maintains its focus on cash and costs a faster than expected shift to vod or other new technologies, such as internet enabled televisions or online only services, causes a sustained loss of viewing and advertising revenue. • in a fast-changing media environment, there is an increased risk that sub-optimal investment decisions are made • investment opportunities and decisions are made by the relevant board based on their strategic ﬁt and return on investment proﬁle • talent management plans have been developed and reviewed to ensure adequate succession planning across itv • itv continues to embed and strengthen the culture of ‘one itv’ way of working • lessons from recent investments are captured through post-acquisition reviews technology a major incident results in itv being unable to continue with scheduled broadcasting for a sustained period of time. • itv’s broadcast technology chain is complex because it operates in multiple regions and links to many platforms • risk can therefore materialise within itv or with third parties responsible for servicing the broadcast supply chain • with the move out of southbank, itv will be using third-party managed studio facilities for some of its daytime shows • a risk register of broadcast operations, including key outsourced functions, is in place and reviewed on a regular basis • there are business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place in high risk areas to help deliver a rapid and flexible response • major incident scenario testing takes place bi-annually • itv has ongoing modernisation projects to ensure transmission and distribution technologies are ﬁt-for-purpose • itv continues to proactively manage its broadcast chain partners and suppliers to ensure the risk of incidents and regulatory breaches is minimised itv remains heavily reliant on legacy systems, which could potentially restrict the ability to grow the business. these systems and processes may not be appropriate for new non-advertising revenue or rapid international growth. 55 strategic report governance financial statements additional information risks and uncertainties potential risk key drivers mitigating factors and risk direction link to business risk direction technology impact of cyber attack on itv there is a sustained cyber attack causing prolonged system denial or major reputational damage, for example: • the ability to broadcast our channels • the availability of itv hub • itv loses a signiﬁcant volume of personal or sensitive data • corporate systems are compromised • cyber security is an increasing risk as our business develops new revenue streams and direct to consumer propositions • with increasingly sophisticated technology and proliferation of cyber hacking tools, along with increased amounts of company data, the risk of a cyber attack has increased across the world • there are a growing volume of software and hardware vulnerabilities being identiﬁed by technology providers in their own products • further, we are higher risk as a result of being a media company and operating in a public environment • by establishing further internal cyber controls across our devices, apps, networks and servers, we have improved our ability to monitor, detect and respond to cyber threats • we continue to educate our colleagues in order to improve our ability to spot, avoid and report cyber attacks • we have worked with specialist security organisations to implement 24x7 monitoring of our network trafﬁc and during the year they conducted cyber simulation and phishing exercises • we have enhanced our process for the risk assessment of third-party security as our cyber risk extends to our supply chain • there are disaster recovery and incident management plans in place for high-risk areas of the business this risk has increased since last year as our technology becomes more sophisticated. to reflect this, we are developing our training programme initially through leading risk (see case study on page 79) • we are continually reviewing our processes and overall approach to production safety (see case study on page 78) and have built a comprehensive online resource to provide easily accessible production focused health and safety advice and support • we are developing our reporting tools to provide increased oversight of risks across the studios division this risk has increased since last year as itv undertakes more complex productions. • changes in taxation, free movement of capital and transfer pricing regulation the likelihood or extent of any impact is currently unknown, however, we continue to work closely with industry bodies and discuss key issues with key uk government

they could distort the group’s underlying quality of earnings. adjustments to prior periods primarily arise where an outcom e is obtained on certain tax matters, which differs from expectations held when the related provision was made. where the outcome is less favourable than our provision, an additional charge to current year tax will occur. this year, losses arising in higher taxed jurisdictions, which we recognise through deferred tax, give rise to a reconciling benefit. taxation – statement of financial position the table below outlines the deferred tax assets/(liabilities)

group’s target profit to cash ratio on a rolling three year basis is at least 90%. this amount was amortised over the two years to 31 march 2017 and recognised as exceptional expense (see note 2.2).

balances (2016: £1 million). the provision for these insured receivables, net of insurance excess, has been recognised as an exceptional expense (see note 2.2). this accelerated depreciation has been recorded as an exceptional item in 2017. refer to note 2.2 for further details. any su bsequent remeasurement of the put option liability is recognised within finance income or cost. method 3: for business combinations prior to 1 january 2004, goodwill is included at its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under uk gaap at that time less accumulated amortisation up to 31 december 2003. the classification and accounting treatment of business combinations occurring prior to 1 january 2004, the date of transition to ifrs, has not been reconsidered, as permitted under ifrs 1. other intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are th ose that are distinct and can be sold sepa rately or which arise from legal rights. formats straight-line up to 8 years expected future cash flows from those assets existing at the date of acquisition are estimated. financial statements 144 itv plc annual report and accounts 2017 145 determining the fair value of intangible assets arising on acquisition requires judgement. other intangible assets are subject to amortisation and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the amount carried in the statemen t of financial position is less than its recoverable amount. when assessing impairment, the recoverable amount of each cgu is based on value in use calculations. beyond the five year plan, these projections are extrapolated using an estimated nominal long-term growth rate of 1.5% (2016: 2%). a pre-tax market discount rate of 9.5% (2016: 10.4%) has been used in discounting the projected cash flows. a pre-tax market discount rate of 11.4% (2016: 11.7%) has been used in discounting the projected cash flows. a pre-tax market discount rate of 10.8% (2016: 11.6%) has been used in discounting the projected cash flows. tetra media studios sas on 28 february 2017, the group purchased 65.04% of the share capital of tetra media studios sas, a french television production group which specialises in drama, including flagship crime series profilage, now in its seventh series, and political crime thriller les hommes de l’ombre. utv is the market-leading commercial broadcaster in northern ireland, broadcasting itv content alongside high-quality local programming. management concluded that the best prospect of delivering a strong and sustainable irish broadcaster was to bring utv ireland under common ownership with tv3. other fair value adjustments have been made to the opening balance sheet, though none of them are individually significant. financial statements 150 itv plc annual report and accounts 2017 151 3.5 investments keeping it simple the group holds non-controlling interests in a number of different entities. further smaller investments have been made in line with group’s strategy to grow the international content business. schemes can be funded, where regular cash contributions are made by the employer into a fund which is invested, or unfunded, where no regular money or assets are required to be put aside to cover future payments but in some cases security is required. this interest cost is recognised through net financing costs in the income statement (see note 4.4). at 31 december 2017, the scheme’s assets were invested in a diversified portfolio that consisted primarily of equity and debt securities. at 31 december 2017, the scheme’s assets were invested in a diversified portfolio that consisted primarily of equity and debt securities. on this basis, ifric 14 rules do not cause any change in the pension deficit accounting or disclosures. this estimation of fair value is consistent with instruments valued under level 1 in note 4.5. accounting policies borrowings borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs, with subsequent measurement at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. finance leases historically, itv has entered into sale and leaseback agreements in relation to certain programme titles. the majority of trade receivables relate to airtime sales contracts with advertising agencies and advertisers. the group also reviews other significant receivables and will seek to take out credit insurance on an individual basis where appropriate. counterparty limits for cash deposits are largely based upon long-term ratings published by the major credit rating agencies. long-term funding comes from the uk and european capital markets, while any short to medium-term debt requirements are provided through bank credit facilities totalling £930 million (see below). the group mainly employs three types of derivative financial instruments when managing its currency and interest rate risk: • foreign exchange swap contracts are derivative instruments used to hedge income statement translation risk arising from short-term intercompany loans denominated in a foreign currency; • forward foreign exchange contracts are derivative instruments used to hedge transaction risk so they enable the sale or purchase of foreign currency at a known fixed rate on an agreed future date; and • cross-currency interest rate swaps are derivative instruments used to exchange the principal and interest coupons in a debt instrument from one currency to another. accounting policies derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at fair value with the movement recorded in the income statement, except where derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. our rationale for adjustments made to financing costs is set out in the finance review. level 1 fair values are measured using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. interest rate swaps and options are accounted for at their fair value based upon termination prices. a transaction will be classed as share-based compensation where the group receives services from employees and pays for these in shares or similar equity instruments. all transactions with associated undertakings and joint ventures arise in the normal course of business on an arm’s length basis. none of these items are expected to have a material effect on the group’s results or financial position. derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at fair value with the movement recorded in the profit and loss account wi thin net financing costs, except where derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. a transaction will be classed as share-based compensation where the company receives services from employees and pays for these in shares or similar equity instruments. note iii investments in subsidiary undertakings the company operates an intra-group cash pool policy with certain 100% owned uk subsidiaries. the pool applies to bank accounts where there is an unconditional right of set off and involves the daily closing cash position for participating subsidiaries whether positive or negative, being cleared to £nil via daily bank transfers to/from itv plc. none of these items are expected to have a material effect on the company’s results or financial position. key management personnel compensation, on an accounting basis, is as follows: 2017 £m 2016 £m short-term employee benefits 4 3 share-based compensation – 2 4 5 total emoluments and gains on share options received by key management personnel in the year were: 2017 £m 2016 £m emoluments 2 3 gains on exercise of
