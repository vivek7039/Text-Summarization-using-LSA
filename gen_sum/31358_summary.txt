and march and ended the quarter more than 25% up on the same period in 2017. many of these orders were driven by demand for our gatedtalent product which features exclusive integration with filefinder

director” and “general manager”. imagine if this database included detailed, private information on those executives – including biographical, aspirational and often compensation data. virtually any

of recruiter subscription and transaction fees for connecting with executives. there is a continuing move away from the upfront license model towards our cloud delivery services. they say that we provide them with: stability, ﬂexibility and functionality easy access to their data rapid deployment ongoing development ensures upgrade path for clients our large client base means that we do not depend on a small number of clients. 2017 saw some major developments in the division including: • development of tempninja – a new mobile companion app allowing candidates to view and accept temporary jobs, update their availability and chat directly with recruiters using voyager’s popular vdq! agile project methodology so stakeholders have regular visibility and influence on what is

accountability the board meets at least four times each year and has adopted a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for decision by it, thus ensuring that it exercises control over appropriate strategic, financial, operational and compliance issues. there is an established framework of internal controls set out and approved by the executive management. the independent non-executive directors have letters of appointment providing fixed three-year service periods, which may be terminated by giving six months’ notice. we identified five centrally controlled components (either those operations required to have individual audit opinions issued under the companies act 2006, or those that contributed greater than 15% of group revenue), which, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information. bdo network component auditors were engaged to perform specific audit procedures on the operations located in australia. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. we also agreed to report differences below these thresholds that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. we identified five centrally controlled components as significant, and have audited these for group reporting purposes. strategic report financial statements overview governance dillistone group plc - annual report and accounts 2017 30 consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year ended 31 december

indicators at each accounting period end. see note 13. in addition, management use a best estimate to determine the amount of directors’ costs that are capitalised. the directors use acknowledged approaches eg: relief from royalty method, capital asset pricing model, excess earnings valuation method but these are reliant upon certain judgements and assumptions which they determine are reasonable by reference to companies in similar industries. see ‘capitalisation and amortisation of internal development expenditure’ in significant estimates above for further details. perpetual licence fee revenues are recognised on practical acceptance of the software, when all obligations have been substantially completed. to the extent that payments have been received in advance for such services these amounts are recognised as deferred income. www.dillistonegroup.com 37 1. accounting policies (continued) product support, hosting and saas revenues from support, hosting or saas agreements are recognised over the period to which they relate but only after practical acceptance of the software, as defined above, has been received. it is an equity settled share-based compensation plan (share options) for remuneration of its employees. all employee services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based compensation are measured at their fair values. all equity-settled share-based compensation is ultimately recognised as an expense in the profit or loss with a corresponding credit to share based payment reserve, net of deferred tax where applicable. no adjustment to expenses recognised in prior periods is made if fewer share options ultimately are exercised than originally estimated. 1.10 impairment testing of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment for impairment assessment purposes, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash generating units). cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually. with the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. development costs that do not meet the requirements for capitalisation are written off to profit and loss as incurred. the impairment loss estimate is then based on recent historical counterparty default rates and current economic conditions. the group’s other ‘financial liabilities measured at amortised cost’ comprise trade payables, intercompany trading balances (in relation to company accounts), bank loans and accruals. deferred tax on temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. under ifrs 15, licences sold with elective support contracts are separate performance obligations and continue to be recognised at a point in time. if cashflows reduced by more than 7% or the discount rate increased to 16.5% an impairment would be required. performance conditions are associated with the ltip options granted on 14 july 2015, 29 june 2016 and 9 november 2017. the company launched its first saye scheme in 2016 with a second issue in 2017.

business transactions. consequently, the group does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying exposure. www.dillistonegroup.com directors m d love –
