Dillistone Systems specialises in the supply of software and services into executive level recruitment teams. Recurring revenues for 2017 were at record levels and, despite the ongoing investment in product development, cash reserves have held up well. FileFinder is an executive search database, CRM system, research tool, report writer and project management solution all rolled into one. PRODUCTS GatedTalent is a private network allowing executives to share confidential data with executive recruiters. With automation at its heart, it meets the demands of flexibility and functionality required by these recruitment firms. evolve™ has been designed to deliver an effective workflow solution for all sizes and types of recruitment business. Voyager Bureau enables bureaus to subcontract back-office operations for multiple client recruitment companies on a single platform. The loan note has a 3-year duration but with various rights for early conversion or repayment. Dividends In view of the fund raising carried out to develop GatedTalent, we did not pay an interim dividend. Many of these orders were driven by demand for our GatedTalent product which features exclusive integration with FileFinder Anywhere. We continue to see strong demand for the platform, with more than 160 firms having now signed contracts. Currently, the three most common Job Titles for our Executives are “CEO”, “Managing Director” and “General Manager”. Imagine if this database included detailed, private information on those executives – including biographical, aspirational and often compensation data. Virtually any executive recruiter storing information covered by the GDPR will need to go through a process of confirming and proving that their data is legal. Where KPIs are not being met, the Board considers ways in which performance could be improved. Dillistone Systems and Voyager Software are our established businesses, with GatedTalent launched in the second half of 2017. This Division generates revenue based on a combination of recruiter subscription and transaction fees for connecting with executives. There is a continuing move away from the upfront license model towards our cloud delivery services. They say that we provide them with: Stability, ﬂexibility and functionality Easy access to their data Rapid deployment Ongoing development ensures upgrade path for clients Our large client base means that we do not depend on a small number of clients. 2017 saw some major developments in the Division including: • Development of TempNinja – A new mobile companion app allowing candidates to view and accept temporary jobs, update their availability and chat directly with recruiters using Voyager’s popular VDQ! Agile project methodology so stakeholders have regular visibility and influence on what is being developed. The businesses can easily lose market share if its products are not well regarded either from being “out of date” or “buggy”. The Group has strong customer relationships and uses account management to keep in touch with clients.

MIKE LOVE 69 NON-EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN JASON STARR 46 CHIEF EXECUTIVE RORY HOWARD 50 OPERATIONS DIRECTOR ALEX JAMES 45 PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR www.dillistonegroup.com 17 GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT Alistair started his career at Richmond Theatre in 1994, working in both the marketing department and box office. Accountability The Board meets at least four times each year and has adopted a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for decision by it, thus ensuring that it exercises control over appropriate strategic, financial, operational and compliance issues. There is an established framework of internal controls set out and approved by the executive management. The independent Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment providing fixed three-year service periods, which may be terminated by giving six months’ notice. We identified five centrally controlled components (either those operations required to have individual audit opinions issued under the Companies Act 2006, or those that contributed greater than 15% of group revenue), which, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information. BDO network component auditors were engaged to perform specific audit procedures on the operations located in Australia. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We also agreed to report differences below these thresholds that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We identified five centrally controlled components as significant, and have audited these for group reporting purposes.

The carrying value of capitalised development is reviewed for impairment indicators at each accounting period end. In addition, management use a best estimate to determine the amount of Directors’ costs that are capitalised. The Directors use acknowledged approaches eg: relief from royalty method, capital asset pricing model, excess earnings valuation method but these are reliant upon certain judgements and assumptions which they determine are reasonable by reference to companies in similar industries. See ‘Capitalisation and amortisation of internal development expenditure’ in Significant estimates above for further details. Perpetual licence fee revenues are recognised on practical acceptance of the software, when all obligations have been substantially completed. To the extent that payments have been received in advance for such services these amounts are recognised as deferred income. Accounting policies (continued) Product support, hosting and SaaS Revenues from support, hosting or SaaS agreements are recognised over the period to which they relate but only after practical acceptance of the software, as defined above, has been received. It is an equity settled share-based compensation plan (share options) for remuneration of its employees. All employee services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based compensation are measured at their fair values. All equity-settled share-based compensation is ultimately recognised as an expense in the profit or loss with a corresponding credit to share based payment reserve, net of deferred tax where applicable. No adjustment to expenses recognised in prior periods is made if fewer share options ultimately are exercised than originally estimated. Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. Development costs that do not meet the requirements for capitalisation are written off to profit and loss as incurred. The impairment loss estimate is then based on recent historical counterparty default rates and current economic conditions. The Group’s other ‘financial liabilities measured at amortised cost’ comprise trade payables, intercompany trading balances (in relation to Company accounts), bank loans and accruals. Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. IFRS 15 – Revenue from customer contracts This standard comes into effect for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Under IFRS 15, licences sold with elective support contracts are separate performance obligations and continue to be recognised at a point in time. IFRS 16 – Leases This standard comes into effect for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Other intangible assets (continued) Acquisition intangibles can be summarised as follows: Brand £’000 Developed technology £’000 Brand and IP £’000 Contractual and non-contractual relationship £’000 Total £’000 NBV At 1 January 2017 126 229 522 1,795 2,672 Amortisation (13) (53) (41) (731) (838) At 31 December 2017 113 176 481 1,064 1,834 Intangible assets under development are reviewed each reporting period for impairment prior to amortisation. If cashflows reduced by more than 7% or the discount rate increased to 16.5% an impairment would be required. The inputs into the model were as follows: Date of grant Number granted Share price on issue date Exercise price Expected volatility Vesting period Leaver rate over vesting period Risk-free rate Expected dividend yield 9 November 2017 LTIP/EMI 845,000 58p 58p 30% 3.3 years 0% 1.00% 2.0% 9 November 2017 EMI 90,000 58p 58p 30% 3.3 years 10% 1.00% 2.0% 9 November 2017 Sharesave 131,713 58p 52.2p 30% 3.3 years 10% 1.00% 2.0% Expected volatility takes into account historic volatility of the share price and its current trend. The fair value of all options granted is shown as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. Treasury dealings such as investments and foreign exchange are conducted only to support underlying business transactions. Consequently, the Group does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying exposure. Control No individual Shareholder, or Shareholders acting in concert, hold more than 50% of voting shares, and accordingly there is not considered to be an ‘ultimate controlling party’. In addition, Dr Love’s fees of £35,000 are paid to Pond Associates LLP, a business owned by him. www.dillistonegroup.com Directors M D Love – Non-Executive Chairman G R Fearnley – Non-Executive Director J S Starr – Chief Executive R Howard – Operations Director A D James – Product Development Director J P Pomeroy – Group Finance Director A F Milne – MD – Dillistone Systems Secretary J P Pomeroy Company number 4578125 Registered office 50 Leman St London E1 8HQ Independent auditor BDO LLP 55 Baker Street London W1U 7EU Principal bankers HSBC Bank Plc Basingstoke Commercial Centre 8 London Street Basingstoke RG21 7NU Solicitors Blake Morgan LLP Apex Plaza Forbury Road Reading RG1 1AX Nominated adviser WH Ireland Limited 24 Martin Lane London EC4R 0DR Broker WH Ireland Limited 24 Martin Lane London EC4R 0DR Registrars Link Assets Services The Registry 34 Beckenham Road Beckenham Kent BR3 4TU DIRECTORS AND ADVISERS STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE 50 Leman Street London E1 8HQ T: +44 (0)20 7749 6100 www.dillistonegroup.com Dillistone Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017
