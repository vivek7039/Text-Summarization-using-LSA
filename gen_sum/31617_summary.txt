non-solicitation of and non- dealing with clients; non-interference with suppliers or contractors and non-solicitation of colleagues. unless determined otherwise, an executive director will be treated as a good leaver in cases where their employment ends due to death, injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy, retirement, or the company being transferred out of the cybg group and any other reason (except for dishonesty, fraud, misconduct or dismissal). at each vesting date the resultant number of shares (post taxation) will be subject to a twelve-month retention period. awards will vest a minimum of three years after being awarded, or longer where required by the pra remuneration code. if existing colleagues become disabled, every effort is made to retain them within the workforce wherever reasonable and practicable. the group has share schemes under which change of control may apply, albeit this is not considered to be significant. this aligns with the behavioural expectations for all colleagues which form a core part of our performance management approach. the group’s credit portfolios will continue to be monitored closely with appetite adjusted where appropriate and risk sensitivity analysis conducted on an ongoing basis. this credit risk is managed as part of the customers overall exposure together with potential exposures from market movements. master netting arrangements do not generally result in an offset of balance sheet assets and liabilities, as transactions are usually settled on a gross basis. this system assigns an indication of the pd for each customer and can be broadly mapped to external agencies rating scales. all lending activities are supported by an appropriate form of valuation using either professional or indexed (subject to policy rules and confidence levels) valuations. collateral for the majority of commercial loans comprises first legal charges over freehold or long leasehold property (including formal companies house registration where appropriate). corporates is the largest sector utilising other risk mitigation techniques, with all three methods utilised dependent on credit quality. customers are actively supported and referred to free money advice agencies when they have multiple credit facilities, including those at other lenders, that require restructuring. when all other avenues of resolution including forbearance have been explored, the group will take steps to repossess and sell underlying collateral. credit risk categorisation description neither past due nor impaired loans that are not in arrears and where there is no objective evidence of impairment.
