recent years and is above the boe’s target of 2.0%. the pra has also finalised its rules on ensuring banks’ critical shared services are able to continue operating while in resolution. this aligns with the behavioural expectations for all colleagues which form a core part of our performance management approach. control is exercised through a clearly defined delegation of authority, with communication and escalation channels throughout the group. the board or executive risk committee approves all material changes to regulatory policy and protocols. how this risk is managed – the group has a conduct framework, with supporting target outcomes and operating principles. 20 cybg plc annual report and accounts 2017 studio b opens we opened our innovation lab in london during april. as b develops, further features will become available for customers in the future including loans and mortgages. overall customer deposit balances including current accounts increased by 2.5% or £0.7bn in the year as part of a balanced approach to funding our loan growth. we continue to have a diverse wholesale funding strategy which includes balances secured on our high-quality mortgage book and deposits with other banks. as at 30 september 2017, we had 164,000 retail mortgage accounts, diversified across multiple regions in the uk. left: in the b app, customers can set up and name ‘savings pots’ making it easier to put money aside regularly. other b smart tools, such as the sweep facility and budgets, have also been designed to help make saving simpler. successful irb accreditation should enable cybg to be more competitive in other areas of the mortgage market, while maintaining a healthy risk position. the fintech partnership we have launched will provide an innovative online lending facility for our small business customers who will benefit from faster decision making and fulfilment of funds, through an easy to use online application. we remain comfortable with the asset quality of our unsecured lending book and will continue to offer personal unsecured lending to customers in a manner reflecting our risk appetite and the emerging economic environment. it’s therefore vital that we are supporting businesses offering the right support and finance to ensure their success. we are striving to build a high-performing culture where colleagues can use their initiative, act with greater autonomy, and connect with each other to deliver the right customer-focused outcomes, regardless of where they work or what they do across the group. we also understand that customers can become vulnerable at any point in their lives and as a result may need our support. the best of these concepts are taken forward into full development and deployment across our channels. development of b and the ib platform b is our digital first brand, offering customers a current account, savings account, credit card and app that together help customers to take effortless control of their money. throughout 2017 a range of b and ib developments have been implemented, responding directly to customer feedback. this site is increasingly used for two-way engagement through the use of polls, discussion threads and invitations to get involved in activities. we have also significantly increased our participation in pride glasgow, connecting campaigning, social responsibility and commercial opportunity. through this audit we review the gender distribution of performance, base pay, allowances and bonuses paid to our staff. our gender pay gap is largely driven by the fact that we have more men than women in senior roles. this is expressed through a series of community partnerships and initiatives that deliver our ‘we care about here’ ethos. an extra special community event took place at rzss’ edinburgh zoo on father’s day in june, when over 400 guests from five different scottish charities visited the zoo and took part in the second annual wild about scotland day. cybg

accounts 2017 38 financial results overview of group results our fy2017 results reflect a year of strong financial performance as we have delivered on our strategic priorities in a period of challenging market and economic conditions. we are firmly focused on building a solid base for delivering sustainable returns to our shareholders. active management of customer deposits customer deposits increased year on year as we saw 5.3% growth in current account balances, with strong recruitment of business current accounts and substantial growth in b savings balances. this growth more than offset the managed reduction in volumes of variable rate savings accounts as we rationalised and repriced our isa portfolio. it is likely that we will see further price pressure in the mortgage and unsecured personal loan markets. we expect to see modest pressure on net interest margin and our nim guidance for fy2018 is 220bps. variable rate loans continue to reduce as although these products remain on sale, they are not actively promoted or targeted. our current account plus product also contributed growth of £140m with the average case size offsetting a declining stock balance. while stock levels across the book fell overall, new account openings were in line with our strategy to grow sustainably in a way that recruits the right profile of customer with whom we have an opportunity to build a long-term relationship. the group has diversified by investing in a broader range of supranational and covered bond issuances. previously, liquidity was mainly held in boe accounts, earning base rate, alongside holdings of uk sovereign bonds (gilts). non-interest income non-interest income reduced by £11m (6.0%), largely driven by a reduction in fees and commission income, principally in relation to insurance revenues from off-sale products which have continued to unwind, lower account fees on the signature current account and lower home insurance profit share due to a higher level of claims, cybg plc annual report and accounts 2017 45 strategic report governance financial results risk report financial statements additional information cybg plc annual

customer-focused culture. this year the board undertook its first externally facilitated performance evaluation since becoming a listed company. his breadth of experience, credibility with key

transactional activity, and providing security for the group’s issuance of scottish bank notes. accordingly, this information is not relied upon by the group in its management of interest rate risk. the key features of the internal interest rate risk management model are: – the use of basis point sensitivity analysis; – var and ear are measured on a statistical basis: 99% confidence level with appropriate holding periods depending on varying risk types: – historical simulation approach utilising instantaneous interest rate shocks including parallel rate movements and twists in the yield curve to explore risks around exposures to movements in short- or long-term interest rates; – static balance sheet (i.e. any new business is assumed to be matched, hedged or subject to immediate repricing); – investment term for capital is modelled with a benchmark term agreed by alco; – investment term for core non-interest bearing assets and liabilities is modelled on a behavioural basis with a benchmark term agreed by alco; and – assumptions covering the behavioural life of products and customer behaviour for optionality are reviewed and approved by alco. mitigation measures market risks are overseen by alco with delegation for day-to-day management given to treasury. 2017 (unaudited) overnight £m 3 months or less £m 3 to 12 months £m 1 to 5 years £m over 5 years £m non-

additional information pension risk the group operates a defined benefit (db) pension scheme, the yorkshire and clydesdale bank pension scheme (the scheme). clydesdale bank plc is the scheme’s principal employer and there are no other participating employers. therefore, the ias 19 valuation can move adversely because of low rates and narrowing credit spreads. mitigation measures – the group has a regulatory engagement policy designed to ensure an open and cooperative relationship is maintained with regulators at all times, ensuring that all key interactions with regulators are managed, recorded and escalated as appropriate. there continues to be a great deal of uncertainty and significant judgement is required in determining the quantum of conduct risk-related liabilities with note 3.14 reflecting the group’s current position in relation to redress provisions for ppi, interest rate hedging products (irhps) and other smaller historic conduct matters. operational risk (including people risks) is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people strategies and systems or from external events including, for example, the prospect of a cyber attack. responsibilities are set out in a structured operational risk framework that seeks to identify, assess, mitigate, monitor, and report the operational risks and events that could impact the achievement of business objectives or impact core business processes. the group has identified, assessed and is currently monitoring all key operational risks across the above noted categories, including undertaking an assessment of control effectiveness, monitoring trends in key risk indicators and escalating events, in accordance with policy requirements. management then document a proposed response to identify how the scenarios would be managed and monitored if they occurred. all other customers who are not prescribed shall be subject to controls commensurate with their risk. mitigation measures risk assessments against the four financial crime policy standards take place on an annual basis. account opening pass rates are overseen as part of a regular process undertaken by financial crime risk and reported monthly. screening customers for sanctions or politically exposed persons and transaction monitoring is carried out by financial crime risk. as such, income growth and margin expectations over the group’s planning horizon are balanced, highlighting that this environment contributes to significant business risk, the risk that group net income fails to grow as targeted, or falls. mitigation measures cybg was divested from nab and listed in february 2016, but strategic changes necessary for success when independent were assessed over a prolonged prior period. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. in march 2017, the fca published policy statement 17/3 containing its final rules and guidance on ppi complaints. the effects of these judgements are material, so this was considered to be a significant audit risk. the directors’ best estimate for future ppi claims and associated costs involved probability weighting a number of possible outcomes. we have set performance materiality at this percentage due to our previous experience as auditors of the group, from which we concluded that there is a lower expectation of material financial statement inaccuracies due to the effective control environment and only minor audit differences resulting from our prior and current year work. – based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identified in the paragraphs above. other matters we are required to address: – we were appointed as cybg plc’s external auditor and signed an engagement letter on 14 january 2016, prior to cybg plc

‘financial instruments: disclosures’; ias 19: ‘employee benefits’; and ias 34: ‘interim financial reporting’. the pronouncements, while relevant to the group, are not anticipated to have a material impact and include: – amendments to ias 12: ‘recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses’ (1) , issued in january 2016 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 january 2017. the amendments clarify the requirements on the recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses; – amendments to ias 7: ‘disclosure initiative’ (1) , issued in january 2016 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 january 2017. the amendments to ias 7: ‘statement of cash flows’ require disclosures that enable users of the financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from an entity’s financing activities; – amendments to ifrs 2: ‘classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions’ (2) , issued in june 2016 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 january 2017. the amendments provide guidance on the effects of vesting and non-vesting conditions on the measurement of cash-settled share-based payments; classification of share-based payments with a net settlement feature for withholding tax obligations; and accounting for modifications to a share-based payment that change the classification from cash-settled to equity-settled; – amendments to ifrs 9: ‘prepayment features with negative compensation’ (2) , issued in october 2017 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 january 2019. the amendments allow companies to measure particular prepayable financial assets with so-called negative compensation at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income if a specified condition is met, instead of at fair value through profit or loss; – ‘annual improvements to ifrs standards 2014-2016 cycle’ (2) , issued december 2016 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 january 2017 or 1 january 2018. the iasb has made amendments to the following standards: ifrs 12: ‘disclosure of interests in other entities’ (clarification of the scope of the standard – effective 1 january 2017), and ias 28: ‘investments in associates and joint ventures’ (measuring an associate or joint venture at fair value – effective 1 january 2018); – ifric interpretation 22: ‘foreign currency transactions and advance consideration’ (2) , issued december 2016 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 january 2018. the new interpretation provides requirements on which exchange rate to use in reporting foreign currency transactions (such as revenue transactions) when payment is made or received in advance; and – ifric interpretation 23: ‘uncertainty over income tax treatments’ (2) , issued june 2017 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 january 2019. the new interpretation applies to any situation in which there is uncertainty as to whether an income tax treatment is acceptable under tax law and is not limited to actual ongoing disputes. the option to designate a financial asset at fvtpl in ias 39 is largely retained in ifrs 9, with ifrs 9 also affording a further option to designate certain equity instruments at fvoci instead of accounting for these as fvtpl. for those revenues that are in scope (typically fees and other commissions), the group continues to assess the related performance obligations to identify any fees or other commissions that may require a change in recognition. for a breakdown of the items included in this category, refer to ‘measuring financial performance – glossary’. the group recognises bonus costs where it has a present obligation that can be reliably measured. the group also cash flow hedges its foreign currency exposure on material, highly probable non-gbp denominated transactions. they are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the

assets carried at amortised cost at each reporting date the group assesses if there is objective evidence of impairment on a financial asset or group of financial assets due to one or more loss events that occurred after initial recognition but prior to the balance sheet date. if it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment (‘collective provisions’). these include judgements that reflect elements which are not sufficiently sensitive to the current economic conditions, model risk reserves that are held to cover against a range of potential model limitations, and judgements made in respect of potential recoveries for specific provisions which also involve customer and economic specific conditions. cybg plc annual report and accounts 2017 212 financial

result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be necessary to settle the obligation, and the obligation can be reliably estimated. there are similar uncertainties and judgements for other conduct risk related matters, however the level of liability is materially lower. as such, the factors discussed above mean there is a risk that existing provisions for ppi

asset or liability; – level 2 fair value measurements – inputs other than quoted prices within level 1 that are observable for the financial asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and – level 3 fair value measurements – inputs for the financial asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). contractual
