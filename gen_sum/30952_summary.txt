This approach – sometimes known as the ‘razor/razorblade’ model – permits a  percentage of organic growth each year. The EKF Central Laboratory range includes clinical reagents and centrifuges which are manufactured  at premises near San Antonio, Texas. To approach these markets EKF has two distinct strategies: firstly, OEM partnerships with  international distributor/manufacturers such as Fresenius Kabi; and secondly agreements with  smaller distributors who are focused on the public health opportunities within their own countries. EKF believes that this portfolio can provide it with a competitive advantage to grow its market  share. In  2017 EKF sold more than 22 million tests for the DiaSpect Tm range, and 19 million tests for  Hemo Control and HemoPoint® H2 Hemo Control TM • Uses ‘gold standard’  methodology (reagent  filled microcuvettes) • Data management  capability; provides a  hematocrit calculation • Proven, robust analyser  sold worldwide DiaSpect Tm • Handheld analyser utilising  reagentless methodology • Benefits of speed to result  (one second), and shelf- life of microcuvettes • Connectivity to a mobile  phone application now  available DiaSpect Hemoglobin T Low • Tests serum, plasma,  aqueous solutions or  stored erythrocytes • Estimates the degree   of hemolysis • Results in less than   two seconds • Reagent-free  microcuvettes UltraCrit TM • Hematocrit analyser  using unique ultrasound  technology • Strong presence in US  blood banking sector HemataStat II TM • Laboratory hematocrit  centrifuge and analyser • Processes multiple  samples  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc | Annual Report 2017  5 1.0 Strategic Review Point-of-Care: Diabetes Care Product Portfolio EKF’s Diabetes Care range aims to provide affordable, easy-to-use technology that reduces the  costs of long-term healthcare of the diabetic and pre-diabetic population. Quo-Lab® A1c • HbA1c testing (Glycated  Hemoglobin) • Results in four minutes  using a unique  methodology • Semi-automated analyser  aimed at cost-sensitive  markets Quo-Test® A1c • HbA1c testing (Glycated  Hemoglobin) • Same methodology  as Quo-Lab but fully  automated • Simple operation requires  minimal training 6 Annual Report 2017  |  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc 1.0 Strategic Review Point-of-Care: Maternal & Women’s Health Product Portfolio Maternal and Women’s Health focuses primarily on diagnostics used to address conditions and  complications associated with pregnancy and child birth. Lactate Scout+ has historically been sold into sports medicine, specifically endurance activities  such as cross-country skiing, cycling and rowing. This market also contributes significantly to  Biosen revenues in which the lactate testing function is used in the preparation of elite squads of  athletes such as Premier League and Budesliga football teams and Olympians. During this time it has built a global customer base for its  clinical chemistry reagents that can be used on most open-channel analyser platforms. The acquisition of Separation Technology Inc. provided EKF with a third element to its central  laboratory offering. Altair TM  240 • Automated bench-top  analyser • Runs up to 400 tests per  hour and can handle up to  43 different reagents • Calibrated to run the  Stanbio Chemistry range  of reagents Beta-Hydroxybutyrate • Liquid reagent for the  early detection of ketosis • Primarily sold in USA  through national  distribution networks Procalcitonin • Liquid reagent for the  detection of sepsis • Targeted at certain  European markets Glycated Serum Protein • 2-3 week indicator of  average blood glucose • Complementary to HbA1c  in diagnosis and screening  of diabetes 8 Annual Report 2017  |  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc 1.0 Strategic Review Chairman’s Statement I am delighted to present results which show  continued good progress with revenues,  earnings, and net cash all significantly improved  compared with the previous year. While we are not currently planning further  closures, our efforts to improve efficiency and  therefore reduce costs continue. sTNFR1/2 (Soluble  Tumour Necrosis Factor Receptors 1 and  2) are novel biomarkers used in combination  with artificial intelligence to identify which  diabetes patients are at the highest risk of  progressive Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD)  potentially leading to End Stage Renal Disease  (ESRD). Non-executive Directors  have continued to waive their standard  director’s fees, however as each has performed  considerable amounts of work for the Group in  addition to their duties as directors, they have  been paid an appropriate bonus. Operations We have succeeded in our aim for 2017 of  driving the existing business and continuing  to reduce cost. We  have continued to promote our Altair 240  analyser through an increasing portfolio of  specialist distributors. New and updated products We have concentrated in 2017 on widening  the range of regulatory approvals for our  existing product ranges. R&D costs included in  administration expenses were £2.2m, with a  further £0.7m being capitalised as an intangible  cost. We continue to consider that adjusted  earnings before interest, tax, depreciation  and amortisation, share-based payments  and exceptional items (adjusted EBITDA) is  a better measure of progress because the  Board believes it gives clearer comparability  of operating performance between periods. While results so far have been  encouraging, and we have seen inventory levels  reduce by over 30% since December 2015,  despite higher revenue, our ambition remains  to reduce our holdings further, while ensuring  production and sales run efficiently. Richard Evans  Finance Director and Chief Operating Officer 14 March 2018  12 Annual Report 2017  |  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc 1.0 Strategic Review Board of Directors Executive Directors Julian Baines MBE Chief Executive Officer (aged 53) Julian was Group CEO of BBI where he undertook a management buyout in 2000, a flotation  on AIM in 2004 and was responsible for selling the business to Alere Inc. (now part of Abbott  Laboratories) in 2008 for circa £85 million. He has also held positions at Fisher Scientific, TRW Seat  Belt Systems, Maxtor Corporation, United Technologies Carrier and Abbott Diagnostics GmbH in  Germany. This risk information is  combined with a consolidated view of the  business area risks. This risk is minimised by ensuring that a  minimum of two individuals manage every  relationship with key customers and suppliers. Political risk A significant proportion of the Group’s revenues  are accounted for by agreements in developing  countries. The Group seeks  to manage this risk by monitoring events and  taking mitigating actions if necessary. The Group seeks to mitigate this risk by  securing patent registration protection for  its products, maintaining confidentiality  agreements regarding the Group’s know-how  and technology, monitoring technological  developments and by selecting leading  businesses in their respective fields as  distribution partners capable of addressing  significant competition, should it arise. Reimbursement levels There is no guarantee that the Group may be  able to sell its products or services profitably  if the reimbursement level from third party  payers, including government and private  health insurers, is unavailable or limited. This risk is mitigated  by the use of robust security measures, staff  training, and back-up systems. EKF’s strategy is to create a world class IVD  business through organic growth. The Group  has an existing portfolio of technologies which  produce revenues and will add technologies  which are strategically appropriate to this  portfolio should they become available and  providing the additions make economic sense. The Board has determined that Adam Reynolds  is independent in character and judgement and that there are no relationships or circumstances  which could materially affect or interfere with the exercise of his independent judgement. Matters reserved for Board decisions include strategic long-term objectives and  capital structure of major transactions. It also has authority to grant options under the  Company’s Executive Share Option Scheme. This  report sets out the Group policy on Directors’ remuneration, including emoluments, benefits and  other share-based awards made to each Director. We concur with management’s assertion that no  further impairment charge is required in respect of  goodwill and intangible assets but identified that  if management is unable achieve planned results,  this could reasonably be expected to give rise to  an impairment in the future. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a  guarantee as to the group’s and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
