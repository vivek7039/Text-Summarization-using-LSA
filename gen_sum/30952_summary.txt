chief executive’s review it is pleasing to be able to report a strong set of results for 2017. in particular, cash generation has once again been very strong, with net cash growing from £2.2m to £7.0m during the year, despite spending £1.4m on capital expenditure and £1.5m on the cancellation of share options. operations we have succeeded in our aim for 2017 of driving the existing business and continuing to reduce cost. new and updated products we have concentrated in 2017 on widening the range of regulatory approvals for our existing product ranges. r&d costs included in administration expenses were £2.2m, with a further £0.7m being capitalised as an intangible cost. we continue to consider that adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, share-based payments and exceptional items (adjusted ebitda) is a better measure of progress because the board believes it gives clearer comparability of operating performance between periods. while results so far have been encouraging, and we have seen inventory levels reduce by over 30% since december 2015, despite higher revenue, our ambition remains to reduce our holdings further, while ensuring production and sales run efficiently. richard evans finance director and chief operating officer 14 march 2018 12 annual report 2017 | ekf diagnostics holdings plc 1.0 strategic review board of
