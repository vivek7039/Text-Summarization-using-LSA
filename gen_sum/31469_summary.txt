It is also expected to help revitalise small local businesses and the commercial fishing industry, by encouraging healthy marine life. In June 2017, G4S was selected as a constituent company of the FTSE4Good Index, recognising our strong commitment to social responsibility and sustainable business practices. As a result, road-traffic accidents and criminal attacks are inherent risks we face in delivering some of our services. Market Environment The global demand outlook for security services remains positive as we outline in more detail on pages 8 and 9. Industry research data indicates that our addressable market for smart safes and recycling solutions is around £20bn-25bn per annum b . • At the end of December 2017 we had over 19,500 (2016: 14,600) cash technology installations deployed in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa. This breadth provides us with a strong understanding and clear visibility of how security trends are evolving across the world. We have around 570,000 colleagues, whose unique skills and shared values are focused on delivering high-quality service to our many thousands of customers. How we engage • Relationship management • c150,000 customers • Bidding processes • Customer service • Net promoter score Key stakeholders Our employees touch the lives of others every day, providing crucial services to help keep society safe and secure. We run a formal exercise every two years to identify and prioritise our material CSR issues (see page 83). This was 25% fewer than the previous year, but detailed analysis shows that employee grievances are being reported and handled more effectively via other channels. During 2017, we have: • Developed and implemented a human rights awareness programme for senior managers, beginning with the Group Internal Audit department. This is particularly the case in developed markets, where higher wages and lower hardware costs have made technology solutions more cost-effective.

Previously, Localiza car-rental branches had a cleaning team for each branch, no matter the size or opening hours, which resulted in high costs and complex management. Following an in-depth study by the G4S facilities management business in Brazil, we won a new contract which uses mobile cleaning teams, reducing Localiza costs by 20%, increasing efficiency, and ensuring they maintain high-quality standards of cleaning which are recognised as part of Localiza’s service excellence. This rate of revenue growth was constrained as we continued to apply commercial discipline in those market locations facing tight labour conditions. This is combined with a top-down review from group functional leaders, to ensure that the risks captured are complete and appropriately assessed. A thorough review is conducted as part of the annual planning process with updates made in senior management team meetings and trading reviews. Business leaders take responsibility for leading safety performance and putting H&S at the forefront of their day-to-day activities. We also deliver regional leadership programmes to nurture talented individuals early in their careers, and help develop them into more senior roles as they move through the organisation. Risk mitigation During 2017 we updated our strict thresholds for the approval of major bids, involving detailed legal review and senior management oversight. We will also embed into the SalesForce opportunity management tool our updated approval requirements to make compliance and monitoring effective. Customer satisfaction reviews will guide how we deliver integrated solutions to existing and potential customers across all businesses. Additionally, we face the risk of disruption to service delivery from system failures, incomplete backup routines, inadequate business continuity and disaster recovery plans. Innovative security-defence products such as cash-box tracking, vehicle protection foam and protective boxes are used in a number of businesses. Paul Spence, who was already a member of the Audit Committee, served as interim chair with effect from 20 January. Chief executive of SELEX Galileo for four years prior to joining United Utilities Group plc in 2011 as CEO. In addition, the board visited a customer location at which integrated security solutions are provided, meeting both G4S personnel and customers. Together with the UK Home Office, an action plan was agreed and a joint working party created to oversee its implementation. Accordingly with effect from 20 January 2017, Paul Spence was appointed as chairman of the Audit Committee and Winnie Fok became a member. Some of those contracts may evolve to become loss-making, such that net unavoidable losses are expected over their life. This requires determining the net present value of estimated future losses in order to calculate an appropriate onerous contract provision. When restrictions apply to direct share ownership, the Group also exercises influence or control through arrangements, including shareholder agreements. CMA Order Compliance The G4S Group audit was put out to tender in 2014, following which PwC were appointed with effect from 2015. Therefore, no substantive changes were made to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy submitted for shareholders’ approval at our AGM last May. It was approved by shareholders at the company’s annual general meeting held on 25 May 2017 with 97.26% of all votes cast in favour.

The basic fee covers committee membership and each NED is expected to participate in one or more board committees. Neither Ashley Almanza nor Tim Weller will be eligible for bonus accrual during any period of garden leave. Remuneration of employees globally will depend on local regulation and practice, taking any collective bargaining agreements into account, where they exist. In 2018, we will continue to implement energy efficiency strategies with the aim of reducing carbon intensity by at least 3.5% per annum. In 2017, we also introduced new on-line newsletters for our senior managers containing information on contract wins, projects and market developments. The newsletters showcase examples of security innovations and help businesses struggling with similar challenges to become early adopters building on new ideas rather than recreating them. We performed scanning analytics on contract margins and investigated unusual or unexpected trends to check inclusion of all relevant contracts in management’s assessment. We assessed each of the key assumptions used in management’s forecasts to identify and quantify onerous contract provisions. Furthermore, we considered whether amounts included as specific items related to current year trading and might be more appropriately reflected in the underlying results. We identified 73 country component units that, in our view, required a full scope audit due to their size or risk characteristics. We took this measure into account in determining our materiality, except that we did not adjust profit before tax to add back amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets and finance income and expense as in our view these are recurring items which do not introduce volatility to the Group’s earnings. In general, provisions recognised for future losses on onerous contracts are charged to the Consolidated income statement within Adjusted PBITA. The directors review acquisition-related intangible assets on an on-going basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value. In particular, estimation is required in assessing future expected revenue and costs on such contracts, including: • determining the expected impact of any profit improvement plans where sufficient evidence exists of benefits being delivered by those plans; and • determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to material future cash flows. In all cases it is assumed that the local tax authorities have, or will be provided with, full information. CGUs for goodwill impairment testing purposes are identified on a country-level basis including significant business units, consistent with the Group’s detailed management accounts. These securities are stated at fair value based on quoted market prices consistent with Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Management are satisfied that across the G4S Group’s total trade debtors as at 31 December 2017 there is no significant concentration risk. All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments. Re-financing risk is further reduced by Group Treasury opening negotiations to either replace or extend any major medium-term facility at least 12 months before its termination date. Treasury transactions are dealt with through the Group’s relationship banks, all of which have a strong investment grade rating. The financing rules specify that an employer is not obliged to pay any further premiums in respect of previously accrued benefits. A funding valuation is carried out for the scheme’s Trustee every three years by an independent firm of actuaries. The effect of a one-year change in this UK life expectancy assumption is to alter reported liabilities (before associated deferred tax adjustments) by approximately £123m (2016: £137m). This is consistent with the Group’s policy which requires evidence that profit improvement plans will be successfully implemented before they are reflected in anticipated future cash flow projections for onerous contract provisioning purposes.
