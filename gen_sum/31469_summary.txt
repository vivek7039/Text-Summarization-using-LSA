expected to help revitalise small local businesses and the commercial fishing industry, by encouraging healthy marine life. our approach we aim to achieve positive outcomes for those in the care and justice system. cash volumes in most developed markets are flat or gradually declining at an aggregate market level. we believe that this approach will generate significant benefits for our customers, employees and shareholders. we now have sufficient strength and depth in these areas to enable us to implement the next, critical phase of our organisational development and with effect from1 january 2018 we have reorganised the group-wide management of our core business. in june 2017, g4s was selected as a constituent company of the ftse4good index, recognising our strong commitment to social responsibility and sustainable business practices. where actions are required – for example, an improvement in the safety performance of a particular business – leaders and managers will have specific objectives in order to make sure the actions are prioritised appropriately (see key performance indicators page 32). we know, however, that even isolated instances of poor conduct are unacceptable and can be very damaging. it is therefore important that we continue to promote good conduct and the use of speak out. as a result, road-traffic accidents and criminal attacks are inherent risks we face in delivering some of our services. sadly, during 2017, 25 of our colleagues lost their lives in work-related accidents and attacks, compared with 47 fatalities in 2016. chief executive’s review continued although we are pleased that there are clear signs of an overall cultural shift within g4s in our approach to safety we also know that there is more to do and our plans reflect this. in 2017 we closed four businesses and sold a further nine, realising gross proceeds of £166 million. priorities for excess cash will be investment, dividends and, in the near term, further leverage reduction. network consolidation with lower cash volumes in some markets together with new higher value added services partly cannibalising traditional cash-in- transit services, it is likely that some, if not all cash markets will experience network consolidation. we believe this market consolidation will help network efficiency and lower the cost of cash handling. some competitors have followed this trend to differentiate away from the commoditised manned security market. industry research data indicates that our addressable market for smart safes and recycling solutions is around £20bn-25bn per annum b . • g4s has been investing in productivity programmes to be more efficient and cost competitive (see page 29). • at the end of december 2017 we had over 19,500 (2016: 14,600) cash technology installations deployed in north america, europe, asia pacific and africa. this breadth provides us with a strong understanding and clear visibility of how security trends are evolving across the world. we have around 570,000 colleagues, whose unique skills and shared values are focused on delivering high-quality service to our many thousands of customers. how we engage • relationship management • c150,000 customers • bidding processes • customer service • net promoter score key stakeholders our employees touch the lives of others every day, providing crucial services to help keep society safe and secure. we run a formal exercise every two years to identify and prioritise our material csr issues (see page 83). feedback from our latest global employee survey indicates that 84% of employees who responded believe that the company values people from different backgrounds, and in 2018 we will continue our focus on diversity to ensure we maximise the benefits it brings. we are experts in security and use that knowledge to protect our customers’ most valuable assets. there are many examples of local development programmes which enhance the security and technology expertise in our organisation. employees by location as at 31 december 2017 (%) middle east & india 31% africa 22% latin america 12% asia paci c 10% north america 10% europe 8% uk & ireland 7% employee gender

for specific functions like sales and business development, we are establishing on-line academies which will help employees identify their own development gaps and navigate the materials available to find those best suited to meet their needs. we do this in a variety of ways including direct dialogue, consultation forums and our employee survey. engagement levels for senior managers were also tested in a separate survey targeted at the leadership team. promoting the right organisational culture during 2017, 300 cases were raised by colleagues via speak out, our global whistleblowing system. this was 25% fewer than the previous year, but detailed analysis shows that employee grievances are being reported and handled more effectively via other channels. we recognise that our businesses operate in different contexts and face varying levels of risk. all businesses within the group are required to meet a set of core health and safety standards. health and safety is included in group internal audit’s scope as part of non-financial risks. during 2017 the group’s lost time injury incidence rate was 6.7 per 1,000 employees (98% of businesses reporting). for example, investment proposals are assessed on whether they can be achieved in line with our company values and standards, as well as on the basis of appropriate operational delivery, commercial risk and financial return. during 2017, we have: • developed and implemented a human rights awareness programme for senior managers, beginning with the group internal audit department. rehabilitation and reintegration services will be provided, as well as programmes aiming to reduce prisoners’ risks of reoffending, thus supporting the government’s policy to achieve a 10% reduction by 2020 and aiding reintegration back into the community. 2017 achievements using g4s-owned amag technology, yale university, one of the world’s best-known and oldest ivy league institutions, has carried out, almost unnoticed, a full scale upgrade of its access-control and site security system across 350 main campus buildings. our understanding of customer requirements has increasingly resulted in opportunities to sell more technology-enabled solutions. this is particularly the case in developed markets, where higher wages and lower hardware costs have made technology solutions more cost-effective. secure

improve further. priorities for excess cash will be investment, dividends and, in the near term, further leverage reduction. emerging markets grew 1.5% with good growth across africa, asia pacific and latin america offset by a decline in the middle east & india region. a description of these performance measures and our progress against them is shown throughout the strategic report. good cash flow and working capital management performances were delivered across most of the group. adjusted eps growth is a component of both the annual and long-term management incentive plans. local, non-strategic restructuring costs in the businesses continue to be included within adjusted pbita, consistent with prior years. as a contrast, organically-developed businesses in the group, whilst clearly benefiting from intangible assets such as talent and customer relationships, do not have any associated goodwill or acquisition-related intangible assets recognised in the group’s consolidated statement of financial position. in addition, tax-specific charges or credits, such as those arising from changes in tax legislation which have a material impact, and which are unrelated to net specific items, are also included within the specific items tax charge. consistent with the treatment of pre-tax specific items, significant tax charges or credits that occur, which are not related to core businesses but which would have a significant impact on the group’s tax charge, would also be classified as tax-specific items. further details regarding these excluded items can be found in note 8 on page 148. adjusted pbita from core businesses is a kpi. certain of these financial performance indicators in respect of core businesses also form a significant element of performance measurement used in the determination of performance-related remuneration and incentives, as follows: • adjusted pbita – annual bonus plans for senior managers in regional management; • operating cash flow – annual bonus plans and long-term incentive plan for all senior management including executive directors; • adjusted earnings – annual bonus plans for executive directors and functional directors who are members of the group executive committee; and • adjusted eps growth – long-term incentive plan for all senior management including executive directors 36 g4s plc integrated report and accounts

objectives and safeguard our reputation. functional teams will use the results of control self-assessments to assist countries with full compliance. in addition, internal audits will continue to test the operational effectiveness of our standards and controls. risk management and appetite as in prior years we have undertaken a bottom-up review, with businesses completing an assessment of their major risks and developing mitigating actions to reduce the likelihood of those risks crystallising. this is combined with a top-down review from group functional leaders, to ensure that the risks captured are complete and appropriately assessed. a thorough review is conducted as part of the annual planning process with updates made in senior management team meetings and trading reviews. operating companies we employ three lines of defence to control and manage risks across the group. during 2017 the annual self-assessment by countries of compliance with our standards was supported by site reviews from local, regional and group h&s managers and was included in the scope of country internal audit visits. business leaders take responsibility for leading safety performance and putting h&s at the forefront of their day-to-day activities. risk mitigation we have a set of values, detailed on page 17, which are continually reinforced to all employees through a variety of key processes including recruitment, induction training, and recognition schemes as well as communications materials. we continue to focus on building awareness of the importance of our corporate values and whistleblowing, particularly in places where we work with people who may be more vulnerable and have less opportunity to raise concerns themselves. screening and vetting is a particular challenge in some territories which lack supporting infrastructure from the relevant authorities. we also deliver regional leadership programmes to nurture talented individuals early in their careers, and help develop them into more senior roles as they move through the organisation. risk the group operates a number of long-term, complex, high-value contracts with multinational companies, governments or strategic partners. risk mitigation during 2017 we updated our strict thresholds for the approval of major bids, involving detailed legal review and senior management oversight. we also perform a quarterly financial review of the top 25 and low-margin contracts in each region. we will also embed into the salesforce opportunity management tool our updated approval requirements to make compliance and monitoring effective. customer satisfaction reviews will guide how we deliver integrated solutions to existing and potential customers across all businesses. focused business transformation projects will also be implemented to drive further efficiency and improve margins. we have a mandatory supplier code of conduct which includes anti-bribery and modern slavery requirements. additionally, we face the risk of disruption to service delivery from system failures, incomplete backup routines, inadequate business continuity and disaster recovery plans. innovative security-defence products such as cash-box tracking, vehicle protection foam and protective boxes are used in a number of businesses. paul spence, who was already a member of the audit committee, served as interim chair with effect from 20 january. as noted elsewhere, our core businesses in all regions apart from the middle east & india grew revenue and adjusted pbita such that total group revenue from core businesses was up 3.2% to £7.4 billion and adjusted pbita grew by 4.2% to £496 million. significant executive management experience in major international businesses with extensive knowledge of asia and the middle east. career experience: served a 30-year career with british aerospace, later bae systems, during which time he held several senior management positions before becoming coo, with particular responsibility for programmes, major projects and customer support, and a member of the bae systems plc board. chief executive of selex galileo for four years prior to joining united utilities group plc in 2011 as ceo. in 1993 was appointed finance head, asia pacific for zeneca agrochemicals and later promoted to group financial controller. a leading integrated energy company at the time, rwe thames water and united utilities group plc. he holds a bachelor’s degree in business from miami university and prior to joining g4s in 2014, john’s previous roles included executive vice president and president, commercial business for the global division of officemax. sanjay has extensive business experience operating across asia pacific having been based in india, china and hong kong. therefore clear records of the tenure and skill set for each non-executive director are maintained. over a day, mr ramsay had individual sessions with members of the group executive team and senior managers. during 2017, a fully externally- facilitated exercise was carried out by oliver ziehn and merlin underwood of lintstock. in addition, the board visited a customer location at which integrated security solutions are provided, meeting both g4s personnel and customers. the project runs in several countries where g4s partners with bhubesi pride foundation to carry out annual rugby coaching events, providing support including delivering talks on topics such as health and safety, career, life-skills and the environment. it is intended that all the directors will attend and be available to answer questions from shareholders. subsequently a new non-executive director qualified to act as chairman of the audit committee was recruited. taking into account the balance of skills and experience on each committee, it was felt that steve mogford, as a current serving ceo with experience of delivery of complex programmes, would bring additional relevant expertise to the risk committee and that john ramsay’s extensive experience in emerging markets would enable him to make a valuable contribution to the csr committee. together with the uk home office, an action plan was agreed and a joint working party created to oversee its implementation. the key objective throughout has been to ensure that detainees are safe at brook house. in 2016 they were re-launched across the group supported by a targeted communications programme, awareness building and training materials. there were four scheduled meetings held during the year ended 31 december 2017. members’ attendance is shown on page 74. accordingly with effect from 20 january 2017, paul spence was appointed as chairman of the audit committee and winnie fok became a member. some of those contracts may evolve to become loss-making, such that net unavoidable losses are expected over their life. this requires determining the net present value of estimated future losses in order to calculate an appropriate onerous contract provision. when restrictions apply to direct share ownership, the group also exercises influence or control through arrangements, including shareholder agreements. adjusted pbita excludes strategic restructuring costs, amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets and specific and other separately disclosed items which the group believes

intensity by at least 3.5% per annum. the group’s uk pension scheme trust deed contains provisions which apply if a takeover event occurs. the high response rate helps identify underlying problems and provides a strong mandate for action. in 2017, we also introduced new on-line newsletters for our senior managers containing information on contract wins, projects and market developments. the newsletters showcase examples of security innovations and help businesses struggling with similar challenges to become early adopters building on new ideas rather than recreating them. we designed audit procedures at the group and component levels to respond to this risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations or through collusion. we performed scanning analytics on contract margins and investigated unusual or unexpected trends to check inclusion of all relevant contracts in management’s assessment. we assessed each of the key assumptions used in management’s forecasts to identify and quantify onerous contract provisions. with the support of our valuations experts, we assessed the terminal growth rates and discount rates applied by management to third party information and confirmed whether they fell within a reasonable range of external market data. where they did not, we applied our independent view of a more appropriate rate to management’s forecast. the recoverable amounts of a number of cgus including brazil secure solutions, risk management and uk cash solutions were found to be sensitive to reasonably possible changes in assumptions and we satisfied ourselves that this risk was appropriately highlighted in the disclosures in note 18. as a result of our work, we determined that it was appropriate that no impairment charge was recognised in the context of the group financial statements taken as a whole and that adequate disclosure has been made. where appropriate, we also read relevant documentation and correspondence to understand the legal positions reached. furthermore, we considered whether amounts included as specific items related to current year trading and might be more appropriately reflected in the underlying results. we identified 73 country component units that, in our view, required a full scope audit due to their size or risk characteristics. this was before considering the contribution to our audit evidence from performing audit work at the regional and group levels, including disaggregated analytical review procedures and our evaluation of entity level controls, which covered a significant portion of the group’s smaller and lower risk components that were not directly included in our group audit scope. we took this measure into account in determining our materiality, except that we did not adjust profit before tax to add back amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets and finance income and expense as in our view these are recurring items which do not introduce volatility to the group’s earnings. the period of total uninterrupted engagement is three years, covering the years ended 31 december 2015 to 31 december 2017. richard hughes (senior statutory auditor) for and on

adjusted pbita. exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income, together with exchange differences arising on monetary items that are in substance a part of the group’s net investment in foreign operations, and on borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments where and to the extent that the hedges are deemed to be effective. the directors review acquisition-related intangible assets on an on-going basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value. capitalised computer software is stated at cost, net of amortisation and any provision for impairment. (n) revenue recognition the group’s revenue arises from two primary sources – secure solutions products, mainly comprising manned security and facilities management services, and cash solutions, mainly the provision of physical cash management services. in general, provisions recognised for future losses are charged to the consolidated income statement within adjusted pbita. in particular, estimation is required in assessing future expected revenue and costs on such contracts, including: • determining the expected impact of any profit improvement plans where sufficient evidence exists of benefits being delivered by those plans; and • determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to material future cash flows. in all cases it is assumed that the local tax authorities have, or will be provided with, full information. as such, there is a risk that further disputes and claims from employees could arise in the future. 11. staff costs and employees the average monthly number of employees, in continuing and discontinued operations, including executive directors was: by reportable segment 2017 number 2016 number africa 125,451 126,182 asia pacific 58,613 59,996 latin america 71,502 73,907 middle east & india 165,847 176,330 europe 50,066 53,287 north america 54,578 55,522 uk & ireland 34,865 34,293 head office 248 171 total average number of employees (excluding joint ventures) 561,170 579,688 average number of employees employed by joint ventures 12,501 13,209 total average number of employees (including joint ventures) 573,671 592,897 their aggregate remuneration, in continuing and discontinued operations, comprised: 2017 £m 2016 £m wages and salaries 4,629 4,533 social security costs 501 479 employee benefits 233 228 total staff costs (excluding joint ventures) 5,363 5,240 joint venture staff costs 70 64 total staff costs (including joint ventures) 5,433 5,304 information on directors’ remuneration, long-term incentive plans, pension contributions and entitlements is set out in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 93 to 115. (i) items that are not deductible and other additions to taxable profit – £20m (2016: £25m) this category reflects the tax effect of items which, in management’s judgment, are potentially disallowable for the purposes of determining local taxable profits. (ii) profits on disposal of businesses not taxable or covered by capital losses – £nil (2016: £(8)m) this relates to profits arising on the disposal of businesses where any taxable gain arising on the disposal is either exempt from tax under the relevant tax legislation or there are capital losses available to offset against those taxable gains, for which deferred tax assets were not previously recognised. 152 g4s plc integrated report and accounts 2017 integrated report and accounts 2017 g4s plc 149 issues relating to taxation the calculation of the group’s total tax charge involves

combination is allocated to the cash-generating units (cgus) which are expected to benefit from that business combination. cgus for goodwill impairment testing purposes are identified on a country-level basis including significant business units, consistent with the group’s detailed management accounts. in certain circumstances, where market prices can be ascertained (for example through recent transactions or by reference to normal industry standard multiples), the fair value less costs to sell is used as a basis for the recoverable amount. these securities are stated at fair value based on quoted market prices consistent with level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. management are satisfied that across the g4s group’s total trade debtors as at 31 december 2017 there is no significant concentration risk. all trade and other receivables arising from construction contracts are due for settlement within one year. interest on all committed bank borrowing facilities is at prevailing libor or euribor rates (with a floor of zero), dependent upon the period of drawdown, plus an agreed margin, and is re-priced within one year or less. all leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments. the group will continue to manage its capital structure so that it retains an investment-grade rating. the group’s policy objective is a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of less than 2.5x. re-financing risk is further reduced by group treasury opening negotiations to either replace or extend any major medium-term facility at least 12 months before its termination date. transaction risk is limited since, wherever possible, each business operates and conducts its financing activities in local currency. treasury policy is to manage significant translation risks in respect of net operating assets and its consolidated net debt/adjusted ebitda ratio by holding foreign currency denominated loans, cross-currency swaps and to a lesser extent forward-currency contracts. treasury transactions are dealt with through the group’s relationship banks, all of which have a strong investment grade rating. pensionable salary is subject to a cap, and minus an offset that reflects social security levels. the financing rules specify that an employer is not obliged to pay any further premiums in respect of previously accrued benefits. a funding valuation is carried out for the scheme’s trustee every three years by an independent firm of actuaries. therefore no adjustments for asset ceiling or additional liabilities under the ifric 14 interpretation are made. ias 19 specifies that pension liabilities should be discounted at appropriate high quality corporate bond rates. the effect of a one-year change in this uk life expectancy assumption is to alter reported liabilities (before associated deferred tax adjustments) by approximately £123m (2016: £137m). analysis of scheme assets the composition of the scheme assets at the reporting date is as follows: 2017 uk £m netherlands £m total £m equity 552 10 562 government bonds 72 39 111 other 1,721 14 1,735 total 2,345 63 2,408 2016 uk £m netherlands

more granular, approximate split of assets of the uk scheme at 31 december 2017 is as follows: 2017 £m 2016 £m equity 409 628 private equity 143 119 government bonds 72 237 credit 83 51 property 83 71 macro-orientated 243 339 multi-strategy 202 217 derivatives 382 412 cash and cash equivalents 728 265 total uk assets 2,345 2,339 multi-strategy assets are held in a pooled fund structure, which is a multi-asset fund investing across all asset classes. in addition, the group incurred non-strategic reorganisation costs of £10m (2016: £9m) which are included within adjusted pbita. both of these amounts have been presented within specific items in the consolidated income statement. this is consistent with the group’s policy which requires evidence that profit improvement plans will be successfully implemented before they are reflected in anticipated future cash flow projections for onerous contract provisioning purposes. there is no single change in key variables that could materially affect future expected losses on these contracts. the discount rates applied when calculating onerous contract provisions for these contracts were between 1.4% and 1.7%. as such, there is risk that further disputes and claims from employees could arise in the future. where a reliable estimate cannot be made, or where the group, based on legal counsel advice, considers that it is not probable that there will be an outflow of economic resources, no provision is recognised. the in-year increase is mainly related to liquidation of dormant holding companies crystallising tax losses. periodic rent reviews take place to bring lease rentals into line with prevailing market conditions. leased vehicles and other operating equipment are negotiated over an average lease term of four years. the relative total shareholder return is measured against a comparator group of selected relevant companies. deferred bonus share plan (dbsp) and restricted share plan (rsp) shares allocated under the group’s dbsp and rsp are not subject to further financial performance conditions, but in both cases, are subject to forfeitures, either in part or in full, subject to continued employment, unless a participant is deemed a good leaver by the remuneration committee. box cp 6098 conway post office, castries, saint lucia al majal group 4s for security and safety llc saudi arabia 49.0% p.o.
