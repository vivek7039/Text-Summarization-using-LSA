By that date all caps expired or were sold, so there will be no further impacts from these instruments in future years. (It is for similar reasons that on an ‘underlying’ basis there was only a small increase in profits from 2016 to 2017, as shown earlier.) The increase relates primarily to new provisions made for future heavy maintenance events, particularly engine LLP replacements. Leverage: net debt adjusted to include capitalised operating lease obligations divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and aircraft rentals. These reports include detailed assessment of, for example, commercial and operational risks which may have arisen or been dealt with during the reporting period. Some areas of the Company’s business have always had sophisticated risk analysis and mitigation processes in place. We invest a huge amount of time in recruiting pilots and also training them to maintain our high standards. Those measures have now been removed, although the Company continues to monitor closely such shareholdings on a regular basis. Mr Franke is the founder and managing partner of Indigo, a private equity fund focused on air transportation. He served as chairman of Spirit Airlines Inc., a United States airline, from 2006 to 2013 and Tiger Aviation Pte. During her time with PepsiCo International, Ms Hooper spent over five years based in Central and Eastern European countries. g) Stephen L. Johnson is not considered to be an independent Non-Executive Director given his past position with Indigo. The Company’s Nomination Committee is comprised of three members, namely William A. Franke, John McMahon and Simon Duffy. The Company believes that this commitment is demonstrated by recent appointments at both Director and senior management level. The Nomination Committee is scheduled to meet formally at least twice a year and otherwise as required.

The Audit Committee also reviews and approves any regulatory announcements that are made in connection with such financial information. The relative strength of Wizz Air’s performance against its peers was reflected in a share price which, as at 31 March 2017, remained some 43 per cent. I was pleased that last year’s Annual Report on Remuneration received a vote in favour from our Shareholders of 99.3 per cent. For transparency, we have included the approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy in full in this report (with some minor updates to wording to provide clarification and an updated scenario chart), although there will not be a vote on the Directors’ Remuneration Policy at this year’s annual general meeting. The Chief Executive Officer currently receives a base salary and is eligible for an annual performance bonus of up to 200 per cent. The Remuneration Committee may take into account a number of factors in deciding whether an increase should be made, including benchmarking against selected airlines. Executive Directors are covered by the Company’s group personal accident and life assurance cover, which is in place for all employees (2x salary). Outstanding awards under the Company’s previous 2009 international employee share option plan remain eligible for vesting and exercise in accordance with their terms. Specific engagement with major Shareholders may be undertaken when a significant change in Remuneration Policy is proposed. During the 2017 financial year, Willis Towers Watson received fees totalling GBP 101,496 for advice related to Remuneration Policy, governance, developments in executive pay, benchmarking and performance analysis. Vesting is due in July 2018 subject to meeting the following performance criteria: a) relative total shareholder return (TSR) growth versus selected European airlines (50 per cent. Aer Lingus has been removed from the group following acquisition by IAG and subsequent delisting in September 2015. The remaining 165,000 (vested) options had not been exercised as at 31 March 2016 and are exercisable any time until April 2021.

The Non-Executive Directors will also be reimbursed for all proper and reasonable expenses incurred in performing their duties. WAHL also has the right to terminate Mr Váradi’s employment with immediate effect by payment in lieu of notice. But more than this, Wizz Air is often the first airline at an airport to offer international flights connecting cities throughout Europe. The survey confirmed that our colleagues are highly engaged and consider Wizz as an employer of choice.

The Group may enter into sale and leaseback arrangements with lessors to finance future aircraft or spare engine deliveries. Deferred interest The Group enters into sale and leaseback agreements to finance future aircraft or spare engine deliveries. The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. Commission revenue arises in relation to the sale of on- board catering, accommodation, car rental, travel insurance, bus transfers, premium calls and co-branded credit cards. Cash contributions or aircraft spares received are recognised as an asset in the statement of financial position. Going forward the Company expects that it will not incur exceptional items of recurring nature so there would be no difference between IFRS and underlying earnings. Management does not expect that any payment under these guarantee contracts will be required by the Company. However, the Group has significant banking, hedging, aircraft manufacturer and card acquiring relationships that represent counterparty credit risk. As required, the fair values ascribed to those instruments are verified also by management using high-level models. Restricted cash during the 2017 financial year was held mainly on current account in Euros, earning no interest. Such Ordinary Shares issued as a result of conversion in certain cases might be subject to restrictions on voting and dividend rights. Other provisions relate to future liabilities under the Group’s customer loyalty programme, all within one year. Trade and other receivables due after more than one year are almost exclusively maintenance reserves, with an average term of approximately four years. Contingent liabilities Legal disputes European Commission state aid investigations Six of the European Commission’s ongoing state aid investigations which are in their formal phase concern arrangements between Wizz Air and certain airports to which it flies, namely, Timişoara, Cluj-Napoca, Târgu Mureş, Beauvais and Girona. Wizz Air has submitted its legal observations and supporting economic analyses of these arrangements to the European Commission. Where relevant, Wizz Air has made further submissions to the European Commission in connection with this notification. Assuming normal operations of the Group, this is equivalent to approximately €1.5 million purchase commitment existing at 31 March 2017 (2016: €1.2m). Shareholders and potential investors are reminded that the Group’s Hungarian operating licence depends, inter alia, on Qualifying Nationals owning more than 50 per cent.
