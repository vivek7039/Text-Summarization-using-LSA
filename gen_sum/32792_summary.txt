embedded in our operations, such as cost index optimisation or the use of thrust reversers. but more than this, wizz air is often the first airline at an airport to offer international flights connecting cities throughout europe. as a result, wizz air does not only provide job opportunities to each of the more than 3,000 aviation professionals already working in the wizz team, but through our continuously developing network and operations we support numerous workplaces at our 141 destinations. the survey confirmed that our colleagues are highly engaged and consider wizz as an employer of choice. 2 recruitment and career as a fast-growing company wizz air is continuously recruiting to find new colleagues passionate about the aviation industry, whether they are talents early in their career or experienced professionals with significant expertise and successful track records. wizz air holdings plc annual report and accounts 2017 62 governance corporate responsibility continued

simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or expense and fair value through profit or loss. wizz air holdings plc annual report and accounts 2017 84 accounts and other information notes forming part of the financial statements continued 2. accounting policies continued basis of consolidation subsidiaries are all entities controlled by the company. the group may enter into sale and leaseback arrangements with lessors to finance future aircraft or spare engine deliveries. deferred interest the group enters into sale and leaseback agreements to finance future aircraft or spare engine deliveries. in some cases it also enters into arrangements to finance the pdps of such deliveries. the fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. unearned revenue represents flight seats sold but not yet flown and is included in deferred income. commission revenue arises in relation to the sale of on- board catering, accommodation, car rental, travel insurance, bus transfers, premium calls and co-branded credit cards. management assesses each leasing contract individually at initial recognition based on the above discussed criteria. cash contributions or aircraft spares received are recognised as an asset in the statement of financial position. net financing costs net financing costs comprise interest payable, finance charges on finance leases, interest receivable on funds invested and foreign exchange gains and losses that are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. going forward the company expects that it will not incur exceptional items of recurring nature so there would be no difference between ifrs and underlying earnings. this balanced position is not visible from the table above that shows a net asset balance of us dollar denominated financial instruments of €111.9 million in 2017. the two positions can be reconciled as follows:  the 2017 balance of trade and other receivables denominated in us dollars includes €22.1 million that has been designated for hedge accounting and therefore its foreign currency revaluation is not impacting financial income or expenses – see under ‘foreign exchange hedge with non-derivatives’ later in this note 3; and  at 31 march 2017 the group had provisions of €84.5 million denominated in us dollars (as part of the total €113.7 million balance reported in note 29). management does not expect that any payment under these guarantee contracts will be required by the company. however, the group has significant banking, hedging, aircraft manufacturer and card acquiring relationships that represent counterparty credit risk. these government bonds are traded in an active market; therefore, it falls into the level 1 category. as required, the fair values ascribed to those instruments are verified also by management using high-level models. wizz air holdings plc annual report and accounts 2017 102 accounts and other information notes forming part of the financial statements continued

disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding of the financial performance of the group. the increase is due to the fact that there were significantly more engine-related new assets created in 2017 because: (i) there were more engines becoming out of condition for llp replacement than in 2016; (ii) in 2016 the company revised its engine maintenance plan combined with a new iae fha agreement (see the 2016 report for details) and as a result only a few engines became out of condition for shop visit in that period – instead most of these became out of condition in 2017; and (iii) the group has a few engines that require second shop visit and these all became out of condition (and partly already went through the shop visit) in
