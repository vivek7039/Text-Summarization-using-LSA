Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 for the year ended 31 March 2017 02 Renold AR2017-Proof3.indd 2 6/7/2017 2:56:22 PM 25290-04 AR 2017 Proof 3 Average working capital % of sales 22.2% Biggest customer % of sales 5% Total employees at 31 March 2017 2,139 3 year CAGR Adjusted EPS growth 1 12.9% Operational highlights Æ Improvement in health and safety accident rate KPIs. Our end-customers generally operate in industrial markets which have continued to be impacted by broader macroeconomic factors and geopolitical uncertainty. Board and People This year saw the appointment of Ian Scapens as Group Finance Director after Brian Tenner left in order to pursue other opportunities. They bring a wealth of relevant experience which will stand the Board in good stead as we continue to implement our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan. All Board members have continued to give additional time and support on a wide range of issues during the year. We are making good progress and continue to believe that mid-teens operating margins can be delivered, supported by volume increases. Internally developed camera systems are now built into all standard assembly lines to enhance the already high product quality of Renold chain. Speed and precision of camera systems make it possible to measure individual parts in line with the production process. Challenging market conditions have impacted upon trading performance during the year, particularly in our Torque Transmission and Chain Americas businesses. This value derives from:  consolidating volume into facilities with efﬁcient business processes and efﬁcient manufacturing capability; or  accessing incremental growth opportunities in new product sectors or new geographies, building on the strength in depth of Renold’s existing product range and geographic reach. Right size cost base Many of our manufacturing processes include manual elements that inevitably reduce any volume beneﬁts due to disproportionate increases in costs. This value derives from:  consolidating volume into facilities with efﬁcient business processes and efﬁcient manufacturing capability; or  accessing incremental growth opportunities in new product sectors or new geographies, building on the strength in depth of Renold’s existing product range and geographic reach. Right size cost base Many of our manufacturing processes include manual elements that inevitably reduce any volume beneﬁts due to disproportionate increases in costs. This has led to inefficient manufacturing processes, long lead times, excess waste and increased waiting time as products pass between multiple work centres. Following an employee consultation process, we have consolidated our UK Couplings manufacturing facilities into the existing facility in Cardiff. During the year, we have made good progress in de-risking exposure to surplus property or crystallising cash from underutilised assets. In addition, following the consolidation of our Halifax Torque Transmission facility into Cardiff, we have released a property for sale. These revenue reductions largely reflect challenging market conditions experienced by our customers reducing overall demand for Renold’s products. Adjusting for these factors to aid true like-for-like comparability, both overheads and monthly sales breakeven point were largely unchanged in the year. However, a number of other KPI measures provide evidence that continued progress on restructuring will deliver improvement in operating profit margins when market conditions improve. This machine dramatically reduces production lead times on complex components whilst at the same time improving quality and removing up to ten separate manufacturing operations. CHAIN FACTS The Chain division is exemplified by an extensive product range reaching into a wide number of geographies: Æ Sales offices and distribution channels in over 18 countries worldwide Æ Extensive product range with the ability to customise or design to suit any application Æ Innovative solution chains for many challenging applications UNDERLYING REVENUE £m 2013 2015 2014 200 150 100 50 0 2017 2016 150.8 150.6 155.2 146.1 143.0 UNDERLYING ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN % 2013 2015 2014 15 12 9 6 3 0 2017 2016 4.3 7.4 10.3 11.4 12.4 27 STRA TEGIC REPORT 27 www.renold.com Stock code: RNO Renold AR2017-Proof3.indd 27 6/7/2017 2:58:24 PM Renold Synergy chain has long been known for industrial applications, where its ability to outperform its closest competitors has seen it leading the market. Each coupling transmits 10MW at 750rpm between a Wärtsilä 20V32TS duel fuel diesel engine and an alternator which is producing power to the gold mine. They are held primarily to generate an income stream that supports the ongoing annual pension payments (currently circa £9.5m including cash lump sums on retirement). If mortality continues at a higher rate than assumed, all else being equal, the level of future pension payments would fall. Æ Of the remaining 3,056 members, approximately 500-600 will have their benefits discharged as a lump sum on retirement or dependency. Existing mitigation controls Æ Our diversified geographic footprint inherently exposes us to more countries where risks arise but conversely provides some degree of resilience. LINK TO STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 1 Potential impact Accidents caused by a lack of robust safety procedures could result in life changing impacts for employees, visitors or contractors. This could result from an accident, a strike by employees, fire, severe weather or other cause outside of management control. 2 0 1 6 T R E N D 2 0 1 7 T R E N D 8 Liquidity, Foreign Exchange and Banking Arrangements Detailed risk A lack of sufficient liquidity and flexibility in banking arrangements could inhibit the Group’s ability to invest for the future or, in extremes, restrict day to day operations. Æ In an extreme situation, the Group’s ability to operate as a Going Concern could also be jeopardised. Existing mitigation controls Æ The Group’s primary banking facility expires in May 2020 and is fully available given current levels of profitability. The Group’s core financing facility expires in May 2020 but, following normal market practice, is likely to be renegotiated at least 12 months earlier. As an international manufacturing business the Group is dependent on stable trading environments to deliver our products and shareholder value. This included an additional detailed review of our markets, competitors and product strategies in addition to financial forecasts. An independent programme of audits is in place, which requires all material sites to be audited within a 12 month period. Æ Personal protective equipment requirements are regularly reviewed and we have ensured that clear communication of standards is observed. The images show awards being presented by Chief Executive, Robert Purcell, to our teams in Milnrow (left) and South Africa (above). This process will be repeated each year, enabling us to create a straightforward and practical continuous improvement ethos in the area of talent development. Compliance Arrangements for consulting and involving Group employees on matters affecting their interests at work are developed in ways appropriate to each business. Employment policies are designed to provide equal opportunities irrespective of race, caste, national origin, religion, age, disability, gender, marital status, sexual orientation or political affiliation.

The Group is also committed to compliance with anti-corruption laws in all countries and operates a zero tolerance policy. We expect staff and job applicants to be treated equally regardless of age, race, religion, disability, gender or sexuality. Through better facilities and higher quality education all round it is anticipated there will be a reduction in the dropout rate of students. John is also currently Senior Independent Director and Ian Griffiths will step into this role after the AGM. In order to provide shorter lead times and better customer service the Group also holds a significant amount of stock. We welcome feedback from shareholders on this report and I will be available at the AGM to answer questions. The remuneration policy is also designed to attract, motivate and retain individuals who will deliver strong performance for all of our stakeholders.

Remuneration principles for Executive Directors Our Directors’ Remuneration Policy has been designed to deliver two key aims, which remain unchanged since the policy was first approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM: To attract, motivate and retain executives who will deliver high performance for all our stakeholders. Executive reward at Renold is relatively modest compared to our peer group and this has been validated by independent third parties. Car benefit is reviewed annually and set on 1 August each year to a maximum of £11,000 per annum cash allowance or equivalent lease value. Bonuses are normally payable in cash but the Committee has flexibility to introduce a share based deferral if deemed appropriate. All PSP or deferred share awards vesting (net of income tax and National Insurance contributions) must be retained until the shareholding requirement is met. Each Non-Executive Director is appointed for an initial period of three years, subject to earlier termination by either party. 4 Ian Griffiths appointment was renewed on 14 January 2016 for a period of three years in line with best practice guidelines. www.renold.com Stock code: RNO 95 GOVERNANCE Renold AR2017-Proof3.indd 95 6/7/2017 3:03:24 PM 25290-04 AR 2017 Proof 3 The deferred shares have no voting or dividend rights and are not able to be traded.

The accounting policies as set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. Based on available evidence, it is considered unlikely that these amounts will be recovered within the foreseeable future. Any past service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are recognised immediately in the income statement as a normal operating cost. Under the Group’s UK pension scheme rules, any surplus arising on payment of agreed contributions is fully recoverable. Finally, as part of the overall agreement, Renold plc is not constrained from paying a dividend, other than by normal legal considerations. Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the reporting period for which they were designated. www.renold.com Stock code: RNO 155 FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS Renold AR2017-Proof3.indd 155 6/7/2017 3:03:49 PM 25290-04 AR 2017 Proof 3 Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 for the year ended 31 March 2017 156 CORPORATE INFORMATION Corporate Calendar Annual General Meeting 19 July 2017 Half year end 2016/17 30 September 2017 Announcement of half year 2016/17 results 14 November 2017 Year end 2017/18 31 March 2018 Announcement of annual results 2017/18 29 May 2018 Payment of preference dividends 1 July 2017 and 1 January 2018 Company details Registered office Trident 2, Trident Business Park Registered number: 249688 Styal Road Telephone: +44 (0)161 498 4500 Wythenshawe Fax: +44 (0)161 437 7782 Manchester Email: enquiry@renold.com M22 5XB Website: www.renold.com Company Secretary Louise Brace Auditor Deloitte LLP Broker and financial adviser Arden Partners Financial PR consultants Instinctif Partners Limited Registrars Capita Asset Services The Registry 34 Beckenham Road Beckenham Kent BR3 4TU Telephone: If calling from the UK: 0871 664 0300 (calls cost 10p per minute plus network extras; lines are open 8.30 am to 5.30 pm, Monday to Friday) If calling from overseas: +44 208 728 5000 Email: shareholderenquiries@capita.co.uk Website: www.capitaassetservices.com Registrars’ Share Portal: www.capitashareportal.com If you receive two or more copies of this report please write to Capita Registrars at The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU and ask for your accounts to be amalgamated.
