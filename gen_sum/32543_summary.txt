of roller chains means that for most requirements there is a renold solution. continuous research, development, innovation and ingenuity has led to the production of more specialised solutions such as hydro- service with its superior corrosion-resistant coating and the syno range which sets a new benchmark for chains requiring little or no lubrication. renold torque transmission also provides a range of freewheel clutches featuring both sprag and roller ramp technology. along with our european distribution centre, these facilities export transmission chain all over the world. ” 25290-04 ar 2017 proof 3 overview renold has performed robustly this year against a backdrop of challenging markets. our markets renold’s global presence and extensive product offering result in a broad spread of end-customer industries. our end-customers generally operate in industrial markets which have continued to be impacted by broader macroeconomic factors and geopolitical uncertainty. board and people this year saw the appointment of ian scapens as group finance director after brian tenner left in order to pursue other opportunities. most recently, he was group finance director of bodycote plc from 1999 until his retirement earlier this year. they bring a wealth of relevant experience which will stand the board in good stead as we continue to implement our step 2020 strategic plan. all board members have continued to give additional time and support on a wide range of issues during the year. we are making good progress and continue to believe that mid-teens operating margins can be delivered, supported by volume increases. internally developed camera systems are now built into all standard assembly lines to enhance the already high product quality of renold chain. visual inspection systems with modern industrial image processing are used to ensure a constant quality level in production. speed and precision of camera systems make it possible to measure individual parts in line with the production process. knowledge skills & facilities 1 service logistics www.renold.com stock code: rno 13 stra tegic report sales channels 10 bringing our unparalleled engineering

and investigations into any reported near misses or accidents. challenging market conditions have impacted upon trading performance during the year, particularly in our torque transmission and chain americas businesses. this value derives from:  consolidating volume into facilities with efﬁcient business processes and efﬁcient manufacturing capability; or  accessing incremental growth opportunities in new product sectors or new geographies, building on the strength in depth of renold’s existing product range and geographic reach. enhanced customer service we believe renold’s reputation for quality and performance is unsurpassed in the market. however, historically our performance in customer service has not lived up to the same standards. right size cost base many of our manufacturing processes include manual elements that inevitably reduce any volume beneﬁts due to disproportionate increases in costs. in some cases this will involve new talent and ideas being brought into the business. this value derives from:  consolidating volume into facilities with efﬁcient business processes and efﬁcient manufacturing capability; or  accessing incremental growth

greater opportunity for organic growth well-structured and clear marketing and sales strategies to target specific end-user segments supports organic growth provides an effective platform into which acquisitions can be integrated, or bolted-on to maximise synergy benefits and reduce acquisition risk provides a platform to consolidate manufacturing upon acquisition, maximising synergy benefits and reducing capital investment requirements acquisitions offering product expansion can benefit from the renold commercial network, increasing synergy benefits market analysis can support decision making by determining key gaps in product offering that can be filled through targeted acquisitions efficient use of capital and balance sheet de-risking creates capital capacity to undertake acquisitions business process efficiency commercial positioning corporate efficiency growth activities manufacturing efficiency our step 2020 strategic plan comprises three specific and overlapping phases: restructuring in phase i, organic growth in phase ii and acquisitions in phase iii. in order to deliver these strategic objectives, each business unit has developed an action plan. our intention is to create one global, integrated erp system, which incorporates efficient and standardised business processes. this has led to inefficient manufacturing processes, long lead times, excess waste and increased waiting time as products pass between multiple work centres. our manufacturing facility in malaysia was relocated during the year to larger premises, increasing capacity. following an employee consultation process, we have consolidated our uk couplings manufacturing facilities into the existing facility in cardiff. like many of our diverse business processes, there is much scope for us to standardise and simplify. we will, over time, de-risk the group’s balance sheet exposure to legacy defined benefit pension schemes. during the year, we have made good progress in de-risking exposure to surplus property or crystallising cash from underutilised assets. in addition, following the consolidation of our halifax torque transmission facility into cardiff, we have released a property for sale. these revenue reductions largely reflect challenging market conditions experienced by our customers reducing overall demand for renold’s products. adjusting for these factors to aid true like-for-like comparability, both overheads and monthly sales breakeven point were largely unchanged in the year. during the year, we also commenced a programme to relocate our chain manufacturing facility in china. however, a number of other kpi measures provide evidence that continued progress on restructuring will deliver improvement in operating profit margins when market conditions improve. this reduction derives from the restructuring activities delivered, combining with a general focus on business efficiency. these products have become more competitive in overseas markets as a result of the currency movements. there are certain product categories which we import to the uk, particularly chain manufactured in our european facilities. we create innovative solutions for our customers who need to ensure performance within increasingly challenging working environments. however, the overall performance of both businesses was depressed by lower demand in export markets. this machine dramatically reduces production lead times on complex components whilst at the same time improving quality and removing up to ten separate manufacturing operations. chain

renold gears has supplied one of the largest worm gear sets in the company’s history to a leading manufacturer of steel plate. each coupling transmits 10mw at 750rpm between a wärtsilä 20v32ts duel fuel diesel engine and an alternator which is producing power to the gold mine. whilst operating margins have reduced in the year, this is largely due to market conditions. on a divisional basis, the chain division saw underlying revenue increase by 2.1% with torque transmission weaker, 10.5% down. however, this increase was offset by experience gains (the difference between assumptions previously made and experience of real events) and asset returns delivered above assumed levels, which together generated gains of £15.3m to offset the deficit increase. they are held primarily to generate an income stream that supports the ongoing annual pension payments (currently circa £9.5m including cash lump sums on retirement). if mortality continues at a higher rate than assumed, all else being equal, the level of future pension payments would fall. æ of the remaining 3,056 members, approximately 500-600 will have their benefits discharged as a lump sum on retirement or dependency. in the current uncertain markets its relevance to safeguarding shareholder value is even more critical. existing mitigation controls æ our diversified geographic footprint inherently exposes us to more countries where risks arise but conversely provides some degree of resilience. link to strategic objectives 2 5 7 potential impact any acquisition involves risks at various stages of the project life cycle. link to strategic objectives 1 potential impact accidents caused by a lack of robust safety procedures could result in life changing impacts for employees, visitors or contractors. æ project

exchange and banking arrangements detailed risk a lack of sufficient liquidity and flexibility in banking arrangements could inhibit the group’s ability to invest for the future or, in extremes, restrict day to day operations. in the past, banking markets and renold’s own performance have made access to debt facilities difficult. link to strategic objectives 4 5 7 potential impact æ potentially cause under-investment and sub-optimal short-term decision making. æ in an extreme situation, the group’s ability to operate as a going concern could also be jeopardised. existing mitigation controls æ the group’s primary banking facility expires in may 2020 and is fully available given current levels of profitability. thirdly, balance sheet deficits can fluctuate based on market conditions outside the control of management. many of the group’s business activities are subject to increasing regulation and enforcement by relevant authorities. as an international manufacturing business the group is dependent on stable trading environments to deliver our products and shareholder value. this included an additional detailed review of our markets, competitors and product strategies in addition to financial forecasts. we use a web based integrated risk management system (irms) which provides aligned processes and data mining functionality. this allows sites to manage accident reporting, opportunities for improvement, hazard assessment and all action tracking. performance data to inform monthly board reporting and site reviews are derived from the system. an independent programme of audits is in place, which requires all material sites to be audited within a 12 month period. æ personal protective equipment requirements are regularly reviewed and we have ensured that clear communication of standards is observed. æ mandated standards relevant to fire safety have been developed and are being rolled out. there is now an increased emphasis on innovative initiatives which are aimed at winning hearts and minds. the images show awards being presented by chief executive, robert purcell, to our teams in milnrow (left) and south africa (above). of

renold monitors both three and seven lost day categories. the new graduates were recruited in september 2016 into diverse functions, including business systems, engineering, commercial and manufacturing operations. it is particularly pleasing that, to date, we have had no turnover in our future leaders cohort. this process will be repeated each year, enabling us to create a straightforward and practical continuous improvement ethos in the area of talent development. compliance arrangements for consulting and involving group employees on matters affecting their interests

all round it is anticipated there will be a reduction in the dropout rate of students. both new directors will play vital roles as we continue to implement our step 2020 strategic plan. john is also currently senior independent director and ian griffiths will step into this role after the agm. prior to joining renold, robert was managing director of filtrona plc’s protection and finishing products division. he has also held a managing director role at low and bonar plc within its technical textiles business. he joined renold from keepmoat group, where he had been deputy chief financial officer since june 2015. previously, ian spent ten years at speedy hire plc, latterly as group financial controller, from 2010 to 2015. ian griffiths non-executive director committee memberships

principles for executive directors our directors’ remuneration policy has been designed to deliver two key aims, which remain unchanged since the policy was first approved by shareholders at the 2014 agm: to attract, motivate and retain executives who will deliver high performance for all our stakeholders. executive reward at renold is relatively modest compared to our peer group and this has been validated by independent third parties. however, we are careful to ensure appropriate incentive opportunities remain for sustainable improvements in business performance. car benefit is reviewed annually and set on 1 august each year to a maximum of £11,000 per annum cash allowance or equivalent lease value. as the cost of providing such insurance benefits varies according to premium rates and the cost of other benefits is dependent on market rates and other factors, there is no formal maximum monetary value. bonuses are normally payable in cash but the committee has flexibility to introduce a share based deferral if deemed appropriate. no bonuses will be payable unless a minimum level of financial performance has been achieved. www.renold.com stock code: rno 83 governance
