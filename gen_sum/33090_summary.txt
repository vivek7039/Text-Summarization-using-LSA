The Committee met three times during 2014 and held a number of informal meetings to discuss wider remuneration issues. This includes the policy for all cash remuneration, executive share plans, service contracts and termination arrangements. The Committee have the discretion to reduce or cancel any outstanding awards that have not vested, and claw back any awards during the deferral/holding period, in any of the following situations: • C&R’s financial statements or results being negatively restated due to the Executive’s behaviour • A participant having deliberately misled management or the market regarding Company performance • A participant causing significant damage to the Company • A participant’s actions amounting to serious/gross misconduct Directors’ service agreements and letters of appointment Details of the service contracts of the executive directors and the non-executive directors are as follows: Name Unexpired term of appointment Date of service agreement Notice period Potential termination payment Executive Directors H Scott-Barrett Rolling contract 9 March 2008 12 months 12 months salary and benefits value K Ford Rolling contract 17 May 1996 12 months 12 months salary and benefits value C Staveley Rolling contract 1 October 2008 12 months 12 months salary and benefits value M Bourgeois Rolling contract 13 August 2013 12 months 12 months salary and benefits value Non-Executive Directors Date of initial appointment P Newton Rolling contract 8 August 2006 No notice None N Haasbroek Rolling contract 15 September 2009 No notice None L Norval Rolling contract 15 September 2009 No notice None J Clare Rolling contract 29 June 2010 No notice None T Hales Rolling contract 1 August 2011 No notice None I Krieger Rolling contract 1 December 2014 No notice None Recruitment of Executives In normal circumstances, new Executive Directors will receive a remuneration package in line with the Company’s remuneration policy. The Remuneration Committee will ensure that there are no unjustified payments for failure on an Executive Director’s termination of employment. All Board appointments automatically terminate in the event of a director not being re-elected by shareholders. On reflection of this it was concluded that Executive Director salaries for 2015 should also increase by the same 2.5% awarded to all employees.

raising in 2009 which was structured so as to allow the Company to claim merger relief under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 on the issue of ordinary shares. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. The Group considers all of its assets held for sale to fall within ‘Level 2’, as defined in note 1. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Long-term accounts receivable are discounted to take into account the time value of money, where material. Provisions for performance fees payable by the underlying subsidiary, associate or joint venture are made when there is a present obligation to settle the performance fee, its amount can be measured reliably and it is probable that it will be paid.

Waterside Lincoln Limited Partnership On 12 November 2014, the Group and its JV Partner, Karoo, sold the Waterside Shopping Centre Lincoln to Tesco Pension Fund Trustees for a net consideration of £46.0 million representing a net initial yield of 5.88%.

The Group’s treasury department maintains a rolling eighteen month forecast of anticipated recurring and non-recurring cash flows under different scenarios. Amounts receivable from the German joint venture incur interest at commercial rates which is payable on demand. Amounts receivable from the Waterside Lincoln Limited Partnership, prior to its disposal, were interest free and repayable on demand. 23714.04 15 April 2015 10:01 AM Proof 5 123 Financial Statements www.capreg.com Company Balance Sheet As at 30 December 2014 Registered number: 01399411 Prepared in accordance with UK GAAP Note 2014 £m 2013 £m Fixed assets Investments C 333.5 77.8 Current assets Debtors – amounts falling due within one year D 126.5 160.2 Debtors – amounts falling due after more than one year D 13.6 14.8 Cash and deposits – – Total current assets 140.1 175.0 Creditors – amounts falling due within one year Trade and other creditors E (73.6) (65.2) Total current liabilities (73.6) (65.2) Net current assets 66.5 109.8 Net assets 400.0 187.6 Capital and reserves Called-up share capital F 7.0 9.9 Share premium F 157.2 – Merger reserve F 60.3 60.3 Capital redemption reserve F 4.4 4.4 Retained earnings F 171.1 113.0 Shareholders’ funds 400.0 187.6 These financial statements were approved by the Board of directors, authorised for issue and signed on their behalf on 26 March 2015 by: Charles Staveley Group Finance Director 23714.04 15 April 2015 10:01 AM Proof 5 Capital & Regional plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 December 2014 124 Stock Code: CAL A Accounting policies Although the Group consolidated financial statements are prepared under IFRS, the Company financial statements for Capital & Regional plc presented in this section are prepared under UK GAAP .
