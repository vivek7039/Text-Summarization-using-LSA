shareholders on modifications to the long term incentive scheme and annual performance bonus levels, these changes were fully integrated in 2014 and feedback continues to inform the committee’s progressive thinking. the committee met three times during 2014 and held a number of informal meetings to discuss wider remuneration issues. this includes the policy for all cash remuneration, executive share plans, service contracts and termination arrangements. the committee have the discretion to reduce or cancel any outstanding awards that have not vested, and claw back any awards during the deferral/holding period, in any of the following situations: • c&r’s financial statements or results being negatively restated due to the executive’s behaviour • a participant having

an informed voting decision. we do not publish details of the thresholds and targets in advance as these are commercially confidential. accordingly all executive directors are expected to build up and

2006 on the issue of ordinary shares. fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. the group considers all of its assets held for sale to fall within ‘level 2’, as defined in note 1. loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. long-term accounts receivable are discounted to take into account the time value of money, where material. provisions for performance fees payable by the underlying subsidiary, associate or joint venture are made when there is a present obligation to settle the performance fee, its amount can be measured reliably and it is probable that it will be paid. the results are therefore now presented together with what was previously ‘group items’ as ‘group/central’. depreciation and charges in respect of share-based payments represent the only significant non- cash expenses. results from discontinued operations are included up until the point of disposal or reclassification as held for sale. 2a operating segments year to 30 december 2014 note uk shopping centres the mall £m other uk shopping centres £m snozone £m group/ central £m total

for significant tenants and there is an allowance for doubtful receivables that represents the estimate of potential losses in respect of trade receivables. the group’s objective in managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it has sufficient funds to meet all its potential liabilities as they fall due, both in normal market conditions and when considering negative projections against expected outcomes, so as to avoid the risk of incurring contractual penalties or damaging the group’s reputation. the group’s treasury department maintains a rolling eighteen month forecast of anticipated recurring and non-recurring cash flows under different scenarios. hemel hempstead was similarly excluded from the group analysis in 2013 (see note 26 for further details). amounts receivable from the german joint venture incur interest at commercial rates which is payable on demand. amounts receivable from the waterside lincoln limited partnership, prior to its disposal, were interest free and repayable on demand. 23714.04 15 april 2015 10:01 am proof 5 123 financial statements www.capreg.com company balance sheet as at 30 december 2014 registered number: 01399411 prepared in accordance
