Affordability remains very attractive and demand exceeds supply, with buyers queueing on site opening days. Market context Demand for low cost homes in the North of England was very strong with long queues forming on launch days at new development sites. Dermot Gleeson Chairman “ “ February 2017, was supportive of the approach to affordable housing on which Gleeson Homes’ business model is based and contains proposals which will, if adopted, make it easier for the division to secure planning permissions. On behalf of the Board, I would like to congratulate and thank them very warmly indeed. Gleeson Homes continues to build significant value for shareholders as well as delivering a unique social benefit in helping people on lower incomes move from housing poverty caused by the ‘rent trap’ into home ownership and wealth creation. This ‘virtuous circle’ will continue to underpin the business and allows for future geographic expansion. We have a very carefully targeted land buying strategy that has clearly defined and challenging hurdle rates. The ground rent is low and we have reduced it even further to a peppercorn. The Gleeson Strategic Land portfolio is in good shape and demand remains strong from other housebuilders. Jolyon Harrison Chief Executive Officer 22 September 2017 Creating safe, sustainable and vibrant communities THE GLEESON APPRENTICESHIP SCHEME Since 2010 the Gleeson Apprenticeship Scheme has trained over 80 young people and we have a record 32 apprentices starting in September this year. We then share this information and, where necessary, send warnings through instant alerts straight to residents’ inboxes. During the year, we secured planning consents for some 1,495 plots and acquired interests in 6 new sites plus additional land at an existing site. 1 Sites are located predominantly in Buckinghamshire, Devon, Dorset, Essex, Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Kent, Oxfordshire, Somerset, Surrey, Sussex and Wiltshire. Our business enables people on lower incomes to become homeowners and regenerates local communities in areas of social deprivation. This strategic benefit is recognised by local authorities and results in more opportunities for us to acquire brownfield land at sensibly low prices, leading to increased sales volumes and profitability whilst keeping average selling prices (“ASPs”) low. DOUBLE GLEESON HOMES VOLUMES We will increase the number of unit completions to 2,000 per annum within 5 years by increasing our housebuilding footprint. Over the past 12 months we have sold 60 homes to buyers under the age of 21, many of whom never thought they would be able to ever own a home, especially not at such a young age. Buying on my own was a little daunting, but it’s the best move I ever made.” Rachel McCaffrey. We give priority to labour and subcontractors who live within a two mile radius of each site. Over the past year we have worked closely with Denaby Main Academy, a primary school located close to our Kilner Park development in South Yorkshire. The centre offers essential free child care for local children, many of whom have special needs or come from disadvantaged families. Emissions have been calculated using the UK Government’s CHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting: 2017 and 2016 respectively. Stefan Allanson Chief Financial Officer 22 September 2017 32 Rachel & Adam, Lowfield Park, Bolton on Dearne, South Yorkshire 33 Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Further Information 33 Operating Risk Statement In common with other organisations, the Group faces risks that may affect its performance. • Lead indicators of the housing market, such as visitors to sites and reservation rates are closely monitored. • Gleeson Strategic Land sites are actively marketed to a wide and varied range of housebuilders. • Our apprenticeship schemes enable us to identify and secure the loyalty of talented individuals at an early age. • Where appropriate, Group purchasing arrangements are in place to ensure the supply of materials at competitive prices. • A dedicated sub-contractor procurement programme is employed to optimise the sourcing of scarce sub- contractor resource. Health & Safety A failure to prevent unsafe practices within our construction activities, causing injury or death. 2 Stefan Allanson ACMA, CGMA, FCT Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary Appointed to the Board in July 2015. We are unreservedly opposed to discrimination on the grounds of race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, religion or beliefs. Being a smaller listed company, it was not considered necessary to have this year’s Board evaluation externally facilitated. It should be recognised that all such systems and procedures are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. This has enabled a meaningful assessment of viability to be undertaken, utilising detailed financial budgets which incorporate individual site cash flow forecasts. We are committed to developing our employees in order that they can maximise their career potential and achieve Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Further Information MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017 49 their aspirations and our aim is to provide rewarding career opportunities in an environment where equality of opportunity is paramount. Employee involvement The Group regularly provides its employees with information on matters of concern to them. We consult with our employees in order to ensure that their views can be taken into account when making decisions. Restrictions on voting A shareholder shall not be entitled to vote at any general meeting or class meeting in respect of any shares held by them unless all calls and other sums presently payable by them in respect of that share have been paid. The Board may, save in certain circumstances, refuse to register any transfer of a certificated share not fully paid up. Notwithstanding this, the Board has determined that all Directors will be subject to annual re-election by shareholders at each AGM. Ross Ancell also has recent relevant financial experience as Chairman of Churngold Construction Holdings Limited. • The Board has established defined lines of authority to ensure that significant decisions are taken at an appropriate level. This continues to have a broad remit across the Group focused on areas of risk and management judgement. From 1 July 2016 the Company has not engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to carry out any new non-audit services. Amounts equivalent to any dividends or shareholder distributions may be made in respect of awards at vesting, if the Committee so determines. No material change will be made to the type of performance conditions without prior major shareholder consultation. Fees are set at levels with reference to sector, FTSE Small Cap and general Non-Executive Director benchmarking data as appropriate. There is no payment in the event of gross misconduct, wilful neglect or certain other specified circumstances.

Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. Available for sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets due after more than one year, which represent receivables in respect of shared equity properties, are recorded at fair value, being the amount receivable by the Group discounted to present day values. Credit risk is accounted for in determining fair values and appropriate discount factors are applied. The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity. Available for sale financial assets due after more than one year represent receivables in respect of shared equity properties. The treasury function is not a profit centre and no speculative trades are permitted or executed. Prudent and controlled use of financial instruments is permitted where appropriate, principally to reduce fluctuation in interest costs. The Group’s remaining credit risk is spread over a number of counterparties and customers. Trade receivables past due more than one year are largely retentions within the Gleeson Homes division.
