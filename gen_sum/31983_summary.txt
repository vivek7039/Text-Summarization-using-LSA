strategy – the development of low cost homes for open market sale in the north of england and strategic land sales in the south – delivered another excellent year of increased volumes, margins, profit and cash. affordability remains very attractive and demand exceeds supply, with buyers queueing on site opening days. market context demand for low cost homes in the north of england was very strong with long queues forming on launch days at new development sites. dermot gleeson chairman “ “ february 2017, was supportive of the approach to affordable housing on which gleeson homes’ business model is based and contains proposals which will, if adopted, make it easier for the division to secure planning permissions. on behalf of the board, i would like to congratulate and thank them very warmly

complementary businesses: housebuilding on brownfield land in the north of england and strategic land trading, primarily in the south of england. gleeson homes continues to build significant value for shareholders as well as delivering a unique social benefit in helping people on lower incomes move from housing poverty caused by the ‘rent trap’ into home ownership and wealth creation. this ‘virtuous circle’ will continue to underpin the business and allows for future geographic expansion. we have a very carefully targeted land buying strategy that has clearly defined and challenging hurdle rates. there has been a great deal of media comment about the difficulties young people face purchasing a home, but typical gleeson homes buyers are blue collar workers aged between 18 and 33. this year we sold 60 houses to people aged 21 or under. the real living wage (of which we are great supporters) has helped the working class young strategic report governance report financial statements further information we have plenty of land on which to build homes, people to build them and a strong management team that can grow the business in a profitable and disciplined way. the ground rent is low and we have reduced it even further to a peppercorn. “ “ 12 mj gleeson plc: report and accounts for the year ended 30 june 2017 strategic report governance report financial statements further information chief executive’s statement (continued) pont house park, leadgate, county durham strategic land significant investment over the last few years has led to a growth in operating profit of 17.6% to £12.0m from 8 transactions completed in the year. current trading & outlook we have plenty of land on which to build homes, people to build them and a strong management team that can grow the business in a profitable and disciplined way. the gleeson strategic land portfolio is in good shape and demand remains strong from other housebuilders. jolyon harrison chief executive officer 22 september 2017 creating safe, sustainable and vibrant communities the gleeson apprenticeship scheme since 2010 the gleeson apprenticeship scheme has trained over 80 young people and we have a record 32 apprentices starting in september this year. we then share this information and, where necessary, send warnings through instant alerts straight to residents’ inboxes. we are encouraged by the government white paper ‘fixing our broken housing market’ published in february 2017 and the definition of affordable homes, which should make it easier for planning authorities to provide consent for gleeson developments. during the year, we secured planning consents for some 1,495 plots and acquired interests in 6 new sites plus additional land at an existing site. our portfolio continues to have a geographic bias towards the south of england 1 and sites in the portfolio are forecast to realise maximum value over a mix of short, medium and long term periods. 1 sites are located predominantly in buckinghamshire, devon, dorset, essex, hampshire, hertfordshire, kent, oxfordshire, somerset, surrey, sussex and wiltshire. our business enables people on lower incomes to become homeowners and regenerates local communities in areas of social deprivation. this strategic benefit is recognised by local authorities and results in more opportunities for us to acquire brownfield land at sensibly low prices, leading to increased sales volumes and profitability whilst keeping average selling prices (“asps”) low. we will ensure that our homes are energy efficient and have low running costs. double gleeson homes volumes we will increase the number of unit completions to 2,000 per annum within 5 years by increasing our housebuilding footprint. over the past 12 months we have sold 60 homes to buyers under the age of 21, many of whom never thought they would be able to ever own a home, especially not at such a young age. buying on my own was a little daunting, but it’s the best move i ever made.” rachel mccaffrey. we give priority to labour and subcontractors who live within a two mile radius of each site. all our buyers are automatically enrolled into yourwatch®, gleeson’s neighbourhood watch online alert platform. over the past year we have worked closely with denaby main academy, a primary school located close to our kilner park development in south yorkshire. the centre offers essential free child care for local children, many of whom have special needs or come from disadvantaged families. the nursery applied for a makeover of their impractical and child un-friendly toilet facilities. emissions have been calculated using the uk government’s chg conversion factors for company reporting: 2017 and 2016 respectively. we anticipate that further development of the apprenticeship programme will continue over future years. “ “ consolidated income statement 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 5.8 33.0 17.3 28.2 12.2 group profit before tax
