Advanced notice of Mark’s intentions has allowed the Board to engage in a thorough and structured search for his successor and we are pleased to announce that Matthew Gazzard will be succeeding Mark. As indicated previously, this needs to be balanced against the normalisation of volumes on particularly large product launches that bolstered H2 FY16 and H1 FY17 performance.

These product categories also have significant barriers to entry in terms of skill and assets required. This enables our relationships and specific contracts to be on a more secure, long term partnership basis. OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTH FORMULATORY EXPERTISE Regulatory Expertise Packaging Solutions Innovation Geographical Flexibility Quality Customer Base Expertise in our ‘Drive’ Categories ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT – 15 – Over the last three years we have developed, both organically and through acquisition, a growing portfolio of brands that are owned and managed by the Group and which we control from formulation through to distribution. National retailers are keen to support brands that can differentiate their offering and thereby drive shopper loyalty. CZECH REPUBLIC TABOR FACTORY A filling location focused on cosmetics, fragrance, tubes and roll-ons. EXECUTING OUR STRATEGY The three strategic pillars that we are focussing on within our owned brands value stream are: NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT (NPD) Fast paced NPD that quickly identifies and responds to market trends is a core element of The Brand Architekts business model. Additionally, we are extending the international reach of our Christmas gifting ranges with orders already having been received for USA, Turkey, Ireland and South Africa. We were particularly active in haircare and colour cosmetic products with a number of our innovations being taken to market by leading brands. This will now be accelerated with significant volumes brought in-house over the next 18 months. The Group’s quality assurance procedures are reviewed continuously with improvements made as appropriate. The Group maintains a high level of expertise in its purchasing and supply chain team. A summary of the financial measures used are: FINANCIAL REVIEW RESULTS 2017 1 Revenue translated at 2016 exchange rates 2 Adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share are calculated before exceptional items and amortisation of acquisition-related intangibles. In addition to the financial key performance measures, a range of non-financial key performance indicators are monitored at an operational level covering, amongst others, new product development, customer service, quality and health and safety. Notwithstanding this impact, contribution margin % has improved, mainly due to the increase of owned brands in our product mix. This improved valuation reflects a very strong trading performance, supplying customers in Europe and the USA. DIVIDENDS The Board is pleased to announce that it will be proposing a final dividend of 3.5 pence. Employees are encouraged to present their views and suggestions in respect of the Group’s performance. EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY The Group continues to carefully consider applications for employment by an individual from any background, including disabled persons. The ‘Working safely’ package is a completely different approach to safety and health training. Since that date, all six-monthly surveillance audits have been passed with no major non-conformances. The Group was also given a 64% sustainability rating score from Carbon Clear, compared to an industry average of 49%. Levels of dry waste recycling or reuse for aluminium, metal, cardboard, wood, paper, plastic etc. By order of the Board Chris How Mark Warren Chief Executive Officer Group Finance Director 18 September 2017 GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 36 – The Group is committed to business integrity, high ethical values and professionalism in all its activities.

Computer software is amortised on a straight- line basis over the expected useful life of 3 years. Costs are those incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition. Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative translation differences are reclassified from equity to profit or loss. Loans and receivables are measured subsequent to initial recognition at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 57 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS of those receivables. Where fair value cannot be reliably estimated such assets are reviewed for impairment annually. All other financial liabilities are recorded initially at fair value, net of direct issue costs. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 58 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Post-retirement benefits The Group’s defined benefit pension scheme is assessed annually. The new standard is required to be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The new standard establishes a control-based revenue recognition model and provides additional guidance in many areas not covered in detail under existing IFRSs, including how to account for arrangements with multiple performance obligations, variable pricing, customer refund rights, supplier repurchase options, and other common complexities. The new standard is required to be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. With effect from April 2016 Mr How has taken additional base salary in lieu of company pension contributions. This model was developed by The QCA partnered with Independent Remuneration Solutions (IRS) and City Group Plc. The fair value estimate has been determined using SCCTC’s June 2017 net assets, and was recognised at a fair value of £1,235k, with an increase of £675k recognised through other comprehensive income in the year.

This has resulted in lower discount rates being adopted for accounting purposes compared to last year, this was coupled by an increase in expectations of long term inflation, the combination of these two factors has translated into an increased liability.
