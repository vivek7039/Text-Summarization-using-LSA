patient needs in chronic endocrine (hormonal) diseases, typically where there is either no licensed medicine or where current treatment does not sufficiently improve patients’ health. these discussions have helped, and continue to help, shape the group’s development plans, such that we can deliver products that not only address important unmet needs and improve patients’ lives but also have a positive impact on healthcare budgets. i am pleased to see that the ashfield team has integrated seamlessly with diurnal staff and are rapidly implementing our launch plans. diurnal also continues to invest in its earlier-stage pipeline, with good progress being made with the group’s oral native testosterone product, which entered human clinical trials during the year, as well as our programmes in cushing’s disease (cortisol excess) and hypothyroidism. meeting milestones, building our future chairman’s statement it is with great pleasure that i report on the significant progress diurnal has made this financial year towards becoming a world-leading, endocrinology-focused specialty pharma company. i would also like to thank my fellow board members for the progress made this year in overseeing a strategy that will ensure continued and sustainable growth from our pipeline. key elements of diurnal’s structure are: + a core internal team covering development, regulatory, manufacturing, supply chain and commercialisation, in addition to administration. one example of such a relationship is with glatt gmbh, who manufacture infacort ® and chronocort ® products. diurnal started working with glatt in 2010, initially for the development of formulations then moving onto clinical trial product manufacture, scale up and, for infacort ® , progression to manufacture of

well to achieve its vision.” 7 diurnal group plc _ annual report 2017 ceo q&a q&a what is your vision for diurnal? infacort ® is being developed to treat children who lack cortisol – a condition known as adrenal insufficiency (ai). despite the active ingredient of infacort ® having been available for around 60 years, there is surprisingly no approved paediatric product. infacort ® is designed to provide an accurate and appropriate dose of this life-saving medicine in a child-friendly formulation. importantly , we expect to start phase 3 registration studies in the us for both infacort ® and chronocort ® . + secondary hypogonadism usually results from a benign tumour of the pituitary gland that causes hypopituitarism and may occasionally be congenital. diurnal is focused on developing testosterone replacement for men with clearly-defined hypogonadism according to current clinical guidelines. 10 diurnal group plc _ annual report 2017 business model and strategy strategic report our vision helping patients’ everyday needs diurnal aims to develop and commercialise products to address unmet patient needs in chronic endocrine (hormonal) diseases, typically where there is either no licensed medicine or where current treatment does not sufficiently improve patients’ health. a strong product portfolio read more about our portfolio on page 4 4 strategic report 12 diurnal group plc _ annual report 2017 chief executive’s review the financial year to 30 june 2017 has seen diurnal continue to build on the momentum following its initial public offering (ipo) in december 2015 through the delivery of key milestones contributing towards its vision of becoming a world-leading specialty pharma company focused on endocrinology . diurnal believes that its strategy of developing novel products using well-characterised active ingredients to meet significant unmet medical needs offers a lower risk approach than the development of new chemical or biological entities, whilst enabling significant in-market protection through both patent filings and regulatory protection. diurnal’s product candidates are protected by a wholly-owned patent portfolio, benefiting from granted or pending patents in key jurisdictions, along with strong protection through orphan drug designations. currently there is no licensed hydrocortisone preparation in europe or the us specifically designed to treat these young patients. infacort ® is expected to be the first pharmaceutically defined dose and consistent formulation of hydrocortisone designed specifically for children. compounding is not a licensed method of producing medicines; it can be highly variable and may result in inaccurate dosing to patients. diurnal’s small in-house commercial team has been supplemented through a service agreement with the respected global contract sales organisation ashfield healthcare (“ashfield”) to support the group in building its sales and medical infrastructure in major european territories. continued progress in late-stage product pipeline diurnal’s second late-stage product candidate, chronocort ® , provides a drug release profile that the group believes mimics the body’s natural cortisol circadian rhythm, which current therapy is unable to replicate. outlook the group is well positioned for its anticipated transformation into a fully integrated, world-leading, endocrinology-focused specialty pharma company with the recommendation for approval of its first product, infacort ® , which diurnal continues to expect in h2 2017. together with its other late-stage product, chronocort ® , diurnal has the opportunity to build a life-long adrenal franchise, providing critical medicine in underserved diseases of cortisol deficiency. the group has engaged specialist market access consultants to ensure expected benefits are well-understood by payers. over time, revenues from planned product launches in europe and the us should provide a natural hedge for operating expenses. membership at 30 june 2017 + alan raymond (chairman) + john goddard + peter allen + sam williams meetings held in 2017 2 board membership executive director non-executive director audit
