Innovation We will develop new products and services that enable us to hold a competitive advantage over other firms in our market. This allows it to invest in future growth, product development and acquisitions whilst still paying a dividend. There are good prospects for the coming year as we increase our market share. The Group has had another busy year bringing on new clients while coping with changing market conditions. Peter Opperman Non-executive Chairman ULS Technology plc 26 June 2017 ULS Technology Annual Report 2017 06 Revenue £22.3m Revenue is generated principally from the completion of conveyancing cases and also the associated sales of searches and ID checks. Solicitors also generate additional revenues for ULS by using the platform to perform legal searches and ID checks. ULS provides ratings on its providers helping the customer to make an informed choice. ULS provides a platform for service providers such as law firms who have low brand recognition, raising their profile and helping them attract new business. Scope Volume Reward Market Reach Time saving Cost Saving Choice Service OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 09 ULS Technology Annual Report 2017 Our market Over the period, housing transactions have declined significantly compared to the previous year, and are markedly below long term average levels. Activity recovered through Spring into the EU Referendum vote, at which point things became markedly quieter, before some sort of recovery got underway in September. Many homeowners find it unnecessary or too expensive to move up a rung on the ladder. Changes to Stamp Duty haven’t helped certainly in London and have hindered other areas. The result of few people moving from one home to another is reduced housing stock for sale. ULS is exploring ways to become more active in this market, which offers upside potential for the Group. Currently, it looks as though any initial Referendum shock has largely worn off and business is returning to normal. From a positive point of view, firstly the housing market is already trading at low levels compared to historical norms. ULS continues to successfully grow its strong relationships with many of these large specialist firms, through procuring many more new customers for them, and by building integrated technology links designed to make all parties’ involvement in the conveyancing process as straightforward and painless as possible. Organic growth ULS has very strong, successful and loyal business partners that make up its conveyancing distribution. For example, the Group is now much more involved in procuring and servicing conveyancing needs for customers requiring and using an Estate Agent - both traditional Estate Agents, as well as those that trade online only. This is an important channel for ULS to be invested in, as it provides scalability and a degree of control over longer term future new business volumes. Acquisitions Over the last year ULS has been actively looking at potentially complementary acquisition opportunities. This acquisition was highly earnings enhancing for the Group, and a great strategic fit. In addition, CAL has been successful in forging a good proportion of its growth from providing Estate Agents with conveyancing related technology and services, a path that we have deliberately wanted to explore and grow into. Strategic Acquisition Conveyancing Alliance 15,170 completions in 2016 (calendar year) 13 ULS Technology Annual Report 2017 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Chief Executive’s statement ULS has continued to make good progress, building on its clear strategy of growing market share, revenue and profit, through a combination of organic growth and tactical acquisition activity. ULS Technology Annual Report 2017 14 The Group is pleased to report that it has successfully tailored and embedded its technology within HOA’s website and that this has delivered new conveyancing growth over the last year. The Group has won new conveyancing contracts with two mortgage lenders, having invested efforts into building a complete suite of technology and services to help lenders provide their customers with the best possible moving experience. This new proposition to lenders includes services offered by Legal Eye, which ULS acquired in 2015. ULS intends to continue its growth into lender related conveyancing through the coming year and beyond. ULS has spent the last year or so honing and piloting new technology to enable home sellers to compare the performance of traditional and online Estate Agents free of charge on one technology platform. ULS has been pursuing complementary acquisition opportunities, and at the end of 2016, acquired Conveyancing Alliance Holdings Limited. Also CAL has enjoyed comparable success partnering independent Estate Agents to provide conveyancing services. CAL is therefore the second channel that ULS has acquired and will use to grow conveyancing market share in the Estate Agency sector, helping customers to access a breadth of choice at comparatively low cost, and move home as seamlessly as possible.

Where opportunities exist, the business will also take on debt facilities to fund acquisition growth and currently uses a guideline of having a maximum leverage of one times EBITDA which it is currently well below. ULS Technology Annual Report 2017 18 Risk Areas Potential Impact Mitigation Loss of key introducer The contract with Lloyds Banking Group delivers significant gross margin. Changes in interest rates, house prices, government policy, GDP growth and wider economic factors can positively or negatively impact the number of housing transactions. There are also opportunities within competitors as illustrated by the recent acquisition of CAL. The Group ensures that anti-virus software is kept up-to-date and regular penetration tests are performed. Risks include over paying, not achieving expected synergies and impact on the existing business due to distraction of management.

The principal accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all periods presented. All subsidiaries have a reporting date of 31 March except Conveyancing Alliance Holdings Limited and its subsidiary Conveyancing Alliance Limited, although their results for the period since acquisition to 31 March 2017 have been included in the consolidated numbers. Segmental reporting An operating segment is a component of an entity that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses related to transactions with other components of the same entity), whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s Chief Operating Decision Maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 33 ULS Technology Annual Report 2017 Amortisation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, net of any residual value, over the estimated useful life of that asset as follows: Capital development expenditure – Straight line over 4–7 years Brand names and customers lists Brand names and customer lists acquired in a business combination that qualify for separate recognition are recognised as intangible assets at their fair values. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of these items. The equity investment in Financial Eye Limited is measured at cost less any impairment charges, as its fair value cannot currently be estimated reliably. This fair value is appraised at the grant date using a Black- Scholes model. All share-based remuneration is ultimately recognised as an expense in profit and loss with a corresponding credit to retained earnings. Such situations are disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the outflow of resources is remote. Uncertainties in these estimates relate to technological obsolescence that may change the utility of certain software and IT equipment. Any inter-segment indebtedness is excluded when arriving at the assets and liabilities for each segment. The recoverable amount of the ULS Technology CGU has been determined from value in use calculations based on cash flow projections from a formally approved 12 month forecast which has been extrapolated out over a five-year period.
