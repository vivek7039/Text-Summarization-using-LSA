We do not develop bespoke applications or specialise in any industry-specific vertical application but can partner with third party organisations for these requirements. I am confident that these plans will ensure a very orderly transition in due course. For my own part, it has been a privilege to chair Softcat through its IPO in 2015. 6,500+ applications 98% employee satisfaction We employ bright, highly motivated people who care about the organisation they work for. OUR GOAL: To be the leading IT infrastructure provider in terms of employee engagement, customer satisfaction and shareholder return. An expanding branch network, growing recruitment capacity and flourishing service capability position us well for sustainable growth. That, combined with another year of strong cash generation, resulted in the special dividend we’ve proposed alongside these results. But time doesn’t stand still and we are now focused on the opportunity to do it all again in 2018. Yes, that’s right; we have branches in Marlow, London, Manchester, Leeds, Glasgow and Bristol but have also recently announced that we intend to open a seventh location on the South Coast in the first half of this new financial year. It is a very consistent view with what we have been saying for the last five years and there are several levels to this. We see an increasing proportion of our software licensing business transition to a cloud-based platform. Some customers may effectively outsource the management and possibly ownership of that infrastructure to a third party. Overall, however, we see a continuing trend from customers to transition towards the public cloud for an increasing number of workloads. All areas are affording us plenty of opportunity and we continue to expand our offering in each. WE’RE ON IT Strong performance from our new offerings such as managed print and contractual support services. That will take the time it takes and we are not working to any set deadline. FUN RESPONSIBLE Our Company values are captured in four key words: THE SOFTCAT DNA We care passionately about two things – outstanding employee satisfaction and world-class customer service. Every customer has digital aspirations and by getting these things right we can help them achieve those goals. WE’RE ON IT 200+ vendors 17 17 Strategic report 18 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 CREATING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE Our customer relationships What sets us apart continued If there’s one single reason why Softcat has delivered such strong growth over such a long period of time, it’s the strength of our customer relationships. But what really sets us apart is the passion, intelligence and integrity with which our people serve their customers. • Delivery of EPS growth will also contribute indirectly to share price performance, an important element in total shareholder return (‘TSR’). This reflects good progress across all customer segments with public sector business once again expanding fastest and rising as a proportion of total income to 31% (2016: 29%). Perhaps even more pleasing, gross profit per customer rose 6.5% (2016: 9.2%), or 9.6% (2016: 6.2%) on an underlying basis (excluding the 2016 procurement benefit). Ownership for each risk has been assigned to a member of the senior management team based upon alignment with operational duties. An outsourced internal audit function has been established to support and enhance the Company’s management of principal risks. Tuberous Sclerosis Association, The Prince’s Trust, Comic Relief and Children in Need have all benefited from our charitable activities to date. For the last five years we have worked particularly closely with Dreams Come True, raising a total of £1.2m over this timeframe. We are very proud to have helped children and young people with serious or life-limiting conditions fulfil their dreams. These events promote team building and unity within Softcat, alongside the primary goal of helping those less fortunate than ourselves. Softcat offices use energy-saving technology, such as energy-efficient lighting which automatically shuts off when not being used and thin clients rather than energy-hungry desktops. • Scope 1: Comprises emissions from our pool cars and natural gas burnt in boilers we control. We are therefore especially focused on working with the industry to improve this position and ensure that Softcat is not missing valuable sources of talent. We are pleased that the Company continued to perform well with strong profit growth and cash generation. Previous roles Lee spent ten years as chief financial officer of Domino’s Pizza Group plc and held the post of group finance director at Health Club Holdings Limited, formerly Holmes Place plc, where he also served for 18 months as deputy chief executive. Our Non-Executive Directors are conscious of the need to keep themselves properly briefed and informed about current issues. OTHER SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS The 2017 Annual General Meeting will be held on 8 December at Softcat plc, Fieldhouse Lane, Marlow SL7 1LW. Both make themselves available, when requested, for meetings with shareholders on issues relating to the Company’s governance and strategy. The Committee also receives detailed monthly reporting on business performance to include revenue recognition data and trends. The Committee receives management information on rebates accrued as part of monthly performance reporting and monitors trends against prior period results. Our activity here was driven primarily by the Company’s assessment of its principal risks and uncertainties, as set out on pages 24 to 25. Last year his salary increase was 3%, in line with the rises provided to all employees of Softcat. The Policy we put forward at last year’s AGM received over 99% support, for which I would like to thank shareholders. We believe the Policy continues to be fit for purpose and therefore it will remain unchanged this year.   Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’)   Minimum shareholding requirements • Chief Executive: 200% of salary • Chief Financial Officer: 150% of salary  INTRODUCTION In this section, we set out our Remuneration Policy, its link to corporate strategic objectives and the performance and remuneration outcomes for the 2017 financial year.

The Company is not party to any other significant agreements that take effect after, or terminate upon, a change of control. Directors’ report 61 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Corporate governance Share capital and control The Company’s ordinary issued share capital as at 31 July 2017 was 197,606,143 ordinary shares of 0.05p each, which have a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange. The Relationship Agreement will remain in effect for so long as: (a) Peter Kelly (and/or any of his Connected Persons) holds at least 10%. This is undertaken through a variety of methods including, but not limited to, weekly all-Company meetings, team briefings, Company days, email and the intranet. At team meetings, managers are responsible for ensuring that information sharing, discussion and feedback take place on a regular basis. • The Company may at times be under pressure to meet ambitious growth targets and analyst expectations as a newly listed entity. When targets are exceeded there may be a risk that revenue is inappropriately deferred into the following fiscal year. We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion. • Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements. These estimates and judgements are based on factors considered to be relevant, including historical experience that may differ significantly from the actual outcome. Separately, management reviews individual large deals on a case-by-case basis, which reduces the opportunity for error. This analysis has identified some discrete areas in which adjustments may be required to reporting under the principal versus agent assessment. The Company assesses its revenue arrangements against specific criteria in order to determine if it is acting as principal or agent. Trade payables due after one year are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
