this document a series of icons demonstrate how we’ve integrated information about our business model with details of our strategy and risk. with our focus on contemporary style and wardrobe essentials, we are the uk’s biggest clothing retailer by value. in january 2007, we launched plan a to address the key environmental, social and ethical challenges facing m&s. after ten years and two further updates, plan a continues to lead the sustainable business agenda. since steve rowe became chief executive, he has set out clear plans to accelerate the pace of change across m&s. decisive action and strong execution have never been more important to compete in a fast-changing retail environment. we repositioned our clothing & home business for sustainable growth by ending a damaging cycle of promotions and discounts. by implementing a sensible, competitive pricing architecture for our customers, we have seen encouraging improvements in full-price sales. at the end of this ﬁ ve-year programme we will have increased our space overall and employed more people. i will leave an m&s that is well equipped for the digital age and totally focused on its customers. “the main purpose of building up a great business should not be merely to make money,” lord sieff said. unless it gives satisfaction, and even happiness to all concerned, it will fail in its aims in the long term.” his comments are as pertinent as ever and this philosophy continues to guide the way we do business at m&s. last year, after a rigorous process, we appointed steve as chief executive, the ﬁ rst internal appointee for many years. having focused on these three pillars – governance, succession and engagement – i believe m&s is now better prepared for the further changes ahead. archie has signiﬁ cant retail experience and a long-term track record of value creation in several major british companies. listening groups in early 201 7 our colleagues shared their views on a range of customer- focused questions. marketing we created our 2016 christmas with love campaign in direct response to feedback from thousands of customers. during the year, customer feedback resulted in a number of store improvements including additional staff on shop ﬂ oors. however, employee engagement extends far beyond big: one example from the year was a collaborative exercise where we asked our store colleagues what we all needed to do diff erently to make every moment special for our customers. over 6 5 % of those who c omplet ed the programme went on to ﬁ nd work, either with m&s or other employers. for further details about how we engage with our employees, see 'employee involvement' on pages 8 1-82. shareholders institutional investors a plan a our pioneering social and environmental sustainability programme continues to underpin the way we do business at m&s. our stakeholders: how we listen & engage governance 45 annual report and financial statements 2017 “the main purpose of building up a great business should not be merely to make money. our consumer barometer gives us a regular snapshot of how consumers are feeling about their household ﬁ nances and the economy in general. they also said they were more likely than before to put their money into experiences and events, such as trips to the cinema, gym membership or meals out, rather than into buying consumer goods on the high street. our net promoter score (nps), which measures customers’ willingness to recommend m&s, in food is up four points. although our clothing & home business is still recovering, customers can see we are doing the right things. customers ﬁ nd m&s.com easy to navigate and customer satisfaction has signiﬁ cantly improved over the last year. but this led to a fragmented shopping experience and product duplication where sub- brands had similar garments. we responded by putting over 3,000 more colleagues into the departments where our customers told us they value service most, including fitting rooms, bra fit, men’s suits and footwear. for example, since the launch of sparks in 201 5, nearly 1.5m people have downloaded our m&s app. however, through listening to our customers and monitoring the market, we keep on top of changing shopping habits. at the same time, households are managing their ﬁ nances carefully due to fears of inﬂ ation and political uncertainty. 201 6/1 7 has been a year of change as we started to answer these questions, which i address below. and in food, we continued to grow ahead of the market with new stores outperforming expectations. we started off ering better value than ever before by reducing prices on 2,400 clothing & home lines. these are also the reasons why our food business is on a clear path to sustainable growth. this year we extended collection, our top tier range for customers who want something extra special. it is their number one concern when it comes to buying food, so we launched 200 new products aimed at helping our customers to eat well, and extended our made without, balanced for you and eat well ranges. i am immensely proud that we now have pay and beneﬁ t parity across the business. i would like to thank all our people for their dedication and professionalism in a year of signiﬁ cant but necessary change. at the same time, customers want to shop in modern stores that off er a great experience. due to our ambitious food expansion we will have more stores in the future, not fewer. on behalf of the whole business, i would like to welcome robert’s successor, archie norman. customers today are increasingly looking for deeper engagement with brands; they want richer and more meaningful experiences. outcome: an eff ective sourcing strategy creates sustainable value by driving effi ciencies

percentage of revenue retained after costs for producing and transporting goods. performance we grew sales, although these were adversely aff ected by the reduction in promotional activity. we anticipate input cost inﬂ ation will slightly outweigh operational effi ciencies with a resulting decrease in gross margin of between 0 and -50 basis points largely weighted towards the ﬁ rst half. > capital expenditure is expected to be c.£400m as we increase the rate of simply food store openings. the changes, which took eff ect in april this year, saw us increase basic pay for our customer assistants to a level well above the national living wage and move to a single approach for premium payments. these changes were made following an extensive consultation process with all employees through our national business involvement group (big), m&s’s network of elected employee representatives, and through town hall meetings and listening groups in our stores. while no change is easy, these were necessary actions to build a robust platform for future growth. although this programme is in its early stages, over the next ﬁ ve years it will lead to change for some of our people. by fostering talent in a structured way at every level of m&s – be that on the shop ﬂ oor, in our school leaver or graduate programmes or at more senior levels, our people can realise their full potential. this year, we took spark something good to another seven cities, with over 4,000 customers and employees volunteering on more than 240 projects. employee diversity as at 1 april 2017 female

great and great ways to feel healthy. we introduced a wholesome store cupboard range with 37 new products across areas including dried grains and grain pots. we also extended the reach of our interactive supply chain map to include food, beauty and home suppliers. we will continue to make every food moment special with our diff erentiation, newness and quality. it is now a year since we changed the structure of our womenswear team to focus on product categories rather than brands. r our improved margin performance is a result of better sourcing and less reliance on promotions. the action we are taking will make us more customer- and partner- focused, driving sustainable proﬁ t growth overseas in a capital-light way. the aff ected businesses were loss- making and in markets where there is limited opportunity for growth. this year alone, online sales rose by 5.6% on a reported basis to £836.3m (up 4.9% at constant currency). the results have seen customer service satisfaction ratings improve, and our people are energised – making every moment special has evolved into a movement within m&s. over half of all sparks visits are made via mobile, making it a crucial sales and communication channel for us. through our marketing activity this year we have taken a diff erent approach to engaging with customers. our new marketing approach focuses on the feeling and emotion people get when they shop at m&s. this is also the ﬁ rst time we have united both food and clothing & home under a single brand philosophy. our sparks membership club is pivotal when it comes to giving customers what they want and rewarding their loyalty. we have identiﬁ ed three new priorities around which all our plan a activity will be based: wellbeing, community and planet. food gross margin was down 25bps year-on-year due to input price pressure as a result of the fall in sterling, and higher than anticipated waste. capital investment was signiﬁ cantly down as we have completed some of our larger infrastructure projects and opened fewer full-line stores than last year. capital management and improving shareholder returns following several years of investment, we now have the infrastructure needed for sustainable growth. under this approach, we are already placing a greater emphasis on cash payback when assessing investments to help improve the reliability of returns. despite the fall in proﬁ t, we believe we have the right strategy in place to recover and grow m&s and this, alongside our strengthened approach to capital management, will deliver proﬁ table, sustainable growth for our shareholders. within other store costs, new space drove the increase, with occupancy cost inﬂ ation largely off set by effi ciencies and lower depreciation. building a

lower as a result of the decision to exit stores in 10 markets. in addition, as we move towards more cloud based software solutions, a larger proportion of costs are now being expensed. maintenance spend has increased primarily due to investment in more energy effi cient in-store equipment such as lighting. further detail on our approach to assessing long-term viability can be found on page 3 1. key areas of focus we continue to challenge and improve the quality of risk information generated across the business, while maintaining a simple and practical approach. while we have already been aff ected by the depreciation of sterling, other risks are not yet fully quantiﬁ able. eff ective risk management is essential to support the achievement of our strategic and operational objectives. > the uk government’s notiﬁ cation of its intention to exit the european union will have adverse ﬁ nancial impacts, including input cost inﬂ ation from increased tariff s and a further weakening in sterling, as well as reduced uk consumer spending. through eff ective management of talent & succession, we can ensure our people are best set up for success to deliver business objectives as they evolve. risk description current context mitigating activities 1 clothing & home recovery our future performance will be impacted if we fail to meet customer expectations. early signs of improved performance are being seen in clothing & home following ongoing eff orts to strengthen product style and quality. fraudulent supply chain behaviour, supplier cost pressures, innovation demands and stringent regulatory requirements are just some of the contributors to this risk. > mature supplier ethical auditing programme, including independent third party auditors, across our clothing & home and food businesses. > proactive simpliﬁ cation of it infrastructure through clearly deﬁ ned technology roadmaps for all business areas. while our business continues to face challenging foreign currency headwinds, other factors place signiﬁ cant pressure on margin performance. > strong engagement with buying teams to communicate ﬂ uctuations in raw material prices and foreign exchange rates. we must successfully drive innovation and diversiﬁ cation to secure future proﬁ table growth for our business. the board was acutely aware that these would aff ect a broad range of our stakeholders. these were particularly evident in our deliberations around the introduction of an m&s living wage and the ambition to deliver fairer pay for our store colleagues in a way that was true and relevant to m&s. while the audit committee will continue to monitor business processes and provide assurance over controls, the board considers data governance and cyber to be so signiﬁ cant that it will review this at least twice a year. i am delighted that with steve and archie's appointments this aspect has been successfully achieved in a rigorous way. from a strong core set of well-established

following a rigorous and competitive tender process. pwc’s fees are typically charged on an hourly basis with costs for work agreed in advance. this is based on an agreed fee for business as usual support with additional work charged at hourly rates. all may attend the committee meetings by invitation but are not present for any discussions that relate directly to their own remuneration. in addition, a director may at any agm retire from offi ce and stand for re-election. it should be noted that these holdings are likely to have changed since the company was notiﬁ ed. these take place at key points in the year to all head offi ce, distribution centre and store management employees. these communications are supplemented by various employee publications including m&s world magazine, plan a updates and dvd presentations. the company operates both an all employee save as you earn scheme and share incentive plan. the crunch costs campaign received an overwhelming response with

uncertainty described above. we assessed all items, either highlighted by management or identiﬁ ed through the course of our audit, which were regarded as signiﬁ cant in nature and/or quantum, but included within adjusted proﬁ t to ensure that these are not material either individually or in aggregate. management has performed a full impairment assessment for all stores, other than those within their shelter period (see below), to determine if the carrying value of these uk assets is supported. in addition, we circularised a sample of 15 suppliers to test whether the arrangements recorded

erence between the nominal value of the shares issued prior to the capital reduction by the company (being the carrying value of the investment in marks and spencer plc) and the share capital, share premium and capital redemption reserve of marks and spencer plc at the date of the transaction. the group reports some ﬁ nancial measures, primarily international sales, on both a reported and constant currency basis. as such, the outstanding supplier income within trade and other payables at year end is immaterial. b. brands acquired brand values are held on the statement of ﬁ nancial position initially at cost. capitalised software development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected economic lives, normally between three and ten years. depreciation is provided to write off the cost of tangible non- current assets (including investment properties), less estimated residual values on a straight line basis as follows: > freehold land – not depreciated. certain purchases of inventories may be subject to cash ﬂ ow hedges for foreign exchange risk. e. loan notes long-term loans are initially measured at fair value net of direct issue costs and are subsequently held at amortised cost unless the loan is designated in a hedge relationship, in which case hedge accounting treatment will apply. these measures are consistent with how business performance is measured internally by the board and operating committee. this credit largely arises following a decision to retain two logistics warehouses within the network which had previously been identiﬁ ed for closure. 106 marks and spencer group plc financial statements notes to the financial statements continued 7 income tax expense continued b. taxation reconciliation continued 2017 £m

calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on earnings after tax and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. these have been presented to provide shareholders with an additional measure of the group's year-on-year performance. the partnership holds £1.6bn (last year £1.6bn) of properties which have been leased back to marks and spencer plc at market rates. a sensitivity analysis has been performed on each of these key assumptions with other variables held constant. it is the group’s policy to lease certain properties and equipment under ﬁ nance leases. all leases are on a ﬁ xed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent payments. the treasury function is managed as a cost centre and does not engage in speculative trading. > operating subsidiaries are ﬁ nanced by a combination of retained proﬁ ts, bank borrowings and intercompany loans. group treasury hedges these exposures principally using forward foreign exchange contracts progressively based on dynamic forecasts from the business. as at the balance sheet date, the gross notional value in sterling terms of forward foreign exchange sell or buy contracts amounted to £2,023m (last year £1,640m) with a weighted average maturity date of six months (last year ﬁ ve months). the group uses a combination of foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge balance sheet translation exposures. the equity impact shown for foreign exchange sensitivity relates to derivative and non-derivative ﬁ nancial instruments hedging net investments. 2% decrease
