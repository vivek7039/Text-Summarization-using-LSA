Since Steve Rowe became Chief Executive, he has set out clear plans to accelerate the pace of change across M&S. I will leave an M&S that is well equipped for the digital age and totally focused on its customers. Last year, after a rigorous process, we appointed Steve as Chief Executive, the ﬁ rst internal appointee for many years. Having focused on these three pillars – governance, succession and engagement – I believe M&S is now better prepared for the further changes ahead. Over 6 5 % of those who c omplet ed the programme went on to ﬁ nd work, either with M&S or other employers. OUR STAKEHOLDERS: HOW WE LISTEN & ENGAGE GOVERNANCE 45 ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017 “The main purpose of building up a great business should not be merely to make money. Our Consumer Barometer gives us a regular snapshot of how consumers are feeling about their household ﬁ nances and the economy in general. We responded by putting over 3,000 more colleagues into the departments where our customers told us they value service most, including Fitting Rooms, Bra Fit, Men’s Suits and Footwear. At the same time, households are managing their ﬁ nances carefully due to fears of inﬂ ation and political uncertainty. I would like to thank all our people for their dedication and professionalism in a year of signiﬁ cant but necessary change. Outcome: An eff ective sourcing strategy creates sustainable value by driving effi ciencies and margin improvement, while using our scale to deliver great quality at every price point. Serve & Engage The rationale behind every strategic decision starts with our customer – we want a winning culture built around giving them great products and service.

As interests have shifted away from dieting, consumers are looking for ways to live healthier lifestyles every day and 8 1 % of our customers tell us that health is their number one concern when buying food. We delivered free cash ﬂ ow up 8.5% on last year mainly due to the impact of reduced capital expenditure, which was partially off set by weaker business performance. We anticipate input cost inﬂ ation will slightly outweigh operational effi ciencies with a resulting decrease in gross margin of between 0 and -50 basis points largely weighted towards the ﬁ rst half. Although this programme is in its early stages, over the next ﬁ ve years it will lead to change for some of our people. This year, we took Spark Something Good to another seven cities, with over 4,000 customers and employees volunteering on more than 240 projects. It is now a year since we changed the structure of our Womenswear team to focus on product categories rather than brands. The action we are taking will make us more customer- and partner- focused, driving sustainable proﬁ t growth overseas in a capital-light way. The results have seen customer service satisfaction ratings improve, and our people are energised – Making Every Moment Special has evolved into a movement within M&S. Over half of all Sparks visits are made via mobile, making it a crucial sales and communication channel for us. This is also the ﬁ rst time we have united both Food and Clothing & Home under a single brand philosophy. We have identiﬁ ed three new priorities around which all our Plan A activity will be based: Wellbeing, Community and Planet. Food gross margin was down 25bps year-on-year due to input price pressure as a result of the fall in sterling, and higher than anticipated waste. Capital investment was signiﬁ cantly down as we have completed some of our larger infrastructure projects and opened fewer full-line stores than last year. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND IMPROVING SHAREHOLDER RETURNS Following several years of investment, we now have the infrastructure needed for sustainable growth. Under this approach, we are already placing a greater emphasis on cash payback when assessing investments to help improve the reliability of returns. Within other store costs, new space drove the increase, with occupancy cost inﬂ ation largely off set by effi ciencies and lower depreciation. M&S Bank proﬁ ts were down £9.7m as a result of the reduction in interchange fees, and lower interest bearing balances. We closed our UK deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme to future accrual eff ective from 1 April 20 1 7 resulting in a one-off charge of £ 1 27 .0m. In addition, as we move towards more cloud based software solutions, a larger proportion of costs are now being expensed. While we have already been aff ected by the depreciation of sterling, other risks are not yet fully quantiﬁ able. Through eff ective management of Talent & Succession, we can ensure our people are best set up for success to deliver business objectives as they evolve. RISK DESCRIPTION CURRENT CONTEXT MITIGATING ACTIVITIES 1 CLOTHING & HOME RECOVERY Our future performance will be impacted if we fail to meet customer expectations. Early signs of improved performance are being seen in Clothing & Home following ongoing eff orts to strengthen product style and quality. Fraudulent supply chain behaviour, supplier cost pressures, innovation demands and stringent regulatory requirements are just some of the contributors to this risk. From a strong core set of well-established timeless values, we have sought to ensure fairness, integrity and rigour with each decision for all our stakeholders. Further information about Archie’s skills, experience and suitability for the role of Chairman can be found under ‘Succession & Induction’ on page 39.

On 5 May 201 7 we were pleased to announce the appointment of Archie Norman as Non-Executive Chairman with eff ect from 1 September 201 7 . Over 6 5 % of those who c omplet ed the programme went on to ﬁ nd work, either with M&S or other employers. The business has a framework with clearly identiﬁ ed individuals capable of covering key management roles on an interim or permanent basis. BOARD CHANGES In September 201 6, we announced that Laura Wade-Gery would not be returning to the business following her maternity leave. The policy remains largely unchanged from that approved by shareholders in 20 1 4; for transparency, where amendments have been made these are highlighted. > Financial performance measures comprise at least 50% of awards and may include, but not be limited to Group PBT after adjusted items. > Typically, no payment for individual objectives can be earned unless a ‘threshold’ level of Group PBT after adjusted items has been achieved. 60 MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC DIRECTORS' REPORT: GOVERNANCE FIGURE 2: POLICY TABLE Executive directors may be in receipt of awards under share plans outside of the current remuneration framework detailed on pages 58 and 59; these may have been awarded upon recruitment or prior to their appointment as an executive director. In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all non-executive directors are subject to annual re-election by shareholders at our AGM. Half of any bonus would be deferred into shares for three years and this is included in the value shown. Performance impacted by reduction in promotional and markdown activity leading to below target UK LFL Clothing & Home revenue growth of -3.4%. As shown in Figure 1 7 below, performance for these awards is measured against EPS, ROCE and cumulative free cash ﬂ ow.

As was reported at the time, Laura received monthly payments of eight months' salary and beneﬁ ts, which were subject to mitigation. All may attend the Committee meetings by invitation but are not present for any discussions that relate directly to their own remuneration. Options granted to directors under the Save As You Earn (SA YE) and Executive Share Option Schemes are shown on page 73. These take place at key points in the year to all Head Offi ce, distribution centre and store management employees. In preparing these ﬁ nancial statements, the directors are required to: > Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.

Capitalised software development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected economic lives, normally between three and ten years. Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of tangible non- current assets (including investment properties), less estimated residual values on a straight line basis as follows: > Freehold land – not depreciated. This credit largely arises following a decision to retain two logistics warehouses within the network which had previously been identiﬁ ed for closure. The Partnership holds £1.6bn (last year £1.6bn) of properties which have been leased back to Marks and Spencer plc at market rates. Includes £5.3m (last year £3.6m) of money market deposit held by Marks and Spencer plc in an escrow account Non-current unlisted investments are carried as available-for-sale assets. Group Treasury hedges these exposures principally using forward foreign exchange contracts progressively based on dynamic forecasts from the business. The equity impact shown for foreign exchange sensitivity relates to derivative and non-derivative ﬁ nancial instruments hedging net investments.
