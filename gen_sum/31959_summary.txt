permit (formerly mlhp-7 block) was awarded an exploitation authorisation in july 2014. the production sharing contract based permit has a term of 20 years with an option to extend for a further ten years. with a strong cash balance and a deferred consideration structure in place post completion of the etinde farm- out transaction, no debt or outstanding work programme commitments, the group is well placed financially to progress its existing asset base. our discussions with vog to date have suggested that there are limited prospects of negotiating more favourable commercial terms. in bomono, we have maintained the farm-in option with victoria oil & gas plc (vog), which allows us to leverage their infrastructure, but as a non- operator. we have an unleveraged balance sheet, strong

cameroon a significant milestone will be the commencement of appraisal drilling in 2018, key to ensuring that etinde’s full potential will be maximised. the cameroon authorities have agreed that the appraisal drilling programme for two wells is to proceed and that, provided 500 bcf of resource is set aside for future domestic gas opportunities, a commercially viable floating lng project will be supported if reserves are sufficient. the 500 bcf resource would be utilised for domestic projects such as fertiliser and gas-to-power schemes. the net resource figures are summarised in the table

libraries, community projects, religious organisations, universities/colleges and other social groups. in the future, this risk will be mitigated by better communication with shareholders and developing closer relationships. these risks are common and must be managed whether an asset is operated or non-operated. the group has retained access to technical support through ad hoc contracts with previous employees. contacts with banks, existing shareholders and potential investors are being maintained to facilitate this should it prove necessary. the group includes anti-bribery and corruption compliance provisions in all contracts entered into with third parties. currently, the group does not undertake oilfield operations and, therefore, has a low staffing level. the internal control system can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. the board does, however, approve an internal audit programme annually under which various specific reviews of business activities are carried out. responsibilities for organising these reviews, including utilising external consultants as appropriate and reporting back, are assigned within the organisation. on behalf of the board eli chahin chief executive officer 7 november 2017 chris ashworth chairman bowleven plc annual report and accounts 2017 15 strategic report corporate
