With a strong cash balance and a deferred consideration structure in place post completion of the Etinde farm- out transaction, no debt or outstanding work programme commitments, the Group is well placed financially to progress its existing asset base. Our discussions with VOG to date have suggested that there are limited prospects of negotiating more favourable commercial terms. In Bomono, we have maintained the farm-in option with Victoria Oil & Gas Plc (VOG), which allows us to leverage their infrastructure, but as a non- operator. We have an unleveraged balance sheet, strong cash position and are carried for two appraisal drills. A right-sized organisation, London-based, that is fit for purpose Withdrawal from new exploration activity De-risk Bomono Develop existing asset – Etinde Relentless focus on capital discipline Bowleven plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 07 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements OPERATING REVIEW Progressing our Assets in Cameroon A significant milestone will be the commencement of appraisal drilling in 2018, key to ensuring that Etinde’s full potential will be maximised. The Cameroon authorities have agreed that the appraisal drilling programme for two wells is to proceed and that, provided 500 bcf of resource is set aside for future domestic gas opportunities, a commercially viable Floating LNG project will be supported if reserves are sufficient. The 500 bcf resource would be utilised for domestic projects such as fertiliser and gas-to-power schemes. The net resource figures are summarised in the table below: Net Contingent Resources P90 P50 P10 Mean Gas (bscf) 91 187 332 194 Condensates (mmbbls) 8 19 41 20 LPGs (mmbbls) 3 7 10 7 Oil (mmbbls) 0 1 3 1 Total boe (mmboe) 26 58 109 60 Bowleven plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 10 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Providing Support to the Community Bowleven’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities cover donations to charities, libraries, community projects, religious organisations, universities/colleges and other social groups. This deferred consideration (2016: $54.7m) is recognised as a current asset on the Group Balance Sheet at 30 June 2017. In the future, this risk will be mitigated by better communication with shareholders and developing closer relationships. These risks are common and must be managed whether an asset is operated or non-operated. Contacts with banks, existing shareholders and potential investors are being maintained to facilitate this should it prove necessary. The Group includes anti-bribery and corruption compliance provisions in all contracts entered into with third parties. Currently, the Group does not undertake oilfield operations and, therefore, has a low staffing level. The internal control system can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Board does, however, approve an internal audit programme annually under which various specific reviews of business activities are carried out. Responsibilities for organising these reviews, including utilising external consultants as appropriate and reporting back, are assigned within the organisation. On behalf of the Board Eli Chahin Chief Executive Officer 7 November 2017 Chris Ashworth Chairman Bowleven plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 15 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT Delivering Value for All Shareholders 2017 has been a transformative year for Bowleven, both in terms of its Board and its operating model. They shared their analysis of the Group’s historic strategy, which had pursued expensive and unsuccessful exploration activities that resulted in significant value destruction to shareholders. With David Clarkson, we were a newly constituted Board, determined to refocus the Company’s strategy on maximising value from our existing Bowleven is now better aligned to delivering long-term value for all shareholders and the operating model and balance sheet strength will ensure that can happen. The Company’s overhead base has been substantially reduced with new exploration activity costs virtually eliminated. He thereafter led O’Melveny & Myers’ European M&A business and was Head of Corporate Finance at Lovells. Chris has a particular reputation for corporate governance having been included in the Law Firm Directories. He was elected to the Bowleven Board in March 2017, and shortly thereafter became Chief Executive Officer.

The Remuneration Committee is currently comprised of Chris Ashworth (Chair), Joe Darby and Matt McDonald. In addition, market announcements, including Group operational updates, are also released, as and when appropriate, to update shareholders on activities.

Shares acquired to meet awards under these share based compensation plans are held by the EBT. The fair value of warrants issued is determined in accordance with IFRS 2 based upon a valuation model. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 2017 Africa $’000 2017 Other $’000 2017 Group $’000 2016 Africa $’000 2016 Other $’000 2016 Group $’000 Administrative expenses (1,737) (9,734) (11,471) (737) (7,693) (8,430) Depreciation (13) (236) (249) (424) (231) (655) Impairment (45,589) – (45,589) (122,305) – (122,305) Unsuccessful exploration costs – – – (11,816) – (11,816) Foreign exchange gain 7 2,865 2,872 (400) 13,905 13,505 Interest income – 745 745 – 432 432 (Loss)/gain for the year (i) (47,332) (6,360) (53,692) (135,682) 6,413 (129,269) Capital expenditure 4,620 291 4,911 42,471 385 42,856 Non-current assets (ii) 172,704 171 172,875 214,118 404 214,522 Segment assets 216,856 86,100 302,956 276,310 88,031 364,341 Segment liabilities (514) (997) (1,511) (1,651) (715) (2,366) (i) Segmental result.

Tax losses will be carried forward and are potentially available for utilisation against taxable profits in future years. The asset will be recognised in future periods when its recovery (against appropriate taxable profits) is considered probable. These contractual arrangements had a ‘longstop’ date of 30 June 2017, which VOG has extended with our agreement to 31 December 2017. There are currently few other potential development partners in Cameroon for an asset of this size and nature. Our discussions with VOG to date have suggested that there is little or no prospect of improving on the above commercial terms. To the extent any contractual arrangement is agreed and a possible valuation determination is possible on any royalty structure, or indeed Bowleven’s 20% equity in the Bomono PSC, then an impairment reversal may be merited at that time. The operatorship of Etinde transferred to NewAge on that date with Bowleven retaining a 25% non-operated interest. The investment in Bowleven New Ventures Limited was assessed to have a recoverable amount of zero as at 30 June 2017 and 2016. 16 Trade and Other Payables Group Company 2017 $’000 2016 $’000 2017 $’000 2016 $’000 Trade payables 154 489 117 524 Amounts due to Group undertakings – – – 513 JV creditors and accruals 377 1,050 – – 531 1,539 117 1,037 Other taxation and social security 591 199 526 190 Accruals 389 628 354 561 1,511 2,366 997 1,788 Group: The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 30 June based on contractual undiscounted payments: 2017 2016 Less than one month $’000 Greater than one month $’000 Total $’000 Less than one month $’000 Greater than one month $’000 Total $’000 Trade payables 154 – 154 489 – 489 JV creditors and accruals 377 – 377 1,050 – 1,050 531 – 531 1,539 – 1,539 Due to the expiry of the block 11B licence in Kenya on 26 May 2016, no repayment will be made in respect of funding received from First Oil and accordingly, no liability is recorded.
