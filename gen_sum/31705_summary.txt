Our businesses Tamdown provides a range of specialised infrastructure and engineering services to the UK housebuilding sectors. Tamdown’s operations are focused on the South East of England and London. As previously reported, the EU Referendum caused a slowdown in tendering activity and delays to customers awarding new contracts during the second half of 2016 with a corresponding delay to work commencing on site. The Group’s organic growth strategy is focused on four key drivers: increasing market share within current geographies, expanding into new geographies, diversification into new growth sectors and leveraging customer relationships to enhance cross-selling within the Group. In order to do this our strategic priorities are focused on increasing market share within existing geographies, expansion into new regions, diversifying into new growth sectors and leveraging TriConnex as the UK’s leading provider of utility connections, to maximise opportunities for Tamdown. We believe one of Nexus’ differentiating factors is our culture and commitment to customer service. We’re confident that both Tamdown and TriConnex will benefit from this landscape of structural undersupply in housing, Government stimulus for the sector and a drive to increase volumes from customers operating in the affordable housing market. Revenue (£m) Operating profit (£m) Gross profit (£m) Mike Morris Chief Executive Officer Alan Martin Chief Financial Officer We are pleased to present the executive review for the Group for this year ended 30 September 2017. The Board believes that this investment can support Tamdown’s growth over a number of years. Tamdown works with the majority of the quoted housebuilders, who account for approximately 50% of total private new build volumes (compared to approximately 32% in 2005) with this dominance expected to continue as they work through their land bank and develop larger schemes. Outlook Tamdown has an established market position, providing quality services to nine of the top ten UK housebuilders. Nexus Infrastructure plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017 10 Tamdown has a very established market position having been in operation for over 40 years The backdrop of Government stimulus to counter the housing supply deficit provides us with confidence that our customers will continue to demand our services Office staff 92 Site staff 541 Market highlights • supply vs demand imbalance • >250k new households against 148k new builds • Government stimulus including Help to Buy, Home Building Fund and Affordable Homes programme • South East of England more economically resilient New households (2016) >250k New builds (2016) 148k Source: DCLG, Construction Products Association Nexus Infrastructure plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017 11 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Executive review continued TriConnex Financial and operating performance Revenue for TriConnex increased by 26.3% to £29.5m (2016: £23.3m). The fibre connections market is not a regulated activity and independents have always been able to provide them. There has been significant Government support to roll out super-fast fibre across the country, including new residential and commercial developments. This has been built through having a deep understanding of its customers’ needs, drawing on the Group’s expertise in residential developments, being more service focused and user-friendly than competitors, as well as by providing fast and reliable delivery.

Shareholders Track record of delivering growth, profits and cash generation, enabling a progressive dividend policy. Nexus Infrastructure plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017 15 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Nexus’ mission is to be recognised as the leading provider of essential infrastructure services in the UK, by delivering outstanding performance through a focus on innovation and customer service. As such, TriConnex gets a unique opportunity to see future developments months in advance of the usual sales cycle experienced by Tamdown. As Nexus operates an integrated business development strategy, the Group is able to share customer intelligence with Tamdown, which can then benefit by targeting customers more selectively and in advance of typical tender windows. In addition, our systems are under constant review by external bodies promoting best practice. Nexus Infrastructure plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017 18 People Investing in the workforce Nexus believes in success through its employees with a dedicated in-house HR team providing structured learning, development and development opportunities. Communication The Group regularly provides its employees with information on matters of concern to them. We consult with our employees in order to ensure that their views can be taken into account when making decisions. In February 2016, the Group gained ISO 50001 accreditation to ensure Energy Saving Opportunity Scheme (“ESOS”) compliance. We see this as a journey for us alongside our clients and suppliers. Should subcontractors not be available at the time required, delays may occur, increasing costs and so reducing profitability.
