Getting there faster doesn’t mean paying a small fortune – our flexible and competitive fares are designed with everyone in mind, from early planners to spontaneous types. Margins are very tight in regional aviation, for both airports and airlines, as our results amply demonstrate, so raising distortive charges does not help either businesses or consumers. t he government for example says that the proposed new runway at l ondon Heathrow will facilitate more u K domestic routes. As announced on 18 th April 2017, Philip de Klerk will leave us at the end of September 2017, primarily for personal reasons. Corporate governance In line with the standards of best practice and regulations, we have made a separate statement on page 65. o ur digital transformation will empower us with industry standard solutions to attract more passengers, improve the customer journey and optimise our revenue per seat. Despite this reduction, Flybe was named as the best u K airline for punctuality by o AG in January 2017, placing us sixth worldwide. t he adjusted loss includes the following one-off items: > £4.3m intangible assets write-off; > £0.5m accelerated amortisation for intangible assets with a reduced useful economic life; > £(3.6)m bonus accrual released on assessment of 2015/16 performance conditions; and > £(4.2)m deferred income released following a detailed review of historic balances. In June 2017 we signed Heads of t erms for a new franchise and joint venture alliance with eastern Airways. Flybe – europe’s leading regional airline has a long relationship with birmingham Airport and continues to be one of our largest customers. Investing in digital transformation and delivering the best possible experience for our customers are key elements of Flybe’s strategic plan. Most of our customers prefer to fly from local airports as it offers them convenience, easy access and a time saving opportunity. t he new routes offer convenient transfers with Flybe’s codeshare partners – emirates, Virgin Atlantic, etihad Airways and Singapore Airlines – plus connections onto the extensive Star Alliance network serving 44 global destinations directly from l ondon Heathrow. Flying is by far the most cost-effective, quickest and hassle-free way to make this journey on a regular basis.

Environment Flybe has always made a commitment to environmental sustainability and operates one of the most environmentally-sensitive fleets in aviation. Flybe understands that noise from any aircraft can have a major impact on local communities living and working close to airports. It is also the current At R derivative and has many enhanced features which reduce its environmental impact. t he Group has also adopted the GHG Protocol Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard, but Flybe is not as yet able to report on all categories that may be relevant.

It is anticipated that salary increases will generally be in line with those awarded to salaried employees as a whole. Awards can be granted as conditional shares or a nil/ nominal cost option vesting subject to the achievement of three-year performance conditions. A post- vesting holding period also applies, such that vested shares are not receivable in full until the fifth anniversary of grant. Further details of measures, their weighting and targets will be disclosed in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration. There is a three-year time bar on this malus provision, i.e. no award can be lapsed if the trigger event comes to light more than three years after its occurrence. It may, however, be necessary in some cases to make buy-out awards on terms that are more bespoke than the existing arrangements. Awards are not forfeitable during any subsequent holding period (but may be available for the application of malus). Sir Timo Anderson and elizabeth McMeikan’s service agreements expire in 2017 but both have agreed with the c ompany to extend their appointments for a further three-year period. We have also evaluated the accuracy of useful economic lives and residual valuations, including assessing external source data for similar assets. t heir quantification can involve complex data flows and in some cases judgment on the likely volume of rejected transactions.
