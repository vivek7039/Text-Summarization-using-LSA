Our responsible approach We have a diverse supply chain, sourcing materials from across the world to produce soft drinks. However, we aim to encourage positive behaviour change and recognise that our brands can play a powerful role in supporting this ambition. Through franchising, export and licensing, Britvic has also been growing its reach into other territories, particularly the United States. 08 www.britvic.com Having visited some of our sites I am extremely impressed by the tenacity, passion and commitment that they have demonstrated. Both Sue and Ian have extensive multinational experience that has benefited the Board since they joined in recent years. Whilst we anticipated a weaker final quarter, it was worse than expected due to the poor weather in July and August. Our recent innovations, which we believe offer significant future growth opportunities, have performed well and now represent 5.4% of total revenue. Purdey’s, a healthier, more natural energy drink, is resonating with consumers and increased its retail value by 55% this year. This ready-to-drink format offers naturally sourced ingredients and no added sugar, enabling consumers to enjoy tasty, healthy hydration at only 55 calories per bottle. This, combined with our continued focus on revenue and cost management, means we remain confident of making further progress next year.

Our selection, training, development and promotion policies ensure equal opportunities for all employees regardless of factors such as age, disability (including colleagues who become disabled during service), gender (including gender reassignment), marital status, pregnancy and maternity, race, nationality, religion or belief, or sexual orientation.

It is a public limited company domiciled in England & Wales and its ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except where measurement of balances at fair value is required as explained below. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of three to seven years on a straight line basis. Trademarks, franchise rights and customer lists Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at the fair value of consideration paid. An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill, at fair value at the date of acquisition, if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, the fair value of any consideration received is also included in shareholders’ equity. Transfer prices between reportable segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. Cash flows are based on the latest approved budgets and forecasts (in most cases this is periods beyond one year). This amount has been disclosed separately to demonstrate the impact of foreign exchange movements which are included in interest bearing loans and borrowings.
