introduction i am honoured to have the opportunity to write to you as we report our full year results for 2017 having been appointed as chairman in september. review of the year our 2017 results delivered a solid growth in revenue to £1,540.8m (2016: £1,431.3m), despite continued challenging market conditions. 08 www.britvic.com having visited some of our sites i am extremely impressed by the tenacity, passion and commitment that they have demonstrated. in october we announced a proposal to close our norwich site with the loss of 242 roles. both sue and ian have extensive multinational experience that has benefited the board since they joined in recent years. strategic report governance financial statements additional information britvic plc annual report and accounts 2017 09 chief executive’s statement capitalise on existing and future opportunities simon litherland chief executive officer this year we have continued to make good progress delivering our long-term strategic goals. despite a highly competitive grocery market, pepsi max has continued to gain volume and value share and we have seen an excellent performance from the r whites brand, following the introduction of a premium range last year. whilst we anticipated a weaker final quarter, it was worse than expected due to the poor weather in july and august. warm weather during the school holidays is particularly beneficial to our portfolio of still brands. we have continued to benefit from a strong performance in our portfolio of immediate refreshment packs, while in the leisure channel we have won or retained major accounts such as mitchells & butlers, marston’s and kfc. our recent innovations, which we believe offer significant future growth opportunities, have performed well and now represent 5.4% of total revenue. purdey’s, a healthier, more natural energy drink, is resonating with consumers and increased its retail value by 55% this year. this ready-to-drink format offers naturally sourced ingredients and no added sugar, enabling consumers to enjoy tasty, healthy hydration at only 55 calories per bottle. there is pressure on disposable incomes, unemployment has remained high and so people have been cutting back. profit after tax is a statutory measure and takes into account one-off costs that have been incurred. in addition, fruit shoot has continued to grow, benefiting from the recent introduction of new flavour variants and the launch of a higher-juice fruit shoot range called fruizeo, that uses spring water and has no added sugar. realise global opportunities in kids, family and adult categories after a very successful first year in brazil, we have seen the well-publicised macro environment challenges have an adverse effect on consumer spending and fmcg categories. our london site is now fully operational with a new flexible pet line and on-site warehouse completed. this, combined with our continued focus on revenue and cost management, means we remain confident of making further progress next year. simon litherland chief executive officer 28 november 2017 strategic report governance financial statements additional information britvic plc annual report and accounts 2017 13 market review responding to the trends shaping our markets gb off-trade (carbonates and stills) £3.7bn carbonates value, £4.0bn stills value we offer a broad portfolio in gb. typically, it is available for different channels through different suppliers and will cover a large part of the market but does not provide 100% coverage of all soft drinks sales as some retailers do not participate in the data collection exercise. collectively, these trends have driven reformulation and innovation in the soft drinks market on a significant scale. the three major outcomes of these trends dominating the market include: 1. greater demand for healthier choices 2. a drive towards premium options 3. convenience: more choices of soft drinks available in more places 1 healthier choices for several years, consumers have been embracing healthier lifestyles and they are actively choosing ‘better for you’ soft drinks options, as well as drinking less alcohol. at the same time, obesity levels globally are rising putting significant strains on public health services and prompting calls for governments to take action. as a result, both the uk and irish governments will be introducing a soft drinks industry levy (sdil) on drinks with more than 5g/100ml of added sugar in april 2018. how is britvic helping consumers make healthier choices? macro trends around socialising and declining alcohol consumption are also driving greater demand for premium soft drinks options, with one in five people now tee-total, and one in three limiting or reducing their alcohol consumption. robinsons is a great example of how we’re constantly moving into new occasions and innovating to meet new consumer trends; a journey which started in 2015 with the launch of squash’d to target consumers on the go. another interesting example is purdey’s which meets increasing consumer demand for natural energy solutions. in brazil we have extended our geographic reach through the acquisition of bela ischia, where we will exceed the planned r$10m cost synergies simon litherland chief executive officer britvic plc annual report and accounts 2017 21 strategic

financial statements additional information making healthier 20bn over 20bn calories removed from gb diets on an annualised basis through reformulation since 2013 our strategy in action: squash’d with 0% sugar and no artificial flavours and preservatives, it provides a healthier choice on the go. the advantage survey is an independent report providing insight into customer service direct from retailers, and benchmarking against our peers. for example, we launched robinsons refresh’d, a low-calorie, all natural juice drink in the uk. • over 20 billion calories have been removed from gb diets on an annualised basis through reformulation since 2013. • we have a mix of ‘asset light’ franchise and business acquisitions, which also reduces our exposure to this risk. • successful launch of fruit shoot in são paulo, now being rolled out to other cities. risk description our business depends on purchasing a wide variety of materials and services from across the world. • dedicated central teams to oversee quality and supplier assurance, working closely with the business units. failure to comply with such requirements could have a signiﬁ cant impact on our reputation and incur ﬁ nancial penalties. governance integrating sustainability across the business is fundamental to achieving our trusted and respected ambitions. health concerns, including obesity, affect all our markets and consumer habits are changing in favour of healthier options. by being a good employer and neighbour, we can help create communities where people flourish. with increasing global consumption of resources, sources are diminishing, which could have significant cost and operational implications for our business. • reduce the carbon emissions relative to production across our global manufacturing sites by 15% vs 2016 baseline. our business was built on bringing an affordable source of vitamins to consumers at a time when diets lacked important nutrients. our leading approach to reformulation has seen us remove over 20 billion calories from gb diets on an annualised basis since 2013. across our global portfolio we have reduced the average calories per 250ml serve by over 6% since 2014 (excluding brazil). in ireland, 79% of our own brand portfolio will be exempt from the proposed sugar tax. in the united states, we launched fruit shoot hydro, offering healthy hydration with no added sugar and zero calories. our selection, training, development and promotion policies ensure equal opportunities for all employees regardless of factors such as age, disability (including colleagues who become disabled during service), gender (including gender reassignment), marital status, pregnancy and maternity, race, nationality, religion or belief, or sexual orientation. we have put in place a range of initiatives to deliver our ambitions, including focus groups to understand how our people feel about diversity and supporting international women’s day celebrating the women we have within the business. our board level gender diversity changed this year to 14% female and 86% male with the departure of joanne averiss. we also celebrated some standout achievements this year, including our sites in beckton gb and bricfruit france, which achieved an impressive record of three years without a lost time accident. our 2020 commitment: all employees have access to wellbeing programmes that support healthier lifestyle choices employee wellbeing goes beyond just ‘wellness’ and we recognise that it is a complex blend of the physical, psychological, social and relationship aspects of employees’ working lives. in ireland, we were one of the first companies to achieve ibec’s keepwell™ mark, an evidence based accreditation award to recognise the positive steps we have taken as an employer in support of our employees’ health and wellbeing. this foundation has been specifically designed to further britvic’s heritage in supporting local communities and social projects. we work closely with our packaging suppliers, and through the supply chain investment programme in gb we have avoided 308 tonnes of primary plastic bottle packaging by moving products onto our new bottling lines and accessing lighterweight bottles. this year, working alongside pepsico, we have trialled the inclusion of rpet in our bottles. britvic plc annual report and accounts 2017 39

ensuring that appropriate safeguards are in place for individuals to raise issues with the board where a breach of conduct or compliance, including any ﬁ nancial reporting irregularity, is suspected.

absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. • material areas of signiﬁ cant judgement have been given due consideration by management and reviewed with the external auditors. a particular focus during this year has been on defining the company’s risk appetite. whistleblowing the group’s ‘whistleblowing’ policy contains arrangements for an independent external service

limited company domiciled in england & wales and its ordinary shares are traded on the london stock exchange. the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except where measurement of balances at fair value is required as explained below. the carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount. assets classified as held for sale are presented separately beneath current items in the consolidated balance sheet. these costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of three to seven years on a straight line basis. trademarks, franchise rights and customer lists intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at the fair value of consideration paid. following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation or impairment losses. an intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill, at fair value at the date of acquisition, if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. when financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, which is normally the transaction price, plus directly attributable transaction costs for those financial assets not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. the fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. britvic plc annual report and accounts 2017 105 strategic report governance financial statements additional information notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3. accounting policies (continued) pensions and post retirement benefits the group operates a number of pension schemes. all differences are taken to the consolidated income statement, except when hedge accounting is applied and for differences in monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the group’s net investment in a foreign operation. where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, the fair value of any consideration received is also included in shareholders’ equity. the group is committed to supporting its trademarks and invests in significant consumer marketing promotional spend. transfer prices between reportable segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. as at 1 october 2017 these intangible assets have a remaining useful life of up to 7 years. cash flows are based on the latest approved budgets and forecasts (in most cases this is periods beyond one year). additionally £9.2m of impairment from prior years was reversed on the ballygowan brand in britvic ireland. this amount has been disclosed separately to demonstrate the impact of

dollar and sterling-brazilian real rates of exchange. additionally cash generation from euro-denominated operations can be utilised to meet euro payment obligations in sterling denominated companies, providing a natural hedge. as at 1 october 2017 the group has hedged 75% (2016: 74%) of forecast net exposures 12 months in advance using forward foreign exchange contracts. this policy restricts the investment of surplus funds and entering into derivatives to counterparties with a minimum credit rating maintained by either moody’s, standard & poors or fitch. the level of exposure with counterparties at various ratings levels is also restricted under this policy. to hedge this risk the group has entered into equity derivatives against future scheme maturities. equity derivatives are measured using share prices and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts. britvic plc annual report and accounts 2017 133 strategic report governance
