global footprint, with 66 production sites based on six continents, giving us close proximity to our customers. overall, despite experiencing headwinds relating to signiﬁ cant raw material price increases and some temporary increased inter-company sourcing costs, the group saw a 24.2% increase in reported trading proﬁ t (16. throughout the year we faced notable inﬂ ationary pressures from signiﬁ cant price increases in several key raw materials. these initially impacted our advanced refractories business, but subsequently price rises were also experienced in the steel flow control and foundry businesses. we responded proactively to the pressure placed on our business making good progress in recovering cost inﬂ ation through higher selling prices by year-end. we remain conﬁ dent that these will enable us to create value and deliver sustainable proﬁ tability for our shareholders. vesuvius remains an intrinsically cash-generative business and we saw strong cash generation throughout 2017 , ending the year with a stronger balance sheet than in previous years. i would also like to thank françois wanecq for his exceptional commitment in leading vesuvius over the past 1 2 years. as a result, the process of price adjustment will continue into 2018, until realised cost increases have been fully recovered. we do not exclude the results of businesses acquired and disposed from this calculation, as capital efﬁ ciency is an important consideration in our portfolio decisions. during 2017 , cash contributions of £12.6m (2016: £10.8m) were made into the deﬁ ned contribution

advanced refractories business services other high-temperature industries such as primary aluminium, copper, cement, petrochemicals and energy from waste. an increased focus on value-added solutions in niche segments like steel ﬁ nishing also allowed us to achieve good momentum during the period. in the developed markets of europe and north america, we are experiencing a greater demand for higher quality refractories. our long-standing presence and local manufacturing capabilities position us well to take advantage of future growth opportunities in india. there are two key elements of vesuvius’ t echnical services strategy: ﬁ rstly, the digital services business unit, which focuses on incubating our data capture technologies, and, secondly, the other business units which play a critical role in integrating these products into our broader consumables offering as well as ensuring customer access. in addition, mould audit services, using our unique xma t™ device, in combination with computerised ﬂ ow modelling, provide our steel customers with an ‘expert eye’ inside the mould, allowing them to gain an intimate understanding of liquid behaviour as steel is cast by using each of these technologies, customers can focus on critical parameters within their processes, enabling them to reﬁ ne their production methods to improve quality, lower production costs and maximise efﬁ ciency. for advanced refractories, laser technology business process metrix has a key role to play in the development of its technical services offering. therefore, we see signiﬁ cant growth potential

group ﬁ nancial statements company ﬁ nancial statements overall materiality £7 .6 million £7 .6 million how we determined it 5% of proﬁ t before tax and separately reported items (‘headline proﬁ t before tax’) 1% of total assets, capped to the level of group overall materiality rationale for benchmark applied we believe that proﬁ t before tax and separately reported items (‘headline proﬁ t before tax’) provides us with an appropriate basis for determining our overall group materiality given it is a key measure used by users of the ﬁ nancial statements. tcja was introduced very rapidly, and consequently there is much uncertainty about how some of the provisions will operate. as guidance is given by the us t reasury department on how these, and other provisions of tcja, are to
