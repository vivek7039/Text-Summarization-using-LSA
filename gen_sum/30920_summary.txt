The Advanced Refractories  business also supplies  other high-temperature  industries such as primary  aluminium, copper, cement,  petrochemical and energy  from waste. Manufacturing capital  We have a global footprint,  with 66 production sites based on six continents,  giving us close proximity to our customers. Overall, despite  experiencing headwinds relating to  signiﬁ cant raw material price increases  and some temporary increased  inter-company sourcing costs, the Group  saw a 24.2% increase in reported trading  proﬁ t (16. Throughout the year we faced notable  inﬂ ationary pressures from signiﬁ cant  price increases in several key raw  materials. These initially impacted our  Advanced Refractories business, but  subsequently price rises were also  experienced in the Steel Flow Control  and Foundry businesses. We responded  proactively to the pressure placed on  our business making good progress in  recovering cost inﬂ ation through higher  selling prices by year-end. We remain conﬁ dent that these will  enable us to create value and deliver  sustainable proﬁ tability for our  shareholders. Vesuvius remains an intrinsically  cash-generative business and we saw  strong cash generation throughout 2017 ,  ending the year with a stronger balance  sheet than in previous years. I would also like to thank François  Wanecq for his exceptional commitment  in leading Vesuvius over the past 1 2 years. As a result, the process  of price adjustment will continue into  2018, until realised cost increases have  been fully recovered. We do not exclude the results  of businesses acquired and disposed  from this calculation, as capital efﬁ ciency  is an important consideration in our  portfolio decisions. During 2017 , cash  contributions of £12.6m (2016: £10.8m)  were made into the deﬁ ned contribution  plans and charged to trading proﬁ t. Corporate Activity Late in 2017 , we made a strategic  investment in Sapotech Oy, a Finnish  technology company with which we will  be jointly developing predictive analytical  service offerings to Steel customers. It is also illustrated in our  T echnical Services strategy: developing  sensors, software tools and techniques to  £33.2m Spend on R&D 2016: £28.6m 2.0% % of Revenue 2016: 2.0% 14 . These can then be used by  R&D departments across our business  to foster new product or process  development projects. This  positions Vesuvius well to support our  customers in facing the future challenges  of automation and a greater focus  on quality.

Our Solution  A T ransfer of Technology team was  formed inside Vesuvius before the  ﬁ rst Castrip® machine commenced  production in China. In addition, Vesuvius’  Advanced Refractories business services  other high-temperature industries such  as primary aluminium, copper, cement,  petrochemicals and energy from waste. An increased focus on value-added  solutions in niche segments like steel  ﬁ nishing also allowed us to achieve  good momentum during the period. There are two key elements of Vesuvius’  T echnical Services strategy: ﬁ rstly, the  Digital Services business unit, which  focuses on incubating our data capture  technologies, and, secondly, the other  business units which play a critical role in  integrating these products into our  broader consumables offering as well as  ensuring customer access. In addition, mould audit services,  using our unique XMA T™ device, in  combination with computerised  ﬂ ow modelling, provide our Steel  customers with an ‘expert eye’ inside  the mould, allowing them to gain an  intimate understanding of liquid  behaviour as steel is cast By using each of these technologies,  customers can focus on critical  parameters within their processes,  enabling them to reﬁ ne their production  methods to improve quality, lower  production costs and maximise  efﬁ ciency. For Advanced Refractories,  laser technology business Process Metrix  has a key role to play in the development  of its technical services offering. Therefore, we see signiﬁ cant  growth potential in markets where  industrial development continues to  gather momentum, particularly certain  parts of Eastern Europe and Asia.

The team developed a  road safety action plan, safe driving policy,  training for speciﬁ c categories of drivers and  updated car pool process.

It is anticipated  that the Board will convene on seven occasions during 2018,  holding ad hoc meetings to consider non-scheduled business  if required. Having reviewed this, the Board believes that Hock’s  additional commitments do not prevent him from properly  fulﬁ lling his duties as a Non-executive Director of Vesuvius plc. He was the Finance Director of IMI plc  for nine years prior to that and has worked in various ﬁ nancial  roles throughout his career. > The Remuneration Policy approved in 2017 states that, whilst  an individual’s performance is reviewed annually, changes to  base salary are normally appraised over a two or three-year  period.

The Group consolidates ﬁ nancial information through  reporting from its components which include divisions and  functions at these sites. Based on our professional judgement, we determined  materiality for the ﬁ nancial statements as a whole as follows: Group ﬁ nancial statements Company ﬁ nancial statements Overall materiality £7 .6 million £7 .6 million How we determined it 5% of proﬁ t before tax and separately  reported items (‘Headline proﬁ t before tax’) 1% of total assets, capped to the level of Group  overall materiality Rationale for benchmark  applied We believe that proﬁ t before tax and  separately reported items (‘Headline proﬁ t before  tax’) provides us with an appropriate basis for  determining our overall Group materiality given  it is a key measure used by users of the ﬁ nancial  statements. TCJA was introduced very rapidly, and consequently there is much uncertainty about how  some of the provisions will operate. As guidance is given by the US T reasury Department on how these, and other provisions of TCJA, are to operate, Vesuvius’ tax  position may be impacted. Eligibility for this rate is reviewed on a regular basis by the Chinese tax authority,  and was worth approximately £0.9m in 2017 (2016: £1.0m). The cash ﬂ ows are discounted to their current value using pre-tax discount rates, which represent each  CGU’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC). In assessing goodwill for impairment, management performed its annual test at 31 October 2017 which is consistent with  the prior year. Financial Risk Management 27.1 Accounting policy  (a) Non-derivative ﬁ nancial instruments Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. For grants with market-based conditions attached to them, fair value is measured using a form of stochastic option  pricing model. Where insurance cover exists for any of these known or probable costs, a related asset is recognised in the Group Balance  Sheet only when its value can be reliably measured by management.
