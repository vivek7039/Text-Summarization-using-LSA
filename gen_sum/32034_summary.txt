our business frontier’s objective of transitioning to a business-to-consumer video game developer with multiple self-published revenue generating franchises has been successfully completed. the launch of our second franchise, planet coaster, combined with continued strong performance from elite dangerous drove a step-up in all financial measures. we have established a scale-up plan to achieve our next step which includes investments in people, organisation, geographical distribution and facilities. to support these plans we took a strategic investment from tencent in july 2017, raising £17.7 million. david gammon non-executive chairman 7 september 2017 david gammon non-executive chairman strategic report frontier developments plc annual report and accounts 2017 03 creating franchises in 2013 we set out our plan to transition the business from work-for-hire to multi-franchise self-publication. four years later i am delighted with our achievements; we have overcome a number of challenges to transform our business model with two successful franchises, planet coaster and elite dangerous already in the market, and more to come. today the games market is split into three roughly comparable sectors by revenue: pc, console and mobile. in contrast the mobile sector is overcrowded, so success can be a lot more hit-and-miss. our strategic objective is to create long-term sustainable growth through success in a multi-franchise self-publication business model. our strategic focus is on two key areas: • developing our business to achieve repeatable success; and • creating and managing franchises further detail is set out in the strategy section of this report, but i’d like to briefl y comment on the fi rst area. frontier developments plc annual report and accounts 2017 04 we believe that developing our business to achieve repeatable success requires scale. our commercial partners now include valve inc (with its steam platform), humble store and the distribution channel teams at both microsoft and sony; we are also excited to be partnering with universal on the jurassic world evolution project. these events were in turn supported by major updates for each game as we followed our strategy of continuing to further enhance the experiences they deliver. all future franchises will be selected using the same approach described above that was used for elite dangerous, planet coaster and jurassic world evolution. horizons will continue to be sold as a substantial expansion product with all content available at the time of purchase. we believe each product in the franchise offers great value, and our further in-game monetisation avoids ‘pay-to-win’ game mechanics. this update strategy is intended to further improve perceived quality and sentiment by adding signiﬁ cant long-term new features. spring update april 2017 added security guard staff members and go-karts tracked rides for players to use in their parks, along with more rides, coasters, scenarios and further management improvements, as well as doubling the maximum size of blueprints that can be shared via steam workshop to 4,000 pieces. 1.38 strategic report frontier developments plc annual report and accounts 2017 11 our franchises continued our third franchise, jurassic world evolution, was identiﬁ ed using the same approach described above that we used for elite dangerous and planet coaster. self-publishing revenue accounted for 97% of sales (fy16: 99%) with the balance being related to our legacy work-for-hire business. frontier’s scale-up plans, which include significant investments in people and facilities, are fully supported by existing financial resources. we review our security provisions regularly and believe them to be in accordance with industry best practices. alex joined frontier from xaar plc (ftse: xar), a world leader in industrial inkjet technology, where he was chief financial officer from february 2011. prior to this, alex

that can be utilised generically are separately identified. a deferred tax asset is currently not being recognised in full due to the unpredictability of future taxable trading profits. impairment of property, plant and equipment at each balance sheet date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its individual property, plant and equipment for any indication that these assets have suffered an impairment loss. revenue from pre-orders of games and crowdfunding for self-published titles is normally deferred, then recognised when the group meets its performance obligations. the majority of amortisation charges for intangible assets are expensed with research and development expenses. a small proportion of amortisation charges for third party software is charged to administrative expenses. the forward contracts are considered by management to be part of economic hedge arrangements but have not been formally designated. the group’s management considers all financial assets, not impaired, for each reporting date to be of good credit quality, including those past due. in respect of trade and other receivables the group is exposed to significant credit risk for a single counterparty. the group manages its liquidity needs by carefully monitoring forecast cash inflows and outflows due in day-to-day business. reconciliation of operating profit to cash generated from
