The launch of our second franchise, Planet Coaster, combined with continued strong performance from Elite Dangerous drove a step-up in all financial measures. We have established a scale-up plan to achieve our next step which includes investments in people, organisation, geographical distribution and facilities. To support these plans we took a strategic investment from Tencent in July 2017, raising £17.7 million. DAVID GAMMON NON-EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN 7 September 2017 DAVID GAMMON NON-EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN STRATEGIC REPORT FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 03 CREATING FRANCHISES In 2013 we set out our plan to transition the business from work-for-hire to multi-franchise self-publication. Four years later I am delighted with our achievements; we have overcome a number of challenges to transform our business model with two successful franchises, Planet Coaster and Elite Dangerous already in the market, and more to come. The games sector is growing fast, increasing at 8% per year, with TV experiencing a decline of 8%. Today the games market is split into three roughly comparable sectors by revenue: PC, console and mobile. In contrast the mobile sector is overcrowded, so success can be a lot more hit-and-miss. Our strategic objective is to create long-term sustainable growth through success in a multi-franchise self-publication business model. Our strategic focus is on two key areas: • developing our business to achieve repeatable success; and • creating and managing franchises Further detail is set out in the strategy section of this report, but I’d like to briefl y comment on the fi rst area. FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 04 We believe that developing our business to achieve repeatable success requires scale. Our commercial partners now include Valve Inc (with its Steam platform), Humble Store and the distribution channel teams at both Microsoft and Sony; we are also excited to be partnering with Universal on the Jurassic World Evolution project. We have further expanded the addressable audience for Elite Dangerous by launching on PlayStation 4 in June 2017. These events were in turn supported by major updates for each game as we followed our strategy of continuing to further enhance the experiences they deliver. We participate in price promotions on each of the distribution platforms we use for each of our games as appropriate to its life-cycle stage, allowing us to reach the widest possible audience. We use this repeatable model to invest our resources with the intention of creating world-class games with strong franchise potential, and plan for strong post-launch franchise support to further help realise this potential. All future franchises will be selected using the same approach described above that was used for Elite Dangerous, Planet Coaster and Jurassic World Evolution. We are building a broad portfolio of franchises, each different to the last, and each with the capabilities to expand over time, as we have already seen with Elite Dangerous and Planet Coaster. Horizons will continue to be sold as a substantial expansion product with all content available at the time of purchase. We believe each product in the franchise offers great value, and our further in-game monetisation avoids ‘pay-to-win’ game mechanics. STRATEGIC REPORT FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 09 Continued expansion after a successful launch In addition to major free expansions, in July 2017 we released our ﬁ rst paid downloadable content (PDLC) for Planet Coaster. As with Elite Dangerous, this follows an in-game monetisation model that avoids ‘pay-to-win’ mechanics. This update strategy is intended to further improve perceived quality and sentiment by adding signiﬁ cant long-term new features. SPRING UPDATE APRIL 2017 Added security guard staff members and go-karts tracked rides for players to use in their parks, along with more rides, coasters, scenarios and further management improvements, as well as doubling the maximum size of blueprints that can be shared via Steam workshop to 4,000 pieces. 1.38 STRATEGIC REPORT FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 11 OUR FRANCHISES CONTINUED Our third franchise, Jurassic World Evolution, was identiﬁ ed using the same approach described above that we used for Elite Dangerous and Planet Coaster. Self-publishing revenue accounted for 97% of sales (FY16: 99%) with the balance being related to our legacy work-for-hire business. Frontier’s scale-up plans, which include significant investments in people and facilities, are fully supported by existing financial resources. Whilst there will unavoidably be some level of staff turnover, the Group believes that its attractive project portfolio, talented staff and good quality leadership make Frontier a place where talented people want to build their careers. We review our security provisions regularly and believe them to be in accordance with industry best practices. MARKET DISRUPTION The Group operates in a fast moving industry where competitive products, larger competitors, new market trends or disruptive technology may emerge which reduce its ability to compete and execute its business plan. Prior to this, Alex rose to VP Finance of Cambridge fabless semiconductor company CSR plc during a 10 year period during which CSR listed on the main market, and grew significantly both organically and through acquisition. In addition the Group has a revolving credit facility with Barclays Bank plc of £4 million. The Company has one class of Ordinary Shares which carries no right to fixed income. • Alex Bevis purchased 15,000 Ordinary Shares at an average price of 292.22 pence before joining Frontier in April 2017. On 1 July 2016, Jonathan Milner stepped down as Non-Executive Director and Charles Cotton was appointed in his place. The Audit Committee is open to attendance by any Director and reports its key issues at Board meetings. Approximately half of the time at Board meetings is set aside for Core Strategic issues. At least two meetings a year have extended time allowed where the focus is predominantly on Core Strategic issues. No Director is permitted to participate in discussions or decisions concerning their own remuneration. Such systems can only provide a reasonable but not absolute level of assurance against material misstatement or loss. This participatory element is an important aspect of the Group’s culture and its focus on long-term performance. From 1 June 2017 a new bonus scheme has been established for all employees, including the Executive Directors. It is anticipated that following this two year period, the Company will return to a more typical annual bonus scheme but with similar performance based characteristics.

This investment was by way of a share issue and supports the company growth projections for investing in future franchises. • IFRIC Interpretation 22 “Foreign Currency transactions and advance considerations” (issued on 8 December 2016) (effective 1 January 2018) (not yet endorsed). • Amendments to IFRS 2 “Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions” (issued on 20 June 2016) (effective 1 January 2018) (not yet endorsed). It applies to all contracts with customers, except those in the scope of other standards. Early adoption is permitted if IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ has also been applied. Development costs of software tools within a project that can be utilised generically are separately identified. Intangible assets are subject to amortisation and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, for example, a decision to suspend a self-published title under development. A deferred tax asset is currently not being recognised in full due to the unpredictability of future taxable trading profits. The estimated useful lives of current development projects are between three and five years. Impairment of property, plant and equipment At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its individual property, plant and equipment for any indication that these assets have suffered an impairment loss. Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. Revenue is measured by reference to the fair value of consideration received or receivable. Revenue from pre-orders of games and crowdfunding for self-published titles is normally deferred, then recognised when the Group meets its performance obligations. The majority of amortisation charges for intangible assets are expensed with research and development expenses. A small proportion of amortisation charges for third party software is charged to administrative expenses. The forward contracts are considered by management to be part of economic hedge arrangements but have not been formally designated. The Group’s management considers all financial assets, not impaired, for each reporting date to be of good credit quality, including those past due. In respect of trade and other receivables the Group is exposed to significant credit risk for a single counterparty. The Group manages its liquidity needs by carefully monitoring forecast cash inflows and outflows due in day-to-day business.
