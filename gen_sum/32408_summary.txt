04/08/2017 10:12:25 25474.04 – 4 august 2017 10:12 am – proof 7 ceo’s report continued the uk financial services sector experienced a tougher environment with recruitment process outsourcing (rpo) challenges affecting contract margins within the sector. overall there has been an increase in permanent billings, with demand for mid and senior level hires. the uk general insurance market saw increased competition by rpo companies impacting on contract delivery and margins. during the year there have been new technology platform programmes and digital distribution activity requiring specialist skills. we continue to address this by ensuring that businesses focus on servicing high value verticals in their current markets. it is likely to have an ongoing effect on the permanent hiring outlook within australia.the digital and technology disruption is beneficial in the sectors nakama provides staff to, specifically within analytics, data, digital and transformation. there has been an appetite for the range of human resource consultancy services that nakama is starting to provide in the region and we see this as an essential differentiator of nakama’s product offering going forward. the business has addressed this by refocusing its internal talent acquisition strategy and approach across all regions. paul worked alongside rob sheffield for many years in aquent where he built their digital marketing recruitment team through both organic growth and acquisition. john was chief executive of the group until april 2000 when he took up his current role. he has been a

the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 march 2017. business model the group provides recruitment services and solutions to its specialist niche market clients in global geographical locations where there is both growing demand and a skills shortage. we have been able to focus our efforts on building talent communities through recommendations, referrals, local advertising and highly specialised peer groups. in a service company it is essential to maintain client relationships and build new business. office locations nakama has offices in the uk (2), australia (2), hong kong, singapore and new york. the changing social media world also creates competition, companies now having moved towards in-house recruitment models continue to drive down margins in sectors that have become more commoditised. we have seen a small increase in competition which operates along some of nakama’s service lines within our markets. it is also the case that we have seen some traditional competitors in local markets cease trading due to lack of scale and reach. the intranet site includes information on policies and procedures relating to their employment at nakama group plc. a resolution to reappoint bdo llp as auditors will be proposed at the annual general meeting. regular strategy meetings are held to review the group’s forward planning - vital in a rapidly
