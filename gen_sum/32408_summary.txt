Our clients need to feel confident before making a permanent or contract hire and political events during the last financial year, including Brexit and the US presidential election caused a slowdown in decision making in some sectors. The UK business was restructured from a service provision and operational standpoint in Q3 last year. Headcount remained stable but the business did not meet its hiring targets internally. OVERVIEW STOCK CODE: NAK | NAKAMA GROUP PLC WWW.NAKAMAGROUPPLC.COM 3 Nakama Group AR 2017 Proof 7.indd 3 04/08/2017 10:12:25 25474.04 – 4 August 2017 10:12 AM – Proof 7 CEO’S REPORT CONTINUED The UK financial services sector experienced a tougher environment with Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) challenges affecting contract margins within the sector. Overall there has been an increase in permanent billings, with demand for mid and senior level hires. The UK general insurance market saw increased competition by RPO companies impacting on contract delivery and margins. During the year there have been new technology platform programmes and digital distribution activity requiring specialist skills. We continue to address this by ensuring that businesses focus on servicing high value verticals in their current markets. It is likely to have an ongoing effect on the permanent hiring outlook within Australia.The digital and technology disruption is beneficial in the sectors Nakama provides staff to, specifically within analytics, data, digital and transformation. There has been an appetite for the range of human resource consultancy services that Nakama is starting to provide in the region and we see this as an essential differentiator of Nakama’s product offering going forward. The business has addressed this by refocusing its internal talent acquisition strategy and approach across all regions. The business does benefit from having global operations and is focused on a sector that is in high demand, which has been beneficial to attracting staff from a variety of industries and locations.

Business model The Group provides recruitment services and solutions to its specialist niche market clients in global geographical locations where there is both growing demand and a skills shortage. We have been able to focus our efforts on building Talent Communities through recommendations, referrals, local advertising and highly specialised peer groups. Linked-in, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram are a few of the channels we currently utilise. In a service company it is essential to maintain client relationships and build new business. Office locations Nakama has offices in the UK (2), Australia (2), Hong Kong, Singapore and New York. The changing social media world also creates competition, companies now having moved towards in-house recruitment models continue to drive down margins in sectors that have become more commoditised. Competitors are now starting to look closely at the markets we operate in. We have seen a small increase in competition which operates along some of Nakama’s service lines within our markets. It is also the case that we have seen some traditional competitors in local markets cease trading due to lack of scale and reach. We differentiate ourselves by being highly specialised, delivering a solution to clients’ issues globally. The intranet site includes information on policies and procedures relating to their employment at Nakama Group plc. A resolution to reappoint BDO LLP as auditors will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

The Group has funding arrangements with its principal bankers, linked to receivables, which are on a revolving basis. Accounting policies continued Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable for services provided during the accounting period net of trade discounts and value added tax. Other intangible assets Computer software included at cost is amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life of two years. The amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate valuation techniques. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Deferred tax assets are recognised in the statement of financial position only where it is probable that suitable taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised. Exchange differences arising from this policy are recognised directly in the currency reserve via other comprehensive income. The Group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment (see note 12). All revenue is derived from the supply of recruitment and human resource services.

Impairment tests are undertaken annually on 31 March using value in use calculations for each CGU. The large revenue growth rate in the next financial year is based on: historical staff performance, a more focused strategy, new business from new hires and a more diversified portfolio of offerings. The carrying values are considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value. No sublease income is expected as all assets held under lease agreements are used exclusively by the Group. Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profit, bank borrowings and invoice discounting. Cash deposits are non-interest bearing unless placed on money markets at overnight rates. The Group is therefore exposed to changes in interest rates primarily through its invoice discounting facility. Credit risk The Group’s principal financial assets are cash deposits and trade receivables. Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history. Options over 4,141,060 ordinary shares were granted on 21 November 2008 at an exercise price of 1.25 pence per share.
