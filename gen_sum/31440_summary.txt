Vitec is focusing on the opportunity to develop and commercialise innovative, high end accessories for these new applications.

We remain focused on further cross-selling of brands across the Group, especially to our Independent Content Creator customers. All products are manufactured by third parties with proprietary tools and sold globally through the Vitec Imaging Distribution network. This process has posed significant challenges and delays for the broadcast industry as television stations will need to complete channel moves. These technologies range from traditional mechanical engineered products, for example manual camera supports, through to electronics and software. I instantly saw myself walking through the woods, climbing mountains and making a fashion statement with my friends. Here, I get to work alongside people with the same appreciation for innovative hardware/software designs, providing both an exciting and fulfilling environment for me to be in.” Tony Mendoza Q&A Engineer, Teradek, Creative Solutions (Irvine, US) “Vitec has given SmallHD and its employees growth opportunities they would have never had otherwise. My co-workers are incredibly talented in their disciplines and being in this culture where we are empowered to explore new technologies is terrific.” Victor Chen, Senior Electrical Engineer – Technologist, Production Solutions (Chatsworth, US) “My role at Vitec’s head office allows me to focus on the detail of each Division’s financial performance, made possible by a culture of open communication across the Group. I enjoy coming to work for the positive environment and the huge variety in work, which is more interesting every day as Vitec evolves and grows.” Charlie Hutchinson, Head of Financial Planning & Analysis, Group, (Richmond, UK) “Working for Vitec’s Imaging Solutions Division is very rewarding. Camera and Imaging Productions Association (“CIPA”) data has shown a slightly positive trend for full year shipments of interchangeable lens cameras (“ILC”). Gitzo, our premium brand, celebrated its 100 year anniversary and continues to be the favoured choice for professional photographers. This will bring the total Vitec SKUs ranged by Apple to 12, with different variations in each store and online. Examples of award-winning new products include the unique, carbon-fibre Flowtech tripod, Litepanels Gemini LED lights and Autoscript IP Prompting. Dual-branded Sachtler and Vinten, Flowtech is a set of two-stage carbon fibre tripod legs with quick release brakes. The mini-rig captured broadcast quality footage, day and night, of multiple flights over a three month period, running for up to five hours from its own airline-safe Anton/ Bauer batteries. Our strategy in this Division has been to rationalise all in-house manufacturing into two sites - Bury St. Edmunds, UK and Cartago, Costa Rica. Operational Review Creative Solutions further expanded its offering of higher technology products to the Independent Content Creator segment in 2017. This market has shown continued strong growth with drivers including the proliferation of online platforms such as Netflix which have generated a need for original content. New products launched in the year include HEVC encoders, daylight viewable on-camera monitors and Serv Pro, a dedicated iOS monitoring solution. Corporate development Vitec’s Creative Solutions Division comprises five entrepreneurial companies which mainly serve the rapidly growing Independent Content Creator market with higher technology products. Early in 2018, SmallHD also launched its first touchscreen, high-definition video monitor for use with small, low profile cameras like DSLRs and mirrorless. We produce the majority of our products in-house and work with selected, market leading partners for specialist solutions. Acquisitions and disposals We buy businesses that provide a good return with clear synergies such as extending our technological, product or geographic footprint. Our overall dependence on key suppliers has increased as a result of the Group’s decision to reduce its costs by outsourcing some manufacturing and assembly activities. Vitec’s largest customer accounted for 11.9% of revenue from continuing operations which is marginally higher than in previous years. We may also incur additional cost from any legal action that is required to protect our intellectual property. We have also sold our Bury St. Edmunds site and will move these activities to a lean, modern manufacturing facility in H1 2018. RTMotion is a high technology business which provides wireless motor lens control systems for broadcast, cine and video cameras. The Group operates strict controls over all treasury transactions including clearly defined currency hedging processes to reduce risks from volatility in exchange rates. • Our Imaging Solutions Division’s Picture of Life Programme offers disenfranchised young people the chance to learn professional photography skills. Now in its fourth year, we celebrated the programme’s achievements with a global exhibition tour that will continue into 2018. • Wooden Camera, part of our Creative Solutions Division, contributed specialist skills and equipment to the North Texas University film school. More informal communications also take place around the various divisions: breakfast with the CEO is an informal opportunity for employees in our Imaging Solutions Division to exchange ideas and express opinions on current business strategies; in our Production Solutions US office, “Time Out” is a monthly activity combining social time including quizzes and food with Vitec updates. The new site at Bury St. Edmunds, UK, which is due to open in H1 2018, has been developed following a detailed consultation with staff. Since April 2014 in the UK, all employees except for those who have expressly opted out, are auto-enrolled into a qualifying pension plan. 46 The V itec Group plc “ Team building event at Imaging Solutions “ Engineering technicians at work in our Costa Rican facility Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Corporate Responsibility Corporate Governance Financial Statements 47 Community & Economic Contribution Our vision T o strengthen, support and integrate with the local communities and economies where we operate. We also encourage a culture of environmentally sustainable behaviour at work and ensure that our employees understand how they can contribute. Other buildings have programmable thermostats that are centrally managed to optimise the building’s heating and cooling needs. The electricity contracts with Green Certificates at our two main sites in Italy were renewed last year until 2021, confirming Vitec’s commitment to use energy generated by renewable sources. We sort waste for recycling at our sites in Italy, the UK and Costa Rica using colour coded bins to improve segregation. Lorraine held the role of President, Meggitt Customer Services & Support until 2017, with responsibility for all centralised aftermarket operations since 2013. On 22 February 2018 we announced that Mark Rollins would leave the Board as a Non-Executive Director with effect from 2 April 2018. We also announced that Richard Tyson will join the Board as a Non-Executive Director with effect from 2 April 2018. Our online governance training module has been completed by all new senior joiners during 2017, notably newly acquired businesses.

This ensures the Board has sufficient time to deal with strategic matters while retaining oversight on salient points by virtue of its Committees. Martin Green’s induction was more finely tailored on account that he has been with the Group for over ten years. Mark Rollins will cease to be a director on 2 April 2018 and has not been included in the table below. Richard Tyson has been appointed as a Non-Executive Director with effect from 2 April 2018 and will be standing for re-election at the 2018 AGM. The Board’s composition, skills and expertise were also rated favourably, with strong governance processes underpinning its performance. Chairman Members Caroline Thomson Christopher Humphrey Lorraine Rienecker Mark Rollins During 2017 the Remuneration Committee had three scheduled meetings. • Major strategic, operational, financial, regulatory, compliance and reputational risks are formally assessed during the annual long-term business planning process around mid-year. This contains the following key elements: - an organisational structure with clearly defined lines of responsibility, delegation of authority and reporting requirements; - defined expenditure authorisation levels; - an operational review process covering all aspects of each business conducted by Group executive management on a regular basis throughout the year; 63 Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Corporate Responsibility Corporate Governance Financial Statements - a strategic planning process identifying key actions, initiatives and risks to deliver the Group’s long-term strategy; and - a comprehensive system of financial reporting including weekly flash reports, monthly reporting, quarterly forecasting and an annual budget process. This was earlier than expected due to a number of business changes that I explain in more detail below. Caroline Thomson Chairman, Remuneration Committee 21 February 2018 * This report provides alternative performance measures (“APMs”) which are not defined or specified under the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). Executive Directors are entitled to a range of benefits including car allowance, private health insurance and life assurance. However, benefits are set at an amount which the Committee considers to be appropriate, based on individual circumstances and local market practice. At threshold, 25% of the award will vest, increasing on a straight-line basis up to 100% for performance in line with maximum. Benefits To reimburse Non-Executive Directors for reasonable expenses incurred and bear any costs associated with tax, where relevant. There have been no other significant distributions and payments required to be disclosed that would assist in understanding the relative importance of spend on pay. This is lower than the materiality we would otherwise have determined by reference to company net assets, and represents 0.1% (2016: 0.3%).
