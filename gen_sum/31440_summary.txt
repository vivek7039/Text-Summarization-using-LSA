financial statements group chief executive’s review vitec operates in the fast-growing, global “image capture and sharing” market. these, coupled with the experience and knowledge of our people, enable us to develop ground-breaking new products. 2017 was a transformational year for vitec as we significantly reshaped our portfolio through disposals and acquisitions. we remain focused on further cross-selling of brands across the group, especially to our independent content creator customers. apac is the fastest growing region for vitec, and we see further growth opportunities in this area. our creative solutions division further expanded its higher technology products with the acquisition of rtmotion. all products are manufactured by third parties with proprietary tools and sold globally through the vitec imaging distribution network. 09 annual report & accounts 2017 strategic report corporate responsibility corporate governance financial statements group chief executive’s review investing in manufacturing excellence focussed on safety, quality, efficiency, cost and on-time delivery, manufacturing excellence is one of vitec’s core competitive strengths. we operate competitive, flexible manufacturing operations which deliver premium products and reliability to our markets. we continue to implement initiatives aimed at sustainability and protecting the environment across all of our locations. our new automatic aluminium tube cutting and punching machine is capable of producing one tube every four seconds, is seamlessly linked to the new assembly lines and gives a high throughput of consistently high quality products. this tube machine received its industry 4.0 certification at the end of 2017. bury st. edmunds, uk vitec centre of excellence for robotics and flowtech vitec’s production solutions division will relocate its bury st. edmunds operation into a new, purpose-built site nearby in h1 2018. replacing the 50-year old existing factory, the new facility will specialise in advanced technology in areas such as robotics, automation and broadcast studio equipment for our vinten and sachtler brands. we are in the process of consolidating our manufacturing operations from shelton, us to costa rica. our products typically attach to, or support, a camera – primarily for broadcast, cinematic, pro-video and photographic applications. vitec’s ability to offer products that reduce the capital expenditure requirements of broadcasters and in turn reduce their investment risk, is increasingly attractive, notably through savings offered by our lower cost vinten robotic heads and litepanels led lighting solutions. this process has posed significant challenges and delays for the broadcast industry as television stations will need to complete channel moves. this project has led to unexpected additional capital investments in core transmission technologies and has led to some uncertainty by us broadcasters and impacted investment in other broadcast technology, including vitec’s us studio products from our production solutions division. this dynamic market has been transformed over the past decade and will continue to change. these technologies range from traditional mechanical engineered products, for example manual camera supports, through to electronics and software. i instantly saw myself walking through the woods, climbing mountains and making a fashion statement with my friends. everything is presented in front of me as if it was lying open on a table. here, i get to work alongside people with the same appreciation for innovative hardware/software designs, providing both an exciting and fulfilling environment for me to be in.” tony mendoza q&a engineer, teradek, creative solutions (irvine, us) “vitec has given smallhd and its employees growth opportunities they would have never had otherwise. my co-workers are incredibly talented in their disciplines and being in this culture where we are empowered to explore new technologies is terrific.” victor chen, senior electrical engineer – technologist, production solutions (chatsworth, us) “my role at vitec’s head office allows me to focus on the detail of each division’s financial performance, made possible by a culture of open communication across the group. i enjoy coming to work for the positive environment and the huge variety in work, which is more interesting every day as vitec evolves and grows.” charlie hutchinson, head of financial planning & analysis, group, (richmond, uk) “working for vitec’s imaging solutions division is very rewarding. camera and imaging productions association (“cipa”) data has shown a slightly positive trend for full year shipments of interchangeable lens cameras (“ilc”). gitzo, our premium brand, celebrated its 100 year anniversary and continues to be the favoured choice for professional photographers. it also supplies an expanding range of premium accessories for smartphones, action cameras and drones. we have also launched a number of new products to market, including more compact and versatile tripods. precision assembly, high quality materials and fine control are all qualities that represent gitzo products. this will bring the total vitec skus ranged by apple to 12, with different variations in each store and online. over the last four years we have invested significantly to develop an efficient distribution network to grow our business in apac and this is proving successful, driven primarily by millennials and the growing chinese middle class. examples of award-winning new products include the unique, carbon-fibre flowtech tripod, litepanels gemini led lights and autoscript ip prompting. dual-branded sachtler and vinten, flowtech is a set of two-stage carbon fibre tripod legs with quick release brakes. the gemini soft panel produces true, full-spectrum white light with manual and remote control options. our engineers completely redesigned the prompting system around an ip-enabled workflow, with a scalable architecture. the mini-rig captured broadcast quality footage, day and night, of multiple flights over a three month period, running for up to five hours from its own airline-safe anton/ bauer batteries. for me, autoscript achieves all three flawlessly.” dan stark, chief engineer of nbc station ktvh “this level of versatility in a tripod’s design (flowtech) is going to disrupt the industry.” filipe deandrade, wildlife director of photography annual report & accounts 2017 strategic report corporate responsibility corporate governance financial statements 23 operational review improving the core the main strategic focus in our production solutions division remains to “improve the core” and we have a clear plan to drive operational efficiencies and further enhance margins through continued improvements to purchasing, inventory management, manufacturing and leveraging synergies. our strategy in this division has been to rationalise all in-house manufacturing into two sites - bury st. edmunds, uk and cartago, costa rica. we are in the process of moving our manufacturing operations from shelton, us to costa rica. operational review creative solutions further expanded its offering of higher technology products to the independent content creator segment in 2017. this market has shown continued strong growth with drivers including the proliferation of online platforms such as netflix which have generated a need for original content. new products launched in the year include hevc encoders, daylight viewable on-camera monitors and serv pro, a dedicated ios monitoring solution. this reflects higher volumes offset by increased investment in sales and marketing to drive sales of our legacy products and increased investment to develop new products which has positioned us well for the future. corporate development vitec’s creative solutions division comprises five entrepreneurial companies which mainly serve the rapidly growing independent content creator market with higher technology products. the freedom they give us means we’re always ready to shoot, and for a documentary on student athletes for netflix, capturing in the moment is what we’re all about.” terry zumalt, director of photography “the bolt 3000 allows me to have cable free monitoring on all my shots that often could not be viewed via a traditional cable connection because of camera set up. it also gives me freedom of movement to move around the set or location and view images privately, giving me the head space i need to create the shot.” brett danton, director “from a rental house perspective, wooden camera always finds a way to make our lives easier by creating intelligent and durable products that seamlessly integrate with every camera system we have in our inventory. lastly, teradek released the bond backpack, a completely new bonded cellular streaming solution for network broadcasters that combines cutting edge hevc video compression with teradek’s own node lte modems, all packed in an ergonomic, lightweight pack. early in 2018, smallhd also launched its first touchscreen, high-definition video monitor for use with small, low profile cameras like dslrs and mirrorless. this year, smallhd and teradek joined forces to create a wireless monitoring device for directors. we produce the majority of our products in-house and work with selected, market leading partners for specialist solutions. this includes regular forecasts to ensure that the financial performance is clearly understood and appropriate targets are set. acquisitions and disposals we buy businesses that provide a good return with clear synergies such as extending our technological, product or geographic footprint. 32 the v itec group plc » continued to develop products and solutions for independent content creators, including: - teradek cube hevc encoders – small, power-efficient encoders

principal risks and uncertainties specific risk mitigation demand for vitec’s products demand for our products may be adversely affected by many factors, including changes in customer and consumer preferences and our ability to deliver appropriate products or to support changes in technology. our increased online presence creates it security and compliance challenges which the group is continually addressing. our overall dependence on key suppliers has increased as a result of the group’s decision to reduce its costs by outsourcing some manufacturing and assembly activities. we review the performance of strategically important suppliers and outsourced providers globally on an ongoing basis. vitec’s largest customer accounted for 11.9% of revenue from continuing operations which is marginally higher than in previous years. we may also incur additional cost from any legal action that is required to protect our intellectual property. the main restructuring projects are now substantially complete, and have already started to generate year-on-year savings. in addition, we continually aim to identify and implement operational synergies between the different business units. this year corporate costs of £12.9 million have been reported separately rather than being allocated to the divisions. the group operates strict controls over all treasury transactions

imaging solutions division to exchange ideas and express opinions on current business strategies; in our production solutions us office, “time out” is a monthly activity combining social time including quizzes and food with vitec updates. the new site at bury st. edmunds, uk, which is due to open in h1 2018, has been developed following a detailed consultation with staff. since april 2014 in the uk, all employees except for those who have expressly opted out, are auto-enrolled into a qualifying pension plan. this may, for example, involve training in warehouse operations, working at heights, fire safety or more general initiatives to make employees aware of the dangers that can be encountered in the execution of their various duties. in 2017 both the costa rica and shelton, us, teams within production solutions participated in the red cross blood drive, with over 65 staff opting to give blood on site during work hours at a time of severe shortages. 46 the v itec group plc “

acted as senior independent director throughout 2017 and until he ceases to be a director on 2 april 2018. notably in this role, mark led the evaluation of my performance as part of the 2017 board evaluation, information on which is provided later in this report. this ensures the board has sufficient time to deal with strategic matters while retaining oversight on salient points by virtue of its committees. we have also appointed richard tyson as non-executive director with effect from 2 april 2018 and mark rollins will cease to be a director with effect from 2 april 2018. we consider that richard tyson is independent. on appointment, we provide each director with a tailored and extensive induction to the group. she attended all board meetings and the strategy day held in june, allowing her to gain an in-depth understanding of the group, as well as a senior management conference in october attended by over 60 of our senior employees. martin green’s induction was more finely tailored on account that he has been with the group for over ten years. each director is encouraged to continue visiting the group’s operations as their schedule permits. the group company secretary maintains a register of training undertaken by directors to facilitate this discussion. the board regularly receives written updates on governance, regulatory and financial matters as they are published. working with the group chief executive and group company secretary, i ensure that directors receive papers for consideration at board meetings so that it gives all board members adequate time to read, prepare and, where appropriate, ask questions prior to the meeting. under the company’s articles, each director is required to stand for annual reappointment at every agm. mark rollins will cease to be a director on 2 april 2018 and has not been included in the table below. richard tyson has been appointed as a non-executive director with effect from 2 april 2018 and will be standing for re-election at the 2018 agm. the board’s composition, skills and expertise were also rated favourably, with strong governance processes underpinning its performance. the board set itself several objectives for 2017. these are summarised below with an assessment of performance against each. chairman members caroline thomson christopher humphrey lorraine rienecker mark rollins during 2017 the remuneration committee had three scheduled meetings. • major strategic, operational, financial, regulatory, compliance and reputational risks are formally assessed during the annual long-term business planning process around mid-year. this contains the following key elements: - an organisational structure with clearly defined lines of responsibility, delegation of authority and reporting requirements; - defined expenditure authorisation levels; - an operational review process covering all aspects of each business conducted by group executive management on a regular basis throughout the year; 63 annual report & accounts 2017 strategic report corporate responsibility corporate governance financial statements - a strategic planning process identifying key actions, initiatives and risks to deliver the group’s long-term strategy; and - a comprehensive system of financial reporting including weekly flash reports, monthly reporting, quarterly forecasting and an annual budget process. what publications has the board reviewed in consideration of compliance with internal control and risk matters? we also receive monthly reports on market and investor sentiment along with a full shareholder analysis. we operate with a rolling agenda programme, taking into account our terms of reference (which can be found on our website), the group’s annual reporting requirements and any other matters which arise on an ad-hoc basis. her induction has been extremely thorough and she provides detailed input to the audit committee. this was earlier than expected due to a number of business changes that i explain in more detail below. initial meetings were held with each firm and the group finance director, following which a number of due diligence documents were shared with each firm to allow them to gain a better understanding of our business. we will review deloitte’s performance during 2018 and provide a summary in the 2018 annual report. 67 annual report & accounts 2017 strategic report corporate responsibility corporate governance financial statements 2017 audit committee objectives progress during 2017 ensure continued appropriateness of the group’s risk management processes and that internal audit actions are aligned with critical business risks. a number of suggestions for areas to focus on have been incorporated in our 2018 objectives. progress on achievement against our 2018 objectives will be reported in next year’s annual report. caroline thomson chairman, remuneration committee 21 february 2018 * this report provides alternative performance measures (“apms”) which are not defined or specified under the requirements of international financial reporting standards (“ifrs”). this review is dependent on continued satisfactory performance in the role of an executive director. executive directors are entitled to a range of benefits including car allowance, private health insurance and life assurance. other ancillary benefits may also be provided where relevant, such as expatriate travel or accommodation allowances. however, benefits are set at an amount which the committee considers to be appropriate, based on individual circumstances and local market practice. any such use of discretion will be clearly reported in the next published remuneration report. at threshold, 25% of the award will vest, increasing on a straight-line basis up to 100% for performance in line with maximum. the committee will measure roce using a standard definition of adjusted operating profit* divided by average total assets less current liabilities excluding the current portion of interest-bearing borrowings, calculated on an average monthly basis at constant currency. benefits to reimburse non-executive directors for reasonable expenses incurred and bear any costs associated with tax, where relevant. kath kearney-croft’s bonus potential was pro-rated from her appointment date of 24 april 2017. paul hayes was not entitled to any bonus payment for 2017 due to his departure on 28 april 2017. the financial elements of the annual bonus plan for each executive director were based upon actual financial results achieved for group adjusted profit before tax* and group conversion of adjusted operating profit* into operating cash flow* (over a quarterly and full year average target) measured against financial targets set by the board. tsr is calculated on the basis of growth in the company’s share price over a three year performance period plus dividends paid during that period and is expressed as a percentage of average compound annual growth. 50% of the award will be subject to eps growth over a three year performance period. tsr is calculated on the basis of growth in the company’s share price over a three year performance period plus dividends paid during that period and is expressed as a percentage of average compound annual growth. • benefits (including car allowance, healthcare and income protection) totalling £7,542 for the period to his departure date. kath kearney-croft having been appointed group finance director on 24 april 2017 is building a shareholding towards this requirement. there have been no other significant distributions and payments required to be disclosed that would assist in understanding the relative importance of spend on pay. for any executive director appointed since 1 january 2017, the pension allowance has been set at 15% of base salary. should a director become aware that they, or their connected parties, have an interest in an existing or proposed transaction with the group, they are required to notify the board as soon as reasonably practicable. there are no material uncertainties that would prevent the directors from being unable to make this statement. this is lower than the materiality we would otherwise have determined by reference to company net assets, and represents 0.1% (2016: 0.3%). components for which specified risk focused audit procedures were performed were not individually financially significant enough to require an audit for group reporting purposes, but did present specific individual risks that needed to be addressed. based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the other information. a fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the frc’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities irregularities – ability to detect our audit aimed to detect non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations (irregularities) that could have a material
