generated from operations (2016: cash consumed £0.34 million). symphony laboratory our d 2 w oxo-biodegradable plastic technology fits in perfectly with many governments’ core principles of the 3 rs,

before tax increased by 249% to £0.43 million chief executive’s review michael laurier symphony environmental technologies plc annual report & accounts 2017 | www.symphonyenvironmental.com 06 although europe is not currently an important market for d 2 w, we note that the eu commission have taken an interest in oxo-biodegradable plastic and have asked the european chemicals agency (“echa”) to consider its environmental credentials. symphony and the oxo-biodegradable plastics association will be assisting echa with all necessary technical information, but we do not expect any conclusions for some time. our technology is proven, viable and does not significantly increase cost or disrupt the supply chain. the group self-hedges by purchasing goods in us dollars, and utilises forward rate agreements to minimise exchange risk. this was achieved by improving profits as detailed above, together with improved payment terms in one of its main markets. there are also more products for 2018, including toothbrushes, water bottles, cling film and food bags. they must use masterbatches which have been approved by saso (saudi standards, metrology and quality organisation). our d 2 w oxo-biodegradable technology has been specifically designed to be consistent with these principles. we currently have two staff members completing nvq qualifications in accountancy and office administration and two students gaining valuable experience in our laboratory as they complete their one-year placement which is an essential part of their science degree courses. michael’s career began with his long established family packaging business, brentwood sack and bag co limited. these may change over time as new risks emerge and others cease to be of concern. the group also has exchange facilities with its bank to use as and when appropriate. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. we have therefore considered revenue recognition in relation to cut off as a significant audit risk. samantha russell senior statutory
