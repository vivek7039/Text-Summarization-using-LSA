Opponents of plastic have yet to find a viable alternative which goes anywhere near performing as well as plastic for most applications, and have themselves raised concerns about food safety and food waste. Symphony has also developed a range of plastic technologies under the d 2 p (designed to protect) brand, offering extra protection from bacteria, insects, fungi, algae, odour, fouling, and fire. Finally, our d 2 t tag and trace technologies give our customers the ability to check the authenticity of products of all kinds, helping to protect brand owners from counterfeits and fraud. Symphony develops and produces a wide range of technologies, to make plastic smarter. It offers seamless integration into the manufacturing process and is added at only 1%, which means little or no extra cost. • have (during their useful life) the same characteristics as conventional polymer i.e. it is waterproof, lightweight, strong and flexible. No Toxic residues and No Microplastics Several countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East have already legislated to require everyday plastic items to be made with oxo-biodegradable technology, because it works. 03 Symphony Environmental Technologies plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 | www.symphonyenvironmental.com FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Antibacterial Fights healthcare and food industry infections.

Symphony laboratory Our d 2 w oxo-biodegradable plastic technology fits in perfectly with many governments’ core principles of the 3 Rs, “reduce, re-use, recycle”. Symphony Environmental Technologies plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 | www.symphonyenvironmental.com 05 Over the years we have established a strong distribution network with 74 distributors worldwide. The improved revenue was due to increased sales of d 2 w oxo-biodegradable plastic additives in several markets. N Deva, DL, FRSA, MEP Chairman 13 March 2018 Profit before tax increased by 249% to £0.43 million Chief Executive’s Review Michael Laurier Symphony Environmental Technologies plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 | www.symphonyenvironmental.com 06 Although Europe is not currently an important market for d 2 w, we note that the EU Commission have taken an interest in oxo-biodegradable plastic and have asked the European Chemicals Agency (“ECHA”) to consider its environmental credentials. Symphony and the Oxo-biodegradable Plastics Association will be assisting ECHA with all necessary technical information, but we do not expect any conclusions for some time. Outlook We expect to see an improving business environment where more countries legislate in favour of our type of technology, and with better enforcement in countries where legislation has already been passed. Our technology is proven, viable and does not significantly increase cost or disrupt the supply chain. The Group self-hedges by purchasing goods in US Dollars, and utilises forward rate agreements to minimise exchange risk. This was achieved by improving profits as detailed above, together with improved payment terms in one of its main markets. There are also more products for 2018, including toothbrushes, water bottles, cling film and food bags. They must use masterbatches which have been approved by SASO (Saudi Standards, Metrology and Quality Organisation). It’s great to know that d 2 w is useful even for red-tape. Our d 2 w oxo-biodegradable technology has been specifically designed to be consistent with these principles. This year we held events to support the MacMillan cancer charity, and Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospice, as well as taking part in sponsored events and a beach clean-up in Ghana. We currently have two staff members completing NVQ qualifications in Accountancy and Office Administration and two students gaining valuable experience in our laboratory as they complete their one-year placement which is an essential part of their science degree courses. Michael’s career began with his long established family packaging business, Brentwood Sack and Bag Co Limited. He is Non-Executive Director of Nordengine Capital Ltd and the Qatar Finance Centre Authority. These may change over time as new risks emerge and others cease to be of concern. The Group mitigates this risk by purchasing, where practicable, in currencies to match revenues. The Group also has exchange facilities with its bank to use as and when appropriate.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have therefore considered revenue recognition in relation to cut off as a significant audit risk. We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: • adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Symphony Environmental Technologies plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 | www.symphonyenvironmental.com 18 • the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or • certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specific by law are not made; or • we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

All amounts disclosed within note 12 in development costs relate to plastic masterbatches and other additives. Amortisation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows: Trademarks – 10 years straight line. Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows: Plant and machinery 20% reducing balance. Impairment testing of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment All individual assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. All assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. Trade receivables are measured subsequent to initial recognition at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The equity investments are measured at cost less any impairment charges, if their fair values cannot currently be estimated reliably.

All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. IFRS 9 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and has been endorsed by the European Union. The new standard establishes a control-based revenue recognition model and provides additional guidance in many areas not covered in detail under existing IFRSs, including how to account for arrangements with multiple performance obligations, variable pricing, customer refund rights, supplier repurchase options, and other common complexities. We anticipate this will have a material effect on the Group’s balance sheet.
