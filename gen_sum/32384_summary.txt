Our plans include a broad mix of potential uses including retail, leisure, entertainment, higher education and workspace alongside up to 3,500 new homes. This year, we will be launching a branded flexible workspace offer which enables us to capture incremental demand from the increasing number of small businesses taking space in London as well as meeting a growing need amongst our existing occupiers for flexible space for specific projects and teams. Consumer spending was resilient in the months following the EU referendum, but weaker sales Chris Grigg Chief Executive Officer 6 British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW data in recent months suggests that consumers are becoming more cautious with higher prices impacting disposable incomes. Retailers are also anticipating a more challenging environment, with import cost inflation, higher business rates in some areas and the National Living Wage putting pressure on margins. Looking further ahead, our medium term pipeline covers a range of uses, including office-led development in London and retail and mixed use development across the country, notably Eden Walk in Kingston where we received planning permission for our 538,000 sq ft mixed use regeneration during the year. This reflects the continuing execution of our strategy, providing space that responds to changing lifestyles and really fulfils customers’ needs. Our priorities for the year ahead Customer Orientation – Further develop customer insights – Deliver technology driven innovations Right Places – Deliver next steps of the Broadgate Masterplan – Submit Canada Water planning – Deliver flexible workspace offer Capital Efficiency – Beat budget and achieve leasing targets – Recycle capital to improve returns Expert People – Promote an inclusive, performance driven culture – Create a more customer focused organisation 8 British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED What makes British Land different? The weaker currency translates to higher input costs for retailers, with consumers potentially facing lower disposable incomes as inflation increases. In Offices, we survey office workers and engage with key decision makers from a range of businesses, providing important insight into how to improve our work spaces. Our environments are designed to reflect people’s changing lifestyles, where the distinction between work and leisure time is increasingly blurred. At 100 Liverpool Street, we are targeting the WELL Building Standard which supports wellbeing innovations that help create healthier, more productive offices. Today’s occupiers see their workspace as a tool to attract and retain key talent so our first area of focus was on what made a great place to work, with particular emphasis on ‘millennials’ who will be the principal users of our space over the coming decades. In Retail we use our detailed understanding of local catchments, demographics, spending patterns and consumer preferences to effectively target new occupiers. Our campus-based office portfolio positions us well to address this growing need, whether in respect of small and expanding businesses or larger companies requiring added flexibility. Having a single organisation responsible for all assets enables us to rapidly capture and transfer best practice learnings across our portfolio. We are active in disposing of single-let retail assets which don’t provide opportunities for us to deploy our placemaking expertise. Development and capital projects are the main ways that we can enhance our properties to better meet customers’ evolving demands and have been an Our strategic focus Offices Lifestyle orientated mixed use offices Campuses Large, office-led mixed use lifestyle campuses Retail Multi-let lifestyle centres Regional Attracting visitors from a wide catchment for a planned trip Standalone Single assets and small clusters Local Fitting into the daily life of local communities important driver of returns. The improvements have already helped attract new brands to Meadowhall including Neal’s Yard, Nespresso, Hawes & Curtis, Flannels and Ghost London. Developments have delivered some of our strongest returns, but are inherently higher risk, particularly when pursued on a speculative basis. ” Recycling capital We sold Debenhams’ flagship Oxford Street store for £400 million in July 2016 on terms agreed ahead of the referendum. We have a formal annual appraisal process for each member of our team and empower all employees to progress their careers with personal development plans. We encourage the recruitment of underrepresented ethnic minorities through our support for initiatives such as Pathways to Property, Budding Brunels and UrbanPlan UK. Vacancy rates have risen from low levels to marginally above long term averages in both the City and West End following recent development completions. In recent years we have positioned our business to benefit from the long term trends driving demand for space, by providing places which reflect people’s changing lifestyles.

This transaction is a good example of how our standalone office assets provide liquidity allowing us to develop and trade opportunistically. We are already seeing a good response from occupiers with 37 long term lettings and renewals signed here in the year. We also commenced a 66,000 sq ft leisure development at New Mersey, Speke which is largely pre-let and expect to complete the residential element of Clarges, Mayfair later this year. Construction cost forecasts continue to suggest a slowdown in the rate of growth over this year and next, despite increasing pressure on input costs. Neal’s Yard, Nespresso, Hawes & Curtis, Flannels and Ghost London all signed in the year as our £60 million (100%) refurbishment programme nears completion. This year we renewed eight Homebase leases, totalling 283,000 sq ft extending the lease term to 15 years, increasing rents and providing a significant capital uplift for our single-let portfolio. This year we staged a virtual Christmas present hunt at 21 Local and Regional centres, the largest ever augmented reality game in UK retail property. 3.5% total property return -1.8% valuation movement 1.6% ERV growth £1.2bn gross investment activity £881m retail disposals at average yield of 4.3% 790kw of solar panels across five centres, with more planned 34 British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report RETAIL PLACEMAKING CONTINUED Our Offices portfolio in London £6.3bn¹ portfolio valuation (British Land share) 98% occupancy rate 7 .8 years lease length to first break Our Offices business has had a strong year. At the portfolio level, this includes broadening the range of uses on our campuses with a higher allocation to retail and leisure, as well as delivering more flexible office space with floorplates which are easily divisible, enabling us to target a wider range of occupiers. At 4 Kingdom Street, Paddington Central, we were almost 80% under offer on the office space within a week of completion in April. We have signed a two year lease with Pergola Paddington Central for an 850-capacity pop-up dining destination on the site of 5 Kingdom Street. Our energy efficiency programme has saved occupiers £13 million gross over six years and we’re committed to using 100% electricity from renewable sources. Management also monitors EPRA NAV as this provides a transparent and consistent basis to enable comparison between European property companies. The interest rate management of joint ventures and funds is considered separately by each entity’s Board, taking into account appropriate factors for its business. Our strategy, which is based on long term trends, endures; we had already positioned the business for a range of outcomes with modest development exposure, high occupancy and robust finances. Prime yields have remained broadly stable, although market pricing is becoming increasingly polarised with some softening in demand for more secondary assets. These pressures mean that retailers are increasingly focusing on the most profitable stores, where they can grow sales with lower occupancy costs. – We maintain a comprehensive crisis response plan across all business units as well as a head office business continuity plan – The Risk Committee monitors the Home Office terrorism threat levels and we have access to security threat information services – Asset emergency procedures are regularly reviewed and scenario tested. Our income streams are secure; underpinned by a high quality, diverse occupier base with 98% occupancy and an average lease length of 8.3 years. Lord Macpherson, formerly Permanent Secretary to HM Treasury, was appointed as a Non-Executive Director in December 2016 and we have recently announced that Preben Prebensen, Chief Executive of Close Brothers Group plc, will join the Board on 1 September 2017. Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment set out the time commitments expected and each Director’s attendance record is considered when assessing whether they should stand for re-election by shareholders. Our website also provides a number of case studies for stakeholders’ information covering topics from asset profiles to sustainability activities. This is my first report as Chairman of British Land’s Remuneration Committee, having succeeded Lord Turnbull at the 2016 AGM. TAR will be measured relative to a comparator group consisting of the 17 largest FTSE property companies that use EPRA accounting (including British Land).

We also considered the reasonableness of other assumptions that are not so readily comparable with published benchmarks, such as Estimated Rental Value. For rental income balances, we then used data-enabled audit techniques to identify all standard revenue journals posted using these systems and processes.

(Jersey) Limited, a joint venture with Oxford Properties. Under the REIT regime, development properties which are sold within three years of completion do not benefit from tax exemption. At 31 March 2017 a 204 bps parallel upward shift in swap rates would increase the value of these interest rate swaps by £82m (2015/16: £151m). Trade creditors and amounts owed to joint ventures, which are repayable within one year, have been excluded from the analysis. PID dividends are paid, as required by REIT legislation, after deduction of withholding tax at the basic rate (currently 20%), where appropriate.
