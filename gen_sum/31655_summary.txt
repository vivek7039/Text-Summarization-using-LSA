Revenue continued to grow as more than 13 million customers came through our doors and enjoyed the high-quality, family friendly experience we offer. With our strong balance sheet, we are extremely well positioned for continued growth through both the existing estate and future openings. I have taken enormous pleasure in seeing this business continue to grow and develop over the past 12 months. Like-for-like growth Improvements in LFL revenue performance have been underpinned by a number of factors, including increased customer visits year-on-year. Over 60 per cent of the estate has now been refurbished with each project benefiting from those that have gone before, resulting in exceptional industry leading environments. We opened three centres in FY2017, two of which – Southampton and Derby – were organic openings, while The London O2 was an acquisition. Legal work is progressing on a number of other exciting new developments, giving us confidence in our longer term growth opportunities. We are also careful to open in only those locations that will complement our existing portfolio, rather than detract from it. These figures, and the fact that in the UK there is low penetration of bowling centres per head of population relative to some other international markets, indicate that there is significant potential for further ten-pin bowling centre roll out. An affordable leisure offering Ten-pin bowling is a competitively priced and highly accessible form of family entertainment. • Independent operators (estimated 17 per cent market share) operating single centres, which are typically smaller and situated in tertiary locations. Within these new retail and leisure developments ten-pin bowling is currently underrepresented as shown in the table above. Operations We operate high-quality centres with innovative, exciting, fun- filled products delivered by our enthusiastic and engaging team. We have a highly targeted incentive structure for our Centre Managers which is based on not only financial performance, but also customer feedback. Dynamic pricing, based on available capacity and booking lead time, has been introduced to improve yield management. In FY2017 we refurbished/rebranded ten centres and have an average return on investment (ROI) greater than 33 per cent. The success of these programmes is clear: in FY2017, 52 management positions were filled internally, a 10.6 per cent increase on FY2016.

Definition Capital expenditure on refurbishments, rebrands and new centres This does not include any maintenance capex. Comment Revenue generating capex increased by 99 per cent due to three new centres and slightly higher refurbishment spend. Definition Group adjusted EBITDA is calculated as operating profit before depreciation, amortisation, exceptional items and other income. The Group has considerable headroom on its current facilities, with gross debt significantly below market opportunity for funding. The reservations systems are now fully migrated to Microsoft Azure Cloud for added resilience and performance. We run continuous training and development courses for appropriately- qualified staff on each area in connection with their roles. This was driven by our continued focus on providing excellent customer satisfaction and environments that people want to visit more often.

Our priorities for use of cash, based on the balance sheet described above, will be: • capital investment in existing centres as well as new centre opportunities; • appropriate acquisition opportunities; • to pay and grow the ordinary dividend every year within a cover ratio of approximately 2x; and • thereafter, any excess cash will be available for additional distribution to shareholders as the Board deems appropriate. As we continued on our refurbishment and rebrand programme, this expenditure increased marginally year-on-year, by £0.1m, to £3.0m. We run several top talent development programmes, including our Assistant Manager in Training programme for team members who wish to progress into management. Almost 100 team members enrolled on this programme in 2017 , with 36 internal assistant manager appointments being made as a result.

Many fantastic events took place including ‘Togetherness Days’ and ‘Hero Pin’ evenings, during which strike-scoring customers earned a donation to their centre’s charity. Sustainability continued Local charity relationships An example of our work with local charities is the team at the Glasgow Springfield Quay centre who developed a wide ranging community programme to support Calum’s Cabin – an amazing charity which runs a holiday retreat for children with cancer. We are already benefiting from Ivan’s significant experience as a CEO in the retail and leisure sector. Following Ivan’s appointment, the Board (excluding me as Chairman) comprises a majority of independent Non- Executive Directors.
