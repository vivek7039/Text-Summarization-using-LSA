continued growth through both the existing estate and future openings. i have taken enormous pleasure in seeing this business continue to grow and develop over the past 12 months. like-for-like growth improvements in lfl revenue performance have been underpinned by a number of factors, including increased customer visits year-on-year. over 60 per cent of the estate has now been refurbished with each project benefiting from those that have gone before, resulting in exceptional industry leading environments. one of our key success criteria is being co-located with the top cinema in town. we opened three centres in fy2017, two of which – southampton and derby – were organic openings, while the london o2 was an acquisition. it is one of our smaller format concept centres designed to fit within a retail/leisure offer. legal work is progressing on a number of other exciting new developments, giving us confidence in our longer term growth opportunities. revenue growth 8.8% earnings per

customer feedback, with input from the management and support team. we have a unique product that has wide appeal across all ages, demographics and geographies. these figures, and the fact that in the

single centres, which are typically smaller and situated in tertiary locations. within these new retail and leisure developments ten-pin bowling is currently underrepresented as shown in the table

frequency of visits of existing customers and raising the spend per game. in fy2017 we refurbished/rebranded ten centres and have an average return on investment (roi) greater than 33 per cent. the success of these programmes is clear: in fy2017, 52 management positions were filled internally, a 10.6 per cent increase on fy2016. we select geographical target areas based on population catchment and a range of specific demographic measures. we agreed that a city centre location would work well, because high existing footfall was paramount. this creates a critical mass of leisure opportunities and provides customers with ways to extend their visit. the new manager has a comprehensive incentive programme in place which covers financial, operational and customer measures. 6 after months of planning and building, we are finally ready to open our all-new hollywood bowl! definition capital expenditure on refurbishments, rebrands and new centres this does not include any maintenance capex. comment revenue generating capex increased by 99 per cent due to three new centres and slightly higher refurbishment spend. definition group adjusted ebitda is calculated as operating profit before depreciation, amortisation, exceptional items and other income. comment group adjusted ebitda margin percentage increased due to revenue growth and tight cost controls. the majority of sites are based in high footfall areas that should withstand an economic downturn. the group has considerable headroom on its current facilities, with gross debt significantly below market opportunity for funding. the reservations systems are now fully migrated to microsoft azure cloud for added resilience and performance. we run continuous training and development courses for appropriately- qualified staff on each area in connection with their roles. this was driven by our continued focus on providing excellent customer satisfaction and environments that people want to visit more often. this was largely due to the administrative and employee costs associated with being a fully listed company, increased spend on marketing activity, as well as increased training and travel costs associated with our centre management leadership programmes. ebitda from new centres was encouraging this year, with both southampton and derby performing significantly above expectations. 30 september 2017 £’000 30

opportunities; • appropriate acquisition opportunities; • to pay and grow the ordinary dividend every year within a cover ratio of approximately 2x; and • thereafter, any excess cash will be available for additional distribution to shareholders as the board deems appropriate. we launched our new online learning system in 2017 to support all team members’ continuous development. we run several top talent development programmes, including our assistant manager in training programme for team members who wish to progress into management. almost 100 team members enrolled on this programme in 2017 ,

work with local charities is the team at the glasgow springfield quay centre who developed a wide ranging community programme to support calum’s cabin – an amazing charity which runs a holiday retreat
