officer’s review focused on growing recurring revenues dear shareholders overview gan is successfully established as a leading provider of enterprise-level internet gaming technology solutions to major us casino operators securing significant us market share. a multi-year extension for simulated gaming™ was agreed during the year with a consortium of casino operators in queensland, australia which have been operating simulated gaming™ focused on australia since 2015. gan and its clients stand to benefit from potential regulation of real money internet gaming which, since september 2017, became effectively prohibited as australian gaming legislation was updated to criminalise the long-standing activities of offshore internet gaming operators. this positions gan to capture significant market share in any incremental us intra-state markets which may regulate internet gaming over time, including pennsylvania, new york and michigan. aligned with the significant growth experienced in new jersey’s real money internet gaming market the group increased its focus on real money internet gaming product development, enhancements and optimisations while continuing to roll out additional new clients and product features for simulated gaming™. furthermore, the group has received indications from collaborating clients that gan’s unique simulated gaming™ platform has materially increased patrons’ visitation on-property, re-activated significant numbers of long-term inactive patrons and generally proved highly supportive of on-property real money land-based gaming. analytics form a critical support for marketers in identifying high-value customers and maximising lifetime values and these capabilities have greatly enhanced the analytics tools already available within isight back office™ as well as the efficiency of marketers using these tools daily to drive their respective businesses. marketing and support services remain a crucial component of the group’s service portfolio, ensuring any land-based casino operator can cost-effectively launch a turnkey managed internet gaming service and grow an online community extending beyond its existing audience of casino patrons.

probity record enabled us to gain entry into the new jersey market in 2013 and receive our full casino service industry enterprise licence in 2017, while many other european-based platform providers hesitated to attempt market entry. financial statements | governance | strategic report gan plc annual report and accounts 2017 13 core business offerings: real money gaming in the us, the standard european rulebook for internet gaming was replaced with a brand new set of requirements, tools and capabilities. when a us casino needs to move online, there is a very small group of potential technology vendors available to serve their needs, and an even smaller subset of companies which are b2b only and fully licensed for us internet gaming. in fact, many of the new gaming features are developed by gan first for simulated gaming™, trialled online, optimised and subsequently made available for clients using gan’s same technology to power their real money internet gaming business. we have automated code change deployment, added event-triggered player interactions and built a new mailer service. the directors regard clean ebitda as a reliable measure of profits that is not unduly subjective. adequacy of funding liquidity the group has historically been loss making with negative cash flows and this trend continued in to 2017, albeit on an improved basis. the board has stress tested future cash flows to ensure operational growth and delivery are not compromised. the group may be adversely affected by activities such as system intrusions, denial of service attacks, virus spreading and phishing. the group sources multiple payment providers to mitigate for risk of losing any single funding channel. our system also actively monitors all skill games to ensure no user can gain an unfair advantage by using bots or automated gameplay systems. over time, his role at gan expanded to include licensing, risk management, compliance auditing and anti-money laundering reporting functions. prior to joining gan, matt had worked for five years as a business development manager for internet gaming at gli (gaming laboratories international) in both europe and north america, after nearly four years with igt’s megajackpots group in reno, nevada. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. impairment reviews require significant judgement from management and are based on assumptions in respect of future profitability. we also agreed to report differences below this threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. financial statements | governance | strategic report gan plc annual report and accounts
