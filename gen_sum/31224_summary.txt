SEAMUS MCGILL CHAIRMAN 28 MARCH 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | GOVERNANCE | STRATEGIC REPORT GAN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 9 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW Focused on growing recurring revenues Dear shareholders Overview GAN is successfully established as a leading provider of enterprise-level Internet gaming technology solutions to major US casino operators securing significant US market share. This positions GAN to capture significant market share in any incremental US intra-State markets which may regulate Internet gaming over time, including Pennsylvania, New York and Michigan. Aligned with the significant growth experienced in New Jersey’s real money Internet gaming market the Group increased its focus on real money Internet gaming product development, enhancements and optimisations while continuing to roll out additional new clients and product features for Simulated Gaming™. Furthermore, the Group has received indications from collaborating clients that GAN’s unique Simulated Gaming™ platform has materially increased patrons’ visitation on-property, re-activated significant numbers of long-term inactive patrons and generally proved highly supportive of on-property real money land-based gaming. Analytics form a critical support for marketers in identifying high-value customers and maximising lifetime values and these capabilities have greatly enhanced the analytics tools already available within iSight Back Office™ as well as the efficiency of marketers using these tools daily to drive their respective businesses. Marketing and support services remain a crucial component of the Group’s service portfolio, ensuring any land-based casino operator can cost-effectively launch a turnkey managed Internet gaming service and grow an online community extending beyond its existing audience of casino patrons. GAN’s open platform has undergone significant technical developments in the last three years, providing our partners – be they operators, content providers or other services providers – with a technical ecosystem that has been awarded by EGR’s (North America) peer-juried Casino Platform Supplier of the Year in both 2015 and 2016 and Freeplay Gaming Supplier of the Year in 2016 and 2017. With the iSight Back Office™ management tool, casino operators have complete control over their content selection, player communications, website layout, process automation and real time analytics. A nimble platform ensures ease of integration for new content, operator-friendly third party tools and turnkey day-to-day operations. GAN has been working with world-leading suppliers for over seven years to bring their content online. With innovative tools for B2B casino operations, GAN has invested in growing our global managed services team to support operators as they move online. GAN’s clean probity record enabled us to gain entry into the New Jersey market in 2013 and receive our full Casino Service Industry Enterprise licence in 2017, while many other European-based platform providers hesitated to attempt market entry. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | GOVERNANCE | STRATEGIC REPORT GAN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 13 CORE BUSINESS OFFERINGS: REAL MONEY GAMING In the US, the standard European rulebook for Internet gaming was replaced with a brand new set of requirements, tools and capabilities. When a US casino needs to move online, there is a very small group of potential technology vendors available to serve their needs, and an even smaller subset of companies which are B2B only and fully licensed for US Internet gaming. These are some of the reasons driving Ocean Resort Casino’s choice to nominate GAN as their partner for Internet gaming in early 2017, leveraging the Company’s proven successful track record in delivering material market share in New Jersey for one of the world’s largest Internet sports betting and gaming companies, Paddy Power Betfair. Ocean Resort Casino becomes GAN’s second client in New Jersey and the Company’s first land-based casino in New Jersey as well as the 14th US casino operator to license the Company’s strategic US Patent in order to link their on-property rewards programme to their forthcoming GAN-powered online gaming experience. In 2017 GAN focused internal resources on delivering optimisations to real money US Internet gaming geolocation tracking, Know- Your-Customer (KYC) processes and its market-leading US payments platform in order to deliver arguably the most efficient Internet traffic ‘funnel’ to Paddy Power Betfair in the US and increase the efficiency of its substantial marketing investments. This focus on optimisations, combined with a substantial commitment to delivering more games, gaming features and excellence in technical operations, has further developed GAN’s position in the fast-growing Internet gaming market of New Jersey.

Simulated Gaming™ remains one of the most exciting business opportunities available to GAN and its clients. In fact, many of the new gaming features are developed by GAN first for Simulated Gaming™, trialled online, optimised and subsequently made available for clients using GAN’s same technology to power their real money Internet gaming business. GAN’s open platform has undergone significant technical developments in the last three years, providing our operators, content, or other services providers with a truly best-in-class technical ecosystem, awarded by EGR’s (North America) peer- juried Casino Platform Supplier of the Year in both 2015 and 2016 and Freeplay Gaming Supplier of the Year in 2016 and 2017. We have automated code change deployment, added event-triggered player interactions and built a new mailer service. The directors regard Clean EBITDA as a reliable measure of profits that is not unduly subjective. ADEQUACY OF FUNDING Liquidity The Group has historically been loss making with negative cash flows and this trend continued in to 2017, albeit on an improved basis. The Board has stress tested future cash flows to ensure operational growth and delivery are not compromised. The Group may be adversely affected by activities such as system intrusions, denial of service attacks, virus spreading and phishing. The Group sources multiple payment providers to mitigate for risk of losing any single funding channel. This is through a mixture of annual bonuses and long-term incentives such as share options. Our system also actively monitors all skill games to ensure no user can gain an unfair advantage by using bots or automated gameplay systems. It meets at least once a year with the auditors without executive directors present. No director is permitted to participate in discussions or decisions concerning his own remuneration. It meets at least once a year with the auditors without executive directors present.

Karen is a Chartered Accountant and began her career at Ernst & Young in New Zealand. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Impairment reviews require significant judgement from management and are based on assumptions in respect of future profitability. We also agreed to report differences below this threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
