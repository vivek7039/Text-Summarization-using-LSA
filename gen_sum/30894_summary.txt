an integrated business services company which drives client value and sustainable profit improvement, through the provision of increasingl y digitall y enabled solutions for regulated transactional communication and marketing execution. • the vep will be driven by three key strategic themes: digital first, global reach and empowered organisation. following successful migration of all fulfilment activity to our newcastle operation in may 2017, communisis assumed full accountability for all printed customer communications with the transition of circa 180 million packs annually into our halifax and liverpool transactional facilities beginning in october 2017. financial results outlook communisis is at an exciting stage in its development with a bedrock of solid performance and deep client relationships to build upon. through consistent and predictable performance, we continue to generate free cash which has enabled a strong dividend stream for shareholders. information design services are deployed at this stage in the communication cycle channel preference preference engines ensure we help our clients communicate with their customers across their preferred channel throughout the

report and financial statements 2017 the brand deployment division case study how this worked for a global fmcg brand before communisis, a client had a minimum of 23 touchpoints necessary to successfully deliver a project. by aligning a toolkit of the core commercial print across all brand and distribution channels, we were able to deliver a consistently qualitative commercial solution that shortened lead times and increased savings during the production of over 20 million items. 35% project cost savings, from initial 10% case study fmcg brand france understanding consumer behaviour ensuring customers continue to buy from the same brand again and again remains a critical component of success for any consumer- focused business. for this client, we developed a loyalty magazine that contained personalised coupons to encourage new purchases. a track record of growth backed by strong cash generation has been established over several years. we perform mission critical work at scale for very substantial clients across the financial services and fast-moving consumer goods (fmcg) sectors. this now established trend will have a notable effect on our transactional business over time. the three main opportunity areas we have identified are: further growth for editions in content marketing, mostly in financial services; scope to access marketing execution services under our existing master relationships with brand owners; and digital transactional communications. • empowered organisation covers a range of initiatives designed to make communisis progressively more efficient and valuable. from an organisational perspective we are fuelling this by devolving more direct p&l responsibility into the hands of our local site and country managers, empowering them to drive the profitability of their discrete business units entrepreneurially. of these, six have been in the last five years and involved on-boarding 800 new employees. • cips (chartered institute of purchasing and supply) advance standard - a leading level held by fewer than 20 organisations globally. qualifications • 80% of our senior managers are degree or masters qualified and accredited by recognised professional bodies. transitional capability • customer experience: 52 large, 72 medium and 104 small projects managed over the last 12 months with total project budgets of £21m. the performance of our business units is meticulously tracked and we are always looking for ways to improve them. demand for specialist content marketing capability, such as that provided by our editions financial business, is strong in the uk and us. brands are therefore offering more events or gift with purchase (gwp) to keep their in-store presence and increase sales. as we focus increasingly on provision of digital products and services, our competitor set has shifted somewhat. there are not yet any clear political outcomes but given our activity in the wider supply chain for staple consumer goods and employment of foreign nationals, in-country, we continue to believe that we are relatively well protected from potential negative economic impacts brexit may have. this is supported by an internal customer satisfaction survey, providing quantitative understanding of the service we deliver and assisting us to shape our future planning. through systematic selection and contracting with 3rd party vendors (the latter being increasingly pertinent as we continue to develop real time digital products), we have improved services received from our technology supply base, in addition to generating important savings in the year. in 2017 we also made significant strides with managing and developing our talent, boosted by a strong focus on personal performance management and leadership development programmes, with 32 candidates completing a leadership programme in the year. strategic priorities • new product development with greater emphasis on data analytics to support digital leadership and channel capability. where this has been largely emea marketing activation activity, we are committed to growing both our brand deployment and customer experience divisions. • increased use of technology to facilitate centralised sourcing and consistency throughout the supply chain interface. through the introduction of roamler analytics, future pos production and use will now be informed more than ever before. clients have shown an increased willingness to enter into longer contractual terms resulting in improved visibility for the group from a financial perspective. we can therefore, only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that key risks are managed to an acceptable level. international exposure to geo-political volatility and social instability may put the group operations at risk. the group operates from multiple office, inbound and manufacturing facilities which helps to mitigate against natural disasters. core areas of the group are subject to certification including iso/iec 27001. alignment with changing legislation is assessed and actioned, this includes gdpr. a growing range of benefits and incentives are provided by the group to its staff. the level of risk is stable due to high operational gearing, a reduction in revenues could significantly impact profitability the impacts are that the group will not: • adapt sufficiently quickly to any technological change or downturn in demand, with a consequent loss of competitiveness and profitability; • have adequate resources to invest in new technology and services; • retain its major client portfolio, without replacement, or recover debts; and • diversify sufficiently into other market sectors. brand deployment saw further development within its overseas network and an increased level of campaign fulfilment activity. adjusted operating profit for customer experience at £22.4m was £2.5m higher than 2016 with very strong performances across the business. a challenging year in cheques, but mitigated through strong cost control with some initial take up of strategic report 23 communisis plc annual report and financial statements 2017 eucn, boding well for 2018. editions financial had another strong year and successfully established the new york office as planned, initially providing content marketing to our client, linkedin, and on-boarding further large financial services clients. the focus going forwards is on operating margin improvement through both operational efficiencies and continued investment in systems along with integration of new client wins. the group also incurred a £0.5m write off in respect of unsupported assets which will not be recovered. plans are in place to have apprentices over four sites: liverpool, edinburgh, leeds and andover. we appreciate that employee engagement and wellbeing not only benefit our employees but also have a direct impact upon the performance of our business and we seek to achieve that engagement in a number of ways. we are also constantly reviewing our international benefits offerings which vary by country linked to local legislation and practice. we are also committed to flexible working arrangements, and benefits provision, which assists staff with their work–life balance. the group has in place an equal opportunities policy and statement (details of which are set out below). we know that our reputation is dependent upon fair and equitable treatment of all our employees and we forbid discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, gender, disability, sexual orientation, age, nationality or ethnic origin. we work hand in hand with our suppliers to understand our environmental impact and we plan to do more in 2018 to establish a reliable source of data within the supply chain through the strategic adoption of ecovadis (a supply chain management platform) which will give us greater insights into the businesses that we work with. proceeds from all fundraising events went to children in need, alzheimer’s society and macmillan cancer support. individuals either walked the 24-mile long route with 5,200ft of ascent, or they supported those doing so. everyone challenged themselves, whether that was to complete one peak, two peaks or all three. all our sites got involved and raised thousands on behalf of these good causes in the process. all endeavours are made to maintain a legally compliant business that operates without placing our employees, customers and visitors at risk of injury. we have a mature system of compliance checking through audit that enables us to monitor and improve our systems. t o provide assurance that this effort is directed in the correct manner, we have a rolling programme of internal audit reviews covering legal and process compliance. we operate a greenhouse gas management system which enables us to accurately record and report our emissions. tonnes of co2e per sq ft 2015 2016 2017 0.025 0.01 0.015 0.005 0.02 0 2014 year-on-year there has been a positive improvement in carbon intensity performance across our property portfolio that we own or lease. for instance, led lighting and energy efficient compressors have been installed in various parts of our operations. this can be attributed to the continued focus on restricting travel and improving our internal communication technology. corporate governance 33 communisis plc annual report and financial statements 2017 dear shareholder to ensure continued focus on our long-term delivery, we have launched the next phase of our strategic planning, with financial targets to ensure continued shareholder returns and value. to this end we have initiated a value enhancement programme (vep) with three key strategic themes; digital first, global reach and empowered organisation. andy blundell chief executive term of office chief executive since october 2009 and member of the board since august 2009. experience andy joined communisis in january 2008 as managing director of print sourcing and became group sales director in november 2008. he was later appointed to the board as chief executive officer designate on 25 august 2009 and took on the role permanently in october 2009. formerly, andy was a managing director at bemrose booth limited and a managing director at de la rue plc. current external directorships peter is executive director and chief financial officer of next fifteen communications group plc. steve rawlins was appointed as an executive director and chief financial officer on 4 december 2017. we have announced today that helen keays will be leaving the business on 6 june 2018. the nomination committee will conduct an external search for a new non-executive director. consistent with their role as part of a unitary board, the non- executive directors constructively challenge and help develop company proposals on strategy. 2 david gilbertson was appointed a non-executive director on 1 march 2017 and chairman with effect from 11 may 2017. by its nature, it provides reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. additionally the retail market has been kept in focus with direct communication and through intermediaries (private client brokers). audit committee corporate governance 43 communisis plc annual report and financial statements 2017 the frc noted one matter in relation to pension disclosures where they believed that users of the accounts would benefit from improvements to existing disclosures. for 2018, we have had to consider as a committee whether our policy remains appropriate for communisis and capable of supporting our revised strategic vision as more fully explained in the chairman’s statement at the beginning of this annual report. having undertaken a review, we concluded that our current policy as approved at the 2017 agm remains appropriate. yours sincerely helen keays chair of the remuneration committee 8 march 2018 introduction this report is presented in two parts. where information disclosed has been subject to audit by the company’s auditor, ernst & young llp, this is highlighted. in summary, the changes which we are making are as follows: • whilst the same performance measures from 2017 (adjusted ebit (50%), free cash flow (25%) and personal objectives (25%)) will apply to the 2018 annual bonus, in 2018 the percentage of maximum bonus payable for on-target performance will be increased from 50% of maximum to 65% of maximum; and • within our ltip, we are again seeking to make annual awards subject to an equally weighted (50:50) mix of three-year eps growth and three-year absolute tsr growth targets. long-term incentives there will be an ltip grant made in 2018 to the executive directors over shares worth 150% of salary. implementation report for 2017 single total figure of remuneration in 2017 for the executive directors (audited information) salary benefits 1 annual performance bonus 2 l tip

remuneration details for nigel howes and dave rushton, who are no longer remunerated). 9 dave rushton stepped down from the board on 31 january 2016 and ceased to be an employee on 30 june 2016. he was paid salary, benefits and pension entitlement until 30 june 2016 only in accordance with his contractual notice period. he did not receive an annual bonus for 2016. dave rushton exercised his

shares at 54.25p). 2 both absolute tsr and share price are measured on the basis of three-month averaging periods. base salaries are reviewed periodically against companies of similar size and complexity, and any salary increases are applied in line with the outcome of the relevant review with effect from 1 july in a financial year. a limit on the maximum cash value of all benefits has been set at £40,000 per annum for each executive director. no bonus is paid at the threshold level of performance, with amounts accruing from that point. awards can be made on an annual basis with a vesting period of at least three years. this is an all-employee tax-advantaged share plan and follows the usual form for such plans. executive directors are able to participate in all-employee share plans on the same terms as other group employees. • for the avoidance of doubt, such buy-out awards are not subject to a formal cap. corporate governance 57 communisis plc annual report and financial statements 2017 service contracts executive directors the committee’s policy is that each executive director’s service agreement should be of indefinite duration, subject to termination at normal

technology presents issues for many of our clients and the new interface is pure html5. employment decisions at communisis are based on candidates’ abilities to match the business needs, job requirements and individual qualifications for roles. we launched two new products within the connect tm range, firstly personalised video is now a channel option for marketing and transactional customers. a poll will be taken on each of the resolutions in the notice of meeting and every member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for every ordinary share held. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. where practicable, at 9 components we performed testing over full populations of transactions using data analysis. based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identified in the paragraphs above. our procedures involved journal entry testing, with a focus on manual consolidation journals, and journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the business; enquiries of legal counsel, group management, internal audit, subsidiary management at all full and specific scope components; and focused testing, as referred to in the key audit matters section above. consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 december 2017 financial statements 75 communisis plc annual report and

assets currently recognised are being amortised over a period of between five and ten years. an impairment review is carried out when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the group, and that will generate probable economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. impairment of assets at each reporting date, the group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, in which case impairment is determined at the cash-generating unit level. such hedges are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. the group sometimes uses forward exchange contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecasted transactions and firm commitments. stage of completion is estimated using an appropriate measure according to the nature of the contract such as costs incurred relative to total anticipated costs or other measures such as contract milestone completion. at this stage, the following areas of change have been identified: • certain revenue streams within the customer experience segment should be treated on an agent basis under ifrs 15 whereas under ias 18 these are accounted for on a principal basis. during the year there have been two changes to cost allocations within the segments as follows: • pass through revenue, representing pre-agreed or contracted revenues that include an element regarding print, postal and other marketing material which are passed on to clients at cost as part of a wider service, is now reported directly within the customer experience and brand deployment segments. transfer pricing between business segments is set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. adjusted earnings per share uses the same weighted average number of ordinary shares as reported above. with the exception of finance leases and hire purchase contracts above, there is no security or any restriction on title. these are based upon detailed budgets for the coming year and internal forecasts of future growth over a five-year period and cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using external forecasts of expected growth rates. for attainment between certain annual growth rate thresholds, vesting will occur on a straight-line pro rata basis. any options which have not been exercised within six months of the vesting date lapse. the diversified nature of these asset classes and their less frequent pricing means that investment returns tend to be smoother than comparable public market investments; and • direct lending – this fund invests in senior loans of mostly mid-market european companies and the fund is expected to produce materially better returns than an investment in publicly quoted corporate debt. the plan’s exposure to equity market risk is mitigated by a diverse portfolio of investments. certain trade receivables were found to be impaired and a provision of £466,000 (2016 £1,404,000) is carried at the year end. future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 december are as follows: 2017 £000 2016 £000 no later than one year 3,876 3,955 after one year but no more than five years 13,593 14,114 after
