REDUCED CAMPAIGN MANAGEMENT   FROM 5 DAYS TO 15 MINUTES FIND OUT MORE ONLINE  AT COMMUNISIS.COM youtube.com/user/CommunisisUKLtd twitter.com/CommunisisGroup linkedin.com/company/communisis COMMUNISIS IS AN INTEGRATED  BUSINESS SERVICES COMPANY WHICH  DRIVES CLIENT VALUE AND SUSTAINABLE  PROFIT IMPROVEMENT, THROUGH THE  PROVISION OF INCREASINGL Y DIGITALL Y  ENABLED SOLUTIONS FOR REGULATED  TRANSACTIONAL COMMUNICATION AND  MARKETING EXECUTION. • The VEP will be driven by three key strategic themes: Digital  First, Global Reach and Empowered Organisation. FINANCIAL RESULTS OUTLOOK Communisis is at an exciting stage in its development with a  bedrock of solid performance and deep client relationships to build  upon. Through consistent and predictable  performance, we continue to generate free cash which  has enabled a strong dividend stream for shareholders. We perform mission  critical work at scale for very substantial clients across the Financial  Services and Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sectors. • CIPS (Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply)  Advance standard - a leading level held by fewer than 20  organisations globally. TRANSITIONAL CAPABILITY  • Customer Experience: 52 large, 72 medium and 104 small  projects managed over the last 12 months with total  project budgets of £21m. The performance of our business units is meticulously  tracked and we are always looking for ways to improve  them. Demand for specialist content marketing capability, such as that  provided by our Editions Financial business, is strong in the UK  and US. Brands  are therefore offering more events or Gift with Purchase (GWP)  to keep their in-store presence and increase sales. As we  focus increasingly on provision of digital products and services,  our competitor set has shifted somewhat. There are not yet any clear  political outcomes but given our activity in the wider supply  chain for staple consumer goods and employment of foreign  nationals, in-country, we continue to believe that we are  relatively well protected from potential negative economic  impacts Brexit may have. This is supported by an  internal customer satisfaction survey, providing quantitative  understanding of the service we deliver and assisting us to  shape our future planning. STRATEGIC PRIORITIES • New product development with greater emphasis on  data analytics to support digital leadership and  channel capability. Where  this has been largely EMEA marketing  activation activity, we are committed to  growing both our Brand Deployment and  Customer Experience divisions. Through the introduction of  Roamler Analytics, future POS production and use will now be  informed more than ever before. Clients have  shown an increased willingness to enter into longer contractual  terms resulting in improved visibility for the Group from a financial  perspective. We can therefore, only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance  that key risks are managed to an acceptable level. The Group operates from multiple office, inbound  and manufacturing facilities which helps to  mitigate against natural disasters. The level of  risk is stable Due to high  operational gearing,  a reduction in  revenues could  significantly impact  profitability  The impacts are that the Group will not: • adapt sufficiently quickly to any technological  change or downturn in demand, with a  consequent loss of competitiveness and  profitability;  • have adequate resources to invest in new  technology and services;  • retain its major client portfolio, without  replacement, or recover debts; and  • diversify sufficiently into other market sectors. Brand Deployment saw further development within its overseas  network and an increased level of Campaign Fulfilment activity. The focus going forwards is on  operating margin improvement through both operational  efficiencies and continued investment in systems along with  integration of new client wins. The Group also incurred a £0.5m write off  in respect of unsupported assets which will not be recovered. We are also constantly reviewing our international  benefits offerings which vary by country linked to local legislation  and practice. We are also committed to flexible working  arrangements, and benefits provision, which assists staff with  their work–life balance. The Group has in place an Equal Opportunities Policy and  Statement (details of which are set out below). Proceeds from all fundraising events went  to Children in Need, Alzheimer’s Society and Macmillan Cancer  Support. All endeavours are made to maintain a legally compliant  business that operates without placing our employees,  customers and visitors at risk of injury. We have a mature system  of compliance checking through audit that enables us to monitor  and improve our systems. T o provide assurance that this effort  is directed in the correct manner, we have a rolling programme of  internal audit reviews covering legal and process compliance. We operate a greenhouse gas management system which  enables us to accurately record and report our emissions. TONNES OF CO2E PER SQ FT   2015 2016 2017 0.025 0.01 0.015 0.005 0.02 0 2014 Year-on-year there has been a  positive improvement in carbon  intensity performance across our property portfolio that we own  or lease. For instance, LED lighting and energy  efficient compressors have been installed in various parts of  our operations. This can be attributed to the continued focus on restricting travel and  improving our internal communication technology. To this end we have initiated a  Value Enhancement Programme (VEP) with three key strategic themes;  Digital First, Global Reach and Empowered Organisation. CURRENT EXTERNAL  DIRECTORSHIPS Peter is Executive Director and  Chief Financial Officer of Next Fifteen  Communications Group plc. Consistent with their role as part of a unitary board, the Non- executive Directors constructively challenge and help develop  Company proposals on strategy. Additionally the retail market has been kept in focus with direct  communication and through intermediaries (private client brokers).

Employment decisions at Communisis are based on candidates’  abilities to match the business needs, job requirements and  individual qualifications for roles. We launched two new products within the Connect TM  range,  firstly Personalised Video is now a channel option for marketing  and transactional customers. Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identified  in the paragraphs above. They have been prepared in  accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. An impairment review is  carried out when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment of assets  At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. Recoverable amount is determined for an  individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of  assets, in which case impairment is determined at the cash-generating unit level. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows  and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting  periods for which they were designated. The Group sometimes uses forward exchange contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecasted transactions  and firm commitments. An adjustment to both  revenue and costs is therefore required when restating the 2017 comparatives in accordance with IFRS 15. Transfer pricing between business segments is set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. With the exception of finance leases and hire purchase contracts above, there is no security or any restriction on title. For attainment between  certain annual growth rate thresholds, vesting will occur on a straight-line pro rata basis. It was agreed that deficit repair contributions to the scheme will  be £2,550,000, increasing in line with dividend increases, or 3% if higher. Certain trade receivables were found to be impaired and a provision of £466,000 (2016 £1,404,000)  is carried at the year end. Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December are as follows: 2017  £000  2016 £000 No later than one year 3,876 3,955  After one year but no more than five years 13,593 14,114  After five years 7,556 8,879  25,025 26,948  OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS – GROUP AS LESSOR Surplus land and building leases The Group has entered into commercial land and building leases consisting of the Group’s surplus office and manufacturing buildings.
