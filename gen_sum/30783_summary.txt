exposures e ﬀectively is time consuming, resource intensive and expensive - often involving dedicated in-house treasury teams or outsourced currency management consultancies. however, these products in isolation do not provide a solution, and used incorrectly can often exacerbate currency risk further. by doing so, we are able to provide a service, traditionally the privilege of ftse100 companies or those with large treasury or those with large treasury departments and make it accessible to all businesses impacted by currency volatility. o v e r v i e w w h a t w e d o 7 untitled-1 1

that are bespoke to their unique objectives and commercial environments. the platform is constantly evolving, and the platform is constantly evolving, and we regularly develop bespoke 'bolt on' solutions for clients, which, if appropriate, are able to be rolled out to all clients. partnering with treasurers, cfos, fds, ceos and mds, our focus is on helping these people improve their decision making in order that they can decision making in order that they can manage their currency exposure as e ﬀectively and e ﬃciently as possible. our ‘bespoke as standard’ approach means we have proven expertise across a diverse range of sectors. during the ﬁnancial year we have recruited staﬀ for our london oﬃce who are ﬂuent in foreign languages which has enabled us to steadily expand into select european territories. further operational progress was made with the expansion of our fx analysis team and through obtaining regulatory approval to sell derivative products. as always, we expect staﬀ contributions to increase incrementally as individuals develop along the learning curve, and i am pleased that yet again, new starters in fy17 outperformed those in fy16 - a trend i expect to continue due to the compounding eﬀect of surrounding great people with more great people, alongside our evolving service and infrastructure and the growing reputation of alpha in our target markets. the majority of remaining new team members joined our technology team, spearheading new product development and technological innovation, with a particular focus on evolving alpha’s online currency management platform and payment functionality, as well as developing custom platform solutions for our clients. morgan tillbrook chief executive oﬃcer 248225 alpha fx_pp12-pp26.qxp 03/04/2018 15:07

minimum amount of alpha’s free cash to be placed against each hedging facility extended; and • alpha’s balance sheet must be well capitalised with cash so that in the event that they are called for margin collateral by a banking counterparty but unable to call on their clients as they have granted them a ‘hedging facility’, they are able to fund the position. 248225 alpha fx_pp12-pp26.qxp

there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditor is unaware, and each director has taken all reasonable steps that he or she ought to have taken to make himself or herself aware

whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. the prior year comparative was set with reference to proﬁt before tax and applying a percentage of 6%. we recalculated the credit valuation adjustment using industry accepted techniques to compare against management’s own assessment of fair value. we also agreed to report diﬀerences below this

are intended to reduce the level of foreign currency risk for expected future cash ﬂows. daily stress tests are carried out to assess and minimise client credit risk exposures under various market volatility scenarios. derivatives are entered into with banking counterparties, which minimises credit risk further, as the group is only exposed to the net position of its derivative assets and liabilities and this position is collateralised on a daily basis. the group also attempts to ensure it maintains (as closely as is possible) a balanced position in each currency, with regular stress testing of its net long or short in a particular currency against sudden and unforeseen market movements (“black swan events”). consequently, management does not believe that the group has a material exposure to liquidity risk. other liabilities at 31 december 2017 total on demand up to 1 year 1-2 years 2-5 years other payables and accruals 4,665,575 – 4,665,575 – – 4,665,575 – 4,665,575 – – at 31
