Alpha exists because managing  these exposures e ﬀectively is  time consuming, resource  intensive and expensive - often  involving dedicated in-house  treasury teams or outsourced  currency management  consultancies. However, these products in  isolation do not provide a  solution, and used incorrectly  can often exacerbate currency  risk further. By doing so, we are able  to provide a service, traditionally  the privilege of FTSE100 companies  or those with large treasury or those with large treasury  departments and make it  accessible to all businesses  impacted by currency volatility.

The platform is constantly evolving, and The platform is constantly evolving, and  we regularly develop bespoke 'bolt on'  solutions for clients, which, if  appropriate, are able to be rolled out  to all clients. Partnering with Treasurers,  CFOs, FDs, CEOs and MDs, our focus is  on helping these people improve their  decision making in order that they can decision making in order that they can  manage their currency exposure as  e ﬀectively and e ﬃciently as possible. Our ‘bespoke as standard’ approach  means we have proven expertise  across a diverse range of sectors. In addition to our core UK  corporate market there are other  segments, both domestically and segments, both domestically and internationally that share similar characteristics, which we also believe represent signi ﬁcant opportunities for growth. The Board has recommended a ﬁnal dividend of 3.4 pence per share giving a total dividend for the ﬁnancial year of 4.9 pence per Chairman’s Statement “Our ﬂotation has already signiﬁcantly raised the proﬁle of our business, whilst enabling us to make key investments and accelerate our growth strategy.” STRATEGIC REPORT CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 12 248225 Alpha FX_pp12-pp26.qxp  03/04/2018  15:06  Page 12 STRA TEGIC REPORT 13 share. During the ﬁnancial year we have recruited staﬀ for our London oﬃce who are ﬂuent in foreign languages which has enabled us to steadily expand into select European territories. Further operational progress was made with the expansion of our FX Analysis team and through obtaining regulatory approval to sell derivative products. As always, we expect staﬀ contributions to increase incrementally as individuals develop along the learning curve, and I am pleased that yet again, new starters in FY17 outperformed those in FY16 - a trend I expect to continue due to the compounding eﬀect of surrounding great people with more great people, alongside our evolving service and infrastructure and the growing reputation of Alpha in our target markets. The majority of remaining new team members joined our Technology team, spearheading new product development and technological innovation, with a particular focus on evolving Alpha’s online currency management platform and payment functionality, as well as developing custom platform solutions for our clients.

The Liquidity Policy provides that:  •  weekly stress tests are carried out that subject the Group’s net currency positions to simulated signiﬁcant FX market volatility;  •  robust margin call terms are maintained with clients;  •  an over extension of hedging facilities is managed through internally mandating a minimum amount of Alpha’s free cash to be placed against each hedging facility extended; and  •  Alpha’s balance sheet must be well capitalised with cash so that in the event that they are called for margin collateral by a banking counterparty but unable to call on their clients as they have granted them a ‘hedging facility’, they are able to fund the position. 248225 Alpha FX_pp12-pp26.qxp  03/04/2018  15:07  Page 22 STRATEGIC REPORT PRINCIPAL RISKS & UNCERT AINTIES 23 The Group minimises ‘Fat Finger’ errors through daily reconciliations of all account balances (meaning any trade error should be identiﬁed early), as well as ensuring trades greater than £2,000,000.00 are reconciled within the hour.

As far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware, and each Director has taken all reasonable steps that he or she ought to have taken to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group’s auditors are aware of this information. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the ﬁnancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The prior year comparative was set with reference to proﬁt before tax and applying a percentage of 6%. We recalculated the credit valuation adjustment using industry accepted techniques to compare against Management’s own assessment of fair value. We also agreed to report diﬀerences below this threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.

IFRS 9 is eﬀective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted. IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and it replaces IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. Basis of consolidation (i) Subsidiaries Where the Company has control over an investee, it is classiﬁed as a subsidiary. The adjustment takes into account counterparty exposure, applicable collateral arrangement and default probability rates. Other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business. They are classiﬁed as current liabilities if payment is due in one year or less. If payment is due at a later date, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Judgement is also exercised in assessing the number of options subject to non-market vesting conditions that will vest.

Daily stress tests are carried out to assess and minimise client credit risk exposures under various market volatility scenarios. Derivatives are entered into with banking counterparties, which minimises credit risk further, as the Group is only exposed to the net position of its derivative assets and liabilities and this position is collateralised on a daily basis. The Group also attempts to ensure it maintains (as closely as is possible) a balanced position in each currency, with regular stress testing of its net long or short in a particular currency against sudden and unforeseen market movements (“Black Swan Events”). Consequently, management does not believe that the Group has a material exposure to liquidity risk.
