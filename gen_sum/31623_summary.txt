Tasks range from trunk mains cleaning and renewals to 24/7 repairs on the water network for our clients. After accounting for impairment, amortisation and exceptional items, basic earnings per share on continuing activities was 19.88p (2016: 23.53p). The Board determined that a non-cash impairment charge of £5.8m should be made which is included within exceptional items. Having served as a Director since November 2003, I have decided to retire at the next Annual General Meeting which will be held on 31 January 2018. Our integrated multidisciplinary services are essential to clients responsible for delivering maintenance and renewals programmes in regulated markets. We are well positioned on key frameworks associated with high hazard risk reduction operations at the Sellafield nuclear site in Cumbria. Working for Southern Gas Networks, we operate as exclusive provider on a regional medium pressure framework that runs to 2021. In Land Remediation, we operate on frameworks to remediate the sites of former gasworks for clients including National Grid and SGN. Our established strategy focuses on: • Infrastructure markets with non-discretionary, long-term funding • Operational expenditure budgets for renewal and maintenance operations • Utilising our directly employed workforce to develop relationships built on responsiveness The UK is committed to long-term investment in its critical infrastructure networks. Organic growth is achieved by aligning our operating subsidiaries with their clients’ day-to-day service requirements on key infrastructure assets. The Group also continues to look for complementary acquisition opportunities where businesses have strong relationships in regulated markets. 5 Developing long-term relationships Directly delivering an innovative and responsive service has proven to be a differentiator in our markets. Positioned as a key supplier to our clients, we assist them in maintaining their assets and providing continuity of service. 7 Capital growth The Group has grown its market capitalisation more than ninefold since 30 September 2005 without recourse to new equity. The UK government has also committed a record £2.3bn investment in coastal and river flood risk management to 2021. We have particular specialist engineering expertise in major structural alteration works both above and below ground. PROGRESS IN 2017 • We continued to develop our subsidiary businesses as strong locally recognised brands within their markets. FUTURE FOCUS • Continue to build on our subsidiary businesses’ reputations for quality and responsive service within their individual markets. We are well positioned to provide a range of services across the Sellafield site and other UK nuclear facilities. Capabilities We provide long-term maintenance and asset renewal support at many of the UK’s thermal power generation plants. Future focus We continue to develop our existing relationships with clients responsible for assets in the thermal and renewable energy market. The UK government has also committed a record £2.3bn investment in coastal and river flood risk management to 2021. We continued to develop our position in Scotland as the major structures renewals and sole civils maintenance contractor for Network Rail. Capabilities Our subsidiary, Walter Lilly, is recognised as a market-leading luxury provider of prestigious private residential refurbishment projects in London and the Home Counties. In-house design and engineering capabilities are able to provide innovative solutions on projects that require extensive underground development. Many of our businesses are involved with local sporting clubs for young people, providing kit and equipment through sponsorship. Walter Lilly hosted the second annual High Quality Residential Ball, an industry event raising over £100,000 for charity. Staff from Walter Lilly also visited Swaziland in Africa to help with community projects, which this year included building neighbourhood care points and facilities for orphaned children. We are pleased to have achieved a further improvement in our accident incident rate upon the previous year. GROUP RETURNS TO NET CASH POSITION Highlights • Revenue increased by 6.3% • All bank debt will be repaid by 31 March 2018 • Dividend increased by 12.5% GROUP REVENUE FROM CONTINUING ACTIVITIES WAS £558.6M (2016: £525.7M), WITH AN OPERATING PROFIT BEFORE TAX FROM CONTINUING ACTIVITIES PRIOR TO AMORTISATION, IMPAIRMENT AND EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS OF £25.6M (2016: £22.0M).” Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Renew Holdings plc 27 STRATEGIC REPORT Cash The Group’s financial position shows a cash balance of £7.0m (2016: £14.1m) at the year end. This position has been achieved after acquiring Giffen Holdings Ltd for a total cash cost of £7.2m including fees during the year. Liabilities have reduced primarily due to an increase in the discount rate as a result of improving gilt yields. Both assets and liabilities on the Balance Sheet are expected to increase by corresponding amounts, which as at 30 September 2017 would have been approximately £10m. Should initial estimates and judgments be incorrect, the actual financial outcomes may ultimately differ from that which is indicated. The Group also seeks to limit its risks by specialising in certain markets where it has extensive experience and a particular skills base. The AGM is normally attended by all Directors and provides an opportunity for communication with those shareholders attending. The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its amounts recoverable on contracts and trade receivables. Full consideration will be given to suitable applications for employment from disabled persons, where they have the necessary abilities and skills for that position, and wherever possible to re-train employees who become disabled, so that they can continue their employment in another position.

The actual financial outcomes may ultimately differ from that which is indicated by these judgements and estimates. Contract costs incurred that relate to future activities are deferred and recognised as amounts recoverable on contracts. Provision is made at rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset, less estimated residual value, evenly over its expected useful life as follows: Freehold land - no depreciation charge Freehold buildings - fifty years Plant, vehicles and equipment - three to ten years (viii) Impairments Goodwill arising on acquisitions and other assets that has an indefinite useful life and is therefore not subject to amortisation, is reviewed at least annually for impairment. Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 52 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued (xiii) Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and where it is probable that an outflow will be required to settle that obligation and where the amount can be reliably estimated. Finance (No 2) Bill 2017 includes legislation, effective from 1 April 2017, that limits the use of brought forward losses in any year. The Group has available further unused UK tax losses of £36m (2016: £39m) to carry forward against future taxable profits. In order to test goodwill for impairment the Group performs value in use calculations by preparing cash flow forecasts for each cash generating unit derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plans approved by management going forward three years, and then extrapolates cash flows based on conservative estimated growth rates according to management’s view of longer term prospects for each CGU.
