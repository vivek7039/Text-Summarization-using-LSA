was promoted to the position of chief operating officer, while retaining his function as group finance director. staff turnover has remained at low levels and we continue to attract high calibre people around the world. the edc solutions offered by dicom group solve this dilemma at an attractive cost to benefit ratio. our business partners and customers have continued to report that it budgets remain under tight scrutiny. edc investments, however, were broadly saved from this development as they allow quick payback periods to be achieved. during the past four years, dicom asia has successfully managed to expand its reach, customer base and capabilities in very challenging market conditions. arnold von büren chief executive officer 10 october 2002 dicom group plc 10 the software
