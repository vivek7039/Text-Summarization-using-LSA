Through authorised business partners DICOM Group has helped more than 10,000 blue chip enterprises in over 60 countries to accomplish superior office efficiency.

The SGA (Samsung General Agency) Division experienced declining turnover rates in difficult trading conditions, but maintained an acceptable, albeit lower, level of operating profit contribution. This represents 82% of DICOM Group’s total operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items. Turnover fell by 8% to £47.5m (2001: £51.5m), but SGA contributed 18% of DICOM Group’s total operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items. Urs Niederberger was promoted to the position of Chief Operating Officer, while retaining his function as Group Finance Director. Staff turnover has remained at low levels and we continue to attract high calibre people around the world. The EDC solutions offered by DICOM Group solve this dilemma at an attractive cost to benefit ratio. Our business partners and customers have continued to report that IT budgets remain under tight scrutiny. EDC investments, however, were broadly saved from this development as they allow quick payback periods to be achieved. During the past four years, DICOM Asia has successfully managed to expand its reach, customer base and capabilities in very challenging market conditions. Arnold von Büren Chief Executive Officer 10 October 2002 DICOM Group plc 10 The software version of VRS (v2.1) now supports more than 40 document scanner models with real time image enhancement features. The ASIC version of VRS, which is being sold on the basis of OEM agreement for use in document scanners, is being sold to both new scanner manufacturers and for new scanner models thereby increasing its future sales prospects significantly. GROUP PERFORMANCE Operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items increased by 14% to £11.3m (2001: £9.9m) on sales of £149.5m (2001: £140.3m). During the year operating expenses before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items increased from £37.1m to £43.1m, up 16%. THE OPPORTUNITY On average front and back office workers are only able to retrieve less than 10 per cent of their documents electronically. In addition time spent incurred in searching for information and the problem of lost MAKING Y OUR INF ORMATION DIGITAL To date over 10,000 blue chip companies have installed DICOM Group products and benefit from using our broad range of services. Further, Chase is able to automatically accept input from other applications with new polling features. When in full production, the system will be able to scan 20,000 pages per day, including letters, faxes and all other documents, black and white or colour, legal or otherwise, related to the administration of justice. A third challenge was to transform its decades old paper mountain of documents into easily retrievable electronic format. Eliminating the paper mountain through conversion into electronic format led to a substantial reduction in physical storage space. This document can be viewed at any given moment during and after the production process. A customised bar code system tracks down physi- cal files and sensitive information sent via e- mail is automatically encrypted. Incoming paper documents are digitised thanks to several Kodak scanner stations equipped with Kofax Ascent Capture software.

The number of IT applications, platforms and communication protocols will continue to grow at a fast pace. We will continue to come up with innovative solutions that complement our existing EDC product range and beyond. During the past two years we also made strategic investments in a number of companies. Also we are building think tanks and business development teams in our organisation to explore new market opportunities. We believe that even in a generally difficult economic environment the number of opportunities remain nearly unlimited. As independent research indicates, SGA has built a leading market position for Samsung LCD flat panel displays, and screens.
