£7.2bn specialist children’s services market (estimated) worth solution – the uk has a well developed system of public and private providers of health and social care which is ideally situated to deal with the growing demand for higher severity services. 2017 has been a year of transition as we established our platform to achieve modest growth and become the leading provider in children’s services. we were not therefore able to right size all our cost base until the second half of last year. this will result in approximately £8.5 million of cost reductions on an annualised basis, half of which have been reflected in 2017. we have also spent 2017 repositioning the business towards a differentiated integrated recovery model incorporating care, education and therapy for children with the highest needs, which is where we believe there is a significant shortage of care and education facilities. cambian group plc annual report and accounts 2017 6 revenue £196.0m +8% adjusted ebitda 1

plc annual report and accounts 2017 97 strategic report governance financial statements independent auditors’ report to the members of cambian group plc continued key audit matters continued provision for national living wage payments for ‘sleep-ins’ key audit matter description as discussed in the audit committee report on page 61 the group, in common with a number of mental health care providers in the industry, is undergoing a national living wage audit by hmrc. given the complexity of applying the regulations and judgment involved in calculating the provision, management has identified this as a key source of estimation uncertainty, as described in note 3. this has been identified as a key audit matter and a risk of fraud in relation to this judgement has been identified. in the current year, we assessed materiality by reference to a number of benchmarks, including revenue, net assets, ebitda and pre-tax profit adjusted for exceptional items (as described in note 6), and concluded that a materiality of £0.35m was appropriate. matters on which we are required to report by exception adequacy of explanations received and accounting records under the companies act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: • we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or • adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or • the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. cgus to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. intangible assets acquired in a business combination intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost). subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the group’s accounting policy. loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. the group segregates these funds from its own in restricted bank accounts and records a corresponding liability. hmrc’s view is that hours spent by employees performing sleep-in count as “working time” and therefore should be included when calculating whether or not someone has been paid in accordance with the national minimum wage regulations 2015. in november 2017 , hmrc reiterated its position and invited companies to join the social care compliance scheme, a self-reporting scheme aimed at concluding historic payments regarding sleep-ins. whilst a number of other care service providers have challenged hmrc’s original view, if it is ultimately individually determined that cambian had to pay each individual engaged in a sleep-in an amount by reference to the national living wage, the additional cost could be material. onerous contract cambian is a party to an exclusive supply agreement in respect of pharmaceutical supplies at its sites. litigation has been formally
