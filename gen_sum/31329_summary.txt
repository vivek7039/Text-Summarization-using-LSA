Note: 1 There may be more than one Cambian location within an area highlighted on the above map. Solving societal challenges – 88k lives impacted – Less reliance on NHS services – Better long-term outcomes for individuals – Fewer individuals returning to care facilities – Reduction in prison populations – More individuals back into work Long-term 88k children/young people in Cambian’s core population £7.2bn Specialist children’s services market (estimated) worth Solution – The UK has a well developed system of public and private providers of health and social care which is ideally situated to deal with the growing demand for higher severity services. 2017 has been a year of transition as we established our platform to achieve modest growth and become the leading provider in children’s services. We were not therefore able to right size all our cost base until the second half of last year. We have also spent 2017 repositioning the business towards a differentiated integrated recovery model incorporating care, education and therapy for children with the highest needs, which is where we believe there is a significant shortage of care and education facilities. Martin Hopcroft, who joined the Group in late 2015, stepped down as Chief Financial Officer on this date. Future strategy Our aim is to be the highest quality provider of specialist education and behavioural health services for children. Constraints on social care budgets, despite increasing levels of demand, have forced local authorities to carefully ration resources. Everything we do is underpinned by the following key principles: • Focus on providing a high quality service in our specialist markets • Rigorous governance and risk management • Delivering an evidence based therapeutic model • Recruiting and retaining high quality staff Outcomes Quality – 80% “Good” or “Outstanding” 5 – Group wide approach to quality improvement Financial impact – Value for money for customers – Sustainable growth – Strong long term cash generation and returns for shareholders Societal impact – Benefiting society as a whole – Although the care market is estimated at £7 billion, because of a failing system, the true cost to society is much greater Geographic presence across all major regions in England and Wales We provide a comprehensive pathway of services across each of the major regions in England and Wales. Focus on execution Cambian Group is now focused on being a market leading provider of specialist children’s services.” Saleem Asaria Chief Executive Officer Chief Executive’s strategic review Cambian Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 14 Our adjusted EBITDA increased by 15%, to £18.7 million (2016: £16.2 million) with adjusted EBITDA margins of 9.5% (2016: 8.9%) reflecting the growth in revenue as well as cost savings made in our head office functions. Average occupancy was broadly level at 1,286 places (2016: 1,294) with an underlying transition towards higher severity cases during the year. Creating a strong Children’s Services platform The completion of the TSA allowed us to focus on reducing our central costs to align our business with its new scale and focus on Children’s Services with an efficient overhead structure. Our key appointments include the following experienced leaders: • Anoop Kang, formerly at Kier Group and Balfour Beatty, joined us as CFO. • Lynn Webb, formerly Chief Operating Officer at Foster Care Associates, joined us as Managing Director of Fostering. These investments combined have led us to a comprehensive plan for investing £85 million in capital expenditure by 2020.

It was therefore particularly disappointing that Cambian was featured in a current affairs television programme broadcast in December 2017, which included undercover video footage taken, without notice or permission, at a number of care facilities managed by independent providers; three of which are operated by Cambian.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.

The Group segregates these funds from its own in restricted bank accounts and records a corresponding liability. HMRC’s view is that hours spent by employees performing sleep-in count as “working time” and therefore should be included when calculating whether or not someone has been paid in accordance with the National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015. Whilst a number of other care service providers have challenged HMRC’s original view, if it is ultimately individually determined that Cambian had to pay each individual engaged in a sleep-in an amount by reference to the National Living Wage, the additional cost could be material.
