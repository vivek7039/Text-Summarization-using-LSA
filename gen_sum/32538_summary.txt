In Switzerland and Southern Africa, our largest two operating platforms, we have seen good trading performances this year. The key metrics of patient admissions, theatre hours sold and revenue per bed day have all been positive. PROSPECTS This year has highlighted, once again, the continued challenges and changing regulatory landscape in which we operate. Furthermore, by closely monitoring key indicators and gathering information, we continue to position the Group for sensible future growth. Danie Meintjes Chief Executive O cer MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 12 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW “We are determined to meet and exceed the expectations of our patients in every market we operate.” WHY DO YOU BELIEVE REGULATORY MATTERS PLAYED SUCH A PROMINENT ROLE THIS YEAR? To assist us in identifying areas for improvement, we implemented a standardised international Patient Experience Index (“PEI”) measurement system, provided by Press Ganey. While significant progress has been made, we continue to focus on resolving these matters and stabilising performance; this will remain a priority. The underlying measures are intended to remove volatility associated with certain types of one-off income and charges from reported earnings.

Demand for Mediclinic’s services across its platforms remains robust, underpinned by an ageing population, growing disease burden and technological innovation. Despite cost inflation running above tariff increases, the underlying EBITDA margin is expected to remain broadly stable through increased efficiencies. • Mediclinic Southern Africa and Hirslanden business days will be impacted by two Easter holiday periods in the current year. A dividend withholding tax of 20% will be applicable to all shareholders on the South African register who are not exempt therefrom. This is summarised as follows: INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE • Extensive property ownership provides valuable operational flexibility and asset underpin to the business. GLOBAL PRIVATE HEALTHCARE GROUP BENEFITS • Scale of operations leads to efficiencies in procurement, information technology and clinical services. • In Switzerland, progressed with the clinical information system; and successfully initiated a pilot project on patient-related outcome measurement relating to joint replacements. IMPROVING EFFICIENCIES – IMPROVED OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS More information on this priority is included in the Chief Executive Officer’s Review. • In the Middle East, commission Khalifa City A clinic; progress with Mediclinic Parkview Hospital; and consider alternative growth options such as public private partnerships. In addition to these audits, the effectiveness of operational procedures is examined internally through various peer review and control self-assessment processes. To this end we have developed a strong focus on measuring and improving clinical performance throughout our organisation. An initiative is underway by pharmacy services to identify, report and reduce the number of medication dispensing errors. Clinical information systems • Collaborated with Mediclinic Middle East and Hirslanden to obtain a clear understanding of detailed requirements for an electronic health record (“EHR”) system along with platform’s readiness as part of the preparation work for the clinical information system project. • A master person index has been developed and implemented in Mediclinic Southern Africa for the identification of healthy neonates. Hirslanden will therefore continue its transformation from being purely a hospital operator to becoming an integrated healthcare provider that oﬀ ers medical services across various levels of care. Hirslanden is focused on achieving further efficiency gains and optimisation, leveraging off the broader Group’s economies of scale to manage cost pressures. This is also important because outpatient clinics are a well-established route for the subsequent allocation of patients to hospitals and specialists. EFFICIENCY AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS Mediclinic Southern Africa progressed with several improvements to its core processes during the period under review. The new SAP solution for financial and central procurement processes was successfully rolled out to 32 Mediclinic Southern Africa hospitals. Despite this, population growth is expected to drive domestic demand in the next year, albeit at a reduced rate. This remains a significant challenge to Mediclinic Middle East, along with persisting economic uncertainty, rising costs and increased competition. Opportunities for the business lie within Mediclinic Middle East’s own areas of development, including bringing newly-opened facilities to capacity, ensuring timely delivery of its projects under construction and identifying areas that will add further value to its patients and stakeholders. SDR INTRODUCTION Mediclinic takes a sustainable, long-term approach to business, putting patients at the heart of its operations and delivering consistently high-quality healthcare services. Stakeholders’ legitimate expectations have been taken into account in setting the Group’s key sustainability priorities, as reported on throughout this report. Whereas Mediclinic Southern Africa previously excluded a number of planned admissions from the calculation, it currently measures all-cause re-admissions. Additionally, structured clinical audits are undertaken across all platforms and aid in identifying opportunities for quality improvement going forward. A definite strength is the available talent analytics which indicate patterns in candidate and employee behaviour over time. An inter-platform development programme which offers a series of secondments across platforms has been designed to help these individuals excel at Mediclinic.

Hirslanden, our largest platform, performed strongly, exceeding the maximum target for financial performance combined with strong outcomes on patient satisfaction. The balance is determined based on Executive Directors’ performance against annual Group operational targets, including measures of clinical excellence. Targets are set on sliding scales that take account of internal strategic planning and external market expectations for the Company. In 2017 all Non-executive Directors, except for Dr Edwin Hertzog and Jannie Durand were considered to be independent of the Company. The normal retirement age is 63 and there are no additional benefits payable if an Executive Director retires early.

All other components of non-controlling interests are measured at their acquisition date fair values, unless another measurement basis is required by IFRSs. Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less provision for impairment. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 2.18 Current and deferred income tax (continued) Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. When tariffs have not yet been agreed, tariff provisions are recognised as adjustments in revenue to reflect any uncertainty about collectability of amounts invoiced. In respect of financial assets, interest rate risk is managed by using approved counterparties that offer the best rates. The financial condition of these clients in relation to their credit standing is evaluated on an ongoing basis. Impairment testing of Hirslanden goodwill and indefinite life trade names Key assumptions used for the value-in-use calculations for the annual impairment testing were as follows: Future earnings is based on budgets and forecasts that is calculated on a per hospital basis. At the date of acquisition a provisional notional purchase price allocation assessment did not identify any significant intangible assets other than goodwill. Management’s judgement in this area is applied on a case-by-case basis due to the jurisdictional nature of taxation. Provision for impairment of receivables is based on historical collection trends, current market conditions and expected future cash flows. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (continued) 15.1 Equity-settled share-based payment arrangements (continued) Additional disclosure for each arrangement Mpilo trusts The Mpilo trusts were created in 2005 for purposes of an employee share scheme to introduce Mediclinic Southern Africa employees up to first line management level as shareholders of the Group. Share options exercised by Al Noor Hospital Group plc directors before the acquisition date (15 February 2016) are regarded as a pre-acquisition transaction in these consolidated financial statements.
