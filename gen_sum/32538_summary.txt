furthermore, by closely monitoring key indicators and gathering information, we continue to position the group for sensible future growth. to assist us in identifying areas for improvement, we implemented a standardised international patient experience index (“pei”) measurement system, provided by press ganey. while significant progress has been made, we continue to focus on resolving these matters and stabilising performance; this will remain a priority. the underlying measures are intended to remove volatility associated with certain types of one-off income and charges from reported earnings. mediclinic annual report 2017 17 financial review earnings reconciliations (continued) 2016 statutory results total £’m switzerland £’m southern africa £’m middle east £’m united kingdom £’m

innovation. despite cost inflation running above tariff increases, the underlying ebitda margin is expected to remain broadly stable through increased efficiencies. • mediclinic southern africa and hirslanden business days will be impacted by two easter holiday periods in the current year. a dividend withholding tax of 20% will be applicable to all shareholders on the south african register who are not exempt therefrom. this is summarised as follows: investment in infrastructure • extensive property ownership provides valuable operational flexibility and asset underpin to the business. • in switzerland, progressed with the clinical information system; and successfully initiated a pilot project on patient-related outcome measurement relating to joint replacements. improving efficiencies – improved operational effectiveness more information on this priority is included in the chief executive officer’s review. • in the middle east, commission khalifa city a clinic; progress with mediclinic parkview hospital; and consider alternative growth options such as public private partnerships. in addition to these audits, the effectiveness of operational procedures is examined internally through various peer review and control self-assessment processes. • a master person index has been developed and implemented in mediclinic southern africa for the identification of healthy neonates. hirslanden will therefore continue its transformation from being purely a hospital operator to becoming an integrated healthcare provider that oﬀ ers medical services across various levels of care. hirslanden is focused on achieving further efficiency gains and optimisation, leveraging off the broader group’s economies of scale to manage cost pressures. this is also important because outpatient clinics are a well-established route for the subsequent allocation of patients to hospitals and specialists. efficiency and other developments mediclinic southern africa progressed with several improvements to its core processes during the period under review. the new sap solution for financial and central procurement processes was successfully rolled out to 32 mediclinic southern africa hospitals. in fy16, al noor’s results were only consolidated from 15 february 2016. during the period under review, revenue increased by 72% to aed3 109m (2016: aed1 802m). despite this, population growth is expected to drive domestic demand in the next year, albeit at a reduced rate. this remains a significant challenge to mediclinic middle east, along with persisting economic uncertainty, rising costs and increased competition. sdr introduction mediclinic takes a sustainable, long-term approach to business, putting patients at the heart of its operations and delivering consistently high-quality healthcare services. stakeholders’ legitimate expectations have been taken into account in setting the group’s key sustainability priorities, as reported on throughout this report. whereas mediclinic southern africa previously excluded a number of planned admissions from the calculation, it currently measures all-cause re-admissions. additionally, structured clinical audits are undertaken across all platforms and aid in identifying opportunities for quality improvement going forward. an inter-platform development programme which offers a series of secondments across platforms has been designed to help these individuals excel at mediclinic. highlights • mediclinic southern africa included in global a list for performance in the carbon disclosure project • since january 2014, the entire hirslanden electricity supply has been generated from 100% sustainable electricity • total energy consumption per bed day reduced in mediclinic southern africa, with mediclinic middle east and hirslanden’s consumption remaining stable • total water usage decreased throughout the group total co 2 emissions (kg/bed day) southern africa 117kg (per cdp 2017) (cdp

interruption due to electricity supply • increased operational costs due to cost of electricity • healthcare risk waste disposal • reputational damage link to group strategy • improve efficiencies key stakeholders • employees and doctors • suppliers • governments and authorities • community risk mitigation • implementation of appropriate environmental management systems (certified by an internationally recognised body, where appropriate) • corporate sustainable water management strategy was implemented • expansion of the energy initiative committee function to the natural resources committee to include all natural resources • introduction of renewable energy sources, such as solar photovoltaic systems, in order to reduce energy consumption and costs selected key performance indicators * the intensity measures of co₂ emissions, water usage and energy consumption per day are not appropriate for the uae, and not comparable with that of southern africa and switzerland, as the total emissions, water usage and energy consumption include only five hospitals, with outpatient consultations and 25 clinics with only outpatient consultation (i.e. no bed days). mediclinic annual report 2017 65 sustainable development highlights (“co 2 e”) using recognised calculation methods, emission factors and stating assumptions made, where relevant. waste management stringent protocols are followed to ensure that refuse removal within the group complies with all legislation, regulations and by-laws. additional training is available on request, where appropriate, so that directors can update their skills and knowledge as applicable. hirslanden, our largest platform, performed strongly, exceeding the maximum target for financial performance combined with strong outcomes on patient satisfaction. the balance is determined based on executive directors’ performance against annual group operational targets, including measures of clinical excellence. targets are set on sliding scales that take account of internal strategic planning and external market expectations for the company. in 2017 all non-executive directors, except for dr edwin hertzog and jannie durand were considered to be independent of the company. awards will be settled in cash and therefore are not taken into consideration as part of determining whether shareholding requirements have

of business mediclinic international plc is a private hospital group with three operating platforms in southern africa (south africa and namibia), switzerland and the united arab emirates and with an equity investment in the uk. all other components of non-controlling interests are measured at their acquisition date fair values, unless another measurement basis is required by ifrss. mediclinic annual report 2017 156 notes to the consolidated financial statements 2. summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 2.13 share capital ordinary shares are classified as equity. when tariffs have not yet been agreed, tariff provisions are recognised as adjustments in revenue to reflect any uncertainty about collectability of amounts invoiced. in respect of financial assets, interest rate risk is managed by using approved counterparties that offer the best rates. at the date of acquisition a provisional notional purchase price allocation assessment did not identify any significant intangible assets other than goodwill. management’s judgement in this area is applied on a case-by-case basis due to the jurisdictional nature of taxation. provision for impairment of receivables is based on historical collection trends, current market conditions and expected future cash flows. expenses arising from equity-settled share-based payment transactions forfeitable share
