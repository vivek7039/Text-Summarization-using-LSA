year i reported on the consistent growth of mediclinic over the past 30 years, for which we are thankful. in switzerland and southern africa, our largest two operating platforms, we have seen good trading performances this year. the key metrics of patient admissions, theatre hours sold and revenue per bed day have all been positive. however, underlying earnings were fl at at £220m (2016: £219m) while underlying earnings per share were down 19% at 29.8 pence (2016: 36.7 pence), both aff ected by the increase in fi nance costs and poor performance of dr edwin hertzog non-executive chairman mediclinic annual report 2017 9 chairman’s statement a transitional solution until the healthcare providers and funders agree on a revised tariff structure. we have always managed this successfully, thanks to the well-informed and responsible leadership of our management teams. prospects this year has highlighted, once again, the continued challenges and changing regulatory landscape in which we operate. despite these challenges, we operate in an industry where demand continues to grow for our services. furthermore, by closely monitoring key indicators and gathering information, we continue to position the group for sensible future growth. when i look at the new services not previously off ered by mediclinic middle east, the number of lives we are changing through our new radiotherapy and pet scan services each month is encouraging. danie meintjes chief executive o cer mediclinic annual report 2017 12 chief executive officer’s review “we are determined to meet and exceed the expectations of our patients in every market we operate.” why do you believe regulatory matters played such a prominent role this year? secondly, there have been ongoing national outpatient tariff (tarmed) negotiations between healthcare providers and funders. and finally, the zurich cantonal parliament approved an amendment to the cantonal hospital law, providing a legal basis to create a list of interventions that in future should generally be treated as outpatient rather than inpatient services. we are focused on growing our patient numbers from the thiqa and enhanced insurance market. using our international scale, we are beginning to deliver meaningful synergies and cost savings. to assist us in identifying areas for improvement, we implemented a standardised international patient experience index (“pei”) measurement system, provided by press ganey. while significant progress has been made, we continue to focus on resolving these matters and stabilising performance; this will remain a priority. another priority is the continued improvement in operational efficiencies, using our combined international intellectual property. the underlying measures are intended to remove volatility associated with certain types of one-off income and charges from reported earnings. • a past-service cost credit of £13m (£10m after tax) arising in the main hirslanden pension fund. this relates to a change in the pension fund conversion rate advised by an independent professional. consistent with last year’s treatment, the underlying income statement has been adjusted for these costs following the combination in 2016. currently, no further restructuring costs associated with this transaction are expected to be adjusted beyond 31 march 2017. mediclinic annual report 2017 16

robust, underpinned by an ageing population, growing disease burden and technological innovation. despite cost inflation running above tariff increases, the underlying ebitda margin is expected to remain broadly stable through increased efficiencies. • mediclinic southern africa and hirslanden business days will be impacted by two easter holiday periods in the current year. a dividend withholding tax of 20% will be applicable to all shareholders on the south african register who are not exempt therefrom. this is summarised as follows: investment in infrastructure • extensive property ownership provides valuable operational flexibility and asset underpin to the business. global private healthcare group benefits • scale of operations leads to efficiencies in procurement, information technology and clinical services. improving efficiencies a relentless focus on extracting efficiencies from key business processes, using resources as effectively as possible and driving cost savings and synergies across the group, are critical to ensure that it delivers cost-efficient services. we will be respected internationally for: • delivering measurable quality clinical outcomes • continuing to grow as a successful international healthcare group • enforcing good corporate governance • acting as a responsible corporate citizen we will be preferred locally for: • delivering excellent patient care • ensuring aligned relationships with doctor communities • being an employer of choice, appointing and retaining competent staff • building constructive relationships with all stakeholders • being a valued member of the community our relentless focus on patient needs will create long-term shareholder value and establish mediclinic international as a leader in the global healthcare industry. • in switzerland, progressed with the clinical information system; and successfully initiated a pilot project on patient-related outcome measurement relating to joint replacements. • in southern africa, improve the processes that prevent serious adverse events; and refine nursing workforce effectiveness. • further refine patient experience index and set targets for improved performance across the group. improving efficiencies – improved operational effectiveness more information on this priority is included in the chief executive officer’s review. • in the middle east, commission khalifa city a clinic; progress with mediclinic parkview hospital; and consider alternative growth options such as public private partnerships. ar csr ar mediclinic annual

employees more information on this priority is included in the sustainable development highlights (material issue 2), as well as the more detailed sustainable development report available on the company’s website at www.mediclinic.com. an erm software application supports the group’s risk management process in all three operating platforms. availability risk relates to the instances where systems are not available for use by its intended users. in addition to these audits, the effectiveness of operational procedures is examined internally through various peer review and control self-assessment processes. to this end we have developed a strong focus on measuring and improving clinical performance throughout our organisation. a comprehensive set of clinical performance indicators are collected, measured, analysed and reported on monthly. all indicators included in this clinical services overview are reported per calendar year to ensure completeness and consistency, as a signifi cant time lag needs to be provided for in the collection of clinical data. saps3 is statistically better suited to the mediclinic population and gives a more accurate prediction of mortality. an initiative is underway by pharmacy services to identify, report and reduce the number of medication dispensing errors. clinical information systems • collaborated with mediclinic middle east and hirslanden to obtain a clear understanding of detailed requirements for an electronic health record (“ehr”) system along with platform’s readiness as part of the preparation work for the clinical information system project. however, clinical outcomes remain excellent as is demonstrated by low infection rates and other outcome measures. medication errors falls in-hospital pressure

developed and implemented in mediclinic southern africa for the identification of healthy neonates. • initiatives are underway to coordinate health technology assessments centrally, and will be further refined. • continued collaboration and support are provided to hirslanden with the implementation of their ehr system. in the saturated swiss healthcare market, strong growth is only possible with a forward- looking investment strategy. hirslanden will therefore continue its transformation from being purely a hospital operator to becoming an integrated healthcare provider that oﬀ ers medical services across various levels of care. in the canton of zurich, a special tax on services for privately insured inpatients was fortunately rejected. hirslanden is focused on achieving further efficiency gains and optimisation, leveraging off the broader group’s economies of scale to manage cost pressures. according to publicly available sources, chf16bn is earmarked for the construction and renovation of hospital buildings. this is also important because outpatient clinics are a well-established route for the subsequent allocation of patients to hospitals and specialists. mediclinic southern africa successfully followed its incremental growth strategy by adding 78 acute care beds at existing hospitals. this proposed acquisition supports mediclinic’s core focus of providing acute care, multi-disciplinary specialist hospital services. efficiency and other developments mediclinic southern africa progressed with several improvements to its core processes during the period under review. the new sap solution for financial and central procurement processes was successfully rolled out to 32 mediclinic southern africa hospitals. outlook mediclinic southern africa remains well positioned to face the significant challenges that exist in the business environment, such as increasing regulatory oversight, slow economic growth, a fragmented private healthcare delivery model and a shortage of healthcare professionals. future growth will focus on related business opportunities, for example mental health and primary care. in fy16, al noor’s results were only consolidated from 15 february 2016. during the period under review, revenue increased by 72% to aed3 109m (2016: aed1 802m). the group has classified aed42m assets and aed9m liabilities as held for sale in relation to these units. despite this, population growth is expected to drive domestic demand in the next year, albeit at a reduced rate. this remains a significant challenge to mediclinic middle east, along with persisting economic uncertainty, rising costs and increased competition. opportunities for the business lie within mediclinic middle east’s own areas of development, including bringing newly-opened facilities to capacity, ensuring timely delivery of its projects under construction and identifying areas that will add further value to its patients and stakeholders. sdr introduction mediclinic takes a sustainable, long-term approach to business, putting patients at the heart of its operations and delivering consistently high-quality healthcare services. stakeholders’ legitimate expectations

differ significantly on the scope of services provided, burden of disease, units of measurement and definition of indicators. whereas mediclinic southern africa previously excluded a number of planned admissions from the calculation, it currently measures all-cause re-admissions. additionally, structured clinical audits are undertaken across all platforms and aid in identifying opportunities for quality improvement going forward. procurement and supply chain management in order to deliver its services, mediclinic is dependent on a large and diverse range of suppliers, who form an integral part of the group’s ability to provide ar csr ar quality hospital care. nurses, pharmacists and doctors are categorised as critical skills and an integrated talent management strategy is tailored to each of these categories to ensure the support of the entire employee life cycle in these roles. a definite strength is the available talent analytics which indicate patterns in candidate and employee behaviour over time. an inter-platform development programme which offers a series of secondments across platforms has been designed to help these individuals excel at mediclinic. link to group

prior years in respect of these assets. we substantively tested the integrity of supporting calculations and corroborated certain information with third party sources. separately identifiable intangible assets amounting to £68 million were valued as a result of this exercise. we focused on this area because judgement and estimation are involved in the impairment assessment. we visited our component teams in south africa, switzerland and the uae, which included file reviews, attendance at key audit meetings with local management and participation in audit clearance meetings at each

mediclinic international plc is a private hospital group with three operating platforms in southern africa (south africa and namibia), switzerland and the united arab emirates and with an equity investment in the uk. mediclinic annual report 2017 150 notes to the consolidated financial statements 2. summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 2.2 consolidation and equity accounting a) basis of consolidation subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the group has control. the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the recognition conditions of ifrs 3 business combinations are recognised at their fair values at acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal company) that are classified as held-for-sale in accordance with ifrs 5 non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations, which are recognised at fair value less costs to sell. this excludes lease agreements and insurance contracts, whose classification remains as per their inception date. all other components of non-controlling interests are measured at their acquisition date fair values, unless another measurement basis is required by ifrss. where the existing shareholding was classified as an available-for-sale financial asset, the cumulative fair value adjustments recognised previously to other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are recognised in profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment. investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. the group’s investments in associates and joint ventures include goodwill identified on acquisition. an asset is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from use. internally developed computer software that is clearly associated with an identifiable and unique system, which will be controlled by the group and have a probable future economic benefit beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. 2.6 impairment of non-financial assets assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less provision for impairment. the group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting cash flows of hedged items. mediclinic annual report 2017 156 notes to the consolidated financial statements 2. summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 2.13 share capital ordinary shares are classified as equity. however, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. when tariffs have not yet been agreed, tariff provisions are recognised as adjustments in revenue to reflect any uncertainty about collectability of amounts invoiced. translation differences on non-monetary financial assets classified as available-for-sale, are included in other comprehensive income. borrowings and short-term deposits issued at variable rates expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk. in respect of financial assets, interest rate risk is managed by using approved counterparties that offer the best rates. the financial condition of these clients in relation to their credit standing is evaluated on an ongoing basis. c) liquidity risk the group manages liquidity risk by monitoring cash flow forecasts to ensure that it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs, while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn borrowing facilities at all times so that the group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities. mediclinic annual report 2017 171 notes to the consolidated financial statements 7. intangible assets (continued) impairment testing of significant goodwill balances and indefinite useful life trade name the carrying amounts of significant goodwill and indefinite life trade names are considered annually for impairment testing. impairment testing of hirslanden goodwill and indefinite life trade names key assumptions used for the value-in-use calculations for the annual impairment testing were as follows: future earnings is based on budgets and forecasts that is calculated on a per hospital basis. it does not issue publicly available quarterly financial information and has a december year-end. it does not issue publicly available quarterly financial information and has a december year-end. at the date of acquisition a provisional notional purchase price allocation assessment did not identify any significant intangible assets other than goodwill. the group has a 49.9% interest in wits university donald gordon medical centre (pty) limited. management’s judgement in this area is applied on a case-by-case basis due to the jurisdictional nature of taxation. mediclinic annual report 2017 178 notes to the consolidated financial statements 10. deferred tax (continued) critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued) at 31 march 2017, the group had unutilised tax losses of approximately £121m (2016: £172m) potentially available for offset against future profits. there are no significant expected income tax consequences of earnings being distributed from switzerland and the uae, as there is no dividend withholding tax applicable to earnings being distributed from these operations. although south african distributions to the uk are typically subject to dividend withholding taxes, distributions from south africa are not expected to have income tax consequences in the foreseeable future as the operations in south africa have a significant contributed tax capital balance from which may be paid dividends free from witholding tax. provision for impairment of receivables is based on historical collection trends, current market conditions and expected future cash flows. expenses arising from equity-settled share-based payment transactions forfeitable share plan – 1 mpilo trusts

payment arrangements (continued) additional disclosure for each arrangement mpilo trusts the mpilo trusts were created in 2005 for purposes of an employee share scheme to introduce mediclinic southern africa employees up to first line management level as shareholders of the group. therefore, no director exercised any rights in relation to share option schemes during the reporting period. share
