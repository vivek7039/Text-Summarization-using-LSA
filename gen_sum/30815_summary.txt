of products and services. essentra’s ethics code helps to ensure that everyone working for or on behalf of the company understands its expectations and conducts essentra business in a way that is consistent with the company’s six principles and with its procedures. through harnessing this strength in diversity with a clearly defined and unifying role for the group – all of which underpinned by clear financial and capital allocation policies, appropriately aligned to management incentives – we are well-placed to create sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders. a portfolio of activities … … with shared business priorities … … sustainable, long-term value annual report 2017 | www.essentraplc.com 7 strategic report | what we do chairman’s statement in my first full year as chairman, i am very pleased to report that 2017 saw stability being restored to essentra after a year of challenge and change in 2016, with our new corporate strategy being unveiled by chief executive, paul forman, at the time of our hy 2017 results. there was a £2.1m decrease in our financing costs resulting from a lower average net debt position during the year and our tax rate was maintained at 20.0%, contributing to basic adjusted earnings per share (at constant exchange) reducing by 30.1% to 22.1p. during the year, there was further investment in our footprint and equipment, with fy 2017 net capital expenditure of £45.3m: we also made good progress with regard to net working capital management, which supported a cash conversion ratio of 94.6%. in addition, low complexity packaging for consumer goods applications will be de-emphasised: notably, this annual report 2017 | www.essentraplc.com 12 strategic report | chief executive’s review unfortunately resulted in the closure of the financially and operationally-challenged newport folding cartons site at the end of 2017 , and thus the removal of c. £4.5m losses in fy 2018. as we continue to stabilise our underlying health & personal care packaging activities, we are now starting to leverage our core capabilities to drive revenue growth through initiatives such as additional commercial programmes to materially increase customer share of wallet, developing a broader and deeper service proposition and expanding geographically with existing customers. combined with further internal upgrading of our innovation capability to become a more commercially (rather than operationally) led business, and hence a more strategic partner, these initiatives – which are being led by our new divisional managing director, kamal taneja, who joined us in october – are aimed at improving customer and market visibility, and thereby dampening the historical volatility in the project pipeline. with a strong position in combustibles, and an expanding presence in both ngp segments, there is the possibility for us to grow in such emerging technologies given the early stage of evaluating each of these potential medium to long-term value-creating levers, these are not opportunities which we are assuming to be certain and we will update the financial markets accordingly as our analysis progresses. accounting for fy 2017 revenue of c. £164m – and with a (potentially variable) high single-digit adjusted operating margin in aggregate – these activities comprise extrusion, pipe protection technologies, tear tapes, speciality tapes, industrial supply (the maintenance, repair & overhaul (“mro”) industrial components business) and card solutions (security). with effect from 1 january 2018, tim wilson joined essentra as divisional president and – over and above maximising short-term tactical opportunities – his task over the next six months will be to work with each of the respective business heads to formulate a full range of longer-term strategies. in the case of the former, operating profit growth and margin are now prioritised, while in the case of the latter there is an emphasis on working capital (measured as average working capital per month as a percentage of revenue), property, plant & equipment and gearing: this translates into an increased focus on returns, both return on capital employed (ie, how we are using our balance sheet) and return on total invested capital (including accumulated goodwill etc from acquisition spend). annual report 2017 | www.essentraplc.com 14 strategic report | chief executive’s review people at all levels, our employees are a vital resource in the company’s pursuit of operational excellence and the provision of quality products and services to our customers. with the average age of employees at our manufacturing sites increasing, we believe that such an initiative is an excellent way of attracting new talent to our business – particularly in skilled operational roles – and to offer them a rewarding and varied career . nowhere is this more evident than at our sites in puerto rico, where hurricane maria caused devastation beyond anything most of us can imagine. while our experienced local team was well prepared for the hurricane strike, nonetheless the response of our 345 employees at manati and guaynabo in reporting for work at a time when many of them were facing significant personal challenges was truly humbling, and the board, gmc and i would like to pay tribute to their outstanding commitment to our business. we will also expect employees to participate fully in the improvement of standards – not least site managers and supervisors – to ensure that healthy and safe working conditions are maintained within their sphere of influence at all times. leading essentra packaging with effect from october is iain percival, who joined essentra as managing director of the europe & asia business in march 2017; supporting iain will be a number of senior global roles, which we have already made good progress in recruiting. however, together we have made great progress and tangible improvement in 2017 , so we are already well on our way.” annual report 2017 | www.essentraplc.com 17 strategic report | chief executive’s review strategy and progress our aim is to make essentra the best company it can be. 4 as

financial review “in 2017 , we strengthened the balance sheet, generated a very good level of cash conversion and refinanced our entire debt facilities, helping to secure not only our current financial stability but also underpinning our medium to long-term position.” this refinancing optimises essentra’s financial position going forward, in terms of interest cost, sources of funding and maturities – as well as providing further headroom – thus underpinning the medium and long-term financial stability of the company as we pursue our strategic objectives. the company uses derivatives only to manage foreign currency and interest rate risk arising from underlying business activities. foreign exchange risk the majority of essentra’s net assets are in currencies other than sterling.

stability to the business was fundamental to securing the opportunities to exploit future growth prospects. the governance improvement programme includes a number of specific initiatives designed to deliver more effective governance, driven by the adoption of risk management (enterprise risk and business continuity) internal audit, and compliance programmes in line with best practice. in addition, a new group risk committee (“grc”) chaired by the chief executive has been constituted. management will be responsible for managing local level risk and reporting to the respective divisional board. changes in the traditional tobacco market have strategic ramifications for essentra, presenting both potential risks and future opportunities. tobacco-related litigation could also adversely affect essentra, although there is no history of the company being involved in such a claim. annual report 2017 | www.essentraplc.com 44 strategic report | management of principal risks

similarly, the company is reliant on certain sites and their equipment in some cases to manufacture specific products. should such machinery not be able to operate for an extended period of time this could also have a material profit impact. our operations based in india, indonesia and thailand are additionally accredited to sa 8000 which details fundamental principles of human rights. our approach is to support and enhance employee efforts in their respective communities through applying essentra’s resources, and there are many local programmes across the company which involve significant employee engagement through direct involvement or secondment. given the number of jurisdictions in which we do business, essentra has adopted a third party due diligence policy. employees’ understanding of these policies is supported by an e-learning training programme and, where applicable, we hold classroom-style training sessions, with all divisions being required to identify what are the most prevalent risks to their respective activities – taking into consideration the markets into which they do business. to date, all our principal manufacturing facilities apply an

elements of executive remuneration and stakeholder management are adhered to are other important considerations in ensuring shareholder trust in the company, and these are discussed in more detail in the remuneration committee chairman’s letter on pages 81 to 85. paul lester, cbe chairman annual report 2017 | www.essentraplc.com 64 directors’ report | chairman’s corporate governance statement corporate governance framework our governance improvement programme is designed to ensure that there is an effective corporate governance framework, supported by robust processes, procedures and controls, which by 2020, is aligned with ftse 250 upper quartile best practice. colin day was an executive director until april 2017 , during which time he held three external non-executive positions. in compliance with the code, all eligible directors will put themselves forward for re-election on an annual basis. essentra has begun a diversity & inclusion programme, with some externally facilitated support, to ensure behaviours fully reflect the principles of diversity and inclusion across the company, and it is intended to develop a specific policy as part of that programme. throughout a director’s tenure, they are encouraged to develop their knowledge of the group through meetings with senior management and site visits. this is achieved by regular updates through public announcements, the corporate website and other published material. in that role, he is available to shareholders to discuss and develop an understanding of their issues and any concerns which cannot be resolved by discussions with the chairman, the chief executive or group finance director, or where such contact is inappropriate. further details of the company’s risk management framework and activities during 2017 are provided on pages 40 to 49 . there is no related party connection with korn ferry or ridgeway partners, and the assignments were undertaken on an arm’s length basis. the transition from kpmg has been completed in a seamless way, and pwc have performed very well during their first year. at each meeting, reports are presented detailing any claims made under the company’s independent right to speak process. in making this assessment, the audit committee had due regard to their expertise, resourcing and independence. such changes are carefully planned to ensure that the group benefits from staff continuity without incurring undue risk of inefficiency. there are no contractual obligations in place that restrict the company’s choice of statutory auditor . it is, however, also acknowledged that, due to its detailed understanding of the company’s business, it may sometimes be necessary to involve the external auditor in non-audit related work, principally comprising further assurance services relating to due diligence and other duties carried out in respect of acquisitions, disposals, tax services (outside the eu) and other services. this now forms part of our new policy and is already reflected in the company’s key performance indicators on pages 20 to 21 and is most likely to be implemented in the 2019 long term incentive plan (“ltip”). one half of the bonuses earned will be deferred and payable in essentra shares which will vest after three years in 2021. full details are set out on page 99. annual report 2017 |

salary reviews executive director salaries will be reviewed on an annual basis in april each year. remuneration for executive directors is structured so that the variable performance-related pay element forms a significant portion of each package. performance is assessed against measures and targets which are established on an annual basis by the remuneration committee. vesting will be

provided centrally to support the operating segments. the assets have been written down to their recoverable amount, which represents fair value less costs of disposal. with effect from 1 january 2018, a new organisation structure has been implemented comprising these strategic business units (see note 28 for further details). goodwill is allocated to groups of cash generating units, in accordance with the new operating segment structure as follows: operating segment goodwill 2017 £m components 83.8 packaging 189.0 filters – specialist components 74.7 347.5 annual report 2017 |

at 31 december 2016. the assets were disposed of with the porous technologies business in march 2017. the health & personal care packaging business faced significant operational and commercial challenges during 2016. integration of the acquired clondalkin operations and the associated site rationalisation programme has experienced significant issues and resulted in losses of customers, particularly in the uk, the us and the netherlands. furthermore, there has been significant scaling back of high margin security feature business in the tear tape operations. essentra’s $155.0m us private placement loan notes are at a weighted average interest rate of 5.26% per annum (2016: 5.64%). in accordance with its treasury policy, essentra does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. essentra had us dollar and euro denominated borrowings which it designated as hedges of its net investments in subsidiary undertakings. at the year end it is expected that earnings from certain overseas group companies will be remitted and a deferred tax liability of £4.5m (2016: £4.2m) has been recognised accordingly. the amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is £107 .8m as at 31 december 2017 (2016: £113.7m), and the associated amount of unrecognised deferred tax is £11.5m (2016: £11.7m). the other asset class relates primarily to property and hedge funds, which are valued at their cumulative unit offer price. essentra uses derivatives only to manage currency and interest rate risk arising from underlying business activities. trade and other receivables essentra’s exposure to credit risk is driven by the profile of its customers. the ageing of the impaired receivables provided for is as follows: 2017 £m 2016 £m up to 3 months – – over 3 months 4.5 4.7 4.5 4.7 the movement in the provision for impaired receivables (including amounts relating to disposal group held for sale) is as follows: 2017 £m 2016 £m beginning of year 4.7 4.3 impaired receivables acquired 0.3 – impairment loss recognised 1.5 2.4 utilisation (2.0) (2.0) end of year 4.5 4.7 annual report 2017 | www.essentraplc.com 156 financial statements | notes 18. financial risk management continued derivative assets credit risk with respect to derivatives is controlled by limiting transactions to major banking counterparties where internationally agreed standard form documentation exists. essentra does not formally define the proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate percentage on an individual basis with each business by reference to the group’s risk management policies and prevailing market conditions. the group documents currency derivatives used to hedge its forecast transactions as cash flow hedges. the following table shows essentra’s sensitivity to a 1%, 5% and 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all currencies. it is assumed that all net investment and cash flow hedges will continue to be 100% effective. essentra’s available undrawn committed facilities at 31 december were: 2017 £m 2016 £m expiring after two years 218.3 103.2 any loans drawn on these facilities would bear interest at floating rates with reference to libor for the currency and period of the loan. 22. commitments

management must also determine the recoverable amount for other finite-lived assets where impairment indicators are identified. disclosures included within note 8 have also been assessed for compliance with requirements and deemed reasonable. the group is split into three divisions being components solutions, health & personal care packaging, and filter products. we determined the most effective approach was to engage pwc local component teams to perform full scope procedures over 20 reporting units, with the group audit team performing full scope audit work over a further 5 reporting units. this approach ensures that appropriate audit coverage has been obtained over all financial statement line items. we issued written instructions to all component auditors and had regular communications with them throughout the audit cycle. this included a clearance meeting with each component team and review of all significant matters reported. registration is entirely voluntary, and you may request a hard copy of the shareholder documents or change your election at any time.
