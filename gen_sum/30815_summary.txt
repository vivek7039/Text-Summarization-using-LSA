Non-GAAP measures Throughout this FY 2017 Annual Report,  the following terms are used to describe  Essentra’s financial performance. Essentra’s  offering also includes e-cigarette and Heat  Not Burn solutions to the rapidly evolving  market for Next Generation Products. Essentra’s Ethics Code helps to ensure that  everyone working for or on behalf of the  Company understands its expectations  and conducts Essentra business in a way  that is consistent with the Company’s six  principles and with its procedures. Through  harnessing this strength in diversity with   a clearly defined and unifying role for the  Group – all of which underpinned by clear  financial and capital allocation policies,  appropriately aligned to management  incentives – we are well-placed to   create sustainable long-term growth   for our shareholders. A portfolio of activities … … With shared business priorities … … Sustainable, long-term value ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM 7 STRATEGIC REPORT | WHAT WE DO CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT In my first full year as Chairman,   I am very pleased to report that 2017  saw stability being restored to Essentra  after a year of challenge and change in  2016, with our new corporate strategy  being unveiled by Chief Executive, Paul  Forman, at the time of our HY 2017  results. My initial impressions When I joined Essentra, it was clear that  the Company had experienced a number  of challenges. With effect from 1 January  2018, Tim Wilson joined Essentra as  divisional President and – over and   above maximising short-term tactical  opportunities – his task over the next six  months will be to work with each of the  respective business heads to formulate   a full range of longer-term strategies. Not least among these is Corporate  Governance and, consistent with the  Board’s ongoing commitment to  promoting a strong culture of the highest  standards of business ethics based on  clear principles, we now have an externally  benchmarked and supported route to  upper quartile FTSE 250 performance by  2020. With the average age of employees at our  manufacturing sites increasing, we believe  that such an initiative is an excellent way   of attracting new talent to our business –  particularly in skilled operational roles – and  to offer them a rewarding and varied career . Nowhere is  this more evident than at our sites in  Puerto Rico, where hurricane Maria caused  devastation beyond anything most of us  can imagine. Leading Essentra  Packaging with effect from October is Iain  Percival, who joined Essentra as Managing  Director of the Europe & Asia business   in March 2017; supporting Iain will be   a number of senior global roles, which   we have already made good progress   in recruiting. The Company uses  derivatives only to manage foreign currency  and interest rate risk arising from underlying  business activities. Offering a full range of value-adding  design and production services, Essentra  Extrusion is well placed to provide  purpose-developed products based on  unique specifications. Our objective is to  leverage our extensive in-house capabilities  – including a laboratory, R&D department  and tooling expertise – to partner with  customers from the earliest stages of new  product development and provide them  with a compelling value proposition, no  matter how complex the finished product. In Turkey, we extended  into a second facility, to accommodate  the expansion of both our metal hardware  and mainline plastics components offering,  while new injection moulding equipment  with reduced set-up time was installed at  both Kidlington and our Americas regional  manufacturing hub in Erie, US.

Industry specification As the industrial and retail sectors  continue to evolve, there is a growing  interest in replacing traditional fastening  solutions with high quality, efficient,  lighter-weight alternatives.

Changes in the traditional tobacco  market have strategic ramifications for  Essentra, presenting both potential risks  and future opportunities. Tobacco-related litigation could also  adversely affect Essentra, although there   is no history of the Company being involved  in such a claim.

Should trade tariffs or a  customs border be imposed, this could  restrict the supply chain opportunities  available to these sites. These include:  > Potential changes to the European asset and  manufacturing footprint to optimise material flows  > Optimisation of product manufacturing locations  versus customer locations  > Seeking alternative raw material supply sources   to minimise cross-border flows  > Seeking “Approved Economic Operator” status   to minimise inspection delays ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM 46 STRATEGIC REPORT | MANAGEMENT OF PRINCIPAL RISKS Operational Risks Description Mitigation Operational Resilience  – Natural Catastrophes   and Fire Likelihood: Low   Impact: High   Change in risk level: Same   Ownership:   Group Operations Director  Categorisation:   Industry General The Group has some single manufacturing  site dependencies for the production of  specific products and meeting particular  customer requirements. ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM 47 STRATEGIC REPORT | MANAGEMENT OF PRINCIPAL RISKS Operational Risks Description Mitigation Internal Business   Processes Likelihood: Medium   Impact: Medium  Change in risk level: New   Ownership:   Divisions and   Enabling Functions  Categorisation:   Company Specific A number of the issues that have previously  impacted the Company were due to  weaknesses in internal business processes  and controls. Similarly, the Company is reliant on certain  sites and their equipment in some cases to  manufacture specific products. Should such  machinery not be able to operate for an  extended period of time this could also  have a material profit impact. Our  operations based in India, Indonesia   and Thailand are additionally accredited   to SA 8000 which details fundamental  principles of human rights. Given the number of jurisdictions in which  we do business, Essentra has adopted a  Third Party Due Diligence policy. Employees’ understanding of these policies  is supported by an e-Learning training  programme and, where applicable, we  hold classroom-style training sessions,   with all divisions being required to identify  what are the most prevalent risks to their  respective activities – taking into  consideration the markets into which   they do business. To date, all our principal manufacturing  facilities apply an Environmental  Management Systems (“EMS”) based on  the ISO 14001 standard.

Following a review during 2017 ,   it has therefore been decided that this  measure will no longer form part of our  environmental targets. Tommy  brings significant experience to Essentra, in particular  of growing diverse businesses both organically and  via acquisition during his 30-year career with DCC. In compliance with the  Code, all eligible Directors will put  themselves forward for re-election on an  annual basis. Essentra  has begun a Diversity & Inclusion  programme, with some externally  facilitated support, to ensure behaviours  fully reflect the principles of diversity and  inclusion across the Company, and it is  intended to develop a specific policy as  part of that programme. Throughout a Director’s  tenure, they are encouraged to develop  their knowledge of the Group through  meetings with senior management and  site visits. In that role, he is available to  shareholders to discuss and develop   an understanding of their issues and   any concerns which cannot be resolved   by discussions with the Chairman, the  Chief Executive or Group Finance Director,  or where such contact is inappropriate. There is no related party connection with  Korn Ferry or Ridgeway Partners, and the  assignments were undertaken on an arm’s  length basis. The transition  from KPMG has been completed in a  seamless way, and PwC have performed  very well during their first year. At each  meeting, reports are presented detailing  any claims made under the Company’s  independent Right to Speak process. Such changes are  carefully planned to ensure that the   Group benefits from staff continuity  without incurring undue risk of inefficiency. > Strategy alignment   Since his appointment in January   2017 , Paul Forman has completed   a full strategic review of the Company. > Shareholder consultation  We have proactively engaged with our  major shareholders and proxy voting  agencies on the updated Remuneration  Policy prior to publication. After careful consideration the Remuneration Committee has decided that 2018 LTIP awards will be subject   to a combination of relative TSR, EPS and cash flow measures. The Remuneration Committee will most likely  introduce a capital return measure for LTIP awards to be made in 2019 and subsequent years. Amended approach  to salary reviews Executive Director salaries will be reviewed on an annual basis in April each year. Remuneration for Executive Directors   is structured so that the variable  performance-related pay element forms   a significant portion of each package. Performance is assessed against  measures and targets which are  established on an annual basis by   the Remuneration Committee. External appointments Essentra recognises its senior executives   can benefit from serving in a personal  capacity as Non-Executive Directors of  non-Essentra Group companies. Executive Directors  are permitted to accept non-executive  directorships offered by listed companies  and other organisations, which provide  industry experience or public service. Potential circumstances in which the malus and clawback provisions may be applied are consistent with  those applying to annual bonus awards as described above. If this increase is approved, the Directors  would not anticipate needing to propose  any further change for a number of years. Additionally, the recognition of  losses based on forward-looking estimates  reflecting current and forecast conditions  may lead to greater volatility in credit loss  provisions. Such assets, or disposal  groups, are generally measured at the  lower of their carrying amount and fair  value less costs to sell. With effect from 1 January 2018, a   new organisation structure has been  implemented, comprising four different  divisions (see note 28 for further details). The assets have been written down to their recoverable amount, which represents fair value less costs of disposal. With effect from 1 January 2018, a new organisation structure has been implemented comprising these strategic business units   (see note 28 for further details).

Furthermore, there has been significant scaling back of  high margin security feature business in the tear tape operations. Essentra had US dollar and euro denominated borrowings which it designated as hedges of its net investments in subsidiary undertakings. At the year end it is expected that earnings from certain overseas Group companies will be remitted and   a deferred tax liability of £4.5m (2016: £4.2m) has been recognised accordingly.
