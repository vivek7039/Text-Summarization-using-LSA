ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 24 Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 BUILD A WORLD-CLASS, LONG-LIFE, LOW-COST PRODUCTION FACILITY Strategy in action 1 We have engaged the services of world- class construction partners to develop our innovative mine which is being constructed to extract large volumes of polyhalite at low-cost. POLY4 has four key attributes that benefit farmers by increasing their profits in a sustainable way through improved crop yields, reduced costs or both. This is a key profit driver as more nutrients are used by the crop for yield and quality improvements. Available in granulated, powdered or standard form, POLY4 is compatible with all major input sources for NPK blending, demonstrating both chemical and physical compatibility. POLY4 also has no detrimental effect on a soil’s electrical conductivity or pH, both of which can be harmful to crops. POLY4 can be used directly or in an NPK blend to supply potassium, sulphur, magnesium, calcium and a range of valuable micro-nutrients. Our extensive R&D programme demonstrates POLY4 can be used on a multitude of crops in numerous geographies with varying climatic conditions. Partner: University of Minnesota Highlights: • US$247 increase in return per hectare • Up to 15% increase in yield • Up to 9% increase in dry kernel weight • Grain quality maintained or improved • Increase in plant populations • 45% decrease in weed presence For complete trial summary: POLY4 on broadacre crops PLEASE VISIT OUR PRODUCT WEBSITE POLY4.COM ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 30 Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Strategy in action continued • Minerals and land acquisition • Resource definition • Planning and approvals • Definitive feasibility study • Site preparation • Procurement • Shafts EXECUTE A FINANCING PLAN THAT DELIVERS RETURNS FOR SHAREHOLDERS 4 Note: 1 Five equity capital raises between 2011 and 2015 Sirius Minerals acquire North Yorkshire polyhalite Project Equity capital1 Stage 1 financing 2010 2016 DEVELOPMENT CONSTRUCTION 1 2 31 Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 • Targeting at least US$1 billion EBITDA at 10 Mtpa • High-margin business • Potential for expansion • MTS • MHF • Harbour facility • Pit-bottom development During the development of the Company, Sirius has strategically raised funds to enable progression between key Project milestones.

In recognition of this, our business has been designed to deliver high production capacity and low operating costs. • The lower CO 2 e emissions associated with POLY4 are due to its environmentally friendly and sustainable method of production. The Company is working with a range of stakeholders to promote these more sustainable practices in key agricultural markets. Sirius continues to provide opportunities for young people across the area, including apprenticeships, work placements and taking on new graduates. Earlier this year, the first funding round was opened to support community projects, awarding grants of between £500 and £5,000. To produce POLY4 involves a simple granulation process which does not require chemical processing and has no waste products.

Looking forward 2018 will be another year of steady hiring to expand our workforce and introduce key talent predominantly into the construction team. We have a strong Board and management team with extensive experience in financing large, multi-billion Dollar Projects. There is no assurance that, even as commercial quantities of polyhalite ore are produced, a profitable market will exist for it. 1 3 4 1 3 4 1 2 3 4 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 50 Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 PRINCIPAL RISKS MITIGATION TREND STRATEGY LINK Currency Sirius Minerals will have currency exposures arising from both its capital expenditure and operating costs and the sale of polyhalite ore.

Having reviewed such non-audit services the Committee is satisfied that they did not prejudice PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s independence or objectivity. Prior to this, the Group had a whistleblowing policy in place whereby an employee could raise any concerns direct with management. We will emerge as a disruptive, world-leading fertilizer operation and the opportunity to create value for our shareholders is sizeable. For the avoidance of doubt, there is no intention to grant such exceptional awards on an ongoing basis. Achieving our transformational milestones significantly ahead of plan would require outstanding Company performance through consistent innovation, constant drive and successful execution. Pension contributions for our Executive Directors will continue to be in line with auto enrolment minimum contribution requirements at the level of circa. However, the maximum bonus earned for 2018 may be increased up to 200% of salary if a successful stage 2 financing is achieved. Pension contributions for our Executive Directors will continue to be line with the wider workforce at circa 1%. However, the maximum bonus earned for 2018 may be increased up to 200% of salary if a successful stage 2 financing is achieved. Targets (which may be based on financial or strategic measures) and individual objectives are determined to reflect the Company’s strategy. Non-Executive Directors may be paid additional fees on a daily rate basis where the time required to fulfil their duties is significantly more than anticipated. Any such payments or awards are excluded from the maximum level of variable remuneration referred to above. Where a position is filled internally, any ongoing remuneration obligations or outstanding variable pay elements shall be allowed to continue in accordance with their terms.

Therefore, these financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result if the going concern basis of preparation was inappropriate. Segment reporting IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires information to be disclosed about each business activity and economic environment in which the Group operates. Therefore disclosures required under IFRS 8 are already included in the primary statements and so no further information requires disclosure. Goodwill arising on consolidation is recognised as an asset and allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. Development costs on activities that have moved past the research phase are capitalised and depreciated over their expected useful lives. The Group operates three equity-settled share-based payment arrangements as part of its employee remuneration strategy which are detailed below. It is expected that this exposure will reduce over time by conversion of the convertible loans (which will crystallise all currency fluctuations in equity without requiring any cash settlement by the Group), meaning that this is not expected to give rise to a material cash flow risk. This risk is mitigated by placing bank deposits and entering into financial instruments only with approved institutions who have an S&P credit rating of at least A-. The registered office of these subsidiaries is Third Floor, Greener House, 68 Haymarket, London, SW1Y 4RF (3f GH) unless otherwise stated.
