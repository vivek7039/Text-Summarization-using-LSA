context well positioned to meet demand fertilizers are a fundamental requirement of modern agriculture and the global food supply chain. every growing season, plants take up nutrients from the soil, depleting those that are naturally available. there are six macro-nutrients all plants require: nitrogen (n), phosphorus (p), potassium (k), magnesium (mg), sulphur (s) and calcium (ca). through this process, we believe that the sirius value proposition continues to grow and be further enhanced. the cornerstones describe poly4’s unique value proposition and are proving to be an effective marketing tool. penetrate existing markets and drive long-term value we have a three-step approach to our marketing strategy: • substitution – utilising poly4 as a substitute for other existing fertilizers

strategy in action continued 2 poly4 is the trademark name of sirius minerals’ flagship granular polyhalite product. poly4 has four key attributes that benefit farmers by increasing their profits in a sustainable way through improved crop yields, reduced costs or both. this is a key profit driver as more nutrients are used by the crop for yield and quality improvements. available in granulated, powdered or standard form, poly4 is compatible with all major input sources for npk blending, demonstrating both chemical and physical compatibility. poly4 also spreads effectively up to 36 metres, preventing uneven fertilizer distribution and subsequently reduction in crop yields. poly4 also has no detrimental effect on a soil’s electrical conductivity or ph, both of which can be harmful to crops. poly4 can be used directly or in an npk blend to supply potassium, sulphur, magnesium, calcium and a range of valuable micro-nutrients. 4. sustainability poly4 is a sustainable multi-nutrient fertilizer: • improves soil strength, structure and nutrient legacy; • reduces agriculture’s impact on the environment by improving fertilizer use efficiency, reducing erosion and nutrient loss; • certified for organic use; • excellent environmental profile. poly4 granules additional information financial statements governance strategic report 28 estimated potential substitute opportunity in

during 2017 for the purposes of developing the project. with so many key components underway simultaneously, our disciplined approach to capital expenditure will be maintained. • the lower co 2 e emissions associated with poly4 are due to its environmentally friendly and sustainable method of production. furthermore, poly4 has also been shown to improve soil strength, structure, nutrient legacy and reduce agriculture’s impact by improving fertilizer use efficiency (ensuring more fertilizer is taken up by the plant and not lost into the environment). the company is working with a range of stakeholders to promote these more sustainable practices in key agricultural markets. sirius continues to provide opportunities for young people across the area, including apprenticeships, work placements and taking on new graduates. earlier this year, the first funding round was opened to support community projects, awarding grants of between £500 and £5,000. to produce poly4 involves a simple granulation process which does not require chemical processing and has no waste products. credit: ebor images north york moors national park additional information financial statements

drive and successful execution. however, the maximum bonus earned for 2018 may be increased up to 200% of salary if a successful stage 2 financing is achieved. further details in relation to the

group’s stage 1 financing activities during the 2016 financial year has resulted in a number of complex financing arrangements being entered into with third parties, specifically: • us$250 million royalty agreement with hancock british holdings limited • us$50 million equity arrangement with hancock british holdings limited • us$400 million of group issued dollar denominated convertible bonds. (group and parent) we obtained management’s valuation model for each of the financing instruments listed. therefore, these financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result if the going concern basis of preparation was inappropriate. segment reporting ifrs 8 operating segments requires information to be disclosed about each business activity and economic environment in which the group operates. therefore disclosures required under ifrs 8 are already included in the primary statements and so no further information requires disclosure. for more information see note 14 on page 126. fair valuation of derivative financial instruments the group has certain financial instruments associated with the stage 1 financing which it is required to classify as derivatives and measure at fair value. for more information see note 12 on page 124. impairment of assets at each reporting date, the group assesses whether there is any indication that any of its assets may be impaired and recognises an impairment if the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. estimation is required in assessing the recoverable amount of a given asset at each measurement date. goodwill arising on consolidation is recognised as an asset and allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. development costs on activities that have moved past the research phase are capitalised and depreciated over their expected useful lives. additional information financial statements governance strategic report 120 sirius minerals plc annual report &
