mine which is being constructed to extract large volumes of polyhalite at low-cost. poly4 has four key attributes that benefit farmers by increasing their profits in a sustainable way through improved crop yields, reduced costs or both. this is a key profit driver as more nutrients are used by the crop for yield and quality improvements. available in granulated, powdered or standard form, poly4 is compatible with all major input sources for npk blending, demonstrating both chemical and physical compatibility. poly4 also has no detrimental effect on a soil’s electrical conductivity or ph, both of which can be harmful to crops. poly4 can be used directly or in an npk blend to supply potassium, sulphur, magnesium, calcium and a range of valuable micro-nutrients. sirius minerals plc annual

financial year has resulted in a number of complex financing arrangements being entered into with third parties, specifically: • us250 million royalty agreement with hancock british holdings limited • us50 million equity arrangement with hancock british holdings limited • us400 million of group issued dollar denominated convertible bonds. therefore, these financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result if the going concern basis of preparation was inappropriate. segment reporting ifrs 8 operating segments requires information to be disclosed about each business activity and economic environment in which the group operates. therefore disclosures required under ifrs 8 are already included in the primary statements and so no further information requires disclosure. for more information see note 12 on page 124. impairment of assets at each reporting date, the group assesses whether there is any indication that any of its assets may be impaired and recognises an impairment if the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. goodwill arising on consolidation is recognised as an asset and allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. development costs on activities that have moved past the research phase are capitalised and depreciated over their expected useful lives. the group operates three equity-settled share-based payment arrangements as part of its employee remuneration strategy which are detailed below. it is expected that this exposure will reduce over time by conversion of the convertible loans (which will crystallise all currency fluctuations in equity without requiring any cash settlement by the group), meaning that this is not expected to give rise to a material cash flow risk. this risk is mitigated by placing bank deposits and entering into financial instruments only with approved institutions who have an s&p credit rating of at least a-. basis of preparation these financial
