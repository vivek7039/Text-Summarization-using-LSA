the group’s head office is in windsor, uk from where all of its operations are performed and controlled. on behalf of the board, i would like to thank everyone at record for their valuable contribution towards this success. investment performance uk-based dynamic hedging programmes allowed uk investors to capture gains in their underlying overseas exposures as sterling depreciated, by keeping hedge ratios low throughout the period. when recruiting staff early in their careers some subsequent attrition is inevitable, but this also creates a growing pool of alumni with whom we maintain strong relationships. these strong operational capabilities are supplemented by a team of highly experienced personnel within the investment, client services and support teams. consequently, the market displays persistent patterns of behaviour or inefficiencies which record believes are best exploited by quantitative, systematic processes. this convergence-driven return opportunity combined with a selection based on interest rate differentials, relative valuations and discretionary risk management, is expected to result in long-term positive performance of the strategy. this market inefficiency has persisted across different currencies and is present in other asset classes, such as equities. currency is commonly thought of as trending and the momentum strategy seeks to make a return from this phenomenon. for example, if a currency deviates too much from its equilibrium value (as indicated by ppp), then this deviation will be corrected. with respect to return-seeking currency strategies, all four principal strands – carry, emerging markets, value and momentum – generated positive performance throughout the year. client relationships innovation people growth risk
