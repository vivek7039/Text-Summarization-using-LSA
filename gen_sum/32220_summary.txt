Record has always been an independent currency specialist, and has always focused on developing a deep understanding of the risk and reward opportunities in currency markets, so as to offer our clients the most appropriate solution to their needs. The Group’s Head Office is in Windsor, UK from where all of its operations are performed and controlled. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank everyone at Record for their valuable contribution towards this success. Investment performance UK-based Dynamic Hedging programmes allowed UK investors to capture gains in their underlying overseas exposures as sterling depreciated, by keeping hedge ratios low throughout the period. When recruiting staff early in their careers some subsequent attrition is inevitable, but this also creates a growing pool of alumni with whom we maintain strong relationships. Find out more about our strategy and objectives on pages 10 and 11 Record plc Annual Report 2017 9 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Outlook From a diverse picture of investors’ preferences a year ago, clearer themes have now emerged. These strong operational capabilities are supplemented by a team of highly experienced personnel within the investment, client services and support teams. Consequently, the market displays persistent patterns of behaviour or inefficiencies which Record believes are best exploited by quantitative, systematic processes. Design systematic processes to exploit them Manage each mandate to meet client needs Refine by continuing research Identify stable inefficiencies (i.e. patterns) Record plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic report 16 BUSINESS MODEL CONTINUED Passive Hedging: AUME $48.2 billion Passive Hedging mandates have the cost-effective reduction of exposure to currency risk as their sole objective by the symmetrical and unbiased elimination of currency volatility from clients’ international portfolios. This convergence-driven return opportunity combined with a selection based on interest rate differentials, relative valuations and discretionary risk management, is expected to result in long-term positive performance of the strategy. This market inefficiency has persisted across different currencies and is present in other asset classes, such as equities. Currency is commonly thought of as trending and the Momentum strategy seeks to make a return from this phenomenon. For example, if a currency deviates too much from its equilibrium value (as indicated by PPP), then this deviation will be corrected. Under the licensing agreement, Record provides signals that are used to dynamically hedge currency exposures within WisdomTree’s rules-based index family and this licensing agreement was extended during the year to include their newly-launched Canadian rules-based index family. Our products are delivered both through segregated mandates and pooled fund structures to suit individual client requirements. The Bank of Japan took new and innovative measures to combat deflation in September by explicitly setting a ten-year bond yield target of zero percent, which was particularly effective as global yields shifted upwards following the US election. With respect to return-seeking currency strategies, all four principal strands – Carry, Emerging Markets, Value and Momentum – generated positive performance throughout the year. FRB10 Index, Emerging Market, Momentum and Value can also be combined to create the Record Currency Multi-Strategy product. Record’s Multi-Strategy mandates combining Carry, Emerging Market, Momentum and Value strategies delivered positive performance over the period.

Cautionary statement This Annual Report contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results, operations and business of Record. Innovation Growth Profitability Diversification of investment capabilities across risk-reducing and risk-taking products to reduce single event/product exposure. Client relationships Innovation People Growth Risk management Profitability Record is committed to the highest ethical standards of conduct and regulatory compliance. Record’s risk appetite does not extend to taking either reputational or regulatory risks within the decision making process. Client relationships People Growth Profitability The Group’s investment process is steered by an Investment Committee comprising members of the Board and senior management and all products are managed on a predominantly systematic process which is not reliant on any individual employee. Alternative office facilities and equipment are available at a disaster recovery provider should the premises be compromised. Risk management Profitability Monthly reporting of all balance sheet exposures to the Executive Committee and Board. Our stakeholders, with whom we maintain an ongoing dialogue, include shareholders, clients, employees, regulators and the local community. Our approach to corporate social responsibility is built around three key areas: • community; • workplace; and • environment. Prior to joining Record, he qualified as a Chartered Accountant in 1994 and gained 15 years of audit experience within practice. He has spent 16 years at Record and previously worked as Assistant Treasurer for Minorco (part of Anglo American plc). There are currently three Non-executive Directors, David Morrison, being the Senior Independent Director, Jane Tufnell and Rosemary Hilary. The Code states that all directors of FTSE 350 companies should be subject to annual election by shareholders. All existing external appointments for each Director were considered and authorised by the Board in September 2016 as part of this annual review.

Rosemary Hilary was appointed on 1 June 2016 and so did not attend any meetings before that date. The Board agreed that full external evaluation of performance was not necessary at the current time but that a group discussion with all members present and a third party facilitator would be an efficient way to canvas opinions. The outcome of these appraisals in 2017 was positive and all roles were considered to be undertaken effectively. The Committee meets at least once a month and as necessary in response to individual or specific events requiring review. The Incident Management Policy has been updated accordingly to encompass such system breaches and data loss. This ensures that, whilst there is focus on areas deemed to be higher risk, all parts of the business are covered over a three year cycle. Following her appointment as Committee Chair Rosemary Hilary met privately with the internal audit partner to discuss Deloitte’s approach. The Committee is, therefore, concerned to ensure that our remuneration structure and policies work at all levels. The remuneration policy for all our staff including Executive Directors is designed to act in the long-term interests of all our key stakeholders, clients, shareholders, employees and regulators, as it links reward with performance in a straightforward and transparent way. Jane Tufnell and Rosemary Hilary, who was appointed as Non-executive Director on 1 June 2016, are the other independent Committee members. Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Group Profit Share Scheme, together with all employees. There is no such limit on the value of Unapproved Options, which may be granted with any exercise price (including nil), although the Committee’s policy is for Unapproved options awarded to Executive Directors to be struck at market price. All Executive Director option awards will be subject to a performance condition based on Record’s annual cumulative EPS growth. Any payments that are made will be in line with contractual entitlements and statutory requirements only.

External advisers The Group participated in a survey conducted by McLagan and received information regarding market rates of pay for staff. We also determine a lower level of specific materiality for certain areas such as directors’ remuneration and related party transactions. No other standards or interpretations issued but not yet effective are expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements. If such an indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated and compared to its carrying value. Provisions are discounted to their present values, where the time value of money is material. All provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. The Group provides Directors with revenue information disaggregated by product, whilst operating costs, assets and liabilities are presented on an aggregated basis. At the year end there were share options not exercised with an intrinsic value for tax purposes of £1,006,095 (2016: £47,742). Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at their original invoice value, as the interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash receipts over the short credit period is not considered to be material. The carrying amount of receivables whose terms have been renegotiated, that would otherwise be past due or impaired, is £nil (2016: £nil). Subsequently they are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss on forward foreign exchange contracts held to hedge cash flow is as follows: 2017 2016 Derivative financial instruments held to hedge cash flow £’000 £’000 Net loss on forward foreign exchange contracts at fair value through profit or loss (506) (315) Derivative financial instruments held for trading The Record Currency – FTSE FRB10 Index Fund and the Record Currency – Emerging Market Currency Fund, use forward foreign exchange contracts in order to achieve a return. In the Group’s judgement, bank deposits and treasury bills with maturities in excess of 3 months do not meet the definition of short-term or highly liquid and are held for purposes other than meeting short-term commitments. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is as follows: 2017 2016 Financial assets at 31 March £’000 £’000 Trade receivables 5,937 4,027 Accrued income 85 1,055 Other receivables 29 25 Other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 53 106 Money market instruments with maturities > 3 months 18,102 13,020 Cash and cash equivalents 19,120 21,720 43,326 39,953 The debtors’ age analysis is also evaluated on a regular basis for potential doubtful debts. The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position are grouped into the fair value hierarchy as follows: 2017 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Forward foreign exchange contracts used for hedging 18 — 18 — Forward foreign exchange contracts used for seed funds 35 — 35 — Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Forward foreign exchange contracts used for hedging (5) — (5) — Forward foreign exchange contracts used for seed funds (43) — (43) — Total 5 — 5 — 2016 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Forward foreign exchange contracts used for seed funds 106 — 106 — Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Forward foreign exchange contracts used for hedging (108) — (108) — Total (2) — (2) — There have been no transfers between levels in the reporting period (2016: none). Options are valued using an industry standard model with inputs based on observable market data whilst the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts may be established using interpolation of observable market data rather than from a quoted price. No expense has been recognised during the period in respect of bad or doubtful debts due from related parties.
