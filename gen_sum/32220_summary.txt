significant economic and regulatory changes affecting the financial services industry in general and foreign exchange markets in particular. as discussed further in the business review, record has reported its highest-ever aume, increased revenues and earnings, and further growth in revenue diversification, with revenues from passive hedging now covering all overheads excluding variable remuneration. constant innovation is key to meeting the needs of our clients in a challenging environment. outlook global financial markets continue to experience a mix of predicted and unexpected developments. on behalf of the board, i would like to thank everyone at record for their valuable contribution towards this success. investment performance uk-based dynamic hedging programmes allowed uk investors to capture gains in their underlying overseas exposures as sterling depreciated, by keeping hedge ratios low throughout the period. underlying revenues 2 £23.1m 9% underlying profit before tax £7.9m 13% 1. during the year ended 31 march 2017, record introduced a new product category (“multi-product”) in order to redefine the boundaries between existing products, and combinations of products, and redefined how aume is measured for this new category. when recruiting staff early in their careers some subsequent attrition is inevitable, but this also creates a growing pool of alumni with whom we maintain strong relationships. strategic progress record’s strategic progress over the year can be measured against each of the objectives set out on pages 10 and 11. find out more

investors’ preferences a year ago, clearer themes have now emerged. a full reconciliation of new and historic classifications is provided on page 103. record plc annual report 2017 strategic report 14 the group was founded over 30 years ago, and over this time it has developed a leading position in managing currency for institutional clients. these strong operational capabilities are supplemented by a team of highly experienced personnel within the investment, client services and support teams. the fx market is essential to global trade and finance and includes a high proportion of not-for-profit or forced participants, resulting in profit-seeking financial institutions continuing to represent a minority of fx market participants. consequently, the market displays persistent patterns of behaviour or inefficiencies which record believes are best exploited by quantitative, systematic processes. 1. source: bis triennial central bank survey of foreign exchange and otc derivatives markets (december 2016), wfe. design systematic processes to exploit them manage each mandate to meet client needs refine by continuing research identify stable inefficiencies (i.e. patterns) record plc annual report 2017 strategic report 16 business model continued passive hedging: aume $48.2 billion passive hedging mandates have the cost-effective reduction of exposure to currency risk as their sole objective by the symmetrical and unbiased elimination of currency volatility from clients’ international portfolios. carry the forward rate bias is the observation that higher yielding currencies tend to outperform lower yielding currencies over longer time periods, and is regarded by record as a fundamental and structural currency risk premium. this convergence-driven return opportunity combined with a selection based on interest rate differentials, relative valuations and discretionary risk management, is expected to result in long-term positive performance of the strategy. this market inefficiency has persisted across different currencies and is present in other asset classes, such as equities. currency is commonly thought of as trending and the momentum strategy seeks to make a return from this phenomenon. for example, if a currency deviates too much from its equilibrium value (as indicated by ppp), then this deviation will be corrected. by implementing more than one currency for return strategy, clients receive a diversified return stream which performs well under a variety of market conditions and reduces the correlation of their currency programme to other asset classes. under the licensing agreement, record provides signals that are used to dynamically hedge currency exposures within wisdomtree’s rules-based index family and this licensing agreement was extended during the year to include their newly-launched canadian rules-based index family. since record is not managing the exchange-traded funds that seek to track the performance of their respective wisdomtree dynamic currency hedged indexes, assets under management in these funds do not contribute to record’s aume. further information on product investment performance is given in the operating review section (page 20). our products are delivered both through segregated mandates and pooled fund structures to suit individual client requirements. whilst the general thrust of regulation is common across jurisdictions, there remain important implementation differences. with respect to return-seeking currency strategies, all four principal strands – carry, emerging markets, value and momentum – generated positive performance throughout the year. frb10 index, emerging market, momentum and value can also be combined to create the record currency multi-strategy product. record’s multi-strategy mandates combining carry, emerging market, momentum and value strategies delivered positive performance over the period. the pooled funds have historically offered clients a range of gearing and target volatility levels. ftse currency frb10 gbp excess return 3 4.45% 2.04% 4.62% currency value 4 1.37% 2.93% 3.13% currency momentum 5 2.06%

not attend any meetings before that date. the board agreed that full external evaluation of performance was not necessary at the current time but that a group discussion with all members present and a third party facilitator would be an efficient way to canvas opinions. a number of objectives for board performance improvement over the short term have been set. the outcome of these appraisals in 2017 was positive and all roles were considered to be undertaken effectively. the committee meets at least once a month and as necessary in response to individual or specific events requiring review. such a system of internal controls is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, risk of failure to meet business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatements or loss. the board will consider more than one appointment should sufficient high calibre candidates present themselves. the incident management policy has been updated accordingly to encompass such system breaches and data loss. this ensures that, whilst there is focus on areas deemed to be higher risk, all parts of the business are covered over a three year cycle. following her appointment as committee chair rosemary hilary met privately with the internal audit partner to discuss deloitte’s approach. the review was not confined to executive directors but addressed remuneration for all employees. the committee is, therefore, concerned to ensure that our remuneration structure and policies work at all levels. the remuneration policy for all our staff including executive directors is designed to act in the long-term interests of all our key stakeholders, clients, shareholders, employees and regulators, as it links reward with performance in a straightforward and transparent way. executive directors are eligible to participate in the group profit share scheme, together with all employees. the scheme is discretionary and employees do not have a contractual right to receive awards. there is no such limit on the value of unapproved options, which may be granted with any exercise price (including nil), although the committee’s policy is for unapproved options awarded to executive directors to be struck at market price. all executive director option awards will be subject to a performance condition based on record’s annual cumulative eps growth. any payments that are made will be in line with contractual entitlements and statutory requirements only. where applicable the broad aim in making termination payments is to avoid rewarding poor performance. fixed remuneration is comprised of salary, pension contributions, other benefits and any cash alternative. short-term short-term salaries gain on incentive incentive year ended and fees

the notes on pages 77 to 102 are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. for this reason the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. no other standards or interpretations issued but not yet effective are expected to have a material impact on the group’s financial statements. an employee benefit trust has been established for the purposes of satisfying certain share-based awards. if such an indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated and compared to its carrying value. (f) provisions and contingent liabilities provisions are recognised when present obligations as a result of a past event will probably lead to an outflow of economic resources from the group and amounts can be estimated reliably. provisions are discounted to their present values, where the time value of money is material. all provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. (g) equity share capital represents the nominal (par) value of shares that have been issued. the group provides directors with revenue information disaggregated by product, whilst operating costs, assets and liabilities are presented on an aggregated basis. at the year end there were share options not exercised with an intrinsic value for tax purposes of £1,006,095 (2016: £47,742). 14. trade and other receivables trade and other receivables are stated at their original invoice value, as the interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash receipts over the short credit period is not considered to be material. record plc annual report 2017 87 strategic report governance financial statements additional information 15. derivative financial assets and liabilities derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at cost on the date on which the contract is first entered into unless the fair value at acquisition is different to cost, in which case fair value is recognised. subsequently they are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognised in profit or loss. the fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined by reference to active market transactions. the net gain or loss on forward foreign exchange contracts held to hedge cash flow is as follows: 2017 2016 derivative financial instruments held to hedge cash flow £’000 £’000 net loss on forward foreign exchange contracts at fair value through profit or loss (506) (315) derivative financial instruments held for trading the record currency – ftse frb10 index fund and the record currency – emerging market currency fund, use forward foreign exchange contracts in order to achieve a return. in the group’s judgement, bank deposits and treasury bills with maturities in excess of 3 months do not meet the definition of short-term or highly liquid and are held for purposes other than meeting short-term commitments. 17. current liabilities trade and other payables are stated at their original invoice value, as the interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash payments over the short payment period is not considered to be material. the group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is as follows: 2017 2016 financial assets at 31 march £’000 £’000 trade receivables 5,937 4,027 accrued income 85 1,055 other receivables 29 25 other financial assets

evaluated on a regular basis for potential doubtful debts. interest rate risk arises from interest-bearing financial assets and liabilities held by the group. a sensitivity analysis has not been disclosed for the impact of interest rate changes as any reasonable range of change in interest rate would not directly have a material impact on profit or equity. record’s policy is to reduce the risk associated with the group’s sales denominated in foreign currencies by using forward fixed rate currency sales contracts, taking into account any forecast foreign currency cash flows. the financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position are grouped into the fair value hierarchy as follows: 2017 level 1 level 2 level 3 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 financial assets at fair value through profit or loss forward foreign exchange contracts used for hedging 18 — 18 — forward foreign exchange contracts used for seed funds 35 — 35 — financial

value through profit or loss forward foreign exchange contracts used for hedging (108) — (108) — total (2) — (2) — there have been no transfers between levels in the reporting period (2016: none). basis for classification of financial instruments classified as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy both forward foreign exchange contracts and options are classified as level 2. both of these instruments are traded on an active market. options are valued using an industry standard model with inputs based on observable market data whilst the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts may be established using interpolation of observable market data rather than from a quoted price. no expense has been recognised during the period in respect of bad or doubtful debts due from related parties. historic presentation mandate reclassification aume redefinition revised presentation aume us$ billion mar-16 mar‑17 mar-16 mar‑17 mar-16 mar‑17 mar-16 mar‑17 dynamic hedging 7.9 8.7 -1.8
