board after serving for nine years, ralph marshall stepped down as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting in may. during 2018 we will continue to selectively invest in the business, with a focus on digital, journalists, and content generation. historically circulation revenue performance remained relatively stable, with volume declines partially compensated by the cover price rises across both regional and national titles. in overall terms circulation volumes will remain challenged in 2018, with price elasticity amongst regional publishers becoming more limited, especially on regional daily titles, and moving to the point where price rises may not compensate overall volume declines as consumers continue to access content free across digital formats. back issues a va ilable fr om historic ne wspaper s, 0844 7707 68 4. monday9a pril 2018.r egister ed as an ew spaper with the post of ﬁc e . 3 i monda y 9april 2018 news voices t v iq b u s inesss por t 2-27 14-18 28-29 30-39 40-43 47-56 0% int er estonb alan ce tr an s f ers f or 27 mo nt hs 0% int er estonn ew pur ch as es for 27 mo nt hs yes, youare se eing do ub le (1.45% tran sf er fee a p pl ies) re pres en ta ti ve exam ple 19 .9%apr re pr es ent at ive( va ri abl e) 19 .9%p .a.

involved in accidents down to this year’s 0.7%. whilst declines in local print advertising and local newspaper sales revenue are expected to continue over this period, further strong growth in both the profitability of the i newspaper brand and digital revenue (excluding classifieds) is expected to continue which, along with additional cost savings, should help maintain profitability. camilla

imposed by these finance lease agreements, such as those concerning dividends, additional debt and further leasing. this means that changes in interest rates and inflation will leave the funding level
