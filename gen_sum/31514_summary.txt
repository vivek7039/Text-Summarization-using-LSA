Board After serving for nine years, Ralph Marshall stepped down as a Non-Executive Director at the Annual General Meeting in May. Instead, they are now looking for trusted media organisations which can provide verified content in a safe environment. Revenue derived from the i newspaper is marked by a greater emphasis on more stable circulation income, operating in the more predictable daily qualities market, at a price point we determined to have reasonable elasticity when compared to other titles within this market segment. During 2018 we will continue to selectively invest in the business, with a focus on digital, journalists, and content generation. Historically circulation revenue performance remained relatively stable, with volume declines partially compensated by the cover price rises across both regional and national titles. In overall terms circulation volumes will remain challenged in 2018, with price elasticity amongst regional publishers becoming more limited, especially on regional daily titles, and moving to the point where price rises may not compensate overall volume declines as consumers continue to access content free across digital formats. Johnston Press, is one of three major printers in the United Kingdom, (alongside Trinity Mirror and News UK). 3 i MONDA Y 9APRIL 2018 NEWS VOICES T V IQ B U S INESSS POR T 2-27 14-18 28-29 30-39 40-43 47-56 0% int er estonb alan ce tr an s f ers f or 27 mo nt hs 0% int er estonn ew pur ch as es for 27 mo nt hs Yes, youare se eing do ub le (1.45% tran sf er fee a p pl ies) Re pres en ta ti ve exam ple 19 .9%APR Re pr es ent at ive( va ri abl e) 19 .9%p .a.

The new iWeekend print product, an 88-page package launched in September 2017, grew Saturday circulation +7% (to 274,000, ABC, Dec 2017) despite a 33% cover price increase.

New enterprise partnerships Our new enterprise partnerships include a reader wine club with Virgin Wines, driven by calls to action in print and online. Adjusted circulation revenue This measure reflects the net effect of our pricing, sales volumes and customer offer for printed newspapers. Management’s continued focus on costs has enabled it to maintain an adjusted EBITDA margin of some 19.9% (2016: 20.8%). There were no accidents requiring notification under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) in 2017. Further downward pressure on revenues could reduce operating cashflow below the level required to service interest and pension commitments. In 2017, the Group initiated new changes to its business model, including how it allocated resources to different brands, its mix of field and call centre based sales staff, while also adopting a clear policy of downsizing its property portfolio, taking advantage of natural lease breaks, typically moving to smaller short term serviced offices in local towns and cities, while maintaining larger hubs in Preston, Leeds, Edinburgh, Peterborough, Sheffield and Portsmouth.

The Group also operates a defined benefits pension scheme, which was closed to future accrual on 30 June 2010. 32 Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Ensuring sustainable operations throughout our business CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY As a significant presence in communities across the country, we continue to ensure that our business activities meet with key sustainability and efficiency principles. We have continued to participate in phase 2 of the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme, and also operate Climate Change Agreements for our two larger print sites. Over the last six years we have significantly reduced our accident rate from 2.6% of all employees involved in accidents down to this year’s 0.7%. Individual Directors also make arrangements to attend a range of seminars presented by professionals throughout the year. Whilst declines in local print advertising and local newspaper sales revenue are expected to continue over this period, further strong growth in both the profitability of the i newspaper brand and digital revenue (excluding classifieds) is expected to continue which, along with additional cost savings, should help maintain profitability. Camilla Rhodes and Kjell Aamot, both of whom hold or have previously held board and/or executive management level posts in major media organisations, are also members. 49 Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial Statements Directors’ Governance Strategic Report Meetings The Audit Committee is required to meet not less than three times per year and has an agenda linked to events in the Group’s financial calendar. The Remuneration Committee has provided certain undertakings to ensure appropriate parameters are set, including a policy that only permits performance shares and includes mandatory bonus deferral. VCP awards were made in the form of premium-priced options, vesting based on stretching share price targets measured over a three-year performance period. External appointments Mr Highfield served as a Non-Executive Director of William Hill plc during 2017, stepping down in November. It aims for a continuous improvement in the Group’s environmental performance and to comply with all relevant regulations. A lower smoothing factor places more weight on recent years’ mortality experience when deriving projections for future longevity improvements. Accordingly we have considered a range of different metrics in determining materiality reflecting the uncertain market environment for newspaper publishers.

They will, in many cases, be ‘one-off’ and include items that span more than one financial period. Prior year comparatives have been restated so that the adjusted results are presented on a consistent basis between periods. The standard introduces an expected loss model approach to impairment of financial assets, which are principally accounts receivable and cash balances held with banks. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement given these assets are not carried at revalued amounts. Cash generating units are tested for impairment annually or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. Cash generating units are tested for impairment annually or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, excluding land, at varying rates calculated to write-off cost over the useful lives. Ancillary press equipment is depreciated over their economic useful life, which ranges between 5 and 15 years on a straight-line basis.

Since these fall across both half years, the Group’s financial results are not usually subject to significant seasonable variations from period-to-period. For a reconciliation from statutory (loss)/earnings refer to the Alternative Performance Measures section within this financial information. A decrease in the operating profit after central cost allocation is possible if revenues or costs do not meet forecasted numbers. The net intangible assets disposed of amounted to £16.0 million and further details can be found in Note 16. Impairment charges totalling of £3.9 million have been recognised against property, plant and equipment for the period ended 30 December 2017. There is no contingent rent payable or restrictions imposed by these finance lease agreements, such as those concerning dividends, additional debt and further leasing. This means that changes in interest rates and inflation will leave the funding level (calculated on a gilts + 0.5% basis) broadly unchanged. As a result of this mismatch, the funding level under IAS19 remains volatile to changes in corporate bond credit spreads that have not been hedged. 1 January 2017 £’000 Cash flow £’000 Non-cash movements £’000 Fair value gains and losses £’000 30 December 2017 £’000 Finance leases 1 (566) 118 (412) – (860) Bond (143,000) – – (22,825) (165,825) Total liabilities from financing activities (143,566) 118 (412) (22,825) (166,685) 1 Prior year comparatives have been re-presented.
