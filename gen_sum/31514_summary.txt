johnston press reaches both local and national audiences across the u.k. 5 johnston press plc annual report and accounts 2017 financial statements directors’ governance strategic report overall audience the johnston press portfolio offers a highly trusted well-established network of brands, with growing digital audiences, online, on mobile and via social media networks, more than offsetting print audience decline. 6 johnston press plc annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report chairman’s statement good performance considering the very challenging conditions during a sustained period of structural change in our business, we remain focused on delivering against our strategic objectives. led by a strong performance of the i newspaper, adjusted ebitda is in line with expectations. on 12 march 2018, it was announced that ashley highfield had been appointed to this advisory panel. board after serving for nine years, ralph marshall stepped down as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting in may. more details of our action plan, together with the gap data, can be found on our website: www.johnstonpress.co.uk outlook current trading remains very challenging and is expected to remain so for the remainder of this year. instead, they are now looking for trusted media organisations which can provide verified content in a safe environment. refer to the strategic review of financing options section on page 11 for more details. total adjusted revenue including the additional 14 weeks of i trading and excluding classified was up 1.8%. revenue derived from the i newspaper is marked by a greater emphasis on more stable circulation income, operating in the more predictable daily qualities market, at a price point we determined to have reasonable elasticity when compared to other titles within this market segment. i print and digital advertising revenue grew 27% in the second half of 2017, compared to the first half, providing a strong advertising revenue platform going into 2018. this reflects our efforts to establish the i newspaper brand as a politically unbiased, independent, quality, trusted brand that delivers a largely unique audience that all advertisers and their agencies should have on their media buying schedule. in 2017, unique browsers grew to an average of 25.4m per month, a 13% increase on prior year. in addition, only a relatively small percentage of the growing digital income has flowed to publishers such as johnston press, with the majority shifting to on-line platforms such as autotrader, indeed, linkedin and rightmove. this trend is driven by a somewhat stronger overall advertising market, our ability to precisely target audiences using ‘big data’, and improving sentiment towards quality print publishers in the wake of the fake news and social media trust concerns. during 2018 we will continue to selectively invest in the business, with a focus on digital, journalists, and content generation. the strategic review of financing options is ongoing and discussions with our various stakeholders are progressing. strategic review of financing options operationally the group is performing well in difficult market conditions. historically circulation revenue performance remained relatively stable, with volume declines partially compensated by the cover price rises across both regional and national titles. in overall terms circulation volumes will remain challenged in 2018, with price elasticity amongst regional publishers becoming more limited, especially on regional daily titles, and moving to the point where price rises may not compensate overall volume declines as consumers continue to access content free across digital formats. market trends continued diversification to a more balanced business sources 1 2017 annual report and accounts. 13 johnston press plc annual report and accounts 2017 financial statements directors’ governance strategic report recycling the new gold rus h sources: environment al science and technology: prosum (prospecting secondary rawmat eria ls in the urban mine and mining wa ste) elect ronic waste, knownase -w as te, is the fa stest grow ingf orm of waste in the wo rld, with 50 mill ion tonnes projected to be gener ated an nu allyby2 020. whi le recyc li ng en tired ev ic es or theirc omponen ts is made di ffi cult by the easil y damagedn atureoft he pr odu cts, recov ering th eir co pper,g old ando th er inte rnal va luable met a ls is increasin glym ore cost-ef fective th an tradi tional mini ng met hods . quote of the da y birthda ys cy nth ia nixon,a ct re ss, 52;

investments are measured at cost less any identified impairment losses at the end of each reporting period. loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. the group is under no legal obligation to make a payment in respect of prior year dividends. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. impairment of publishing titles and print presses the group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether intangible assets with indefinite useful lives have suffered any impairment based on the recoverable amount of its cash generating units. when management is aware, in making its assessment, of material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt upon the entities
