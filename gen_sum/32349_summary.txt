Enterprise We help large organisations make the most of technology to serve their customers better and address other business challenges. We continue to monitor against our set of Board objectives which are detailed further in the Corporate governance section. Demand for our fibre broadband across both business and consumer markets has remained high during the year with average take-up rates in excess of 30 per cent, where our fibre is available and we remain on target to make those services available to more than two thirds of premises by December 2017. New business has been signed with clients across a range of sectors, including Hastings Direct (Insurance), C Hoare & Co (Financial Services) and Dugout (Entertainment). Consistent with our existing commitment to a minimum full year dividend of 6.00p per share, the Board is recommending a final dividend of 4.00p per share, subject to shareholder approval at the company’s Annual General Meeting on 21 July 2017. Our strategy in this market represents a strong growth opportunity by creating an asset- light, margin-rich revenue stream.

This information is presented before exceptional items in order to provide a better understanding of the Group’s underlying performance. Enterprise During the year, we have seen year-on-year revenue growth, through growing relationships with key customers such as HMRC and NFU Mutual. In September 2016, we agreed a new five year £180.0 million revolving credit facility, on the same terms as our existing arrangements. Customers People Driving operational excellence Our value creation is underpinned by four strategic pillars 21 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 | Strategic report We recognise that our customers’ needs are better met if we work seamlessly with carefully selected partners to create combined service offerings. Progress for 2016/17 We have: > worked increasingly with providers of niche technologies that, when integrated with the scalable, mature platforms offered by best-in-class providers such as Amazon Web Services, CA Technologies, Cisco and Microsoft, offer a balance of stability and innovation in customer solutions. Progress for 2016/17 We have: > completed a programme of investment in our critical systems infrastructure that has significantly increased its reliability and improved its performance; > begun the transition to an API-centric IT architecture model, an agile and future-proof approach that enables us to benefit from the integration of third party applications within our infrastructure. We are focusing more on new technologies and applications; therefore the mitigation of this risk is very much aligned with our strategy. Growing revenue in our Enterprise segment to offset the decline of network-based revenues Why is it important? We are continuing with our investment plan to mitigate the risk of service failure from obsolete equipment. Any lessons learnt from such tests are fed back into the resilience planning process, which in turn is continually reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis. 2 To promote our values, both internally and in the way we do business with external stakeholders. > We have introduced a new HR advisory service to provide support for people managers and help them develop their skills in handling employee relations issues. The retired driving instructor took his first steps on social media at one of KCOM’s monthly internet drop-in sessions. “These sessions are a godsend really, without them I wouldn’t have much use for my iPad. > As part of our efforts to improve digital inclusion we introduced regular online skills sessions at more Hull and East Yorkshire locations. During the year we rationalised our supplier base to achieve economies of scale wherever possible and worked with individual suppliers to identify ways in which we can reduce their costs by introducing efficiencies such as streamlining ordering and delivery processes. Where we have done this it has achieved reductions in energy usage for air conditioning by up to 77 per cent. The Chairman ensures that an investor relations report setting out any feedback from shareholders is provided to the Board each month and discussed at each Board meeting, so that all of our Directors are kept informed of investor views. In addition, feedback from shareholder meetings is a standing agenda item for the Board at each meeting. Management judgement around when one-off items should be treated as exceptional was therefore an area for review. These usually involve some judgement in relation to the timing of revenue and cost recognition on such contracts. Rights and obligations attaching to shares In a general meeting of the Company voting is as follows: > on a show of hands, every member present in person shall have one vote; > on a show of hands, every proxy present who has been duly appointed by one or more members shall have one vote; and > on a poll, every member who is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which he or she is the holder. 51 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 | Directors’ report Having concluded that the structure of our current policy is effective and remains aligned with our strategy, we are proposing just four minor changes to enhance it further: > LTIP post-vesting holding period – We are introducing a two year post-vesting holding period for LTIP awards made from the year ended 31 March 2018 onwards to align Executive Director and shareholder interests over a five year period from the date of grant of an LTIP award. It became apparent to us during the recruitment process for our new Chief Financial Officer this year that the standard notice periods offered by other firms were set at 12 months and that therefore only being able to offer a six month notice period placed KCOM out of line with general market practice. Any existing remuneration commitments or contractual arrangements agreed prior to the approval and implementation of this Policy report will be honoured in accordance with their original terms. I hope that we can rely on your support for the resolutions relating to remuneration at our AGM in July 2017. Awards will typically vest after no less than three years, subject to the achievement of pre-set performance criteria and continued employment. Clawback and withholding provisions may be invoked for material misstatement, errors in assessing performance conditions or gross misconduct. This will require Executive Directors to hold any shares vesting from future awards under the LTIP, after tax, for a period of two years. Awards will typically vest after no less than three years, subject to the achievement of pre-set performance criteria and continued employment. Clawback and withholding provisions may be invoked for material misstatement, errors in assessing performance conditions or gross misconduct. This will require Executive Directors to hold any shares vesting from future awards under the LTIP, after tax, for a period of two years. There is a range of flexible benefits open to all employees, and the Executive Directors, that can be purchased each year. Executive Directors receive a slightly higher maximum pension contribution than other employees, at 20 per cent of base salary. Long-term incentives On an ongoing basis awards will be made in line with the policy for other Directors. Service contracts It was previously the policy to set notice periods for Executive Directors at six months for either party; however, it became apparent to us during the year that this put KCOM out of line with general market practice. The Committee is clear that there will be a consistent approach to exit payments and no reward for poor performance. All payments to Paul during the year have been made in accordance with our policy as stated on page 62. Policy on outside appointments We believe that where Board members hold directorships in other companies, KCOM can benefit from their experience. Retirement benefits Bill Halbert has elected not to be a member of the KCOM pension scheme and, accordingly, we made no contributions on his behalf. Any significant movement in EBITDA has always led to a corresponding movement in our share price and therefore it is extremely important for our investors that the Executive Directors are incentivised to achieve an EBITDA above market expectations each year. The Committee will consider KCOM’s share price progression and dividend policy as part of this review. TSR measures the total shareholder return from share price movements and dividends over a period of time. In 2015/16 there were also fees of £16,000 paid to Martin Towers who retired from the Board on 31 July 2015. Any vested shares, after tax, will then be subject to a two year holding period following vesting. Bill Halbert was a Non-Executive Director from the date of his Board appointment until 25 November 2008, when he became Executive Deputy Chairman. These were discussed at length and a draft revised Remuneration policy was agreed, to form the basis of consultation with our largest shareholders.
