network services we provide connectivity-based services to national organisations. our strategy is designed to offer shareholders a combination of income generation and value accretion. jane previously held a number of executive level positions, including her most recent role as chief financial officer and chief operating officer for phoenix it group plc until its acquisition by and merger with daisy group. jane will stand for election by shareholders at the annual general meeting in july. we continue to monitor against our set of board objectives which are detailed further in the corporate governance section. new business has been signed with clients across a range of sectors, including hastings direct (insurance), c hoare & co (financial services) and dugout (entertainment). this segment seeks to maximise the value of our historical investment in national network platforms and, while we expect overall revenues to decline in this segment as a number of legacy contracts come to an end, there are some areas of this market in which we can compete without the need for substantial investment. primarily this is in the provision of multi-site wide area networks and other associated services. existing customers for such services include rnli, one stop, furniture village and domino’s. we remain focused on creating a simplified business, with a cost base better aligned to the growth opportunities in our core markets, that the board believes will generate long-term sustainable returns and growth for shareholders. our strategy in this market represents a strong growth opportunity by creating an asset- light, margin-rich revenue stream. for employees 73 latest employee engagement score (october 16) see also see also 12 | kcom group plc

have seen year-on-year revenue growth, through growing relationships with key customers such as hmrc and nfu mutual. in september 2016, we agreed a new five year £180.0 million revolving credit facility, on the same terms as our existing arrangements. customers people driving operational excellence our value creation is underpinned by four strategic pillars 21 kcom group plc annual report

effect on the business. 26 | kcom group plc annual report and accounts 2016/17 strategic report managing risk in our business continued risks reported in the prior year key: customers people partners processes and systems substitute technologies entering the consumer market why is it important? we are focusing more on new technologies and applications; therefore the mitigation of this risk is very much aligned with our strategy. growing revenue in our enterprise segment to offset the decline of network-based revenues why is it important? we are continuing with our investment plan to mitigate the risk of service failure from obsolete equipment. change in level of risk our aim is to provide exceptional service wherever we can. any lessons learnt from such tests are fed back into the resilience planning process, which in turn is continually reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis. 2 to promote our values, both internally and in the way we do business with external stakeholders. we have also continued our patronage of the prince’s trust, the uk’s leading youth charity, which aims to change lives by offering training, personal development, business start-up support, mentoring and advice to young people. we continue to be an active member of local business organisations including humber bondholders, which promotes the region as a destination for inward investment; for entrepreneurs only, a community interest company that helps local entrepreneurs create jobs and wealth; and c4di (centre for digital innovation), a technology hub that is helping to drive the development of the digital economy locally. > we have introduced a new hr advisory service to provide support for people managers and help them develop their skills in handling employee relations issues. having brought together all our people within a single, integrated business, we have introduced regular events where they are encouraged to explore our shared ways of working and collaborate with colleagues from other business areas. the retired driving instructor took his first steps on social media at one of kcom’s monthly internet drop-in sessions. “these sessions are a godsend really, without them i wouldn’t have much use for my ipad. it’s a lifeline.” sustainable relationships with customers and suppliers are vital to our success. > as part of our efforts to improve digital inclusion we introduced regular online skills sessions at more hull and east yorkshire locations. during the year we rationalised our supplier base to achieve economies of scale wherever possible and worked with individual suppliers to identify ways in which we can reduce their costs by introducing efficiencies such as streamlining ordering and delivery processes. we have reduced our energy usage for lighting by up to 40 per cent in these areas. air conditioning we have installed inverter-driven and variable speed drive air conditioning in technical buildings (exchanges, switch sites and hosting facilities) where it can have the greatest impact in addition to reducing the volume of cooling required. where we have done this it has achieved reductions in energy usage for air conditioning by up to 77 per cent. other roles bill holds directorships at excelsys ltd, jade solutions limited and tacit connexions ltd. appointed graham joined the board as a non-executive director

needs are discussed as part of individual performance evaluations, plus each director is given the opportunity to flag any additional training requirements which they may have identified as part of the annual board evaluation process. the chairman ensures that an investor relations report setting out any feedback from shareholders is provided to the board each month and discussed at each board meeting, so that all of our directors are kept informed of investor views. in addition, feedback from shareholder meetings is a standing agenda item for the board at each meeting. 42 | kcom group plc annual report and accounts 2016/17 directors’ report we have a risk management framework in place to help us to identify, assess, measure, manage and monitor our key risks in a consistent way. we

also gave an overview of ifrs 15 and the work on this to date by kcom. management judgement around when one-off items should be treated as exceptional was therefore an area for review. these usually involve some judgement in relation to the timing of revenue and cost recognition on such contracts. there is also a quarterly video broadcast covering latest stories from across the business. rights and obligations attaching to shares in a general meeting of the company voting is as follows: > on a show of hands, every member present in person shall have one vote; > on a show of hands, every proxy present who has been duly appointed by one or more members shall have one vote; and > on a poll, every member who is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which he or she is the holder. 51 kcom group plc annual report and accounts 2016/17 | directors’ report having concluded that the structure of our current policy is effective and remains aligned with our strategy, we are proposing just four minor changes to enhance it further: > ltip post-vesting holding period – we are introducing a two year post-vesting holding period for ltip awards made from the year ended 31 march 2018 onwards to align executive director and shareholder interests over a five year period from the date of grant of an ltip award. it became apparent to us during the recruitment process for our new chief financial officer this year that the standard notice periods offered by other firms were set at 12 months and that therefore only being able to offer a six month notice period placed kcom out of line with general market practice. we value feedback from our shareholders extremely highly and are always willing to hear your thoughts or arrange a meeting if there is anything that you would like more information on or would like to discuss further. details of the final vesting result will be included in our remuneration report next year. any existing remuneration commitments or contractual arrangements agreed prior to the approval and implementation of this policy report will be honoured in accordance with their original terms. her base salary on appointment was set at £290,000, which is slightly higher than that paid to her predecessor, paul simpson, which is reflective of the considerable experience that jane brings to the role. the committee does not consult directly with employees when drawing up the directors’ remuneration policy; however, we encourage our people to give us feedback, including in relation to remuneration, through mechanisms such as our change network. clawback provisions may be invoked for material misstatement, errors in assessing performance conditions or gross misconduct. a holding period will apply to awards granted in the year ending 31 march 2018 and onwards. awards will typically vest after no less than three years, subject to the achievement of pre-set performance criteria and continued employment. clawback and withholding provisions may be invoked for material misstatement, errors in assessing performance conditions or gross misconduct. this will require executive directors to hold any shares vesting from future awards under the ltip, after tax, for a period of two years. clawback provisions may be invoked for material misstatement, errors in assessing performance conditions or gross misconduct. a holding period will apply to awards granted in the year ending 31 march 2018 and onwards. awards will typically vest after no less than three years, subject to the achievement of pre-set performance criteria and continued employment. clawback and withholding provisions may be invoked for material misstatement, errors in assessing performance conditions or gross misconduct. this will require executive directors to hold any shares vesting from future awards under the ltip, after tax, for a period of two years. there is a range of flexible benefits open to all employees, and the executive directors, that can be purchased each year. executive directors receive a slightly higher maximum pension contribution than other employees, at 20 per cent of base salary. long-term incentives on an ongoing basis awards will be made in line with the policy for other directors. service contracts it was previously the policy to set notice periods for executive directors at six months for either party; however, it became apparent to us during the year that this put kcom out of line with general market practice. the committee is clear that there will be a consistent approach to exit payments and no reward for poor performance. however, we have discretion to make a lump sum payment on termination in lieu of notice. payment may also be made in respect of accrued benefits, including untaken holiday entitlement. policy on outside appointments we believe that where board members hold directorships in other companies, kcom can benefit from their experience. retirement benefits bill halbert has elected not to be a member of the kcom pension scheme and, accordingly, we made no contributions on his behalf. any significant movement in ebitda has always led to a corresponding movement in our share price and therefore it is extremely important for our investors that the executive directors are incentivised to achieve an ebitda above market expectations each year. the committee will consider kcom’s share price progression and dividend policy as part of this review. tsr measures the total shareholder return from share price movements and dividends over a period of time. any vested shares, after tax, will then be subject to a two year holding period following vesting. relative spend on pay the table below sets out the relative spend on pay for kcom as a whole in comparison to distributions to shareholders: year ended 31 march 2017 £’000 year ended 31 march 2016 £’000 percentage change total remuneration cost for all employees 1 85,300 88,135 -3.22% dividend payments to shareholders 30,686 28,672 7.02% 1. the total remuneration cost for all employees is taken from note 8 to the financial statements on page 96 and includes wages and salaries, social security costs, other pension costs and share scheme costs. > a draft of the ltip awards to be made in july 2016 was reviewed and discussed. these were discussed at length and a draft revised remuneration policy was agreed, to form the basis of consultation with our largest shareholders. further information was sought on this prior to making a decision at the next committee meeting. however, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the group’s and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 79 kcom group plc annual report and

years presented, unless otherwise stated. ifrs 15 in may 2014, ifrs 15 ‘revenue from contracts with customers’ was issued for periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018. this new standard will be applicable to the group for the year ended 31 march 2019. adoption of ifrs 15 can be applied on a full retrospective basis (by restating comparative periods) or as an adjustment to equity at the date of adoption (which is our intended approach). within our enterprise business we expect the impact of ifrs 15 to be less significant. revenue related to equipment is accounted for based on the point of effective transfer of risks and rewards (shipment); and > in-life service – revenue for this phase is recognised in line with the obligation to provide service as dictated by customer contracts. subsequent recoveries of amounts written off are credited against operating expenses in the income statement. bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet, unless a right of offset exists. deferred tax liabilities are recognised generally for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. in accordance with its treasury policy, the group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. any gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement. employee share options and long-term incentive schemes are generally subject to performance or service conditions. revenue relating to the ‘installation’ phase is accounted for on a stage of completion basis. smb national communication services to our medium-

pence and a weighted average remaining contractual life of nil years (the directors have assumed all shares will vest at the earliest available date). as in previous years, kcom’s cgus are based on customer type and geographic service location. the cash flow forecasts assume revenue and profit growth in line with our strategic priorities. where appropriate, further sensitivity analysis has been performed by changing the base case assumptions applicable to each cgu. the individually impaired receivables mainly relate to customers who are in unexpectedly difficult economic situations. it was assessed that a portion of the impaired balance is expected to be recovered. 21 bank loans consolidated 2017 2016 £’000 £’000 bank borrowings amount falling due: – between two and five years 50,000 —
