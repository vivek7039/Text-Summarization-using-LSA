Read more page 14 A Strong Balance Sheet In adhering to strict capital discipline throughout the business Chariot retains a strong balance sheet with two fully funded wells in 2018, cash exceeding its commitments and no debt. This is further supported by our external advisors with whom we retain strong relationships and regular reviews. It is with this continued focus on the de-risking strategy, governed by a diligent team, supportive partners and an effective Board that we hope to achieve our goal of discovering material accumulations of hydrocarbons. In maintaining capital discipline at the centre of our business we are able to apply our strategy from a position of fiscal strength and have the optionality to invest in opportunities as they arise. Managing Risks We carry out in-depth technical reviews in accordance with our financial position and portfolio direction at quarterly meetings, and our committees meet regularly to support the delivery of best practice corporate standards in everything we do. As a result this investment gives us more fire power in our decision making and commercial strength in negotiations, particularly with regard to capitalising on historically low rig rates and ongoing partnering discussions. We carry out in-depth technical reviews in accordance with our financial position and portfolio direction at quarterly meetings, and our committees meet regularly to support the delivery of best practice corporate standards in everything we do. This is further supported by our external advisors with whom we retain strong relationships and regular reviews. Management believes that this preparatory work will avoid unnecessary delays associated with its plans to drill, strengthen its position in partnering negotiations and ensure it capitalises on the current low-cost oil services environment. With a recently stabilised oil price and the reduced cost price environment encouraging more seismic activity, we see signs of a return to exploration from the industry, and with increasing demand for these services, will come increasing prices. Management believes that this preparatory work will avoid unnecessary delays, strengthen its position in partnering negotiations and ensure it capitalises on the current low-cost oil services environment. ” STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 13 Chariot Oil & Gas Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 As well as looking to add prospectivity, the team also consistently streamlines the portfolio to identify those parts that, despite being giant in their potential, may present higher risks. In March 2018 this balance sheet was further bolstered by an equity raise of US$16.5 million net, allowing funding for the drilling of Prospect S in Namibia and acting as a potential catalyst for future partnering discussions. The tax expense of less than US$0.1 million in the year to 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: US$0.2 million) relates to Brazilian taxation levied on interest income with its decrease consistent with lower Brazilian interest income received in 2017. In March 2018 this balance sheet was further bolstered by an equity raise of US$16.5 million net, allowing funding for the drilling of Prospect S in Namibia and acting as a potential catalyst for future partnering discussions. This work has led to the inclusion of five new structural prospects in Namibia and a diverse portfolio of stratigraphic and structural closures in Brazil as confirmed by a recently completed CPR. Partnering processes have also been initiated across the remainder of its acreage on priority drilling targets. Namibia: Ocean Rig Poseidon drill ship contracted for one firm and one optional well with Prospect S (459mmbbls gross mean prospective resources) anticipated to spud Q4 2018 Morocco: Drilling preparations underway for Kenitra-1 and LKP-1a priority targets with updated partnering process anticipated to commence in mid-2018, incorporating the well results of Rabat Deep 1 Brazil: Integrated seismic interpretation and CPR completed.

As a result Chariot holds first-mover advantage with its in-depth knowledge of the Namibian geology and a significant acreage position totalling approximately 16,800km² within the Walvis Basin, adjacent to third-party wells which have proven mature source rock and excellent quality reservoirs.

This portfolio consists of seven prospective reservoir targets in a range of trapping configurations from purely structural and combination traps, associated to a 200km2 4-way dip-closed structure which sits principally over Block 314, to stratigraphic traps. The on-licence gross mean prospective resource of individual targets range up to 366mmbbls, and a single vertical well located at Prospect 1 can penetrate the TP-1, TP-3 and KP-3 stacked targets which have a summed on-licence gross mean prospective resource of 911mmbbls. The Group closely monitors its cash position and each month produces updated cash flow forecasts to help it determine whether it has sufficient financial resources to fund its short and medium term operations. The Group has so far been successful with this strategy by introducing strong industry partners to its licences, including Woodside and Eni. Given this, the Group works closely with the relevant ministries to ensure that all relevant Environmental Impact Studies are undertaken in advance of any proposed seismic or other offshore operations that are undertaken and that best in class industry environmental standards and practices are adopted by the Group in all of its operations. The Group is currently engaging with third party contractors for readiness planning and potential execution concerning i) any potential pollution incident and ii) emergency response planning related to the Group’s upcoming drilling programme. It is our policy to make every effort to provide a working environment free from bullying, harassment, intimidation and discrimination on the basis of disability, nationality, race, sex, sexual orientation, religion or belief. Procedures are in place to ensure that any form of bribery or improper behaviour is prevented from being conducted on Chariot’s behalf by joint venture partners, contractors and suppliers. In pursuit of these objectives, Chariot will use recognised standards and models as benchmarks for its management systems. Prior to any seismic acquisition programmes and in preparation for the drilling of any exploratory wells, Chariot will employ environmental consultants to carry out area specific Environmental Impact Assessments (“EIAs”) which are approved by the relevant ministries. These observers compile marine mammal and bird count statistics which will assist in the preparation of future EIAs. He has typically served as the operational catalyst for integrating technical management, financing and commercial alignment in bringing successful projects to first production. Prior to being promoted in May 2015 Julian was Chariot’s Group Financial Controller for three years. After graduating with an MSc from Imperial College he joined Perenco where he held a wide variety of technical and management positions focused largely on the African Atlantic margin and Andean foreland basins prior to becoming Country Manager in Brazil. He also oversees the new venture exploration activity, which has so far successfully integrated Brazilian and additional Moroccan acreage.

Potentially dilutive share awards are detailed in note 20, however these do not have any dilutive impact as the Group reported a loss for the year, consequently a separate diluted loss per share has not been presented. The Group does not undertake any form of speculation on long term interest rates or currency movements, therefore it manages market risk by maintaining a short term investment horizon and placing funds on deposit to optimise short term yields where possible but, moreover, to ensure that it always has sufficient cash resources to meet payables and other working capital requirements when necessary. This process enables the Group to optimise the yield on its cash resources whilst ensuring that it always has sufficient liquidity to meet payables and other working capital requirements when these become due. Standalone share awards are one-off awards to Non-Executive Directors which will vest in equal instalments over a three year period and will lapse if not exercised within a fixed period on stepping down from the Board. The well, which did not encounter a hydrocarbon accumulation, was subsequently plugged and abandoned. 50 Chariot Oil & Gas Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 ADVISORS Registered Office PO Box 282 Regency Court Glategny Esplanade St Peter Port Guernsey GY1 1WW Channel Islands Registration Number 47532 Nominated Advisor & Joint Broker finnCap Limited 60 New Broad Street London EC2M 1JJ United Kingdom Bankers Barclays Bank Plc.
