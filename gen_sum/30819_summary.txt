impact the business. the group does not rely on one single system or platform, rather having individual systems for specific purposes. should cases not be progressed in line with the group’s expectations or perform in a way that wasn’t predicted, it could lead to significant impact on the quantum and timing of revenue recognition and cash conversion thereby having a material impact on group performance. the group continues to provide its customers with high quality business that ensures they maximise their financial performance. any significant deviations from plan are investigated and improvement plans implemented in line with contractual service level agreements (slas). if the performance of these acquisitions falls below expectation, there is a risk that these assets may become impaired and require a writedown in value which could negatively impact financial performance of the group and its ability to pay future dividends to its shareholders. bringing leaders together

acquisitions, fair values remain provisional in the first year and will be finalised within 12 months of acquisition. service and non-market performance conditions attached to the arrangements were not taken into account in measuring fair value. as mentioned in the strategic report increasing cost pressures on solicitiors mean they often do not settle these balances until interim funds are available or a case has settled. this analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant and considers the effect of financial instruments with variable interest rates. the fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. service and non-market performance conditions attached to the arrangements were not taken into account in measuring fair value. 2017 £000 2016 £000
