Key milestones since flotation Jul 2015 Acquired Best Value Conveyancing Cementing our position in   the residential property market. Jul 2017 – Established Your Law LLP,   our first ABS with NewLaw Solicitors Getting closer to the claim, delivering  improved consumer experience. Personal Injury The PI market has been broadly static in recent years at just  under one million claims per annum. Our three divisions focus on the Personal Injury (PI), Critical  Care ((CC), incorporating medical reporting/rehabilitation) and  Residential Property (RP) markets within CLS. 5 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Governance Strategic report 0 160 320 480 640 800 Clinical Negligence      Employer      Motor      Public     Other 2016/17 2015/16 Liability not known      73,355 86,495 20,047 11,388 85,504 92,709 1,692 2,046 17,894 17,895 780,324 770,791 Total  2016/17 978,816 Critical Care Despite being a relatively small market, in comparison to the others in  which we operate, 2017 has, nevertheless, seen some interesting  developments. Bush has  successfully adapted to compete effectively in such initiatives,  securing insurer contracts that help us grow joint instructions. As an example Bush has been working with  the Child Brain Injury T rust (CBIT) on a new commercial alliance  which we anticipate will contribute to 2018 growth.

To this end, we are  proud that our Values can be so evidently shown in action: Curious  We have been aware that the PI industry has been in need   of a new approach for some time, with a view to improving the  consumer experience. Being Curious about how we could be at  the forefront of this, NAH created its own ABSs.

In these circumstances, they need the help  that NAH can give to make it right again. Trustpilot score 9.2 NAH received an overall  Trustpilot score of 9.2  out of 10 during 2017* (*Source: Brand Trustpilot  2017) “After speaking with the lady, she  was really nice and she was very  sympathetic.”  - Teusday 11 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Governance Strategic report Increasing market share  These plans include NAH’s medium-term strategy  to grow its share of the personal injury market,  whilst continuing to provide high quality marketing  services to its PLFs. As with Your Law, the claims being processed via  National Law Partners don’t constrain the supply of  enquiries to our PLFs and we remain committed to  operating a UK-wide panel of solicitors providing  both full geographical coverage and market leading  expertise. We have  made a large upfront investment into these new  ventures and the returns will not be seen until future  years. These activities have  enabled us to partially defray market impacts in  what has been,overall, a challenging year. We performed as expected, with 2017  revenue ahead at £51.9m (2016: £50.6m), primarily  due to a 5.5% increase in PI revenues. Steve Halbert Chairman 19 March 2018 18 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Embracing change, innovating for the future,  evolving our business. However,  despite this, we have continued to grow market  share and developed a solid pipeline of contract  wins. Our credibility as brand leader has been  further enhanced by winning Lawyer Monthly  magazine Rehabilitation Provider of the Year. The Group’s RP business faced further market  headwinds during 2017 with Land Registry figures  indicating a decline in annual volume of 25% 2 . However, our focus on website conversion, margin  management and cost control enabled us to report  profits for this division in line with those of 2016 - a  robust performance. Critical Care focuses exclusively on the catastrophic  injury market, where we provide expert witness and  case management services. We believe that the  platform will also enable us to transition into  processing small claims on an efficient and  cost-effective basis. Increased investment means a continuing  deferment of profit and cash flow that is realised in  future years as cases settle. Critical Care, operating under the Bush brand, has  always had an enviable reputation for clinical  excellence. In RP we have continued to evolve our portfolio of  brands as they focus on a localised organic search  approach. Particularly satisfying has been the  development of larger more strategic relationships  with key insurers and law firms. These joint operations  with two of our PLFs will deliver profit as their cases  begin to settle. Our CC division  experienced 6.6% growth in revenue to £11.0m  (2016: £10.4m) and the future outlook for this  business is encouraging. This amount is payable to  Allianz for previously received commissions when  certain policies either fail or are abandoned.

Once the risks have been assessed appropriate mitigation actions are determined for each key risk identified. The Group engages external advisors to help protect its  corporate profile and advise on public relations. A major IT or system failure could interrupt our ability to  provide those services and impact the business. The Group does not rely on one single system or platform,  rather having individual systems for specific purposes. The Group is planning for an increasing proportion of claims generated  by NAH to be processed via these ABSs and this will require increased  investment in working capital as the cases may take a number of years  to settle. Should cases not be progressed in line with the Group’s expectations or  perform in a way that wasn’t predicted, it could lead to significant impact  on the quantum and timing of revenue recognition and cash conversion  thereby having a material impact on Group performance. The Group continues to provide its customers with high quality  business that ensures they maximise their financial  performance. Any significant deviations from plan are investigated and  improvement plans implemented in line with contractual  Service Level Agreements (SLAs). If the performance of these acquisitions falls below expectation,  there is a risk that these assets may become impaired and require a  writedown in value which could negatively impact financial performance  of the Group and its ability to pay future dividends to its shareholders. Bringing leaders together Following on from some key leadership appointments made in 2016,  2017 was a time of stability and cohesion. NAHL Group plc staff engagement rate 60%   Compared to Gallup  survey’s UK engaged staff  rate of 8% 80% of staff across the Group would  recommend their company as a great  place to work 29 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Governance Strategic report Investing in our future leaders – succession planning Identifying, developing and retaining our future leaders is vital if the  business is to ensure strong succession planning. In 2017, NAH went into partnership with Warwickshire and  Northamptonshire Air Ambulance to raise funds for this vital  service. During December,  colleagues from our newly formed National Law Partners  themed their office as a traditional German Market selling festive  food and drink. The staff have raised over £3,300 altogether,  which will be matched by NAH for this most important cause. Critical Care Staff at Bush have always been keen to raise money and 2017  was no different. The team threw themselves into their fundraising with  themed lunches including Super Soup Mondays and Mexican Day. The event has already raised enough money to buy two  incubators for premature and ill babies. Steve is currently Chairman of Alcumus  Holdings Limited and Safestyle UK plc, an  AIM quoted company. His senior leadership career in the legal  sector includes Managing Partner of  DMH Stallard LLP where he led its  transformation into an award winning and  highly respected mid-market law firm. • Annual bonus awards for 2018 will be  based on operating profit and  individual objectives which are aligned  to the Group’s strategy. • In line with best practice, clawback  provisions have been included within  the annual bonus and LTIP . • A Policy on the Committee’s approach to payments for loss of office has been introduced. All Non-Executive Directors have initial fixed-term agreements with the Company of no more than three years. Unvested awards will normally lapse on cessation of  employment, other than when the individual is considered to be a ‘good leaver’. Revenue, other than pre- and post-LASPO ATE income, is not considered to be a key judgement or estimate. Subsequent to initial recognition,  interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. The fair value of options granted is  recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. Included in the balance sheet is a liability  that has been separately identified due to its material value. For all acquisitions, fair values remain provisional in the first year and will be finalised within 12 months of acquisition. Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the arrangements were not taken into account in measuring fair value. As mentioned in the Strategic Report increasing cost pressures on solicitiors  mean they often do not settle these balances until interim funds are available or a case has settled. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant and considers the effect of financial instruments with variable  interest rates. The fair value of options granted is  recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any  indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. At 31 December 2017 the value of the investment in Consumer Champion Group Limited, its only directly owned subsidiary, was  as follows: Valuation  Total £000 At 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2017 52,700 Impairment has been assessed on a fair value less costs to sell basis.
