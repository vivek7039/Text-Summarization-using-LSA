strategic report increasing market share these plans include nah’s medium-term strategy to grow its share of the personal injury market, whilst continuing to provide high quality marketing services to its plfs. as with your law, the claims being processed via national law partners don’t constrain the supply of enquiries to our plfs and we remain committed to operating a uk-wide panel of solicitors providing both full geographical coverage and market leading expertise. we have made a large upfront investment into these new ventures and the returns will not be seen until future years. these activities have enabled us to partially defray market impacts in what has been,overall, a challenging year. we performed as expected, with 2017 revenue ahead at £51.9m (2016: £50.6m), primarily due to a 5.5% increase in pi revenues. the division has recently secured a number of strategic business development opportunities that we expect to contribute to growth in h2 2018. divisional review –

pi, revenue is generated within nah from plfs paying for marketing and triage services resulting in the supply of qualified enquiries. once the risks have been assessed appropriate mitigation actions are determined for each key risk identified. the group engages external advisors to help protect its corporate profile and advise on public relations. a major it or system failure could interrupt our ability to provide those services and impact the business. the group does not rely on one single system or platform, rather having individual systems for specific purposes. the group is planning for an increasing proportion of claims generated by nah to be processed via these abss and this will require increased investment in working capital as the cases may take a number of years to settle. should cases not be progressed in line with the group’s expectations or perform in a way that wasn’t predicted, it could lead to significant impact on the quantum and timing of revenue recognition and cash conversion thereby having a material impact on group performance. the group continues to provide its customers with high quality business that ensures they maximise their financial performance. any significant deviations from plan are investigated and improvement plans implemented in line with contractual service level agreements (slas). if the performance of these acquisitions falls below expectation, there is a risk that these assets may become impaired and require a writedown in value which could negatively impact financial performance of the group and its ability to pay future dividends to its shareholders. this strategic report was approved by the board on 19 march 2018 and signed on its behalf by: steve halbert chairman 19 march 2018 28 nahl group plc annual report and

strong succession planning. in 2017, nah went into partnership with warwickshire and northamptonshire air ambulance to raise funds for this vital service. during december, colleagues from our newly formed national law partners themed their office as a traditional german market selling festive food and drink. the staff have raised over £3,300 altogether, which will be matched by nah for this most important cause. critical care staff at bush have always been keen to raise money and 2017 was no different. the team threw themselves into their fundraising with themed lunches including super soup
