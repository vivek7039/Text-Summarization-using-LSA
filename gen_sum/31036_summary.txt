lessons learnt from this affair will be applied throughout spire healthcare. board developments in october, we were delighted to secure the services of justin ash as chief executive officer (‘ceo’). it is by working together closely and making a positive contribution to the business that they drive our strong culture. i am determined that spire healthcare will be famous for delivering the very best in quality and clinical care. i have found that spire provides outstanding care to thousands of patients across britain every day. pmi is currently about half of our business, but it remains largely a benefit provided by companies for their employees. major contracts with nhs trusts are unlikely to grow in the future, while e-referral is still not fully adopted. whatever their motivation, the macro market drivers suggest that self-pay will be our key growth sector. i am pleased to say that spire manchester and st anthony’s hospitals are making good progress. both should be profitable in 2018. spire nottingham hospital will take further work to achieve its full potential. operationally, we will have one best way of working in increasing areas, aligning all our hospitals around simple, national systems and operating approach – one ‘spire way’ of working – while leaving room for local best practice and strong leadership by our hospitals’ senior management teams. all this aims to support a steadily improving return on the recent substantial capital investment in spire healthcare. success is also linked directly to leadership, particularly at the key hospital director and matron levels. “each hospital that was rated requires improvement will undergo a clinical review as a priority in the first quarter of 2018. over the next two years we will be focused on helping our hospitals to become outstanding across all aspects of our care.” spire bristol hospital received its cqc report in april 2017, rating it good or outstanding across all domains, and good overall. at spire healthcare we’re a team – the centre supports us to deliver outstanding care in each of our hospitals. we were one of the first private hospital’s in the country to have a critical care outreach

urological surgeon at spire norwich hospital, has seen his relatively new private practice transformed over the last year by our investment in a holmium laser, enabling holep laser prostatectomy for benign prostate enlargement. mark commented: “i was having to fit some of my private patients in around the edges of my work at our nhs hospital, but now that spire norwich hospital has the equipment, we can offer patients all the clinical benefits of a shorter hospital stay and post-operative catheterisation time, with excellent outcomes – at a time and place that’s best for them. together, we have used advertising, gp evening talks and word of mouth to promote our services. and looking ahead, after this year’s work review, we’re planning to introduce 10-minute free consultations for women with any cosmetic breast concerns, together with more editorial in spire leicester hospital’s newsletter and a series of gp talks on aftercare for breast patients.” david macdonald’s (based at spire

our usage of electricity and natural gas. key projects this year included investment in areas such as lighting, mechanical ventilation, building controls, heating and domestic hot water services. these projects are having a positive impact on relevant energy performance certificates (‘epcs’) for our buildings. high efficiency lighting – after the success of our lighting replacement projects previously reported, we have invested heavily in this area in 2017 to reduce our carbon footprint and also benefit from the much improved light quality that this technology brings. for purposes of baselining and ongoing comparison, it is required to express the ghg emissions using a carbon intensity metric. this is a core component of driving quality improvement across the group in order to provide outstanding services. this software has been implemented across the group and is now populated by risk registers for all hospitals. additionally, the risk management process moved its formal reporting line from legal to internal audit in q4. the group takes all instances of incidents (including near misses), complaints, control failures, regulatory non-compliance or other risk events very seriously. a three- year period was selected as it corresponds with the board’s strategic planning horizon. these scenarios may be summarised as follows: • spire healthcare is unable to access sufficient numbers of appropriately qualified clinical staff, restricting growth, driving up clinical staff costs and constraining the capacity of new hospital developments (this links with availability of key medical staff); • a key hospital is subject to temporary suspension of trade, with a permanent adverse impact on revenues, for example, due to failure to meet care quality commission (‘cqc’) regulatory standards (this links with compliance with laws, regulations and other applicable requirements); • the group is subject to temporary suspension of trade, with a temporary adverse impact on revenue, for example, as a result of a successful cyber attack on key business systems (this links with cyber security); • the downside modelling of a number of risks which result in a decline in earnings, including lower nhs tariffs or referral rates or a general economic downturn (this links with macroeconomic conditions and government policy); and • the business is subject to significant uninsured losses arising from medical malpractice, negligence or similar claims (this links with insurance). further consolidation of the pmi market could adversely impact spire healthcare’s relative bargaining power in any ongoing commercial arrangements. the board manages this risk by regularly reviewing market conditions and economic indicators to assess whether actions are required. business processes are also kept under review and user education regularly carried out to minimise the possibility of ransomware incidents. with any major project there are risks, such as major cost overrun or substantial delay in delivery, or disruption to business activities during capital builds which could impact upon the expected returns, the group’s planned profit growth and future cash flow. during his time at virgin active, the business grew from break-even to £150 million ebitda, operating in five countries. peter was also a director of prs for music limited between

addition the external auditors undertook sample-based substantive testing on private revenues, checking invoices back to procedure and price list information across a number of contracts. as this process involves some degree of estimation there is a risk that properties are held in the financial statements at inappropriate carrying values. our internal audit team will be fully resourced during q1 and will start undertaking regular audits in each of our hospitals on a risk rotational basis and following up on agreed improvements to ensure they are effectively implemented as well as completing a number of key corporate audits around governance. she has been working closely with our group medical director, dr jean-jacques de gorter, driving forward a programme of continuous development and ever improving clinical quality. while much has been accomplished during 2017, our group medical director recently launched ‘project outstanding’ which will introduce a programme of clinical and non-clinical workstreams to ensure that outstanding quality is delivered in everything we do within every hospital and clinic across our network. when holding our committee meetings at hospitals, we extend the visit in order to engage with hospital directors, their senior management teams and front line staff. our clinical assurance methodology follows that of the care quality commission (‘cqc’) domains – safe, effective, responsive, caring, and well-led. there were also many examples of hospitals rated ‘outstanding’ and ‘good’ for individual domains across our group. health care, in all its guises, and however technically advanced it may become, will always be an intensely personal activity. i thank all our staff for their dedication to delivering the highest

• for pmi revenue, we have tested a representative sample and agreed prices from sap billings (revenue) to insurer contracts, price lists, or other supporting correspondence as applicable. based on our audit procedures performed, we concluded that revenue for the year is appropriately recognised and free from material misstatement. we understand that the high volume of system generated and low value revenue transactions, results in limited opportunity for management to fraudulently misstate revenue at a transactional level, (other than through manipulation of changes to the pricing master file as considered on page 102). the high volume of costs being capitalised over all property, plant and equipment categories means that it is harder for management to detect material inappropriate items. our audit procedures found no material instances of expenditure which had been inappropriately capitalised to property, plant and equipment. based on our audit procedures performed, we concluded that costs have been appropriately capitalised to property, plant, and equipment. other items include compliance set-up costs and deferred tax adjustments in relation to revised property carrying values. on initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. subsequently, such assets are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate (‘eir’) method, less any allowance for impairment. subsequent measurement after initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. 117 spire healthcare group plc annual report 2017 governance strategic report financial statements other information notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2017 continued 118 2. accounting policies continued interest-bearing borrowings interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost on an effective interest basis. any such insurance recoveries are recognised in other receivables when the receipt of them is judged sufficiently probable. these services are typically provided over a short time frame, that is, one to three days. out-patient cases generally do not involve surgical procedures and revenue is recognised on an individual component basis when performance obligations are satisfied. at 31 december 2017, the group’s future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases amounted to £1,587.6 million, on an undiscounted basis. these variables are interdependent and the forecast cash flows reflect management’s expectations based on current market trends. revenue growth is projected to be in line with past experience averaging 4.3% for the five-year period (2016: 4.1%). cost assumptions are consistent with the group’s historical track record, after taking account of headline inflation at 3.0% (2016: 1.0%). for example, an increase of 3.0% in the pre-tax discount rate to 12.0%, with all other assumptions held constant, did not identify any impairments.

annually in line with rpi, upwards only and subject to a cap of 5.0%. the group has rights within its contracts to terminate at short notice and, therefore, cancellation payments are minimal. this affects future cash flows from money market investments and the cost of floating rate borrowings. 142 spire healthcare group plc annual report 2017 company balance sheet as at 31 december 2017
