Officer 14 March 2018 15 Strategic report Our people A compelling culture for a global community We are on a journey to establish a culture that  brings out the best from everyone and are making  a significant investment in our colleagues because  we believe that to grow our business we must grow  our people   We have fundamentally reshaped the organisation  to ensure we have the right people in the right place  in the right roles, harnessing local knowledge of  local markets to explore the many opportunities  that exist to reach our ambitions  We have  established a new operating model with our  Country CEOs that focuses on what our customers  in countries need to drive growth   Our Country CEOs are critical to our success  We  have invested in them and provided coaching in the  psychology of cultural transformation to enable  them to build a consistent CPP culture across our  countries  This is all about role modelling authentic  leadership and creating the conditions for our  people to grow, which includes going out of our way  to be open, honest and empowering because we feel  this generates trust, belief and confidence in our  people to deliver our plans  Promoting flexible working and addressing any  gaps in gender-related pay are becoming  increasingly important to us because we want to  create a fair culture that is socially responsible  We  have evolved working practices to promote flexible  working that suits lifestyles regardless of gender,  level and role  We will continue to focus on this  during 2018 because we believe it is the right  thing to attract talent, enable existing talent to  achieve their potential and ensure that colleagues  are fairly rewarded for the work they do, regardless  of their gender  A full gender pay gap report will be  published on our website in April 2018   We continue to invest in our colleagues with  team-based coaching and a leadership development  plan, which augments our Accelerant programme  which is in its third year   This programme is about developing our change  agents to accelerate business performance and  cultural transformation  Our Accelerants are high  impact, high performing professionals from within  the business who choose to opt-in and work  together with sponsors and coaches to deliver  significant change aligned to our ambitions   Following the introduction of this programme in  2016, we now have a strong alumni of graduated  Accelerants that will join forces during 2018 to  continue their role of delivering change and  success to drive growth  Just as our business is evolving, we have also  evolved our co-created Values to ensure they  reflect behaviours that will drive success  Our  people told us they want a culture where we value  five things – curiosity, working together, being  brave, keeping things simple and when someone  says they’ll do something you can ‘consider it  done’  How our people demonstrate these are  discussed in action-orientated great performance  conversations and we take pride in acknowledging  those who live our Values through meaningful  reward and recognition  The progress we have made on our transformation  journey is tangibly demonstrated through the  investment in our vibrant new work space that is  home to our International Support Centre  We  have created the right conditions for growth that  embraces the spirit of our culture through the use  of nature and design to provide an innovative,  collaborative and inspirational environment that  can be reflected in all of our countries to bring out  the best in our people   We believe this relentless focus on our people agenda  and cultural transformation has been a significant  factor in attracting and retaining colleagues who  are powering our successes   Our people continue to be the heart  of everything we do.

It is  estimated that almost 3 million  British companies were hit by  some sort of cyber-attack in the  last 12 months, with costs  totalling over £29 billion. This  means we can continue to protect customers in an  ever-growing online world, where they increasingly  manage their lives on the go.

It is anticipated that there will be a material impact on revenue recognition and  profit across the Group. For certain other of the Group’s assistance products, there are no introduction fees. Internally generated software is amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life of four to five years. Judgement is made over the levels of future costs likely to be  incurred in providing ongoing services. The Group is  satisfied with its position from both a legal and regulatory perspective. Deferred tax assets  are currently recognised under the assumption of forecast profits on a short-term assessment basis. Revenue from external customers and non-current assets (excluding deferred tax) by geographical location is detailed below:   External revenues Non-current assets 2017 £’000 2016 £’000 2017 £’000 2016 £’000 Continuing operations     UK 21,977 28,358 2,140 7,074 India 40,032 15,163 82 90 Spain 11,294 11,997 151 92 Other 18,132 18,131 566 196 Total continuing operations 91,435 73,649 2,939 7,452 Discontinued operations — 91 — —   91,435 73,740 2,939 7,452 Information about major customers Revenue from the customers of one business partner in the Group’s Asia Pacific segment represented approximately  £25,548,000 (2016: £5,515,000) of the Group’s total revenue.

An analysis of the  Group’s revenue from retail insurance only policies is set out in note 5. In  accordance with IAS 33, potential ordinary shares are only considered dilutive when their conversion would decrease the earnings  per share from continuing operations attributable to equity holders. The deferred shares have not been admitted to trading on AIM or any other Stock Exchange. Credit risk is reduced as insurance receivables are dispersed amongst a broad  customer base. There have been no overdue but unprovided debts in either the current or prior year. The Group’s trade receivables relate to retail customer payments awaiting collection and wholesale counterparties. Overall exposure continues to be mainly spread over a large number of customers but where concentration exists this is with  highly rated counterparties. All balances in the comparative period had been past due for less than 90 days. Solvency II  replaced these rules with effect from 1 January 2016 and does not require an equalisation reserve to be held. The agreement bore interest at a rate of 3.5% and was by secured  charges over assets in CPPL. The Group has made certain commercial and contractual decisions that are not yet agreed with all affected parties. The Group  is satisfied with its position from both a legal and regulatory perspective. Both  subsidiaries have complied with their respective imposed capital requirements throughout the current and prior year. As at 31 December 2017, HIL ’s ratio of eligible funds to meet its Solvency Capital Requirement was 203%. There is no significant difference between the fair value and carrying amount of any financial asset. There is no significant difference between the fair value and carrying amount of any financial liability, since liabilities are either  short term in nature or bear interest at variable rates. There has been no use  of interest rate derivatives in either the current or prior year. Financial instruments continued Interest rate sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to movements in LIBOR. The Group’s wholesale activities can result in material balances existing with a small number of counterparties and therefore  increased credit risk exists. Additional undrawn facilities that  the Group had at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk are included in note 26. Compliance with financial ratios and other covenant obligations of the Group’s bank loans is monitored on a monthly basis  by Executive Directors and by the Board of Directors at each Board meeting. Although settlement costs are not capped, they generally vary within a small range, limiting the  Group’s exposure. Following the Group’s transfer to AIM, no further awards can be made under these share plans. The acquisition also allows for a further earn-out based on future profits and product development which is  considered to represent remuneration rather than contingent consideration. Acquisition costs of £128,000 have been recognised as an administrative expense through the consolidated income statement. There were no amounts outstanding  on these loans at 31 December in either the current or prior years. The £5,000,000 facility commitment has been extended  for a term of three years and remains available. The only potential restriction on  current year cash is balances held for regulatory  purposes.
