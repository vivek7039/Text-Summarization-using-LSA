the case of certain contracts. it is anticipated that there will be a material impact on revenue recognition and profit across the group. internally generated software is amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life of four to five years. judgement is made over the levels of future costs likely to be incurred in providing ongoing services. deferred tax assets are currently

31 december — 20 amounts due from policyholders and intermediaries and amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent the total exposure to credit risk in respect of insurance activities. overall exposure continues to be mainly spread over a large number of customers but where concentration exists this is with highly rated counterparties. solvency ii replaced these rules with effect from 1 january 2016 and does not require an equalisation reserve to be held. the group has made certain commercial and contractual decisions that are not yet agreed with all affected parties. both subsidiaries have complied with their respective imposed capital requirements throughout the current and prior year. as at 31 december 2017, hil ’s ratio of eligible funds to meet its solvency capital requirement was 203%. there is no significant difference between the fair value and carrying amount of any financial asset. there is no significant difference between the fair value and carrying amount of any financial liability, since liabilities are either short term in nature or bear interest at variable rates. there has been no use of interest rate derivatives in either the current or prior year. the group’s wholesale activities can result in material balances existing with a small number of counterparties and therefore increased credit risk exists. although settlement costs are not capped, they generally vary within a small range, limiting the group’s exposure. following the group’s transfer to aim, no further awards can be made under these share plans. the acquisition also allows for a further earn-out based on future profits and product development which is considered to represent remuneration rather than contingent consideration. there were no amounts outstanding on these loans at 31 december in either the current or prior years. the £5,000,000 facility commitment has been extended for a term of three years and remains available. this document is printed on
