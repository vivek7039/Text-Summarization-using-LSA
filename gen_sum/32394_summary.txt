the acquisition of seven small companies brings great rewards but also significant integration efforts. despite early teething issues previously noted, i’m delighted to say that the business has now dealt with these and as we enter our fourth year, we fully expect the company to demonstrate its growth potential. dean dickinson joined the board as ceo on 31 october 2016, replacing ian smith who became executive deputy chairman. david payne chairman 17 july 2017 04 castleton technology plc annual report 2017 chief executive’s review each of the acquisitions has brought best in class software solutions or managed services capability. the group remains aligned along two divisions; software solutions and managed services, with each focusing on their separate yet complementary offerings. all key processes are available to be utilised on a mobile platform via apps or digital engagement. our managed services division offers a wide range of it infrastructure solutions which support an organisation’s business objectives, including helping to drive efficiencies, manage legacy architectures or providing customers and staff with the latest social, mobile and cloud technologies. new contracts signed during the year include a landmark agreement with wentworth community housing in australia, signed in november 2016, for the provision of kypera’s housing system and three other products including agile’s mobile working solutions. combined with the general long term nature of the contracts entered into, selling our products on a hosted basis gives greater recurring revenue and greater visibility of earnings and cash flow as we move forward. the existing customer base provides a significant opportunity for cross-selling opportunities, adding further organic growth along with new customers. invoicing is largely quarterly, half yearly or annually in advance and therefore deferred income levels fluctuate throughout the year. going concern the directors have prepared detailed cash flow projections including sensitivity analysis on key assumptions. in such a case, it could become more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive pressures. jenny y oung company

the directors have prepared detailed cash flow projections including sensitivity analysis on key assumptions. 31 castleton technology plc annual report 2017 strategic report governance financial statements 1 accounting policies – group continued software and customer relationships intangible assets that meet the criteria to be separately recognised as part of a business combination are carried at cost (which is equal to their fair value at the date of acquisition) less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. they are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis as follows: – software – 7–15 years – customer contracts and related relationships – 7–15 years impairment and amortisation charges are included within the administrative expenses line in the income statement. non-financial assets that were impaired in previous periods are reviewed annually to assess whether the impairment is still relevant. incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from proceeds. the equity component of a compound financial instrument is not re-measured subsequent to initial recognition except on conversion or expiry. after initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. spend on integration is incurred by the group when integrating one trading business into another. based on our analyses so far, these differences include: • we expect a revised revenue pattern for on-premise subscription contracts, which combine the delivery of software and support service. although it is expected that the standard will have an impact on the timing and amount of revenue and costs being recognised there will be no impact on cash flows with cash collections remaining in line with contractual terms. the quantitative impact of ifrs 15 on our 2019 financial statements is currently neither known to us nor reasonably estimable. 37 castleton technology plc annual report 2017 strategic report governance financial statements 1 accounting policies – group continued (b) critical judgements in applying
