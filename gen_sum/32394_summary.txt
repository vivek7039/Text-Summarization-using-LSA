Despite early teething issues previously noted, I’m delighted to say that the business has now dealt with these and as we enter our fourth year, we fully expect the company to demonstrate its growth potential. Dean Dickinson joined the Board as CEO on 31 October 2016, replacing Ian Smith who became Executive Deputy Chairman. Dean was part of the senior management team that sold ACS to Vista Private Equity for £725 million in March 2015. Caro Bell resigned from the Board as Operations Director on 30 August 2016 having joined in November 2015 and Davinder Sanghera resigned from the Board as Chief Operations Officer on 16th January 2017 having joined when Documotive was acquired by Castleton in November 2014. David Payne Chairman 17 July 2017 04 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017 Chief Executive’s Review Each of the acquisitions has brought best in class software solutions or managed services capability. The Group remains aligned along two divisions; Software Solutions and Managed Services, with each focusing on their separate yet complementary offerings. All key processes are available to be utilised on a mobile platform via apps or digital engagement. Our Managed Services division offers a wide range of IT Infrastructure solutions which support an organisation’s business objectives, including helping to drive efficiencies, manage legacy architectures or providing customers and staff with the latest social, mobile and cloud technologies. New contracts signed during the year include a landmark agreement with Wentworth Community Housing in Australia, signed in November 2016, for the provision of Kypera’s housing system and three other products including Agile’s mobile working solutions. Combined with the general long term nature of the contracts entered into, selling our products on a hosted basis gives greater recurring revenue and greater visibility of earnings and cash flow as we move forward. The existing customer base provides a significant opportunity for cross-selling opportunities, adding further organic growth along with new customers. We plan to bring Kypera onto our common accounting platform during the current year. Invoicing is largely quarterly, half yearly or annually in advance and therefore deferred income levels fluctuate throughout the year. Going Concern The Directors have prepared detailed cash flow projections including sensitivity analysis on key assumptions. In such a case, it could become more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive pressures.

The Board has a formal written schedule of matters reserved for its review and approval. A whistle-blowing arrangement exists whereby matters can be confidentially reported to the Audit Committee. This is achieved through an organisational structure that has clear reporting lines and delegated authorities.

The options are being awarded under a variety of schemes, both approved and unapproved. Capital expenditure on research and development in the year ended 31 March 2017 amounted to £0.3 million. In addition, various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and payables arise directly from its operations. The Group is committed to employment policies, which follow best practice based on equal opportunities for all employees, irrespective of sex, race, colour, disability or marital status. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all unadjusted differences in excess of £8,350 as well as differences below those thresholds that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.

Going Concern The Directors have prepared detailed cash flow projections including sensitivity analysis on key assumptions. 31 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies – Group continued Software and customer relationships Intangible assets that meet the criteria to be separately recognised as part of a business combination are carried at cost (which is equal to their fair value at the date of acquisition) less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. They are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis as follows: – Software – 7–15 years – Customer contracts and related relationships – 7–15 years Impairment and amortisation charges are included within the administrative expenses line in the income statement. In addition, the carrying value of capitalised development expenditure is reviewed for impairment annually. Non-financial assets that were impaired in previous periods are reviewed annually to assess whether the impairment is still relevant. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from proceeds. The equity component of a compound financial instrument is not re-measured subsequent to initial recognition except on conversion or expiry. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Amounts billed to customers in advance of revenue recognition are shown as deferred income. Amounts billed to customers in advance of revenue recognition are shown as deferred income. This is usually billed for either a quarter or the whole year in advance. Spend on integration is incurred by the Group when integrating one trading business into another. Based on our analyses so far, these differences include: • We expect a revised revenue pattern for on-premise subscription contracts, which combine the delivery of software and support service. Although it is expected that the standard will have an impact on the timing and amount of revenue and costs being recognised there will be no impact on cash flows with cash collections remaining in line with contractual terms. The quantitative impact of IFRS 15 on our 2019 financial statements is currently neither known to us nor reasonably estimable. 37 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies – Group continued (b) Critical judgements in applying accounting policies • Revenue recognition The directors exercise judgement in relation to the amounts of revenue and deferred income to be recognised on bundled contracts. 38 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued year ended 31 March 2017 2 Segment reporting continued Y ear ended 31 March 2017 Managed Services £000 Software Solutions £000 Central £000 T otal £000 Revenue 9,437 10,832 – 20,269 Operating profit/(loss) before amortisation of intangible assets and management charge 2,750 2,127 (1,691) 3,186 Amortisation of acquired intangibles (969) (2,028) – (2,997) Management charge (1,063) (368) 1,431 – Operating profit /(loss) 718 (269) (260) 189 Finance income 20 – 1 21 Finance costs – (189) (560) (749) Profit/(loss) before tax 738 (458) (819) (539) Adjusted EBITDA * 3,012 2,668 (1,297) 4,383 * Earnings for the year before net finance costs, tax, depreciation, amortisation, exceptional items, group management charge and share based payment charges.

Impairment tests for goodwill The recoverable amount of all cash generating units (CGU) has been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management until 31 March 2018. A reasonably possible adverse movement in any of the above key assumptions made would not give rise to impairment. Amounts charged to the allowance account are generally written-off, when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
