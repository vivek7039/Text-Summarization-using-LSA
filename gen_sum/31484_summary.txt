what was a quite fragmented business is now organised through four clear operating divisions, with real focus around customers and end market verticals. as shareholders may remember, these headline objectives were underpinned by a six-part action plan: to simplify our operating structure, enhance the management model, be more proactive on portfolio management, pursue a focused and disciplined acquisition strategy, increase investment in organic growth initiatives and improve our funding discipline. this is reflected in the range of benefits available to all colleagues, which includes our colleague equity/share incentive plan sharematch. mike ward head of pharma content, business intelligence informa brands: insight & intelligence: in vivo, scrip, sitetrove, trialtrove, biomedtracker

nutrition: clean choices i n the us, consumers are increasingly paying attention to what they put in and on their bodies. they are reading product labels, scrutinising chemical-sounding or perceived unnatural ingredients, and seeking out healthier, less processed offerings that their grandparents would recognise. rob gallagher research director, consumer & electronic services, ovum at our own natural products expo west and east, more than 1,000 new finished product brands launch each year. in commercial aviation, the large jetliner market continues to grow, fuelled by new demand for air travel and more efficient aircraft. global economic growth, rising numbers of middle-class travellers in emerging markets and low interest rates are underpinning strong demand for new airplanes. but the civil mro market is experiencing some churn as large aerospace contractors, most notably boeing, aim to grab a larger share of those lucrative revenues. mitigating activities informa has an international customer base, selling into over 165 countries, which dilutes the effect of downturns in specific geographies. the group’s aim is to not rely on individual partners, but in certain conditions, markets and geographies this can be unavoidable. impact change not managed effectively could result in unrealised opportunities, poor project delivery, colleague turnover, erosion of value and failure to deliver growth. major incidents can result from several causes, including natural disasters, extreme weather events, disease, epidemics, civil unrest and terrorism. impact loss of sensitive data through mismanagement, theft, cyber-crime or security breaches could lead to losses for our stakeholders, damaged reputation, investigations, fines and business interruption. if a significant loss materialised, this would distract from our strategic goals through excessive demands on management time to respond. the group seeks to build on these strong foundations with continued investment in its products and customer platforms, alongside further expansion. our recommended recruitment practices, which were promoted internally during 2017, standardise and enhance how candidates are selected, including using mixed-gender panel interviews where practical. “we are now seeing year-on-year customer performance metrics, and in time aim to build trend data across

america 51% rest of world 25% continental europe 13% uk 11% divisional revenue by geography (%) another key trend is the use of technology and digital platforms, whether for content delivery, customer tracking or search capability. another change as part of the penton integration was to appoint two divisional managing directors, each responsible for three vertical businesses. but its historical format – pdf reports delivered by email, with limited online presence – was increasingly preventing the full use of content and data by customers, as well as limiting the ability of sales teams to attract new subscribers and product development teams to create additional services. on top of this, it gives us a platform for exploring and introducing additional services and enhancements in the

laboratory as its own sector and create a true community in this space. this enhances customer relationships, builds loyalty around core branded events and provides new revenue opportunities, particularly in specialist marketing services. proactive portfolio management leaves the division streamlined, with a core of internationally focused events in key verticals and geographic hubs.
