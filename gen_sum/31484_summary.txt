publishing, knowledge and events business, operating in the knowledge and information economy. what was a quite fragmented business is now organised through four clear operating divisions, with real focus around customers and end market verticals. informa’s recommended offer for ubm builds on this platform, bringing benefits of scale and future opportunity. as shareholders may remember, these headline objectives were underpinned by a six-part action plan: to simplify our operating structure, enhance the management model, be more proactive on portfolio management, pursue a focused and disciplined acquisition strategy, increase investment in organic growth initiatives and improve our funding discipline. much has been achieved to reshape the group through gap and this is reflected in its improving performance. in 2017 , this gap investment started to reap dividends, with a range of new products and platform enhancements launched. project manager helena redshaw (above) said: “the integration project started from a positive place, as cultural fit was an important part of the rationale for combining our businesses, and there was a strong appetite amongst colleagues to come together as one business and community. this is reflected in the range of benefits available to all colleagues, which includes our colleague equity/share incentive plan sharematch. alongside such informal discussions, the group has a more formal colleague engagement platform, inside informa. similarly, we have launched new initiatives to promote gender balance, including enhanced recommended recruitment practices. informa has a balanced workforce overall, but female representation is lower in more senior roles. i look forward to keeping everyone updated and informed on progress through the year ahead. mike ward head of pharma content, business intelligence informa brands: insight & intelligence: in vivo, scrip, sitetrove, trialtrove, biomedtracker see pharmaintelligence.informa.com

consumers are increasingly paying attention to what they put in and on their bodies. they are reading product labels, scrutinising chemical-sounding or perceived unnatural ingredients, and seeking out healthier, less processed offerings that their grandparents would recognise. growing at 6-10% each year over the last decade, us consumer sales of natural, organic and functional foods and beverages are far outpacing total us food industry sales, which grew less than 1% in 2016 according to nutrition business journal (nbj). although still small in comparison to the total industry, natural,

statements strategic report our markets continued aviation: from defence spend to space start-ups i n the last few years, a sense of distrust has seeped into the global zeitgeist. however, futurists who track global trends believe this mistrust has also given rise to a countermovement. in commercial aviation, the large jetliner market continues to grow, fuelled by new demand for air travel and more efficient aircraft. the large commercial jetliner market dominated by airbus and boeing is heading into an unprecedented 15th year of growth. history would suggest the market is overdue a downturn, but there are few signs of weakness. global economic growth, rising numbers of middle-class travellers in emerging markets and low interest rates are underpinning strong demand for new airplanes. in addition to the fact that social media is increasingly where people find news and information (a reuters institute 2017 digital news report found that 33% of those between 18 and 24 listed social media as their main source of news), it has also made it possible for savvy influencers to take parasocial relationships – a one-way relationship with someone you do not know in real life – to the next level by using online interaction with fans and followers to supplement real life interactions. without these, brands may one day find their readers have abandoned them and gone elsewhere. but the civil mro market is experiencing some churn as large aerospace contractors, most notably boeing, aim to grab a larger share of those lucrative revenues. we have also added scoring in the dow jones sustainability index (djsi) as a new non-financial performance measure. the ratio is a calculation of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation compared with net debt. 2017 performance: informa has participated in the index since 2013 and this is a new kpi for 2017 . h e a l t h a n d safety incident 10. major incident culture two principal risks relate to how culture, behaviour and ethics contribute to the group’s success 11. inadequate regulatory compliance 12. privacy regulation risk it meets quarterly on a formal basis, and colleagues regularly work together outside of these meetings as is required to manage risk. mitigating activities informa has an international customer base, selling into over 165 countries, which dilutes the effect of downturns in specific geographies. movements in currency can have positive and negative impacts on the group’s reported earnings. the executive management team oversees market risk through holding regular people, planning and product-focused meetings with each division. the group’s aim is to not rely on individual partners, but in certain conditions, markets and geographies this can be unavoidable. mitigations include requiring counterparties to have robust and tested business continuity plans in place, service level agreements, contracts, proactive relationship management and working with suppliers to ensure that invoices are paid on time so that services are not suspended. risk 6. technology failure financial impact considered low not modelled for the viability statement oversight: risk committee description the group relies on technology to deliver products and services, engage with customers and pay suppliers, without which it would experience severe disruption. security is emphasised through standards including iso 27001, nist and cobit, which also benchmark us against recognised control objectives. risk 4. ineffective change management financial impact considered low not modelled for the viability statement oversight: executive management team description as the group grows through innovation and acquisition, it is necessary to adjust to change and assimilate new business cultures. impact change not managed effectively could result in unrealised opportunities, poor project delivery, colleague turnover, erosion of value and failure to deliver growth. major incidents can result from several causes, including natural disasters, extreme weather events, disease, epidemics, civil unrest and terrorism. if the group’s response to a major incident is inadequate, this could result in additional reputational damage. impact loss of sensitive data through mismanagement, theft, cyber-crime or security breaches could lead to losses for our stakeholders, damaged reputation, investigations, fines and business interruption. if a significant loss materialised, this would distract from our strategic goals through excessive demands on management time to respond. loss of expertise, engaged resource, corporate knowledge and contacts may impact the group’s future success. privacy regulations are regionally focused which presents further challenge for informa as an international business. link to strategy compliance with privacy regulations will influence marketing strategies and therefore the acquisition of new customers. over-compliance with privacy regulations, such as applying the strictest rules globally, could result in commercial disadvantage. this found we have a good baseline of compliance, with further work to do in specific areas. the group seeks to build on these strong foundations with continued investment in its products and customer platforms, alongside further expansion. factors in assessing long-term prospects group’s current position • recurring revenue streams with strong cash dynamics, including positive working capital driving high cash conversion • diversified business model by geography of operations and customers • diversified business model by products and by the verticals in which informa operates • strong market positions, brands that customers value and a focus on long-term customer relationships • flexible cost structure, enabling the business to respond effectively to changes in demand or in markets see the financial review on page 62 for more detail. accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing this annual report and financial statements. our recommended recruitment practices, which were promoted internally during 2017, standardise and enhance how candidates are selected, including using mixed-gender panel interviews where practical. this was last conducted in 2016, with the feedback leading to initiatives including new learning and development programmes. training accredited by the chartered management institute was trialled for uk line managers, and global exhibitions developed a common training framework that will roll out in 2018 to eight global hubs to support the division’s growth and business strategy. this captures information on key performance indicators such as customer satisfaction, likelihood of return and advocacy through a net promoter measure, with data delivered in real time to over 200 divisional users through dashboards and automated reports. “we are now seeing year-on-year customer performance metrics, and in time aim to build trend data across multiple years. the initial trend is positive and we now understand better the key drivers on satisfaction, retention and advocacy.” in academic publishing, we offer a suite of services dedicated to supporting authors at all stages of their research careers. as mark robinson, communications manager for authors & researchers at taylor & francis, explains: “the publishing process can seem complex, especially to those just starting out. work is underway to prepare the first report on our payment practices and performance for uk-related contracts by july 2018, as required under new uk legislation. in 2017, the print brands acquired as part of penton increased our overall paper usage almost twofold. opportunities where colleagues contribute their professional skills are particularly encouraged, as a way of lending extra capabilities to the organisation while developing personally. textbooks that address lower level undergraduate study have continued to suffer from broader market headwinds, particularly in the us, where higher education enrolment is down and alternative, cheap, book rental models are becoming more popular. this benefited trading, as did the launch of a new single online platform for ebook content in september 2017 . having most recently been ceo at information and software services group quantros, annie has brought a deep understanding of the application of technology to knowledge and information services, something that is increasing relevant in the academic market. journals continued to perform strongly over the year, maintaining a high level of subscription renewals and consistent, modest growth. this was supported by the depth of specialist content in its portfolio and the benefits of gap investments made in its online platform, t&f online, which have made content more discoverable and flexible. authors, funders, institutions and users are based all over the world, with research developments readily travelling across borders amongst specialist communities. for example, in 2017 taylor & francis launched an initiative to provide journal content to academics and the wider public in egypt, as part of an agreement with the egyptian knowledge bank, a government-backed national knowledge archive. academic publishing continued connecting book content, creating new opportunities in 2016, taylor & francis’s journals content moved onto a single online platform – t&f online – a new, optimised and user-friendly repository for nearly 4m specialist academic articles. “commercially, increasing usage means that over time, we can build on our current ebook revenue streams and explore new opportunities from additional digital services. it also makes it easier to add new content on a continuous basis.” subscription 53% unit sales 47% divisional revenue by type (%) north america 51% rest of world 25% continental europe 13% uk 11% divisional revenue by geography (%) another key trend is the use of technology and digital platforms, whether for content delivery, customer tracking or search capability. such analytics can inform commissioning decisions, balancing typically supply- based editorial models with demand-based evidence. following the addition of penton information services brands to business intelligence, it became meaningfully bigger in 2017 . both are contingent on the subscriptions business, building from its customer relationships and specialist expertise. another change as part of the penton integration was to appoint two divisional managing directors, each responsible for three vertical businesses. responding to this trend, many product upgrades under gap have focused on making the digital delivery of data more flexible and user-friendly, on our own platforms and through developing apis that enable customers to take data feeds direct into their own systems. but its historical format – pdf reports delivered by email, with limited online presence – was increasingly preventing the full use of content and data by customers, as well as limiting the ability of sales teams to attract new subscribers and product development teams to create additional services. “in terms of key features, at the heart was fast access to fertecon’s market data, and improved search. “learning from other business intelligence gap projects, improving data download and export features was also critical. on top of this, it gives us a platform for exploring and introducing additional services and enhancements in the future, not just for fertecon, but also through combining and building on our proprietary market intelligence across the full agribusiness value chain.” subscriptions 75% unit sales 7% advertising 18% divisional revenue by type (%) north america 62% rest of world 14% continental europe 12% uk 12% divisional revenue by geography (%) over the same period, intelligence – trusted, specialist, action- oriented insight that provides information on what businesses can and should do – has increased in value, as customers seek to gain competitive advantage in the information era, more so than general news reporting or simple industry analysis, which can increasingly be found for free. 2018 focus and possibilities in 2018, the focus for business intelligence will be to maintain its recent positive momentum, delivering further steady improvement in underlying revenue growth, with a target to at least match wider industry growth levels of around 3%. informa engage will seek to apply its specialist skills and marketing capabilities across a broader range of verticals and international customers, partnering not just with businesses in business intelligence but also in the other operating divisions. our top 30 events were again a key driver of growth, with strong performance across major brands that account for over 60% of divisional revenues, including arab health (life sciences), natural products expo west (health & nutrition) and china beauty (beauty & aesthetics). in dubai, we successfully separated medlab from the venue- bound arab health – see overleaf for more detail. this provides flexibility for exhibitors through a more customer service-oriented approach, with the potential to improve rebooking rates and generate incremental yields. the first, omnia, launched in life sciences, to provide customers with rich data on buyer behaviour and targeted, developed sales leads. “the show is a buzzing place – in 2016 there were over 4,100 exhibitors across more than 22 halls, plus many ancillary events and country pavilions. “splitting out the events helped cement medical laboratory as its own sector and create a true community in this space. exhibitor 69% attendee 10% sponsorship 8% advertising 13% divisional revenue by type (%) north america 57% rest of world 33% continental europe 8% uk 2% divisional revenue by geography (%) in this way, major exhibition brands can become fundamental to the commercial health and success of an industry sector, helping to drive investment and growth. there are additional growth possibilities from extending our brands into new geographic markets, notably in asia. this enhances customer relationships, builds loyalty around core branded events and provides new revenue opportunities, particularly in specialist marketing services. proactive portfolio management leaves the division streamlined, with a core of internationally focused events in key verticals and geographic hubs. these businesses have helped increase the division’s presence in north america, which now accounts for 40% of revenue. sponorship is another major source of revenue, with corporates investing in promotional activities connected to the event, including presenter and demonstration slots. more than 55,000 people from over 90 countries attended, making it europe’s largest tech gathering in 2017. “this festival is something knect365 would have found much more challenging to deliver effectively before gap,” carolyn continued. attendee 45% sponsorship 21% exhibitor 23% advertising 11% divisional revenue by type (%) north america 40% rest of world 19% continental europe 28% uk 13% divisional revenue by geography (%) to be successful, event organisers need to invest in their brands and the experiences they offer, demonstrating value and making them must-attend events in their community or sector. knowledge & networking is now focused on three key verticals, and the trends within each industry sector will ultimately influence its performance. the next phase of investment will focus on strengthening our digital content publishing platform with enhanced social media capabilities. this will build further year-round customer engagement, delivering specialist content and tools to reach engaged online audiences. the team is divided into three areas: informa’s events, our offices, and colleagues when they travel for business. this includes benchmarking criteria brought to life through a set of 40 ideas that can enhance an event’s positive impact. i n 2017 , the final year of the growth acceleration plan, informa delivered further operational progress and an improving financial performance, producing a fourth consecutive year of growth in revenue, adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow and dividends. outside of informa, we view the market for knowledge, business- to-business events and information services as an attractive one. this is in line with similar adjusted measures used by our peers and facilitates comparisons. the group also repaid private placement loan notes of usd 102m, eur 50m and gbp 40m that matured in december 2017 . we believe gap has strengthened informa’s operational capabilities and helped to deliver improving financial results. in the ordinary course of business, the directors meet a wide range of colleagues each year, from executive management who attend board meetings, divisional leadership teams who provide presentations on specific business matters at board, to committee and strategy meetings, as well as colleagues from many different functions and geographies. should shareholder and regulatory approval be secured for our recommended offer for ubm plc, it is our intention to welcome three directors from ubm’s board derek mapp chairman to join the board of the enlarged group. he achieved a first class honours ma in mathematics and statistics from the university of aberdeen. the board therefore considers all of its non-executive directors to be independent in character and judgement. when considering succession planning for executive and non-executive directors, the committee considers candidates from a wide range of backgrounds. their recommendations will be actively considered when it comes to new board appointments and succession planning. during 2017 , the committee received regular updates on allinforma, informa’s group-wide approach to diversity and inclusion. dr brendan o’neill’s retirement from the board and as audit committee chairman after nine years of service took effect on 26 may 2017 , and john rishton, appointed in september 2016, became chairman of the audit committee on brendan’s retirement. in 2017 , the committee focused on a number of key areas, including: cyber security: the growing threat of cyber security is a key issue for all companies today and one which constantly evolves with technology. there are significant judgements involved in assessing what amounts are recognised as the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities acquired through business combinations, particularly the amounts attributed to separate intangible assets such as titles, brands, acquired customer lists and associated customer relationships. at each reporting period, an assessment is performed to determine whether there are any such indicators of impairment, which involves considering the performance of our businesses, any significant changes to the markets in which we operate and future forecasts. informa’s chairman, derek mapp, attends meetings by invitation only and he is not present when matters relating to his remuneration are discussed. as part of our regular three-year cycle, we will be asking shareholders to approve an updated remuneration policy at the 2018 agm. while our existing remuneration policy has served the group and its shareholders well, we are proposing a number of changes in the updated policy (set out on pages 97 to 104) that are designed to reflect market best practice. as it is currently drafted: • the remuneration policy can be found on pages 98 to 104 of this report. as part of this process we will continue to regularly engage with executive directors and shareholders, particularly if any changes are proposed. • good leaver treatment: dsbp: awards will normally vest on the normal vesting date, with committee discretion to accelerate. bonus opportunity will be linked to the achievement of challenging financial and, when appropriate, non-financial performance targets. ltip awards will be linked to the achievement of challenging financial and, when appropriate, non-financial performance targets. they are expected to meet the guideline within five years of appointment and maintain this throughout their term. details of any such payments will be set out in the relevant year’s annual report on remuneration as they arise. the chairman and non-executive directors have letters of appointment that can be terminated by either party on three months’ notice. market practice more generally, feedback from shareholders and aspects of practices across the group are taken into account. where businesses join the group through acquisition, this can also create a level of difference in remuneration practices. for the senior management team, base salary is reviewed annually and takes into account factors consistent with those applied to executive director pay. the group’s remuneration policy for colleagues as a whole is based on principles that are broadly consistent with those applied to executive directors. the committee determined that stephen a. carter cbe and gareth wright’s base salaries would increase by 1.0%. this increases on a straight-line basis to full vesting for ranking at or above the 80th percentile. this increases

our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. in addition, auditing standards identify revenue recognition as a presumed area of potentially fraudulent management manipulation. we note that management has elected to show the fair value amounts within note 18 for acquisitions made in 2017 as provisional as permitted by ifrs 3 business combinations for finalisation within 12 months of the respective acquisition dates. we originally planned to take a controls reliance approach in the uk

conferences and learning events, together with attendee fees and event sponsorship, is recognised when the event is held, with advance receipts recognised as deferred income in the balance sheet. barter transactions typically involve the trading of advertisements and trade show space in exchange for services provided at events. the pension cost charge associated with these schemes represents contributions payable and is charged as an expense when incurred. net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the opening net defined benefit liability or asset and shown in finance costs, and the administration costs are shown as a component of operating expenses. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. for intangible assets acquired in business combinations, cost is calculated based on the group’s valuation methodologies (note 17). capitalisation of these costs ceases when the project is substantially complete and available for use. net

acquired customer lists and associated customer relationships. at each reporting period, an assessment is performed to determine whether there are any such indicators of impairment, which involves considering the performance of our businesses, any significant changes to the markets in which we operate and future forecasts. the contingent consideration is based on future business valuations and profit multiples (both level 3 fair value measurements) and has been estimated on an acquisition by acquisition basis using available profit forecasts (a significant unobservable input). consolidated
