We are determined to consistently exceed customer expectations and enhance their overall experience with us through continual improvement of the quality of our products, services, people and processes.” Mathew Shajee Varghese Group Quality Manager Strategic report Principal risks and uncertainties 34 A robust risk management framework We continue to have a single depository for all major risks that the Lamprell Group faces – our Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) system. • Lamprell’s majority shareholder can act as a negative veto to hostile approaches based on unreasonably low valuations. If the Group fails to be competitive (technically and commercially), it will not win new project awards. Ineffective management of these relationships could leave Lamprell exposed to additional contractual and/or execution liability or render the Group’s operations in certain jurisdictions uncompetitive. medium Continued development of current business units and movement into growth markets could be significantly impeded if sufficient funding does not exist. Operational risks Risk description Business implication Mitigation Geopolitical The Group is subject to the legal, economic and political conditions of operating in emerging markets, in which regulatory or contractual enforcement may be difficult, and such emerging markets may be prone to corruption issues. Mr Wright is a qualified Chartered Certified Accountant with over 15 years’ experience working in the oil & gas and construction industries.

Nick Garrett Non-Executive Director Aged 55 Appointed: March 2017 Strengths: public markets, financial and accounting Experience: In his 23-year career at J.P . In many cases he acted as chair of their audit committees, driving world class corporate governance at board committee level. Similarly, any Director is entitled to take independent professional or legal advice on Company matters, as and when needed. Nick Garrett took advice in relation to his position as a Non-Executive Director that had been nominated by the major shareholder . Further value would be achieved by spending more time on deeper dives into individual risks, rather than high level assessments. External auditor – activities and performance Deloitte LLP has been the Company’s auditors following a formal tender process in 2015. Accordingly , Deloitte LLP could, under certain conditions, be engaged to undertake non-audit services provided that it does not compromise the integrity of their audit work. However , the policy also sets out services that Deloitte LLP is prohibited from undertaking under any circumstances. At each meeting, the Committee evaluated management’s report on material subjective provisions taken in respect of matters including doubtful debts, contract accruals, project risks and warranty issues. However , in light of the significant losses incurred on the East Anglia One project, it was recognised that additional improvements had to be made around project risk reporting, measurement of performance against metrics and feeding lessons learned from previous projects into future bidding activities. Consideration of shareholder views The Company is committed to maintaining good communications with investors and in particular around compensation matters. Ellis Armstrong, Mel Fitzgerald, Debra Valentine and James Dewar are considered to be independent NEDs of the Company . Such Executive Directors may retain fees paid for these services, which will be subject to approval by the Board. 76 Financial statements Independent Auditor’s Report Estimation of project costs and revenue recognition Key audit matter description The Group’s operations are characterised by contract risk with significant judgements involved in the assessment of both current and future contract financial performance. This is a change from the prior year where we determined materiality based on adjusted forecast profit before taxation. Refer to Note 2.1(b) for a statement on the impact of IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with customers’. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss. The effect of this change in estimate was to reduce 2017 depreciation expense and net loss by USD 1.4 million. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line method to allocate the fair value at acquisition over its estimated useful life. (b) Customer relationships Customer relationships acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised, separately from goodwill, at fair value at the date of acquisition if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably . Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line method to allocate the fair value at acquisition over their estimated useful life. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against ‘general and administrative expenses’ in the consolidated income statement. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three-year period. These assumptions are based on medium-term forecasts for the global energy industry, macro-economic factors, opportunities and market insights obtained from bidding activities. The performance target is assessed against financial metrics that may include relative or absolute total shareholder return, cumulative EBIDTA and end of period backlog. 2017 USD’000 2016 USD’000 Loss per share: Basic (28.70)c (53.94)c Diluted (28.70)c (53.94)c Loss per share from continuing operations: Basic (28.70)c (53.32)c Diluted (28.70)c (53.32)c Loss per share from discontinued operations: Basic – (0.62)c Diluted – (0.62)c 110 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 14 Operating (loss)/profit (a) Operating (loss)/profit Operating loss (from continuing operations) is stated after charging/recognising: 2017 USD’000 2016 USD’000 Provision for onerous contract (Note 4) 80,000 – Depreciation (Note 16) 22,638 25,101 Operating lease rentals – land and buildings 10,195 11,872 Provision for impairment of trade receivables 33 977 Impairment of goodwill (Note 17) – 180,539 Write-down of inventory to net realisable value (Note 20) – 2,000 (b) Auditor’s remuneration Services provided by the Group’s auditor and its associates comprised: 2017 USD’000 2016 USD’000 Audit of parent company and consolidated financial statements 419 302 Audit of Group companies pursuant to legislation 49 90 Interim review of parent company and consolidated financial statements 116 116 Other audit related service 12 12 596 520 15 Financial instruments by category The accounting policies for financial instruments have been applied to the line items below: Group Assets as per balance sheet Classification 2017 USD’000 2016 USD’000 Trade receivables – net of provision (Note 21) Loans and receivables 33,942 83,943 Other receivables excluding prepayments Loans and receivables 4,275 17,967 Due from related parties (Note 23) Loans and receivables 12,951 109 Derivative financial instruments (Note 27) Fair value through profit or loss 1,666 173 Cash and bank balances (Note 22) Loans and receivables 296,443 334,670 349,277 436,862 Liabilities as per balance sheet Classification 2017 USD’000 2016 USD’000 Derivative financial instruments (Note 27) Derivatives used for hedging – 1,259 Trade payables (Note 28) Liabilities at amortised cost 47,897 31,662 Due to a related party (Note 23) Liabilities at amortised cost 28 228 Accruals (Note 28) Liabilities at amortised cost 149,833 111,022 Provision for warranty costs and other liabilities (Note 29) Liabilities at amortised cost 7,475 7,958 Borrowings (Note 30) Liabilities at amortised cost 39,491 59,484 244,724 211,613 Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 111 15 Financial instruments by category continued Company Assets as per balance sheet Classification 2017 USD’000 2016 USD’000 Cash and bank balance Loans and receivables 163 264 Due from related parties (Note 23) Loans and receivables 16,936 13,694 Other receivables Loans and receivables 242 357 17,341 14,315 Liabilities as per balance sheet Classification 2017 USD’000 2016 USD’000 Accruals Liabilities at amortised cost 1,241 564 Due to related parties (Note 23) Liabilities at amortised cost 3,155 – 4,396 564 Credit quality of financial assets Group The credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired can be assessed by reference to historical information about counterparty default rates: 2017 USD’000 2016 USD’000 Trade receivables Group A 13,482 57,315 Group B 7,575 975 Group C 2,322 17,733 23,379 76,023 Group A – Last six months average debtor days is less than 45.
