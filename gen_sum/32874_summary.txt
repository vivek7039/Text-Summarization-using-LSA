manager strategic report principal risks and uncertainties 34 a robust risk management framework we continue to have a single depository for all major risks that the lamprell group faces – our enterprise risk management (“erm”) system. in addition, such communication ensures that the approach to appropriate mitigation strategies amongst stakeholders is aligned. • lamprell’s majority shareholder can act as a negative veto to hostile approaches based on unreasonably low valuations. ability to win new work the group is dependent on a relatively small number of contracts at any given time, some of which are for the same customers, and strong client relationships are critical for a sustainable business. if the group fails to be competitive (technically and commercially), it will not win new project awards. ineffective management of these relationships could leave lamprell exposed to additional contractual and/or execution liability or render the group’s operations in certain jurisdictions uncompetitive. medium continued development of current business units and movement into growth markets could be significantly impeded if sufficient funding does not exist. operational risks risk description business implication mitigation geopolitical the group is subject to the legal, economic and political conditions of operating in emerging markets, in which regulatory or contractual enforcement may be difficult, and such emerging markets may be prone to corruption issues. • major operations take place in the uae, which is considered to be politically and financially stable. project execution as the group diversifies into new markets and product offerings, it faces additional risks surrounding project execution including bid estimation, scheduling, supply chain

value at acquisition over its estimated useful life. (b) customer relationships customer relationships acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised, separately from goodwill, at fair value at the date of acquisition if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably . amortisation is calculated on a straight-line method to allocate the fair value at acquisition over their estimated useful life. (c) operating lease rights intangible assets representing operating leasehold rights are carried at cost (being the fair value on the date of acquisition where intangibles are acquired in a business combination) less accumulated amortisation and impairment, if any . subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against ‘general and administrative expenses’ in the consolidated income statement. accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. however , deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. they are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. these risks are evaluated by management on an ongoing basis to assess and manage critical exposures. management believes that this concentration of credit risk is mitigated as the group conducts credit checks internally and through expert third party providers for new counterparties or in support of major contracts, payment terms under contract are carefully managed and protection against non-payment is built into contractual documentation to ensure the group has a right to remedy in the event of delayed/non-payment. if all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. if one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include: (a) quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments; and (b) other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments. 4.1.1 provisions for liquidated damages claims (lds) the group provides for liquidated damages where there have been significant delays against defined contractual delivery dates or contractual milestones and it is considered probable that the customer will successfully pursue these penalties. these calculations use pre-tax cash flow
