Risk Control Assuring data integrity in  real time across fragmented  systems to mitigate operational  and conduct risks. The increasing volume of transactions is a  demand driver for our core solution Clareti Transaction Control (“CTC”). The Gresham organisation and its employees are fully aligned to growing  profitable revenue from Clareti sales globally. Gresham Technologies plc Annual Financial Report 2017 07 Strategic Report Outlook We started 2018 with the Clareti annuity stream up 24% year-on-year  and, in the first quarter of 2018 so far, we have signed a further insurance  broking business for CTC, a Clareti Adapter sale and several professional  services engagements for delivery of software contracts won in late 2017 . CTC is expected to drive the majority of new wins, with Clareti-as-a-Service  providing incremental hosting and managed service revenues. We will look for opportunity to broaden the appeal  of our Clareti ARM offering with new capabilities. We also see a broader market opportunity for our modern technology  and we aim to establish Clareti within the financial industry as a “de-facto”  standard platform for firms with complex data processing challenges  who need to improve integrity and evidence control across their entire  business. Regulatory drivers are increasingly behind this requirement  and it was pleasing to see three RegTech deals signed in 2017 . Using Clareti, we  have built a number of individual applications  designed to address specific industry  problems, providing enhanced value and  greater marketability. Our strengths Our business Our business model is to earn high-margin, recurring revenues by providing innovative  software solutions to financial institutions in the field of data integrity and control  Innovative software solutions – Recurring 5.3m – Non-recurring 5.8m Clareti recognised revenue Strategic Report 08 Gresham Technologies plc Annual Financial Report 2017 Business model By industry – Banking 56% –  A s s e t   Management 9% –  Hedge Fund 6% –  I n s u r anc e 5% –  O t h e r 24% CHARGING MODEL Gresham’s preferred charging model is to  licence Clareti applications on a subscription  basis, combining licensing and support and  maintenance. The team  operates as a global function, which enables us  to make optimal use of resources and expertise  from all locations. Clareti-as-a-Service (“CaaS”) is a stable offering and has delivered  significant total cost of ownership reduction for our customers who have  opted to deploy in Gresham’s cloud. We won 15 new CTC software  contracts in the year, contributing  to our closing Clareti annualised  recurring revenue of £5.7m (up 24%). We will improve on our position in the  Global RiskTech100 register and seek  other independent third party attestations. We will focus our product development  activities on enhancements and new  Clareti applications designed to address  data integrity issues. Measuring our progress FINANCIAL  Build a high-margin,  recurring revenue  stream based on  term licence sales,  subscriptions and  cloud services. The Board is committed to addressing  these risks by implementing systems for effective risk management and  internal control. CHANGE IN RISK MITIGATION I  Stable We continue to see strong market  demand for Clareti solutions, but the  risks associated with timing, type,  mix and quantum of revenues remain  unchanged as these factors are largely  driven by the customers’ requirements  and budgeting processes. Issues or failures with our software  products or services could lead to  failed implementations, project delays,  cost overruns, data loss, security issues,  customer dissatisfaction, early termination,  service level breaches and contractual  claims, all of which could adversely  impact the Group’s revenues, earnings  and reputation. Our forecasts prudently  allow for attrition in non-Clareti revenues  based on historical performance and  customer plans, where known. New senior hires have been  added throughout the business (including  HR, sales and marketing) which mitigates  certain key person risks. These processes are  overseen by Gresham’s information  security committee, which reports  formally to the Board at least every  six months. All three clients  selected CTC following robust tender processes where Gresham was  pitched head-to-head with incumbents and other competitors. In common with many of our customer contracts, we also agreed  a framework for licence growth over time as more use cases are identified  across their business. We also won two further UK-based hedge fund  clients during the year and our recent recognition for being the  “Most Innovative Technology Firm” in hedge funds by HFM in both  their European and US awards is further evidence that our offering for  alternative investment managers is particularly strong. The system will also be extended to replace existing manually  intensive reconciliation and control processes in their securities division. This customer is also deploying Clareti Analytics to provide deeper  management insight into their data control operations. In a relative short period, North America has grown to represent  25% of Clareti ARR and is also now pulling through demand for  implementation services. Our long-standing white label agreements with two global banks  in accounts receivables management continue to deliver a steadily  growing recurring revenue stream. Throughout 2017 , we typically had  around a dozen implementation projects and several pre-sale proofs  of concept underway at any given point in time. We offer customers a cloud or on-premise deployment option,  although the majority still select to run their systems in-house. Our joint venture with Mount Street Loan Solutions LLP , one of  Europe’s leading commercial real estate servicers, to develop Clareti  Loan Control (“CLC”) has now delivered a market ready offering, and  whilst no incremental sales were achieved in 2017 , there is potential  for additional revenues as Mount Street increases its usage of CLC and,  more widely, we believe that there is a significant market opportunity  to sell CLC into financial institutions. To date,  we have achieved initial licence fees under term agreements totalling £4.0m  that we anticipate will repeat from 2020 onwards either as repeat upfront  fees or additional annuity revenues of an equivalent £0.9m per annum;  this is in addition to our stated annualised recurring revenue as at  31 December 2017 which incorporates annually recurring revenues only. Our gross margin continues to be affected by the split of contracting service revenues that are provided by third party contractors (which is recorded  in cost of sales) and individuals we bring on our payroll as fixed-term employees (which is recorded in administration costs). We also “hire for attitude” , placing great importance on our values,  effective team working, and customer success. We are pleased to have been able to support  charities such as BeyondBlue, an Australian charity offering support and  raising awareness of mental health, and SMART , a North American charity  started by a doctor whose son suffers from spinal muscular atrophy,  known personally by one of our team. We also proudly sponsor OCRFC – a youth rugby team in London  that coaches and mentors disadvantaged young men. We believe that it is very important to achieve high levels of trust  between individuals within the Group as this promotes high levels  of staff engagement and helps to ensure that the working environment  is pleasant, healthy and sustainable. Gresham is guided by internationally proclaimed  fundamental principles such as those set out in the United Nations  Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Prior to Mr A Balchin’s appointment in May 2017 , the Company did not comply  with these Provisions as it only had one independent Non-Executive Director,  namely Ms I Joss. Retirement and re-election All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM  immediately following their appointment and thereafter are subject  to re-election at intervals of no more than three years, or annually for  any Non-Executive Director who has served for more than nine years. These lay down  accounting policies and financial control procedures, in addition  to controls of a more operational nature. Our  committee comprises three members, two of whom are independent  Non-Executive Directors, namely myself and Ms I Joss. At least once a year, we meet separately  with the external auditor to discuss matters without executive  management being present. Impairments reviews were also an area of focus for the external auditor  who reported its findings to us. BDO LLP has continued as external  auditor for every year since then, including in respect of this Annual  Financial Report 2017 . For 2017 , the committee has continued to operate a simple remuneration  structure made up of basic salary, performance-related bonuses, share  options, benefits and pensions. As regards increases for 2018, the committee has assessed that Chief  Executive basic pay should increase by 2.4% in line with other Group  employees. Non-Executive  Directors are not eligible for pensions, incentives, bonus  or any similar payments other than normal out-of-pocket  expenses incurred on behalf of the business. Mr R Grubb has a service agreement dated 18 May 2011, which is  terminable by six months’ rolling notice from either side. All Director service contracts and letters of appointment are available  for inspection by shareholders at the Company’s registered office,  Aldermary House, 10–15 Queen Street, London EC4N 1TX.

Independent auditor’s report Gresham Technologies plc Annual Financial Report 2017 50 Financial Statements Key audit matters continued Development costs (Note 2, Note 13) Description As detailed in the accounting policies, development  costs are recognised as an intangible asset if specific  criteria have been met. Cash flows forecast  in respect of development projects were assessed for reasonableness against known sales  pipeline opportunities. The estimated useful life of these intangible assets ranges between  two and ten years depending on their nature. The fair value of derivative financial instruments is calculated by  reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar  maturity profiles. Pre-contract costs incurred subsequent to  appointment as preferred bidder are capitalised onto the balance  sheet under prepayments and accrued income. Fair value of awards with a financial result-based performance target  is determined by management using the Black Scholes pricing model. Segment information continued Transfer prices between segments are set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to £nil  (2016: £nil). Finance Bill 2015, which was substantively enacted  on 26 October 2015, announced further reductions to the main rate of corporation tax. Obligations under leases continued Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: Land and buildings 2017 £’000 Other 2017 £’000 Total 2017 £’000 Land and buildings 2016 £’000 Other 2016 £’000 Total 2016 £’000 Not later than one year 295 — 295 304 — 304  After one but not more than five years 751 — 751 453 — 453 More than five years 61 — 61 — — — 1,107 — 1,107 757 — 757  Operating lease agreements where the Group is lessor The Group has entered into commercial leases as lessor on Australian and US properties. • Property, plant and equipment – a significant element of the Group’s liquidity is tied up in tangible fixed assets. A positive number indicates an increase in profit after taxation and other components of equity where Sterling weakens against the respective currencies. There is no single party known that the Directors consider to be a controlling shareholder or ultimate parent undertaking. Gresham also provided support services during the year to its joint venture partner; Mount Street Loans Limited  of £204,000. Fair value of derivative financial instruments is calculated by reference  to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity  profiles. Fair value of awards with a financial  result-based performance target is determined by management using  the Black Scholes pricing model.
