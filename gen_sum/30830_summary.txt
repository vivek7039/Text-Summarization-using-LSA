assuring data integrity in real time across fragmented systems to mitigate operational and conduct risks. importantly, we have continued to secure new, high-margin recurring clareti revenues, which has resulted in clareti annualised recurring revenues closing at £5.7m (up 24% over 2016) and associated growth in underlying profitability yielding an adjusted ebitda for the group of £5.1m (up 34% over 2016). at the same time, these pressures drive demand for more effective it solutions to improve internal efficiency. the increasing volume of transactions is a demand driver for our core solution clareti transaction control (“ctc”). gresham technologies plc annual financial report 2017 05 strategic report ongoing investments the board continues to believe there is a very significant market opportunity for data integrity and control solutions and that ongoing investment in key strategic areas is essential. as noted above, regulatory reporting demands on our clients are increasing both in number and complexity. the gresham organisation and its employees are fully aligned to growing profitable revenue from clareti sales globally. ken archer non-executive chairman 12 march 2018 gresham technologies plc annual financial report 2017 06 strategic report ceo’s statement with clareti sales now generating more than half of all group sales and with the group now generating surplus cash for the first time in many years, we are confident our strategy is on track and certain about our ability to deliver sustainable long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. financial year 2017 reflects yet another strong performance from a motivated global team and a further year of excellent progress for the group, which is transforming into one of the uk’s most exciting listed financial technology companies. gresham technologies plc annual financial report 2017 07 strategic report outlook we started 2018 with the clareti annuity stream up 24% year-on-year and, in the first quarter of 2018 so far, we have signed a further insurance broking business for ctc, a clareti adapter sale and several professional services engagements for delivery of software contracts won in late 2017 . ctc is expected to drive the majority of new wins, with clareti-as-a-service providing incremental hosting and managed service revenues. we will look for opportunity to broaden the appeal of our clareti arm offering with new capabilities. the core use case for clareti transaction control continues to be that of addressing larger scale reconciliation and transaction data quality problems in financial markets and we intend to capitalise on this opportunity over the next few years. we also see a broader market opportunity for our modern technology and we aim to establish clareti within the financial industry as a “de-facto” standard platform for firms with complex data processing challenges who need to improve integrity and evidence control across their entire business. regulatory drivers are increasingly behind this requirement and it was pleasing to see three regtech deals signed in 2017 . using clareti, we have built a number of individual applications designed to address specific industry problems, providing enhanced value and greater marketability. our strengths our business our business model is to earn high-margin, recurring revenues by providing innovative software solutions to financial institutions in the field of data integrity and control innovative software solutions – recurring 5.3m – non-recurring 5.8m clareti recognised revenue strategic report

gresham’s preferred charging model is to licence clareti applications on a subscription basis, combining licensing and support and maintenance. deployment our customer success team is made up of experienced professional services consultants and specialist support technicians. the team operates as a global function, which enables us to make optimal use of resources and expertise from all locations. clareti-as-a-service (“caas”) is a stable offering and has delivered significant total cost of ownership reduction for our customers who have opted to deploy in gresham’s cloud. we have a long track record of working with partner banks on innovation in cash management capabilities and we expect this to continue in 2018 with new capabilities to enhance gresham’s addressable market at the major transaction banks. we won 15 new ctc software contracts in the year, contributing to our closing clareti annualised recurring revenue of £5.7m (up 24%). we will improve on our position in the global risktech100 register and seek other independent third party attestations. we will focus our product development activities on enhancements and new clareti applications designed to address data integrity issues. measuring our progress financial build a high-margin, recurring revenue stream based on term licence sales, subscriptions and cloud services. total of our clareti annually recurring revenues and the annually recurring revenues from our partner and legacy customer contracts in force as at 31 december 2017 that we have a high expectation will renew in the following year. the board is committed to addressing these risks by implementing systems for effective risk management and internal control. change in risk mitigation i stable we continue to see strong market demand for clareti solutions, but the risks associated with timing, type, mix and quantum of revenues remain unchanged as these factors are largely driven by the customers’ requirements and budgeting processes. issues or failures with our software products or services could lead to failed implementations, project delays, cost overruns, data loss, security issues, customer dissatisfaction, early termination, service level breaches and contractual claims, all of which could adversely impact the group’s revenues, earnings and reputation. strong communication lines between the relevant stakeholders are ensured through regular formal meetings and monthly reporting. mitigation against short-term impact is provided through the natural spread of non-clareti products, geographies and customers. our forecasts prudently allow for attrition in non-clareti revenues based on historical performance and customer plans, where known. new senior hires have been added throughout the business (including hr, sales and marketing) which mitigates certain key person risks. gresham’s high-margin recurring revenues provide a level of protection against volatile economic or market conditions. these processes are overseen by gresham’s information security committee, which reports formally to the board at least every six months. principal risks and uncertainties continued gresham technologies plc annual financial report 2017 19 strategic report operational review ian manocha 15 new ctc customers introduction the group delivered another strong performance in 2017 , once again underpinned by strong organic revenue growth from clareti solutions. all three clients selected ctc following robust tender processes where gresham was pitched head-to-head with incumbents and other competitors. in common with many of our customer contracts, we also agreed a framework for licence growth over time as more use cases are identified across their business. we also won two further uk-based hedge fund clients during the year and our recent recognition for being the “most innovative technology firm” in hedge funds by hfm in both their european and us awards is further evidence that our offering for alternative investment managers is particularly strong. the system will also be extended to replace existing manually intensive reconciliation and control processes in their securities division. this customer is also deploying clareti analytics to provide deeper management insight into their data control operations. in a relative short period, north america has grown to represent 25% of clareti arr and is also now pulling through demand for implementation services. one major systems integrator has now delivered two successful projects and is embarking on its third. throughout 2017 , we typically had around a dozen implementation projects and several pre-sale proofs of concept underway at any given point in time. we offer customers a cloud or on-premise deployment option, although the majority still select to run their systems in-house. our joint venture with mount street loan solutions llp , one of europe’s leading commercial real estate servicers, to develop clareti loan control (“clc”) has now delivered a market ready offering, and whilst no incremental sales were achieved in 2017 , there is potential for additional revenues as mount street increases its usage of clc and, more widely, we believe that there is a significant market opportunity to sell clc into financial institutions. this has opened up charging for additional future periods of use for these customers beyond the fixed licence term of the contract with the first of these additional chargeable periods beginning in 2020. to date, we have achieved initial licence fees under term agreements totalling £4.0m that we anticipate will repeat from 2020 onwards either as repeat upfront fees or additional annuity revenues of an equivalent £0.9m per annum; this is in addition to our stated annualised recurring revenue as at 31 december 2017 which incorporates annually recurring revenues only. our gross margin continues to be affected by the split of contracting service revenues that are provided by third party contractors (which is recorded in cost of sales) and individuals we bring on our payroll as fixed-term employees (which is recorded in administration costs). this increase in cash was due to £2.2m arising from operations less capital expenditure (2016: £0.5m) as the group’s increasing clareti revenues and earnings were offset by a lower capital expenditure amount as we spent less on development due to releasing temporary development resources engaged in fy2016, and less development spend has been capitalised as certain parts of our clareti portfolio begin to mature. we also “hire for attitude” , placing great importance on our values, effective team working, and customer success. we are pleased to have been able to support charities such as beyondblue, an australian charity offering support and raising awareness of mental health, and smart , a north american charity started by a doctor whose son suffers from spinal muscular atrophy, known personally by one of our team. we also proudly sponsor ocrfc – a youth rugby team in london that coaches and mentors disadvantaged young men. performance appraisals happen formally at mid and full year, but we encourage ongoing dialogue throughout the year to ensure that employees are getting sufficient support from the group (including training needs) in order to be successful in their roles. we believe that it is very important to achieve high levels of trust between individuals within the group as this promotes high levels of staff engagement and helps to ensure that the working environment is pleasant, healthy and sustainable. gresham has reported on all material emission sources which it deems itself to be responsible for. gresham is guided by internationally

made up of basic salary, performance-related bonuses, share options, benefits and pensions. as regards increases for 2018, the committee has assessed that chief executive basic pay should increase by
