our success therefore is dependent on how well we select, manage, organise, motivate, develop and engage the people who work for serco. as we have said previously, the rate of growth thereafter will be more dependent on our ability to grow revenues. we believe that the market will continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate than previously, because of two fundamental truths. • we have made further excellent progress rebuilding confidence and trust with our major customers, in large part due to greatly improved operational performance. performance 2017’s viewpoint survey, which is based on some 31,000 employees responding, showed a fourth successive year of improvement in our global score. lack of resilience in the supply chain – exposing us to potential service provision or financial losses should they have ineffective business continuity and disaster recovery plans. our guidance, as set out in more detail below, includes that we expect underlying trading profit to grow over the next two years, and this will be driven largely by further transformation savings. in 2019, it increases to around £700m, with australian immigration services, the dubai metro, one of our us navy installation contracts and compass all due for rebid or potential extension. it should also be remembered that in the americas division in particular, we have numerous arrangements which are classed as ‘idiq’ – indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity – which are essentially framework agreements under which the customer issues task orders one at a time; chief executive's review continued serco group plc annual report and accounts 2017 38 whilst the ultimate value of such an agreement may be very large and run over many years, a value is only recorded in our order book as individual task orders are contracted, and few of them would appear in the pipeline as they tend to be individually less than £10m and contracted on short lead times. there is a very real risk that this will make the uk government more than normally cautious in dealing with its suppliers. so far, serco’s three-stage plan (stabilise – transform – grow), which we conceived in late 2014, has survived contact with the flow of events surprisingly well. serco presents alternative measures to include the revenue and trading profit of these discontinued operations in prior periods for consistency with previous disclosures. we have partially reloaded the pipeline with some other smaller tenders for various defence support, hospital facilities management and environmental services. serco was unsuccessful in a large new bid opportunity to be prime contractor for us navy systems support, but has potential for a share of work through sub-contract relationships; there were no other major new pipeline decisions or large rebids or extensions due during the year. this reduction was driven by the end of the armidale class patrol boats (acpb), western australia court security & custodial services (wacscs) and mount eden contracts, together with some smaller reductions from other contracts ending or reducing in scope; there was some growth in citizen services contact and processing support which partially offset this attrition. in general, apms are presented externally to meet investors’ requirements for further clarity and transparency of the group’s financial performance. no such material one-time items occurred in 2017. underlying trading margin is calculated as utp divided by revenue from continuing and discontinued operations. this aids consistency with historical results, and enables performance to be evaluated before the unusual or one-time effects described above. at the same time, however, we recognise enduring challenges that, whilst not exclusive to serco, are high priority issues for our business and customers. they help to ensure we are all working from a commonly understood base that can be consistently applied across our organisation. in 2017, we have continued to enable the achievement of enhanced social outcomes through consistent, well- managed and continuously improving frontline services. • health: we have helped to enhance patient experiences and maintain safer environments in hospitals through the provision of facilities management services. we strive for early line of sight regarding increases in threat or exposure, and maintain a robust control environment that reduces negative impacts to our business performance. internal controls and key processes are defined within the serco management system (sms) together with clear definitions of those individuals responsible for ensuring compliance. i would like to thank angie risley, who stepped down when she left the board, for her valued contribution over a number of years. during 2017, the board received briefings from their advisers of relevant topics designed to update directors’ skills and knowledge in particular areas. non-executive directors of the group are initially appointed for a three-year term, and that appointment may be terminated on three months’ written notice. full retrospective disclosure will be made of any details that are withheld once this information is no longer deemed commercially sensitive by the committee. as the cost of providing such benefits varies based on market rates and other factors, there is no formal maximum monetary value. remuneration
