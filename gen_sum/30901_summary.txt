geographies, with revenue in 2017 (including share of joint ventures and associates) of £3,310m strategic report our purpose at serco is to be a trusted partner of governments, delivering superb public services that transform outcomes and make a positive difference for our fellow citizens. they guide us in our dealings with colleagues, customers, suppliers, partners, shareholders and the communities we serve. our success therefore is dependent on how well we select, manage, organise, motivate, develop and engage the people who work for serco. every year we run a detailed ‘viewpoint’ employee survey to gauge how well our colleagues think we are doing, and i am delighted to say that, for the fourth successive year, the aggregated measure of ‘employee engagement’ improved again in 2017, with some 31,000 people responding. supporting this, we achieved our targeted cost savings through the delivery of operational efficiency improvements. since the second half of 2016, we have been making progress on increasing our profit margin – a key deliverable of successfully implementing our strategy – and in 2018 we expect that further margin and profit progress will be driven largely by transformation savings. as we have said previously, the rate of growth thereafter will be more dependent on our ability to grow revenues. we have continued in 2017 to further develop the effectiveness of our governance, operational resilience and organisational change processes. board members regularly visit contracts and meet with members of the wider management team; in particular, non-executives participate in our oxford saïd serco management training course, which is attended by around 30 managers and runs four times a year. we focus our activities in five areas of government service: defence, justice & immigration, transport, health and citizen services. we deliver these services in four regions: uk & europe, north america, asia pacific and the middle east. furthermore, governments have become much more skilled at contracting and focused on risk- transfer; as a consequence margins and risk-adjusted returns earned by many suppliers to government are much lower today than they were ten years ago. we believe that the market will continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate than previously, because of two fundamental truths. the challenge facing governments worldwide can, like our strategy, be simply expressed: to deliver more, and better, for less. there are other factors that make the public sector marketplace attractive to us: whilst some niches may be disrupted by technology or other exogenous factors, we can be very confident that the world will still need prisons, will still need to manage immigration, and provide healthcare and transport, and that these services will be highly people-intensive for decades to come. the bank teller or shop assistant may be rightly fearful that technology will disintermediate their role, but a prison custody officer can sleep soundly in the knowledge that his or her skills will be required for years to come. risk management is central to our thinking at both a strategic and an operational level. but, more broadly, when governments are considering awarding us an important project, the fact that other governments trust us to help them manage some of their most critical and secret areas of national security infrastructure is helpful in building confidence. how should we treat services provided by government-owned agencies operating on an arm’s-length basis? “working at the leading edge of technology” may be inspiring to people working for it businesses, but they are not reasons why a prison officer makes a cup of tea for a suicidal prisoner at two o’clock in the morning; why a housing officer leaves the comfort of an office to guide a nervous asylum seeker’s child to school on their first day; why an engineer crawls into that impossibly small space in the foetid bowels of an aircraft-carrier to make sure the cable-ties are secured just right so they will stay in place in storm or battle. this is why our values of trust, care, innovation and pride are so important. when we launched the plan, it was conceived that growth would refer to both revenues and profit. our business continued our ambition to be a superb provider of public services by being the best-managed

phase: • we have successfully strengthened our balance sheet, following the rights issue completed in april 2015 and the disposal of our private sector bpo business; together these raised over £700m, and our net debt: ebitda now stands at 1.4x, with period-end net debt reduced from £745m at the end of 2013 to £141m at the end of 2017. • we have made further excellent progress rebuilding confidence and trust with our major customers, in large part due to greatly improved operational performance. importantly, our cost reduction also includes over £100m removed through our programmes to deliver savings by reducing the number of management layers, implementing better procurement and driving greater efficiency in the operation of shared services. definition trading profit is defined as ifrs operating profit adjusted for (i) amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on acquisition and (ii) exceptional items; it includes the impact of discontinued operations for consistency with previous disclosures. information on our carbon emissions that was presented in this section in previous years can be found within our corporate responsibility report on pages 69 to 84. a large number

exceeds our target which was set at 0.23. this indicator has been impacted by increasing numbers of physical assaults and particularly serious physical assaults within our justice & immigration business. definition we partner with aon hewitt to run viewpoint, our global employee engagement survey. this covers all employees, excluding our joint ventures, and focuses on three key areas: whether people say positive things about working at serco (‘say’), people’s intention to stay with serco (‘stay’) and their intention to give discretionary effort (‘strive’). performance 2017’s viewpoint survey, which is based on some 31,000 employees responding, showed a fourth successive year of improvement in our global score. material controls: • serco group strategy focusing on specific

information security breach resulting in the loss or compromise of sensitive information (including personal or customer) or wilful damage resulting in the loss of service, causing significant reputational damage, financial penalties and loss of customer confidence. key risk drivers: ineffective procurement and supply chain governance – no group functional owner for procurement resulting in inconsistencies in implementation of standards, potential non- compliance to those standards and lack of consequence management for non-compliance. lack of resilience in the supply chain – exposing us to potential service provision or financial losses should they have ineffective business continuity and disaster recovery plans. key risk drivers: lack of capability and experience – if our chosen market sectors are not aligned to our capability and experience, then a failure to operate optimally may result in a serious event. this may result in significant financial penalties, an impact on existing contracts and serco being subject to a period of discretionary debarment from future contracts with uk government entities; or • that the sfo and the relevant serco entities enter into a deferred prosecution agreement (dpa) – which may result in significant financial penalties and a period of discretionary debarment from future contracts with uk government entities. if the group faces any criminal convictions, debarment consequences or enters into a dpa, any such outcome could result in significant fines and have a material adverse impact on the group’s ability to contract with the uk government and on its reputation, which would, in turn, materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, operations and prospects. serco group plc annual report and accounts 2017 28 material changes to principal risks failure of business critical partners, sub-contractor or supplier following the 2017 november group risk committee meeting, this new risk was proposed and accepted by the board. both of these areas have had a significant focus over the last few years and the positive impacts of these are being seen (our key risk indicators (kris) demonstrate that our residual risk is decreasing in both areas). in doing so, it is recognised that such future assessments are subject to a level of uncertainty that increases further out in time and, therefore, future outcomes cannot be guaranteed or predicted with certainty. in addition, as well as the attrition impact from profitable contracts coming to an end, some of the new contracts added revenue growth in 2017 but were at reduced profitability due to their initial transition and transformation stages. first, there was a £15.8m net charge (2016: net release of £14.2m) within trading profit arising from the review of onerous contract provisions (ocps) and other contract & balance sheet review items; the ocp adjustments comprised gross charges totalling £62m (2016: £56m), partially offset by gross releases totalling £43m (2016: £66m). at the closing balance sheet date, our leverage for debt covenant purposes was 1.4x ebitda (2016: 0.7x), which compares with the covenant requirement to be less than 3.5x and remains well within our medium term target range of 1–2x. more detailed analysis of earnings, cash flow, financing and related matters are described further in the finance review. within our operating framework, we insist that all our management initiatives fit into one or more of four categories: winning good business, executing brilliantly, making serco a place people are proud to work, and delivering profitability and sustainability. where we have exited contracts during the year, we have done so with pride and excellence, mindful of the military adage that you judge a battalion as much by how it leaves its barracks, as by how it arrives. where we have started new operations, which have involved the transition and recruitment of several thousand employees, again i am pleased with the serco group plc annual report and accounts 2017 36 skill of our operational managers. where we are making losses on contracts, we are resolute in still delivering what is required of us to appropriately serve our customers and service users; and while doing so, working to improve the financial performance of individual contracts. our guidance, as set out in more detail below, includes that we expect underlying trading profit to grow over the next two years, and this will be driven largely by further transformation savings. over that period, we are in particular looking to transform our it systems, capabilities and structures. serco employs (including our joint venture operations) over 50,000 people, the vast majority delivering services to customers. some 200 out of 300 senior managers have completed our highly tailored oxford saïd serco management course. this is the largest order intake since 2012, and represents a book-to- bill ratio of approximately 115%. in 2019, it increases to around £700m, with australian immigration services, the dubai metro, one of our us navy installation contracts and compass all due for rebid or potential extension. it should also be remembered that in the americas division in particular, we have numerous arrangements which are classed as ‘idiq’ – indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity – which are essentially framework agreements under which the customer issues task orders one at a time; chief executive's review continued serco group plc annual report and accounts 2017 38 whilst the ultimate value of such an agreement may be very large and run over many years, a value is only recorded in our order book as individual task orders are contracted, and few of them would appear in the pipeline as they tend to be individually less than £10m and contracted on short lead times. there is a very real risk that this will make the uk government more than normally cautious in dealing with its suppliers. the possible consequences of these events are examined in more detail under ‘industry backdrop and concluding thoughts’, below. our guidance reflects latest currency rates, which now imply greater pressure from adverse currency impacts estimated at £5–6m for profit and £100–120m for revenue when compared to the average rates for 2017. as we have noted before in regard to our previous guidance, we reiterate that the range of potential outcomes is significantly wider than that implied by our budget’s central case, both to the upside and downside; this reflects serco’s relatively low margins and the sensitivity of our profits to even small changes in revenues and costs, as well as movements in currency. however, if serco enters into future contracts that have significant transition phases, this could result in a greater proportion of revenue and profit being recognised later on in the life of the contract than under previous accounting. the uk defence fire & risk management organisation (dfrmo) contract, which we are currently bidding, is one such. the rate of growth thereafter will be more dependent on our ability to grow revenues. so far, serco’s three-stage plan (stabilise – transform – grow), which we conceived in late 2014, has survived contact with the flow of events surprisingly well. at the same time, falling interest rates and increasing longevity sent pension deficits soaring. given the amount of contractual risk suppliers were carrying, that fragility was going to show itself sooner or later. clearly, both government and suppliers should take time to consider carefully the implications of recent events. there should also be far greater transparency of operational performance: except in exceptional circumstances, suppliers, be they private or government-owned, should be required to publish chief executive's review continued serco group plc annual report and accounts 2017 42 every six months their performance against key operational indicators, so they are held accountable for the delivery of their promises to the taxpayers who are paying for them and the users who they are serving. this would, for both government and supplier, significantly reduce the risk of being stuck together in unhappy marriages. serco presents alternative measures to include the revenue and trading profit of these discontinued operations in prior periods for consistency with previous disclosures. year ended 31 december 2017 £m uk&e americas aspac middle east corporate costs total revenue 1,334.7 688.0 579.0 351.9 – 2,953.6 change (3%) 0% (7%)

facilities management and environmental services. serco was unsuccessful in a large new bid opportunity to be prime contractor for us navy systems support, but has potential for a share of work through sub-contract relationships; there were no other major new pipeline decisions or large rebids or extensions due during the year. opportunities for immigration services were removed from the pipeline due to delays in tender processes. serco was pleased to announce in june 2017 that david j. dacquino would become chief executive officer of the americas division, with dan allen having informed the business back in february of his intention to retire. this reduction was driven by the end of the armidale class patrol boats (acpb), western australia court security & custodial services (wacscs) and mount eden contracts, together with some smaller reductions from other contracts ending or reducing in scope; there was some growth in citizen services contact and processing support which partially offset this attrition. while there was a favourable currency movement of £2.1m, the net of other movements reflected contract attrition and other margin pressures with only partial offset from progress on cost efficiencies and growth from new work. there were no other larger rebids or major new bid pipeline decisions made in the year. divisional reviews continued serco group plc annual report and accounts 2017 48 underlying trading profit was £16.2m (2016: £16.6m), representing a margin of 4.6% (2016: 5.1%). there is a high proportion of work to secure in 2019, when the dubai metro, melabs and cleveland clinic abu dhabi contracts each require extending or rebidding; by 2020, our dubai air navigation services will also become due for further extension or rebid. this includes the unavoidable costs of servicing contracts and all costs that a contract would incur purely on its own without a parent company, regardless of how those services are delivered within the wider group, such as it or human resource management services provided centrally. in general, apms are presented externally to meet investors’ requirements for further clarity and transparency of the

group uses an alternative measure, underlying trading profit, to make adjustments for unusual items that occur within trading profit and remove the impact of historical issues. it should be noted that, as for operating profit, utp benefits from ocp utilisation of £69.3m in 2017 (2016: £84.2m) which neutralises the in-year losses on previously identified onerous contracts, therefore it is only charges or releases of ocps that are adjusted for. no such material one-time items occurred in 2017. underlying trading margin is calculated as utp divided by revenue from continuing and discontinued operations. this aids consistency with historical results, and enables performance to be evaluated before the unusual or one-time effects described above. as trading cash flow was an outflow in 2016, a conversion percentage of utp is not presented. trading profit for the year ended 31 december 2016 included a loss on discontinued operations of £3.3m. these costs have historically been treated as exceptional and consistent treatment is applied in 2017. financial statements directors’ report strategic report 59 strategic report finance review continued other exceptional operating items continued there were releases of provisions of £0.4m (2016: £0.6m) which were previously charged through exceptional items in relation to the exit of the uk frontline clinical health contracts. serco sodexo defence services pty ltd was previously a 50% owned joint venture accounted for on an equity accounting basis. this is only partially offset by the downward impact of our joint ventures whose post-tax results are included in our pre-tax profit and additional deferred tax assets that have been recognised in relation to historic uk losses. treasury operations and risk management the group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include liquidity, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and credit risk. interest on the revolving credit facility is at floating rate, however it was undrawn. further details of these movements are provided in the cash flow and net debt sections above. further details on this post year-end transaction are provided in note 40 to the consolidated financial statements. we have structured it around our key stakeholders – underpinned by our values, purpose and public service ethos – focusing in particular on how we work to add sustainable value whilst delivering their requirements with accountability and transparency. at the same time, however, we recognise enduring challenges that, whilst not exclusive to serco, are high priority issues for our business and customers. they help to ensure we are all working from a commonly understood base that can be consistently applied across our organisation. we recognise our obligations under the uk modern slavery act 2015, publish an annual modern slavery statement on www.serco.com and do not engage in any form of human trafficking or use forced, bonded, illegal or child labour, nor knowingly work with anyone who does. additionally, in the uk we piloted an abc assessment tool to review contracts against required adequate procedures. this figure reflects the average paid to men and women across our uk businesses. where we have control, activities are managed locally, covering a wide range of initiatives focused on reducing our carbon emissions intensity, improving energy and fuel efficiency, improving our waste management processes and promoting biodiversity. corporate responsibility continued serco group plc annual report

committees until her retirement from the board on 15 september 2017: nomination committee, remuneration committee and the corporate responsibility committee. in addition, angie risley notified the board of her intention to step down with effect from 15 september. the committee's aim in 2017 was to challenge serco’s capabilities for assessing and managing risk. internal controls and key processes are defined within the serco management system (sms) together with clear definitions of those individuals responsible for ensuring compliance. self-assessment recipients are now working to address any gaps identified, through the completion of action plans. key themes and management action progress have been included in regular written updates to the audit committee. the services of an external search consultant, lygon group, were retained to assist in identifying potential candidates. serco will always seek to appoint board members and senior management on merit against objective criteria, including diversity. i would like to thank angie risley, who stepped down when she left the board, for her valued contribution over a number of years. meetings are arranged to ensure sufficient time is available for the discussion of all items. it is company policy that any such unresolved concern must be recorded in the board minutes. during 2017, the board received briefings from their advisers of relevant topics designed to update directors’ skills and knowledge in particular areas. a number of the non-executive directors also undertook a programme of individual contract visits and divisional management meetings to support familiarity with the group’s operations, and visit reports were shared with all board members. b.6 evaluation in 2017, performance evaluations of the board, its committees and individual directors were carried out internally. external evaluation last took place in early 2015 and it is the board’s intention to carry out an externally facilitated evaluation in 2018. b.7 election/re-election each director is subject to election at the first agm following their appointment, and re- election at each subsequent agm. accordingly lynne peacock, ian

information serco group plc (the company) is a company incorporated in the united kingdom under the companies act 2006. the address of the registered office is serco house, 16 bartley wood business park, bartley way, hook, hampshire, rg27 9uy. this includes the unavoidable costs of servicing contracts and all costs that a contract would incur purely on its own without a parent company, regardless of how those services are delivered within the wider group, such as it or human resource management services provided centrally. where any price step downs are required in a contract accounted for under the output basis and output is not decreasing, revenue will require deferral from initial years to subsequent years in order for revenue to be recognised on a consistent basis. dividend income from investments is recognised when the right to receive payment has been established. as a result, revenue recognised in prior years for certain contracts will be deferred under ifrs15. ifrs15 provides clear guidance on variable income unlike ias18 and two areas may be impacted as a result. serco group plc annual report and accounts 2017 168 while each of these areas requires a high level of judgement, only long term contract accounting could have a significant impact on the group’s financial results or position. dividend income from investments is recognised when the right to receive payment has been established. exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised directly within equity in the group’s hedging and translation reserve. changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised. determining whether joint control exists requires a level of judgement, based upon specific facts and circumstances which exist at the year end. the fair values associated with material business combinations are valued by external advisers and any amount of consideration which is contingent in nature is evaluated at the end of each reporting period, based on internal forecasts. serco group plc annual report and accounts 2017 170 development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset only if all of certain conditions are met, with all research costs and other development expenditure being expensed when incurred. subsequent actuarial gains and losses in relation to the group’s share of pension obligations are recognised within other comprehensive income. serco group plc annual report and accounts 2017 172 cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity. financial statements 173 strategic report directors’ report financial statements notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2. significant accounting policies continued trade receivables trade receivables are recognised initially at cost (being the same as fair value) and subsequently at amortised cost less any provision for impairment, to ensure that amounts recognised represent the recoverable amount. a provision for impairment arises where there is evidence that the group will not be able to collect amounts due, which is achieved by creating an allowance for doubtful debts recognised in the income statement within administrative expenses. determining whether a trade receivable is impaired requires judgement to be applied based on the information available at each reporting date. subsequent recoveries of amounts previously provided for or written off are credited against administrative expenses. further details are provided in note 2. use of alternative performance measures: operating profit before exceptional items ias1 requires material items to be disclosed separately in a way that enables users to assess the quality of a company’s profitability. in practice, these are commonly referred to as ‘exceptional’ items, but this is not a concept defined by ifrs and therefore there is a level of judgement involved in arriving at an alternative performance measure which excludes such exceptional items. at each reporting period an assessment is performed in order to determine whether there are any such indicators, which involves considering the performance of our business and any significant changes to the markets in which we operate. discount rates used for internal purposes are post tax rates, however for the purpose of impairment testing in accordance with ias36 impairment of assets we calculate a pre-tax rate based on post tax targets. • no pension assets are invested in the group’s own financial instruments or property. aweml is not liable for any deficiency in the defined benefit pension scheme under current contractual arrangements. aweml is not liable for any deficiency in the

are material to the results of the group either by virtue of size or nature. further information regarding the exceptional items arising on discontinued operations in 2016 can be seen in note 4. exceptional gain on disposal of subsidiaries and operations the exceptional net gain on disposals is included in note 9. other exceptional operating items arising on continuing operations for the year ended 31 december 2017 £m 2016 £m impairment of goodwill – (17.8) restructuring costs (28.6) (17.2) aborted transaction costs – (0.1) costs associated with uk government review (0.4) (0.1) release of

impairment of aspac customer lists (6.1) – other exceptional operating items (19.9) (59.2) goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that there is a risk that it could be impaired. the recoverable amount of each cash generating unit (cgu) is based on value in use calculations derived from forecast cash flows based on past experience, adjusted to reflect market trends, economic conditions, the group’s strategy and key risks. the average number of persons employed includes all permanent employees and those with fixed term contracts. contingent assets of £5.5m (2016: £5.6m) are held within current other receivables in relation to insurance claims where it is probable that the group will receive future payments. the levels are as follows: level 1: inputs derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 32 (d) foreign exchange risk i) transactional it is the group’s policy to hedge material transactional exposures using forward foreign exchange contracts to fix the functional currency value of non-functional currency cash flows. if matched funding is not possible, currency derivatives may be used to protect against movements in foreign exchange. these derivatives are hedging highly probable forecast foreign currency trade payments in the uk business. the net notional amounts are summarised by currency below: 2017 £m 2016 £m sterling (9.4) (7.0) us dollar 0.6 3.2 euro – 4.2 indian rupee 9.2 – serco group plc annual report and accounts 2017 210 all derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are highly effective and as at 31 december 2017 a net fair value loss of £0.7m (2016: £0.5m) has been deferred in the hedging reserve. however, where the assessed credit worthiness of a customer, government or non-government, falls below that considered acceptable, appropriate measures are taken to mitigate against the risk of contractual default using instruments such as credit guarantees. at 31 december 2017, the company has issued guarantees in respect of certain joint ventures and associates as per note 31. as a result of the splas’s investment strategy, which aims to reduce volatility risk by better matching assets to liabilities, 45% of the scheme’s assets are annuity policies and 55% are liability driven investments (ldis). the value of these investments vary in line with gilt yields, which has decreased from 2.65% p.a. iii) values recognised in total comprehensive income in the year the amounts recognised in the financial statements for the year are analysed

actuarial assumptions: splas the assumptions set out below are for splas, which reflects 92% of total liabilities and 94% of total assets of the defined benefit pension scheme in which the group participates. the expected yield on bond investments with fixed interest rates is derived from their market value. the yield on equity investments contains an additional premium (an ‘equity risk premium’) to compensate investors for the additional anticipated risks of holding this type of investment, when compared to bond yields. cash contributions are recognised as pension costs and no asset or liability is shown on the balance sheet. there were no new options granted under executive option plan during the year and all shares are now vested. this approach has also been used for the awards made with no performance conditions attached to them. the only loan amounts owed by joint ventures or associates related to a single entity which have been provided for in full (see note 11). serco
