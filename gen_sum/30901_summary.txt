Our success therefore is dependent on how well we  select, manage, organise, motivate, develop and engage  the people who work for Serco. Every year we run a  detailed ‘Viewpoint’ employee survey to gauge how well  our colleagues think we are doing, and I am delighted to  say that, for the fourth successive year, the aggregated  measure of ‘employee engagement’ improved again in  2017, with some 31,000 people responding. As we have said previously, the rate of growth  thereafter will be more dependent on our ability to  grow revenues. We focus our activities in five areas of government  service: Defence, Justice & Immigration, Transport,  Health and Citizen Services. We believe that the market  will continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate than  previously, because of two fundamental truths. The challenge facing governments worldwide can, like  our strategy, be simply expressed: to deliver more, and  better, for less. • We have made further excellent progress rebuilding  confidence and trust with our major customers,  in large part due to greatly improved operational  performance. Performance 2017’s Viewpoint survey, which is based on some 31,000 employees  responding, showed a fourth successive year of improvement in  our global score. Lack of resilience in the supply chain – exposing  us to potential service provision or financial losses  should they have ineffective Business Continuity and  Disaster Recovery plans. This may result in significant financial penalties, an impact on existing contracts and  Serco being subject to a period of discretionary debarment from future contracts with UK Government entities; or • that the SFO and the relevant Serco entities enter into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) – which may  result in significant financial penalties and a period of discretionary debarment from future contracts with UK  Government entities. Our guidance, as set out in more detail below,  includes that we expect Underlying Trading Profit to  grow over the next two years, and this will be driven  largely by further transformation savings. In 2019, it  increases to around £700m, with Australian immigration  services, the Dubai Metro, one of our US Navy  installation contracts and COMPASS all due for rebid  or potential extension. It should also be  remembered that in the Americas division in particular,  we have numerous arrangements which are classed  as ‘IDIQ’ – Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity –  which are essentially framework agreements under  which the customer issues task orders one at a time;  Chief Executive's Review continued Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 38 whilst the ultimate value of such an agreement may  be very large and run over many years, a value is only  recorded in our order book as individual task orders  are contracted, and few of them would appear in the  pipeline as they tend to be individually less than £10m  and contracted on short lead times. There is a very real risk that  this will make the UK Government more than normally  cautious in dealing with its suppliers. The possible consequences of these events are  examined in more detail under ‘Industry Backdrop and  Concluding Thoughts’, below. So far, Serco’s  three-stage plan (Stabilise – Transform – Grow), which  we conceived in late 2014, has survived contact with  the flow of events surprisingly well. Given the amount  of contractual risk suppliers were carrying, that fragility  was going to show itself sooner or later. There should also be far greater transparency of  operational performance: except in exceptional  circumstances, suppliers, be they private or  Government-owned, should be required to publish  Chief Executive's Review continued Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 42 every six months their performance against key  operational indicators, so they are held accountable  for the delivery of their promises to the taxpayers  who are paying for them and the users who they  are serving. Serco presents alternative measures to  include the Revenue and Trading Profit of these discontinued operations in prior periods for consistency with previous  disclosures. We have partially  reloaded the pipeline with some other smaller tenders for  various defence support, hospital facilities management  and environmental services. Serco was unsuccessful in a  large new bid opportunity to be prime contractor for  US Navy systems support, but has potential for a share  of work through sub-contract relationships; there were  no other major new pipeline decisions or large rebids  or extensions due during the year. This  reduction was driven by the end of the Armidale Class  Patrol Boats (ACPB), Western Australia Court Security  & Custodial Services (WACSCS) and Mount Eden  contracts, together with some smaller reductions from  other contracts ending or reducing in scope; there was  some growth in Citizen Services contact and processing  support which partially offset this attrition. This includes the unavoidable costs of servicing  contracts and all costs that a contract would incur purely on its  own without a parent company, regardless of how those services  are delivered within the wider Group, such as IT or Human  Resource management services provided centrally. In general, APMs are presented externally to meet investors’  requirements for further clarity and transparency of the Group’s  financial performance. This aids consistency with historical  results, and enables performance to be evaluated  before the unusual or one-time effects described  above. Serco Sodexo Defence  Services Pty Ltd was previously a 50% owned joint venture  accounted for on an equity accounting basis. We have continued to build momentum in long-term  objectives for sustainable improvement – consolidating  progress and maintaining our key strategies. At the  same time, however, we recognise enduring challenges  that, whilst not exclusive to Serco, are high priority  issues for our business and customers. They help to ensure we are all working from a commonly  understood base that can be consistently applied  across our organisation. In Saudi Arabia, our colleague, Miko Baay, received a  Global Pulse Award for helping to rescue 270 stranded  train passengers on his day off. In 2017, we have continued to enable the achievement  of enhanced social outcomes through consistent, well- managed and continuously improving frontline services. • Health: We have helped to enhance patient  experiences and maintain safer environments  in hospitals through the provision of facilities  management services. We strive for early line of sight regarding  increases in threat or exposure, and maintain a robust  control environment that reduces negative impacts to  our business performance. Internal controls and key processes are defined within  the Serco Management System (SMS) together with  clear definitions of those individuals responsible  for ensuring compliance. I would like  to thank Angie Risley, who stepped down when she  left the Board, for her valued contribution over a  number of years. During 2017, the Board received briefings  from their advisers of relevant topics  designed to update Directors’ skills and  knowledge in particular areas. Non-Executive Directors of the Group are initially appointed for a  three-year term, and that appointment may be terminated on three months’ written notice. Holding  requirement Vested shares from the PSP must be held for two years post vesting   (after payment of tax). Full retrospective disclosure will be made of any details that are withheld once this information is no  longer deemed commercially sensitive by the Committee. The balance of fixed to variable pay also  ensures that significant reward is only delivered for exceptional performance. As the cost of  providing such benefits varies  based on market rates and  other factors, there is no formal  maximum monetary value. For existing Executive Directors the unvested share awards in respect of deferred  annual bonus will vest without time pro-rating. In such circumstances, awards vesting will normally be prorated on a time apportioned  basis, unless the Committee determines otherwise.

Ed Casey’s 2017 benefits relate primarily to  his expatriate status, including costs of £87,489 for accommodation while in the UK. Payments  under the 2017 annual bonus were subject to an Underlying Trading Profit underpin (after adjustment for in-year  Onerous Contract Provisions (OCP) items) of £60.4m at constant currency rates. The main difference  between the two years is that in 2016 there was an £11.8m net credit to Trading Profit related to Onerous Contract  Provisions charges and releases which were excluded from Trading Profit for bonus purposes, whilst in 2017 there  was a debit of £19.5m similarly excluded. of shares  vesting Vesting date Share price   at vest Value   at vest Rupert  Soames TSR (40%) 27 June 2014 153,953 – 27 June 2017 £1.192 £0 Strategic Objectives (20%) 76,977 76,977 £90,232 Angus  Cockburn TSR (40%) 31 October 2014 112,714 – 31 October 2017 £1.166 £0 Strategic Objectives (20%) 56,356 56,356 £64,584 Note: 1 The number of shares under award was adjusted on the Rights Issue in 2015.

Within the US business there exists a Political  Action Committee (PAC), which is funded entirely  by employees and their spouses.

Where any price step downs are required in a contract accounted for under the output basis and output is not  decreasing, revenue will require deferral from initial years to subsequent years in order for revenue to be recognised on a consistent basis. Determining whether joint control exists requires a level of judgement, based upon specific facts and circumstances which exist at the year  end. Subsequent actuarial gains and losses in relation to the Group’s share of pension obligations are recognised within Other  Comprehensive Income. Determining whether a  trade receivable is impaired requires judgement to be applied based on the information available at each reporting date.
