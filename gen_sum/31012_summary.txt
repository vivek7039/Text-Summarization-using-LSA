investors with a means of evaluating performance of the group on a consistent basis, similar to the way in which management evaluates performance, that is not otherwise apparent on an ifrs basis, given that certain non-recurring, infrequent or non-cash items that management does not believe are indicative of the underlying operating performance of the group are included when preparing financial measures under ifrs. once considered to be probable, management reviews each material tax benefit to assess whether a provision should be taken against full recognition of the benefit on the basis of potential settlement through negotiation and/or litigation. the group makes appropriate provision on a consistent basis for risks of product liability, litigation, restructuring, credit risk and other normal trading exposures with estimates being made regarding the timing of future payments; and • note 22 – defined benefit pension obligations. the carrying values of intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. costs that are directly associated with the implementation of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. in determining estimated fair value, investments are valued at quoted bid prices on the trade date. after initial recognition, borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. the business has broad capabilities ranging from printed circuit board assembly to environmental test and full systems integration. this global suite of end-to-end solutions is focused exclusively on low volume, high mix business. alternative performance measures are presented in these financial statements as management believes they provide investors with a means of evaluating performance of the group on a consistent basis, similar to the way in which management evaluates performance, that is not otherwise apparent on an ifrs basis, given that certain non-recurring, infrequent or non-cash items that management does not believe are indicative of the underlying operating performance of the group are included when preparing financial measures under ifrs. if a company’s actual performance does not meet these projections, this could lead to an impairment of the goodwill in future periods. notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 118 tt electronics plc annual report and accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com 16 inventories £million 2017 2016 raw materials 30.5 40.1 work in progress 16.1 18.5 finished goods 12.5 21.0 59.1 79.6 inventories are stated after deduction of a provision for slow moving and obsolete items of £20.1 million (2016: £28.8 million). provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent management’s best estimate of the likely outcome. no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties against group companies unless management, taking into account professional advice received, assesses that it is more likely than not that such proceedings may be successful. the group’s accounting policies with regard to financial instruments are detailed in note 2(p). to mitigate transactional foreign exchange risk, wherever possible, group companies enter into transactions in their functional currencies with customers and suppliers. when this is not possible, hedging strategies are undertaken through the use of forward currency contracts for up to one year ahead. customer credit risk is managed by each operating company within a division but is subject to group oversight to ensure that each division’s customer credit risk management system operates in a prudent and responsible manner. credit risk arising from balances with banks and financial institutions is monitored by the group’s treasury department. in addition, ifrs 13 requires financial instruments not measured at fair value, but for which fair value is disclosed, to be analysed in the same fair value hierarchy: • level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; • level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and • level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs). • a prudent investment strategy is pursued by seeking risk-rewarded long-term returns whilst removing the majority of liability mismatching unrewarded risks. derivatives include liability driven instruments taken out to hedge part of the scheme inflation and interest rate risks. amounts recognised in the consolidated income statement are: £million 2017 2016 scheme administration costs 1.2 1.2 past service credit (non-underlying) (2.3) – net interest cost 0.1 0.7 settlements and curtailments – (0.6) the actual return on scheme assets was a gain of £33.2 million (2016: gain of £122.7 million). on 18 march 2015 50,000 shares were granted to a senior executive which will ultimately be settled in cash. the group will also acquire net debt of circa £11.8 million as at 31 december 2017. notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 134 tt electronics plc
