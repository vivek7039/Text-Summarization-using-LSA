During the year, there were seven principal Board meetings on scheduled dates, for which full notice was given. There is an agreed procedure for any individual Director to take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense if they consider it necessary. This also provided an opportunity to discuss any issues which had arisen from either their individual assessments or those of the Board and its principal committees. Management accounts are prepared monthly by each operating company comparing actual performance with budget, forecast and prior year. This states that we may obtain non-audit services from the most appropriate source, having regard to expertise, availability, knowledge and cost. Our improved customer focus is reflected in a number of new contract wins (see page 8 and pages 30 to 35).

The carrying values of intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. The business has broad capabilities ranging from printed circuit board assembly to environmental test and full systems integration. If a company’s actual performance does not meet these projections, this could lead to an impairment of the goodwill in future periods. To mitigate transactional foreign exchange risk, wherever possible, Group companies enter into transactions in their functional currencies with customers and suppliers. When this is not possible, hedging strategies are undertaken through the use of forward currency contracts for up to one year ahead. Credit risk arising from balances with banks and financial institutions is monitored by the Group’s Treasury department. • A prudent investment strategy is pursued by seeking risk-rewarded long-term returns whilst removing the majority of liability mismatching unrewarded risks. Derivatives include liability driven instruments taken out to hedge part of the scheme inflation and interest rate risks.
