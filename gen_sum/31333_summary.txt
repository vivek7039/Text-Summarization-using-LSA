Tanning Technologies ∙ Successful scale trials with leading European tanneries; focus on completing engineering solutions to facilitate technology incorporation in existing tannery processes. Saving up to 80% water and nearly 50% electricity are metrics that really resonate with South Africans, who are facing rising water costs.” Charl De Beer Founder fanute hospitality solutions 06 Report for the period ending 31 December 2017 Xeros Technology Group plc This has been another year of considerable progress at Xeros. The development of Textile Technologies, which we started in mid-2016, is now delivering comparable water and chemistry savings to those achieved by our other applications. Their loyalty, combined with the continued commitment and dedication of our employees, has taken us to this point. The application of Xeros’ technology significantly reduces harmful contamination in firefighters’ expensive Personal Protective Equipment (“PPE”) whilst simultaneously extending its life. Our objective in doing so was to start meaningful discussions with major OEMs, which are now underway. I am most impressed with the customer service at Xeros, they truly value their customers. We are now progressively commercialising applications in these sectors to generate profitable returns, leveraging our intellectual property and know-how with low capital requirements. We have established that our technologies can deliver these benefits in three world-scale industries: cleaning, tanning and textiles. We are now progressively commercialising applications in these sectors to generate profitable returns, leveraging our intellectual property and know-how with low capital requirements. Given the scale of the markets in which we operate, our strategy is to commercialise our technology with partners who already have strong international market positions and who also demonstrate a strategic intent to deliver increased levels of sustainability. Chief Executive Officer’s review 09 Xeros Technology Group plc Report for the period ending 31 December 2017 Operating review Cleaning Technologies High Performance Workwear Having extensively trialled our technology in the high added value Personal Protective Equipment (“PPE”) market during 2017, we entered this market with the acquisition of Marken PPE Restoration’s operations in Nevada in July 2017. The ability of Xeros’ technology to significantly outperform conventional cleaning technologies, coupled with major cost savings from extending the life of expensive PPE garments, puts Xeros in a unique position to create high added value for our customers and our shareholders. Similar to High Performance Workwear, we have demonstrated that Xeros’ technology can improve cleaning results whilst simultaneously making garments look better for longer. Hotel & Lodging We entered the US market in 2013 with our own brand machines and an ‘all requirements’ multi-year contract package, which was sold and delivered by our own staff in combination with ‘Forward Channel Partners’. Following this demonstration, we are currently working with two major OEMs on the testing and validation of Xeros’ technology inside their own branded machines. The objective being to have these companies marketing, selling and servicing machines incorporating Xeros’ technology through their own well-established channels. 10 Chief Executive Officer’s review continued Report for the period ending 31 December 2017 Xeros Technology Group plc Simultaneously, we have signed agreements with Forward Channel Partners in Australia, UAE and South Africa, who will market, sell and provide the full set of services for Xeros enabled machines. Xeros is now actively developing opportunities for the licensing of its Cleaning Technologies in China. Our plan in this application is for Xeros to make a financial return on its intellectual property and know-how with relatively low capital intensity. These developments are a significant step forward for transitioning tanneries from trials to contract and implementation. Our business model for this industry is one of sharing gains with customers under long-term contracts. We are currently focused on commercialising our technology in the Retanning and Dyeing stages which use large volumes of water to apply specialty chemicals. We have now successfully demonstrated that Xeros’ technology has the capacity to deliver water, chemistry, energy and effluent reductions which at least match performance outcomes in our other selected applications. One example being the plan for “Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals by 2020” which has 23 global clothing brands as signatories. All our novel polymer and engineering developments are underpinned by Intellectual Property and in the 15 months to the end of March 2018 we increased our ‘pending’ or ‘granted’ patent families by seven to a total of 48. Outlook With the development of our Cleaning and Tanning Technologies materially completed during 2017, Xeros is now focused on their commercialisation. The Group does not recognise revenue and costs from a machine sale until all of these aspects are complete. As the Group’s commercial activities have expanded this average contract period reflects normal trading terms. This R&D spend was all expensed during the period as it represents Group expenditure on Textiles, Domestic laundry development and Tanning engineering development, none of which yet meet the full criteria for capitalisation of these costs in accordance with IAS 38. When these business areas are deemed to have met the IAS 38 capitalisation criteria ongoing development costs will be capitalised. After adjusting for Marken and the impact of foreign exchange, underlying administrative expenses increased from £26.4m (17 months ending 31 December 2016) to £28.3m. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the loss on ordinary activities before interest, tax, share-based payment expense, non-operating exceptional costs, depreciation and amortisation. Its patented technologies have the capacity to provide material economic, operational and sustainability improvements that are unattainable with traditional processes. Certain qualitative measures, such as the performance of product development initiatives, are also monitored on a regular basis. There can be no assurance that others have not developed or will not develop similar products, duplicate any of the Group’s products or design around any patent applications held by the Group. Any claims made against the Group’s intellectual property rights, even without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could have a materially detrimental effect on the Group’s resources. There is no guarantee that the Group will be successful in its research and product development. The Group’s negotiating position in agreeing terms of either joint development, distribution, service or supply arrangements may be affected by its size and limited cash resources relative to potential development partners with substantial cash resources and established levels of commercial success. An inability to enter into or renew such arrangements on favourable terms, if at all, or disagreements between the Group and any of its potential partners could lead to delays in the Group’s commercialisation strategy. There are a number of operational, strategic and financial risks associated with such early stage companies. The Group has a limited operating history upon which its performance and prospects can be evaluated. Prior to joining Xeros, Mark led a number of technology start-ups in the cleantech arena.

The Company’s registered office is Unit 2, Evolution, Advanced Manufacturing Park, Whittle Way, Catcliffe, Rotherham, S60 5BL. At this stage in its development the Group is loss making and incurs operating cash outflows. Amortisation Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost of intangible assets less their estimated residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and is generally recognised in profit or loss. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually. Share based payments Certain employees and consultants (including Directors and senior executives) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments (“equity-settled transactions”). Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. In addition, all internal activities related to research and development of new products are continuously monitored by the Directors. It is not anticipated that any of the other new standards or interpretations will have a material impact.
