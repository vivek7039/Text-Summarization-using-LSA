5 GGR means gross gaming revenue, being total bets placed by players less winnings paid to them. Strategic progress Stride’s progress during the year has continued to be underpinned by the Group’s first-class proprietary technology, leading business intelligence capabilities and clear focus on operating in markets where it is legal to do so. This investment gives the Group an entry into a rapidly growing market with enormous potential for profitable growth. This has been a very busy year for the Group as we have integrated acquisitions, launched new products and adapted to regulatory changes whilst still delivering strong organic growth. We plan to execute this growth strategy by continuing to develop our proprietary gaming platform, investing in our skilled and dynamic team and focusing on operating only in regulated or legal markets. In line with the Group’s strategic focus, Real Money Gaming NGR generated from Stride’s proprietary platform increased by 39% to £48.6 million, accounting for 54% of Group revenue (2016: pro-forma of 31% to £34.9 million accounting for 45% and reported: 73%). • Continued strong organic growth • Excellent performance with NGR from Real Money Gaming increasing by 39% • Significant progress made with the integrations of 8Ball, Netboost and Tarco • 29% growth in yield per player reported at £147 • Enter 2018 in a strengthened position to continue upward trajectory Clear growth strategy * Based on H2 Gaming Commission research report showing market size of £600 million based on net gaming revenue. Regulation, responsibility and compliance remain a major focus in the Group’s core UK market. We are confident of delivering further success in the year ahead and continued progress against our growth strategy. I would like to thank each and every one of my colleagues for their hard work during the year. Once again, we have demonstrated our ability to grow both organically and through acquisitions. This is being driven by strong deposit growth, with a stable yield per player.

High The Group procures legal and professional advice with regard to its activities in its principal countries of operation including any changes in legislation, and monitors updates on any potential future jurisdiction where it may start accepting customers. Impact on Group Likelihood of occurrence Risk assessment Risk levels Low Medium High Stride Gaming plc Annual report and financial statements 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT 14 Principal risks and uncertainties continued Risk Likelihood Issue Impact Mitigation Regulations continued General taxation Medium The Group currently operates across different jurisdictions in a tax environment which is constantly evolving. It is therefore important that the Group remains up to date with all changes affecting its tax position. This would have a lasting and damaging effect on the Group’s reputation, which can subsequently affect relationships with service providers, in particular the payment processing providers which could refuse our business going forward. For example, the system is designed to flag up immediately any unusual transactions such as high value and number of deposits in a day, deposits made in accounts which already have a significant balance and types of methods used for withdrawals especially where these differ from the deposit method. High IT policies, especially around security, are constantly monitored and reviewed to ensure compliance. Significant improvements in player engagement and monetisation across the Group’s brands helped deliver a strong overall performance. We anticipate some further margin improvement once acquisition earn-out periods conclude in the new financial year. This was stable year on year at 22% of NGR (2016: pro-forma 22%) despite the Group’s continued investment in talent, software development, business intelligence and products in line with our vision to build a leading online gaming business. Both of these amounts were settled post year end and therefore represent agreed balances. The Board believes that Adjusted basic earnings per share (excluding exceptional items such as impairment, contingent remuneration and consideration, acquisition costs, amortisation of intangible assets excluding those arising from internal development, share-based payments and associated taxes) enables a better understanding of the underlying business performance.

The Committee has taken into account market data when setting remuneration levels, positioning Executives’ pay at a broadly mid-market level relative to similarly sized AIM-listed companies, as well as those from the gaming sector. Service agreements The Executive Directors’ service agreements provide that their employment with the Company is on a rolling basis, subject to written notice being served by either party of not less than six months. No bonus would be payable in the event of an Executive Director’s resignation. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Stride Gaming plc Annual report and financial statements 2017 32 Independent auditor’s report continued to the members of Stride Gaming Plc Matter How we addressed the matter in our audit Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets At 31 August 2017 goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to £57.7 million. As a result of this review management determined that the weaker than expected social gaming market had an adverse effect on the projected value in use of that social gaming cash generating unit and consequently these intangible assets have been written down to their assessed value in use. Where work was performed by component auditors we determined the level of involvement we needed at those reporting units to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. Key audit matters continued Annual report and financial statements 2017 Stride Gaming plc 33 Matters on which we are required to report by exception We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: • proper accounting records have not been kept, or proper returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or • the consolidated financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or • we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Annual report and financial statements 2017 Stride Gaming plc 39 1 Accounting policies Legal status Stride Gaming plc, which includes its subsidiaries and together forms the “Group”, is a public limited company incorporated in Jersey. Changes in accounting policies a) New standards, interpretations and amendments effective from 1 September 2016 Where relevant, new standards and amendments to existing IFRSs that have been published and are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 September 2016 have been adopted, but had no significant impact to the Group accounts. This has resulted in a revision of the boundary between fair value and amortised cost. Lifetime ECL will be recognised on assets for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. Additionally, the new requirements add specific guidance for multiple-element arrangements, contract costs and disclosures. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the profit or loss account. It is stated after deduction of certain bonuses, jackpots and prizes granted to players. Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the profit or loss account.

All financial liabilities are classified as amortised cost with the exception of contingent consideration which is at fair value through profit or loss. Available for sale Non-derivative financial assets not included in the above categories are classified as available for sale and comprise principally the Group’s strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities.
