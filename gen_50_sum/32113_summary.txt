through this we will maximise value for our shareholders by delivering long-term sustainable growth in earnings per share and cash flow. while there is much left to do, we made tangible progress across the year in key areas such as product offering, promotional effectiveness, brand perception, store standards and customer service. we are redressing this bias by substantially extending our offer in the hard flooring area to better reflect consumer tastes. as at the end of april 2017, we had refurbished an initial nine stores and they have achieved excellent sales growth post- refurbishment. further improving our reputation and being readily identified as a brand that customers can trust is vital to carpetright’s future success. we have supported this move with extensive brand sponsorship on uktv featuring lucy, who is a credible home improvement personality. customer research shows this activity is yielding positive results on brand metrics such as awareness, trust and consideration. trusted trader’ status for our recommended fitting service is another important element to improving brand perception and ‘making it easy’. ‘who we are’ also incorporates our new colleague uniform which was successfully rolled out last year to give teams a comfortable, contemporary identity. in carpet, we continue to strengthen our range authority as market leader, with a focus on all budgets, from £2.99 per square metre roll stock in our ‘essentials’ range through to outstanding quality wool carpets from british manufacturers such as westex, brintons and ulster. we have identified an opportunity to create exclusives that allow for differentiation of carpetright versus the independent sector and our national competitors. as a simple guide, where a store team delivers 15% or more interest free credit participation, 50% plus underlay penetration and 75% or more “highly satisfied” responses under ‘do we measure up?’ surveys, they can, on average, expect to deliver like-for-like sales growth 3% ahead of the total uk estate. undoubtedly – we cannot do anything about the economy, what government in its infinite wisdom throws at us or consumer confidence. i don’t have an ideal number, if the stores are making a contribution we want to keep them. an improved performance, with a profit growth and increasing market share, especially in hard flooring, whatever the economic conditions. the combination of volume and rate improvements led to cash gross profit in local currency terms increasing by 3.9%. 2017 £m 2016 £m underlying profit before tax 14.4

(rcf) and multi-option facilities (principally overdrafts) in a mixture of sterling and euro currencies. gross bank borrowings at the balance sheet date were £20.1m (fy16: £7.1m), being a combination drawn down from overdraft and revolving credit facilities. should an individual become disabled while working for the company, efforts are made to continue their employment and retraining is provided, if necessary. in 2016 we started using fuse as an additional communication tool, enabling us to reach all uk and roi colleagues instantly for the first time. so far 80% of colleagues have engaged with the platform, and, on average fuse receives 72,000 page views per day. we will review from time-to- time whether a specific human rights policy is needed in the future, over and above our existing policies. an external search consultancy is ordinarily used in relation to the appointment of both executive and non-executive directors. this is a new policy for the three years from the annual general meeting to be held in september 2017 and will be put to a binding shareholder vote at that meeting; and – our annual remuneration report, which sets out how our current remuneration policy has been implemented. this alignment is (or will be, if the new policy is adopted by shareholders) achieved through a combination of s etting appropriate performance targets, a retention period for vested lt ip awards and share ownership gu idelines which require executives to build up holdings of carpetright shares. these guidelines, whic h are reviewed at least annually, require executive directors t o build up and maintain a target holding having a value equal to the same multip le of base salary as awards are made under the ltip (150% for wilf walsh, 125% for neil page). neil page and wilf walsh have contracts of an indefinite term, subject to a 12 month notice pe riod. tax equalisation may also be considered if an executive is adversely affected by taxation due to their employm ent with the company. it is understood that this principally related to the absence of a two-year post-vesting holding period for ltips. the awards will vest according to performance against the cumulative underlying earnings per shar e, as set out below: cumulative underlying earnings per share over the performance period vesting level % of award that vests (on a straight line basis between points)

as chief executive on 21 jun e 2014, at which point lord harris ceased to fulfil that role. the company does not have agreements with any director or officer that would provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover, except that provisions in the company’s share plans may cause options and awards granted under such plans to vest on a takeover. shareholders’ views there is a formal investor relations programme based around the results presentations and interim management statements. all directors normally attend the annual general meeting and are available to

generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognised to the e xtent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available agains t which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffer impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of impa irment at each reporting date. the group has also reviewed any trading loss-making stores and provided for those leases considered to be o nerous. other key assumptions for pension obligations, including mortality rates, are based in part on current market conditions. the group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimat es of whether additional taxes will be due. this has no impact on the group statutory reported

(i) ltip under this scheme, participants may receive annual awards in the form of contingent entitlements to company shares. this analysis is then assessed for other factors such as performance improvement plans potential property deals or closure of nearby stores which should positively impact the poorer performing store.
