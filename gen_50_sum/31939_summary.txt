from our f&b clients due to exciting issuance partner relationships. i am very pleased to report that under tim’s leadership the company has excelled, with a clear strategy in place, accelerated growth, and in a strengthened position to capitalise on the sizeable market opportunity. both these uk contract announcements reinforce the clear competitive benefits our solutions deliver to leading retailers. in march 2017, the company signed a strategic partnership with tcc, a world leader in creating retail marketing programmes and long-term loyalty schemes, allowing eagle eye to extend its digital promotions offer into the european loyalty market. this meaningful uplift in redemptions is proof that eagle eye can successfully drive higher redemption rates through the power of digital. as part of this campaign, eagle eye formed a new partnership with the life cycle social advertising company, driftrock. working with each brand and their media agency the company has coordinated a number of promotions targeted by region using a combination of web landing pages, programmatic display, traditional advertising, game and dating apps plus social media lead ads. traditional methods which give 1% discounts and a “rear view” perspective on purchase behaviour are being replaced by digital alternatives. better , bigger , faster integrity our values by creating cool tech by being trusted

leverage his experience to ensure first class operations and delivery across eagle eye’s network of customers. we have introduced a new life skills training workshop based on the fundamental philosophy that people can benefit from understanding more about themselves, how they perform at their best and what triggers sub-optimal performance. performance improvements were made to support our growing tier 1 grocery volumes, while we extended reporting and relationship management capabilities for issuance partners. this increase in value and share for implementation fees reflects the progress made in deepening the group’s product offering within major accounts, particularly for our uk and international tier 1 grocer clients where implementation fees were £2.8m (2016: £0.7m). additionally, the group is committed to developing products for its customers on a set timeline. no assurance can be given that the group will develop further technologies or products which are patentable, that patents will be sufficiently broad in their scope to provide protection for the group’s intellectual property rights against third parties, or that patents will have been granted in all new territories which the group enters. patents pending or future patent applications may not be granted and the lack of any such patents may have a material adverse effect on the group’s ability to develop and market its proposed products. even if the group obtains patents, they may not be valid or enforceable against others. the group ensures that employees are fully aware of financial and economic factors affecting its performance. in particular, it may impact the group’s ability to recruit suitably skilled staff for its uk-based operations. there can be no assurance that the group would be able to compensate or hedge against such adverse effects and therefore negative exchange rate movements could have a material adverse effect on the group’s business, prospects and financial performance. making every day your masterpiece governance 18 eagle eye solutions group plc annual report 2017 19 eagle eye solutions group plc annual report 2017 for more information, please visit:

criteria have been met for each of the activities as described below: development and set up fees are recognised on a percentage of completion basis using estimates. deferred tax liabilities are
