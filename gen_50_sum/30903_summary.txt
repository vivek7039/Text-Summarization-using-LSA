are required by ifrs 16. as at 31 december 2017, the group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of £30,333,000. cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. depreciation depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value of each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: leasehold premises leasehold improvements shorter of 7 years or life of lease computer equipment computer hardware 3 to 5 years fixtures and fittings 10 years motor vehicles 4 years the asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year end. for inventory acquired for retail sale the cost represents the purchase price plus overheads directly related to bringing inventory to its present location and condition and is measured on a first in first out basis. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. the following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: • pawnbroking, or pawn service charge (psc), comprises interest on pledge book loans, plus auction profit and loss, less any auction commissions payable and less surplus payable to the customer. all revenue is recognised at the point of sale; • pawnbroking scrap and gold purchasing comprises proceeds from gold scrap sales and is recognised on full receipt of sale proceeds; • personal loans comprise income from the group’s unsecured lending activities. employee share incentive plans the group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees (including directors). impairment of personal loans impairment is calculated using models which use historical payment performance to generate the estimated amount and timing of future cash flows from each arrears stage,

currently organised into six segments – pawnbroking, gold purchasing, retail, pawnbroking scrap, personal loans and other services. there were no fees payable to the company’s auditor and its associates in respect of associated pension schemes. this does not account for lost repeat business however, and as such the group sees more value in retaining a high redemption ratio. the investment of £43,091,000 in harvey & thompson limited was subsequently transferred to h& t group plc.
