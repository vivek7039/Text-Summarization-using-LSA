contracts used as hedging instruments for future incoming currency cash flows did not qualify for hedge accounting. in our encoder product line, we launched the vionic™ series, a new range of ultra-high accuracy, super-compact all-in-one digital incremental encoders. 3. it has been established that certain foreign currency forward contracts used as hedging instruments for future incoming currency cash flows did not qualify for hedge accounting as they did not meet the hedge effectiveness criteria set out in the international accounting standard ias 39 ‘financial instruments: recognition and measurement’. combined with ipc (intelligent process control) software, equator provides the functionality to fully automate tool offset updates in cnc manufacturing processes. with the help of renishaw ballbar diagnostics bae systems has benefitted from significant improvements in workshop productivity and qa compliance. renishaw plc annual report and accounts 2017 16 d paul coupland, machine shop manager at tridan, displaying the final part for ricardo. as a company they are very supportive, although to be honest we’ve never had to call on their service department – the products simply don’t go wrong.” tremec mexico reduces shop floor gauging time of daimler parts by 85% with equator™ gauges at the tremec queretaro plant, near mexico city, transmission systems are produced for daimler, volvo, gm, john deere and agriculture and construction equipment manufacturer cnh. dividend per share pence in a manufacturing environment, it is crucial that we maintain high standards of health and safety. it is through this approach that renishaw has been able to deliver such a long-term track record of profitable growth. today, most machine tools are equipped with a networking capability and have more accessible software architectures, making it simpler to facilitate communication between systems. traditionally, hydraulic block manifolds are manufactured from an aluminium alloy or stainless steel billet which has been cut and machined to size. investment has continued in the improvement of key manufacturing processes associated with increased volumes and developing capability for specific product lines such as am. governance financial statements shareholder information strategic report 33 strategic report our strategy in action – continual research creating strong market positions with innovative products atom™ – miniaturising innovation in the encoder business modern high-volume production processes, such as semiconductor manufacturing, demand production-line machines with ever smaller footprints to maximise productivity while also continually improving accuracy and throughput. richard toller, technical manager for renishaw’s cmm products division, explains: “the atom encoder provides a level of plug-and-play convenience that simply didn’t exist before. the new building at west dundee, illinois, is much better aligned to our ‘solutions provider’ strategy with excellent customer demonstration and training facilities. in mexico, work is nearing completion of a new building that will provide expansion space for sales and marketing operations. we have a planned intake of 45 graduates and 48 apprentices this summer, whilst our in-house academy delivered 3,050 training days (2016: 6,500), with the reduction primarily due to changes to our graduate induction and apprenticeship programmes, which meant that less time was spent with the academy in favour of more ‘on-the job’ training. market conditions as reported last year, we were already seeing a favourable environment for our position encoders line due to new investments in led manufacture and the semiconductor sector. as well as strong trade in the far east electronics sector, on a global basis we are continuing to see ongoing investment in production systems and processes, including automation, aided by an increasing awareness of the benefits to be gained by adopting industry 4.0 and smart factory philosophies (see pages 26–27). the use of collaborative robots (‘cobots’) is increasing, working closely with people to help finish production tasks through simple, fast programming or even self-learning processes. we continue to position renishaw as a ‘solutions provider’ and reduce the risks of over-reliance on large customers who integrate our products. we will launch a large number of new products at the emo hannover exhibition in september 2017. we have introduced at trade exhibitions a new machining cell concept with integrated process control which demonstrates how complementary technologies from renishaw, including gauging and machine tool probing, can contribute to high levels of productivity and manufacturing capability. these trends should all result in increased demand for our metrology products to help drive efficiencies, reduce waste, increase automation and aid product measurement traceability. there was also a good year of sales for additively manufactured metal dental structures created from cobalt chrome powder using renishaw am machines. likewise, the growing life science market is showing renewed performance there was growth from all our healthcare product lines (spectroscopy, neurological and medical dental). strategy for growth we aim to develop innovative healthcare products that will significantly advance our customers’ operational performance by maximising research capabilities, reducing process times and improving the efficacy of medical procedures. outlook increased life expectancy on a global basis means greater incidences of degenerative neurological diseases, which will require surgical therapies. in developing markets, levels of wealth are increasing at a national and individual level, which is driving demand for higher-quality medical treatments, often requiring more technologically advanced products. the market for raman spectroscopy continues to grow in fields such as nanotechnology, advanced materials, pharmaceutical, life sciences and medical research. all sterling and foreign currency balances not immediately required for group operations are placed on short-term deposit with leading international highly-rated financial institutions. there are forward contracts in place to hedge against the group’s euro, us dollar and japanese yen cash inflows. related strategic priorities: 1 potential impact volatility in investment returns and actuarial assumptions can significantly affect the defined benefit pension scheme deficit, impacting on future funding requirements. mitigation • the group enters into forward contracts in order to hedge varying proportions of forecast us dollar, euro and japanese yen revenue. this year we have given 100 (2016: 100) students the opportunity to work at renishaw, 40 of whom stay for a full year-long placement. we are continuing to develop relationships with key universities that have been identified as having relevant courses for our business needs. in the usa, we are also developing a new programme that creates partnerships with educational establishments such as technical colleges and universities. these sites have been recognised by the carbon trust for their efforts in moving waste away from landfill as a disposal option, towards recovery, recycling and reuse. the board takes seriously its responsibilities for making sure that all employees are aware of their obligations to act with openness, honesty and transparency. as such, the adjusted profit before tax disclosure has been adopted to provide stakeholders with a better measure of underlying performance. this year we are seeking approval of a new remuneration policy that is designed to operate over the next three years. historically, feedback from proxy advisors and some institutional shareholders has questioned the absence of a long term incentive for our executives. executive director salaries are benchmarked against equivalent positions for relevant industrial sectors based on factors such as sector, size and location. 50% of any net vested share awards (after sales to meet tax liabilities) must be retained until the minimum shareholding guideline is met. the non-executive directors are appointed for an initial three-year period subject to annual performance review and re-election at agms, unless terminated earlier by either party on one month’s written notice. single total figure table (audited) salary/fees benefits bonus pension total 2017 £’000 2016 £’000 2017 £’000 2016 £’000
