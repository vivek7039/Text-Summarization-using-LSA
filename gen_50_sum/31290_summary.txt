and gas company plc annual report and accounts 2017 3 chairman’s report when i wrote my update to accompany the 2016 annual report, nostra terra was still in the early stages of embedding its new strategy. the company has since taken significant steps forward in realising its ambitions, delivering robust returns for shareholders. in particular we sought to acquire leases, which were held by production (hbp). in egypt we increased our stake in the east ghazalat concession to 50%, having acquired echo energy’s (aim:echo) 25% stake for a 500,000 consideration payable only upon certain approvals and production hurdles. for minimal outlay we will increase nostra terra’s assets to just over 1 million barrels of 2p reserves. we are now cash flow positive at the plc level and have access to significant working capital, fundamental attributes that are rarely found in companies on aim or of our size. now that we have put in place such a solid foundation our intention is to build on this through further acquisitions and organic growth. ewen ainsworth chairman 1 june 2018 nostra terra oil and gas company plc annual report and accounts 2017 4 chief executive officer’s report our primary goal in 2017 was to become cash flow positive at the plc level. in april 2017 the company raised £500,000 through an equity placing at 2 pence per share. included in this were 1 for 1 warrants, exercisable within 12 months at 3 pence per share. moving forward we will certainly seek to build on this success, through further drilling across our existing portfolio of assets. if successful this change in approach could significantly increase nostra terra’s growth trajectory. my vision has always been to build a much larger company, built on solid fundamentals. we were able to demonstrate an established track record of consistent production and the viability of our long-term model consolidating efforts made in the first half of 2017. permian basin, texas having secured the hedging facility, we were confident we would be able to obtain a new senior lending facility. we now have approximately 22 drill ready locations across our existing permian basin assets. we have been proactive in suggesting solutions to the issues raised, and sought positive resolutions. we already have a number of potential catalysts to rerate the business in our asset portfolio and are extremely well positioned to raise our sights in terms of new acquisitions. it meets at least four times a year, as issues arise which require board attention. the board has a formal schedule of matters specially referred to it for decision. other responsibilities include considering annually whether there is a need for an internal audit function and making a recommendation to the board, and reviewing arrangements by which the group’s staff will be able to raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters related to the group. a system of internal control can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that material financial irregularities will be detected or that risk of failure to achieve business objectives is eliminated. vice president of operations at gulf keystone (lse:gkp) 2014–2017, oversaw 40,000 bopd, having joined that company as manager, geology & geophysics in early 2009. john is a geoscientist, with specialist expertise in oil field development and reserve certification and reporting. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. this is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. this entailed comparing oil reserves and net present values from the independent reserves report produced by booth reeves to the asset carrying values, and a detailed review of producing wells. we agreed with the audit committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £2,900 (2016: £2,750) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. in particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgments, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. sanjay parmar (senior statutory auditor) for and on behalf of jeffreys henry llp,

obtained a us5m credit facility with washington federal bank post year end where us1.2m is available immediately. identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. unrealised losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. when a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. payments to acquire the legal right to explore, together with the directly related costs of technical services and studies, seismic acquisition, exploratory drilling and testing are capitalised as intangible e&e assets. changes in the estimates of commercial reserves or future field development costs are dealt with prospectively. where there has been a change in economic conditions that indicates a possible impairment in an oil and gas asset, the recoverability of the net book value relating to that field is assessed by comparison with the estimated discounted future cash flows based on management’s expectations of future oil and gas prices and future costs. any impairment identified is charged to the income statement as additional depletion and amortisation. when a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates for each cash generating unit. (b) impairment of property, plant and equipment property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. nostra terra oil and gas company plc annual report and accounts 2017 41 14. investment in joint venture group £000 cost at 1 january 2016 190 additions — impairment — share of post-tax losses of equity accounted joint ventures (189) at 31 december 2016 1 additions — impairment — transfer (1) at 31 december 2017 — carrying value at 31 december 2017 — at 31 december 2016 1 the group has acquired the remaining 50% interest in independent resources (egypt) limited (ire), a company incorporated in england & wales, whose purpose is to invest in the oil and gas exploration and production activities in the arab republic of egypt, from echo energy plc. the final loan note principal and semi-annual interest payable to trans globe thereon remain subject to final determination in accordance with completion working capital adjustment provisions in the sale and purchase agreement. at 31 december 2015 the loan note principal has been recorded based on trans globe’s initial assessment of working capital at completion and interest on this estimated loan note principal has been accrued up to 31 december 2015. the us dollar denominated loan liability all to transglobe has been retranslated at prevailing year-end exchange rates. further progress has been made post year end – please see note 27 for details. borrowings also include an unsecured loan with a balance at year end of £827,000 (2016: £558,000). on 19 july 2017 the company issued 1,462,246 ordinary shares to e ainsworth in respect of his annual director’s and consultancy fee. a further loan was made in october 2017 for £130,000, which is unsecured, bearing an interest rate of 7.5% per annum. loan repayments of these balances total £11,000 for the year ended 31 december 2017. this balance is fully payable in 2018. the company obtained a further loan from j stafford in october 2017 for £85,000, which is unsecured, bearing an interest rate of 7.5% per annum. 27. events after the reporting period on 31 january 2018 nostra terra opened a senior lending facility with washington federal bank. on 26 april 2018 nostra terra announced that unresolved issues between nostra terra’s ultimate subsidiary, sahara resources (gos) inc and north petroleum international company sa, relating to the company’s joint venture at the east ghazalat concession egypt, have been referred for arbitration.
