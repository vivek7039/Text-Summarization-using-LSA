fischer-tropsch process or or raw ft product our process our proven fischer- t ropsch technology is one of a very small number of economic, sustainable routes to produce renewable fuels that can be blended at high percentages with petroleum- based products, and that are compatible with existing infrastructure and engines. failure to have reliable, long-term offtakers or active spot sales of products could affect revenue forecasts and ongoing operations. it has modelled steady state and upset operations under conditions that will be experienced at future commercial plants. indications are that velocys’ technology will be able to meet both quantity and quality expectations for finished products. velocys’ strategy is to de-risk its future projects by selecting commercially-proven technologies and piloting significant components of the flowsheet. for its projects, velocys is focused on engaging operators who are fully qualified and well-trained in the operation of such plants. such advances take time to develop and provide velocys with a significant competitive advantage beyond its core fischer-tropsch technology capability. based on regularly updated cash flow forecasts the required currency mix is identified and foreign exchange contracts taken out accordingly. for example, the company does not comply with:   fca listing rule 9.8.6r (which includes the ‘comply or
