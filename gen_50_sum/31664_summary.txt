sector has proved increasingly popular for both specialist purchasers and credit funds in recent years, with yields reducing as a consequence. idem capital has retained its credit and pricing discipline across the past year, but as a consequence investment levels have reduced year-on-year. the coming year will see development of new product lines, including two already launched, aviation finance and structured lending. overall idem capital’s success rests on understanding assets, strong analytics, advanced servicing capabilities and the efficient use of funding. these, together with

expertise. recoverable amounts on loans may also be affected by adverse movements in security values such as house and commercial asset prices. the group has comprehensive policies in place that set out detailed criteria which must be met before loans are approved. credit policies incorporate limits for concentration risks arising from factors such as large exposures to counterparties,

support lending activities where maturity is over a longer period than that of the deposits. the group’s exposure to this risk is a natural consequence of its lending, deposit taking and borrowing activities, as some of its financial assets and liabilities bear interest at rates which float with various market rates while others are fixed, either for a term or for their whole lives. in practice
