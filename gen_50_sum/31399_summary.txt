ourboardandgovernance our board was chosen to ensure that, as a fast-growing public company, energean demonstrates best practice governance standards and provides sound stewardship. this strategy is underpinned by our key competitive strengths: x we are an experienced offshore operator, operating the majority of assets in our portfolio x we are well-positioned as an independent, eastern mediterranean e&p to move quickly in an increasingly active region x we have a track record of value creation through timely acquisitions and efficient development x we have the depth and diversity across a series of assets at various stages of development to position us as a full-cycle, sustainable business x we have an experienced management team, with an international oil industry track record, who are significantly invested in energean x we have a strong health and safety track record x we have world class industry partners such as technipfmc, bp and repsol and strong financial capacity 1 maximising output and cash flow from our producing assets the prinos and prinos north oil fields, offshore north eastern greece, are low-cost producing assets that have already delivered 115 million barrels of oil to date. our strategy revolves around identifying and exploring undeveloped areas where we have technical experience of similar geologies to minimise exploration risk. as our track record demonstrates, energean continually assesses ways to create further sustainable value and act upon value- accretive opportunities. chief executive’s review continued 1 strategic report other information financial statements corporate governance energean oil & gas plc annual report 2017 09 08 energean oil & gas plc annual report 2017 chief executive’s review continued a sustainable growth story karish & tanin project milestones 2018 outlook energean is currently the only upstream company on the lse with considerable exposure to the eastern mediterranean, an area which is attracting increasing interest from global oil and gas majors. energean’s hse record has been an important factor in our successful bids for licences, including karish and tanin. by maintaining a focused approach to this region, we believe the group has developed strong relationships with all key stakeholders. as an independent, locally-based e&p company, energean is well positioned to move swiftly on opportunities in the eastern mediterranean. at the time energean acquired them, karish and tanin were stranded assets with no gas contracts in place. as our track record demonstrates, energean continually assesses ways to create further sustainable value and act upon value- accretive opportunities. strong health & safety record energean’s exemplary hse performance is a key aspect of our overall success. to date, over 5 billion barrels of oil in place have been discovered within this prolific carbonate play. a mou has already been signed between israel, greece, italy and cyprus to support the expected us6–7 billion pipeline construction. energean’s conservative financial management and its focus on operating costs give the group confidence that it can prosper under a range of oil prices. this approach removes the need to land hydrocarbon liquids in israel, minimising environmental impacts, and will establish a hub through which other discoveries could be developed. options to extend the existing b platform were generated and will be compared with a new bridge-linked jacket. in order to achieve final investment decision energean met the following key milestones: x finalisation of field development plan that was submitted to and approved by the israeli authorities x execution of 12 long term gas sales agreements totalling an estimated 61 bcm on an acq basis (up to 74 bcm including or gas supply agreement) with reputable and credible counterparties x agreement of financing terms for a us1.275m project finance with major international banks. this cash flow together with increased debt facilities funded the group’s us54 million capital expenditure on exploration and development. these non-ifrs measures include adjusted ebitdax, cost of oil production capital expenditure, cash capex, net debt and gearing ratio are explained overleaf. marine contingency plan we have developed and tested emergency response procedures for handling specific incidents such as oil spills. a key aspect of this is designing and monitoring an internal control system in order to manage these risks. risk management strategic report other information financial statements

consolidation continued profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (oci) are attributed to owners of the group and to the non- controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. where appropriate, the cost of acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. strategic report other

continued 3.7 impairment of non-financial assets at each reporting date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its depreciable property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. this is usually at the individual royalty, stream, oil and gas or working interest level for each property from which cash inflows are generated. if the group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment. the group does not have any financial liabilities classified as fair value through profit or loss except derivative instruments. the group has considered their carrying value at each balance sheet date and concluded that, based on management’s estimates, sufficient taxable profits will be generated in future years to recover such recognised deferred tax assets. 3.19 equity, reserves and dividend payments share capital represents the nominal (par) value of shares that
