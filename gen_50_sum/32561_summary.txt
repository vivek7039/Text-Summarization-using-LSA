we create value for all our stakeholders through our customer heartbeat model: is the ukâ€™s leading hospitality company we have built two of the ukâ€™s most successful hospitality brands, premier inn and costa, through consistent operational excellence and providing a great customer experience. china remains an exciting platform of growth for costa and we have a clear plan to enhance our business. we have made good progress this year in areas such as procurement, supplier consolidation and labour scheduling, which has helped maintain margins. i reported this time last year that dominic paul would be joining the team as managing director, costa coffee. coffee has recently overtaken tea as the ukâ€™s beverage of choice and international comparisons show a lot more headroom for growth. however, we are given confidence by the fact that, outside a tail of underperforming stores, site performance is credible. culturally speaking, we need dynamic leadership with clear executive accountability, and relentless customer focus supported by agile decision making. whitbreadâ€™s business model, which can be found on pages 14 and 15 shows how we create value for our stakeholders. overall whitbread maintained its engagement score of 78% which, despite positioning us favourably against external comparisons, did not quite meet our 79% target and highlights further opportunities to improve. we are proud to have celebrated a member of our costa leadership team being recognised in the outstanding & financial times leading lgbt+ ally executives list. the wise programme enabled paige to experience premier inn before enrolling on our advanced apprenticeship in hospitality management, earning while learning at work. paige valued the structured programme, support system of regular reviews and feedback about her performance at leeds premier inn. our graduates have acquired function-specific experience, technical training and support for the professional qualifications they wish to work towards. in costa poland, focus is centred on developing internal talent pipelines, introducing efficiency driven pay, benefits for baristas and development of leadership skills.

earns the right to earn further incentivised rewards. in 2017/18, half of the total incentive available will be based on performance against a group underlying profit before tax target. each of the groupâ€™s operating businesses maintains employee relations and consults employees as appropriate to its own particular needs. in addition, our employee opinion survey, â€˜your sayâ€™, is conducted twice a year to provide insight into the views of employees. it also includes co 2 e from owned vehicles which include company cars but excludes logistics as this is an outsourced operation. for those operations which are currently beyond our reporting capabilities, such as costa shanghai, we have used an estimation approach using known sales data and local conversion factors. nicola mitchell fca
