our on-site concessions aim to be best in class, providing a variety of food, drink and snack options. three new vip locations were opened during the year in zichron (israel), chodov (czech republic) and wroclaw (poland). we have a further 75 screens scheduled to open in 2018. new sites will be opened across both the uk and row. there is a strong movie slate for 2018, which includes “jurassic world: fallen kingdom”, “fantastic beasts: the crimes of grindelwald“, “avengers: infinity war”, “incredibles 2”, “mamma mia! here we go again”, “solo: a star wars story”, “deadpool 2”, “fifty shades freed”, “mary poppins returns” and many more. where there are site closures, especially of older sites in the uk, this also provides further opportunities for new investments. visiting the cinema remains a convenient, affordable out-of-home activity, especially when compared with other leisure activities such as concerts and sporting events. where there are site closures, especially of older sites in the uk, this also provides further opportunities for new investments. visiting the cinema remains a convenient, affordable out-of-home activity, especially when compared with other leisure activities such as concerts and sporting events. we have six different formats in which our customers can watch a movie: regular screens, 3d, 4dx, imax, superscreen and vip auditoriums. in the uk we also cater for different consumer tastes with our combination of modern multiplexes and arthouse cinemas. although we have not experienced any breaches from these, cyber risk has been a board focus throughout the year. retail spend may also decrease due to changes in customer preferences, decreased disposable income or other economic and cultural factors. if the group loses key people this could have an impact on its ability to deliver business objectives. the group actively encourages our future film-going audience by specifically tailoring film schedules to attract families and young people. i was promoted to a cinema manager – i firmly believe the apprenticeship was successful in helping forge my cineworld career.” ranjeet nanrah 25 cineworld group plc annual report and accounts

cineworld group plc annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report financial statements corporate governance independent auditor’s report continued we continue to perform procedures over onerous lease provisions £3.6m (2016: £2.4m) but have not assessed it as one of the most significant risks in our current year audit as fewer leased cinemas are trading at a loss than in the past and as a result, the potential for a material error in this area has diminished. intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. for goodwill assets that have an indefinite useful economic life, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date. net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. the fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. at 31 december 2017 the group had unrecognised potential tax assets relating to the following temporary differences: • uk capital losses of £7.5m with no expiry date • overseas tax losses of £0.5m with no expiry date it is not considered probable that future taxable profit will be available against which these deductible temporary differences can be utilised. for established sites, expected future cash flows are based on financial budgets approved by the board of directors covering a one year period. given the short term admissions trends and ticket price inflation, sensitivities applied are believed to reflect a potential downside scenario. the recoverable amounts of uk and cinema city cgu groups have been determined based on a value in use calculation. no contributions are expected for the year ending 31
