completion due autumn 2017. park house northampton business park northampton a multi-let 43,500 sq ft office property with active management initiatives underway. by listening to tenants and taking advice from agents, the company remains totally aware of emerging occupier trends, such as the increasing preference towards characterful or individualistic offices, and is able to increase value by providing supply for this demand. as a result, and because of the resilient demand for the type of space we offer, we believe our portfolio will prove less susceptible to any downward valuation shifts arising from any prolonged political and economic uncertainty. however, with a strong cash flow and cash at bank we believe that our business is well placed to capitalise upon a regional office market that has, to-date, remained fairly robust due to sustained demand for offices in the sub 5,000 sq ft range and the continuing loss of much of the lower quality office stock due to obsolescence and residential conversion. whether we are buying short let income to drive the rents forward or offices requiring refurbishment, we use our proven expertise to provide tenants with the occupational space they desire, in locations where there is proven occupier demand. companies relocating to the regions to save costs, being attracted by lower employment costs, business rates and rent, coupled with existing demand from local professional occupiers and smes, have further enhanced tenant demand for good quality well located offices. furthermore, major provincial cities have experienced the permitted development rights effect, whereby offices can be converted to residential without planning permission. recycle capital 34% above valuation development programme we reposition and add value to well located provincial offices by undertaking both minor or extensive refurbishments. recycle capital 34% above valuation development programme we reposition and add value to well located
