it has been a challenging year as we have reviewed our operations and introduced new ways of working in many areas to position the group for future success. with its three year tag programme well underway, ite is entering a period in the transformation that requires dynamic change. good quality events have become places to learn, network, discuss and debate; they act as an industry platform, bringing a business community together under one roof. training, monitoring, managing performance and breeding a culture of success by rewarding achievement is the basis for strong sustainable organic growth. priorities for 2018 the group has achieved much in a short space of time since we announced our evolved strategy and tag programme. in the year ahead, our main focus within tag will be on lead generation, content and customer service. a fast pace has been set in the last year which we look forward to continuing into 2018 and beyond. on a like-for-like basis headline profit before tax has grown by 2%, reversing the trend reported in recent years. the significant increase is largely as a result of the onsite rebooking initiative, which has brought our cash inflows forward, and also from an increase in forward bookings for next year’s events attributable to an upturn in trading, particularly across our core events. a detailed analysis of volumes and revenues is presented below: square

balances increased to £23.3m (2016: £15.5m) as a result of earlier cash collection following the onsite rebooking initiative, reduced expenditure on acquisitions compared to previous years and the strengthening of foreign currencies against sterling which create unrealised gains when translated into sterling on consolidation. worldfood moscow in september also grew volumes by 5% to 21,300m 2 (2016: 20,200m 2 ), as both domestic exhibitors and international suppliers increased their space requirements. prior to joining ebiquity, andrew spent nine years at pwc as part of the entertainment

on improved terms, with greater headroom and more appropriate covenants. we carry business interruption insurance policies which protect profits on our largest fully-owned events against such an event in the short term. competitor risk competition has existed in ite’s markets for some years and we face competitive pressures on a market-by-market basis. we have sought to build loyalty in our staff by ensuring remuneration is competitive and through a wide distribution of the group’s long-term incentive plans. bonus will be predominantly based on a challenging range of financial targets set in line with the group’s kpis (for example, revenue growth, cash conversion and profit). profit will be measured on a reported basis (i.e. using actual exchange rates) with revenue growth and cash
