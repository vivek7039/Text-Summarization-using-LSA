faxon, non-executive chairman number of employees increased from 74 to 91 as we continued to expand the group’s technology group and started to build out our marketing and product teams. this is why the group has spent considerable time and resource in developing a transactional tool which we call marketplace. we have maintained our tight focus on the world’s largest and fastest growing advertising markets with high levels of video consumption. the value chain for in‑video advertising involves three parties: content producers, distributors (digital or broadcast) and advertisers/media agencies. as our technology has developed we have increasingly focused resources on the last steps in this process. development work continued around the marketplace platform, which will enable key stakeholders such as content owners, distributors and advertisers to transact. the campaign embedded t angeche’s brand messages as ad units across more than 20 different shows over five months. we are delighted that the campaign results, independently researched by miaozhen systems, exceeded even our high expectations. when demand is generated mirriad has the technology and processes in place to fulfil transactions using marketplace. it is also worth emphasising that mirriad has planned capabilities to support programmatic buying and can provide personalisation depending on our distribution partners’ infrastructure. in 2017 marc pritchard said that: “we bombard consumers with thousands of ads a day, subject them to endless ad load times, interrupt their screens with pop‑ups and overpopulate their screens and feeds… we’re awfully busy, but all of this activity is not breaking through the clutter. it’s just creating more noise.” while keith weed said at the iab annual leadership meeting in 2018 that: “[consumers] don’t care about good value for advertisers. the work in these two pivotal markets should drive more transactional liquidity between media owners and advertisers. the group now has a base of customers which provides a platform for future growth, though the directors caution that sales cycles are long and signature of customer contracts, while an important kpi, does not immediately lead to future revenue. it is believed that the expectations reflected in these statements are reasonable but they may be affected by a wide range of variables which could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated. all the group’s revenue is derived from contracts which have no contractual obligation to maintain or renew any level of purchasing activity and there is no minimum purchasing commitment under the group’s agreements. mirriad advertising plc annual report and accounts 2017 10 strategic report description mitigation change failure to renew contracts typically the group’s contracts have 24‑month durations and as they have been signed at different times the group is generally in a state of contract renewal with one or more customers. key increase in risk decrease in risk no change in risk mirriad advertising plc annual report and accounts 2017 11 board of directors roger conant faxon
