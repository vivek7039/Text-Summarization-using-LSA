market context demand for low cost homes in the north of england was very strong with long queues forming on launch days at new development sites. on behalf of the board, i would like to congratulate and thank them very warmly indeed. we have a very carefully targeted land buying strategy that has clearly defined and challenging hurdle rates. there has been a great deal of media comment about the difficulties young people face purchasing a home, but typical gleeson homes buyers are blue collar workers aged between 18 and 33. this year we sold 60 houses to people aged 21 or under. we then share this information and, where necessary, send warnings through instant alerts straight to residents’ inboxes. during the year, we secured planning consents for some 1,495 plots and acquired interests in 6 new sites plus additional land at an existing site. 1 sites are located predominantly in buckinghamshire, devon, dorset, essex, hampshire, hertfordshire, kent, oxfordshire, somerset, surrey, sussex and wiltshire. our business enables people on lower incomes to become homeowners and regenerates local communities in areas of social deprivation. double gleeson homes volumes we will increase the number of unit completions to 2,000 per annum within 5 years by increasing our housebuilding footprint. buying on my own was a little daunting, but it’s the best move i ever made.” rachel mccaffrey. we give priority to labour and subcontractors who live within a two mile radius of each site. over the past year we have worked closely with denaby main academy, a primary school located close to our kilner park development in south yorkshire. the centre offers essential free child care for local children, many of whom have special needs or come from disadvantaged families. emissions have been calculated using the uk government’s chg conversion factors for company reporting: 2017 and 2016 respectively. stefan allanson chief financial officer 22 september 2017 32 rachel & adam, lowfield

opposed to discrimination on the grounds of race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, religion or beliefs. being a smaller listed company, it was not considered necessary to have this year’s

forecasts. we consult with our employees in order to ensure that their views can be taken into account when making decisions. restrictions on voting a shareholder shall not be entitled to vote at any
