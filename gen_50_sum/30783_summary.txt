exposures e ﬀectively is time consuming, resource intensive and expensive - often involving dedicated in-house treasury teams or outsourced currency management consultancies. however, these products in isolation do not provide a solution, and used incorrectly can often exacerbate currency risk further. by doing so, we are able to provide a service, traditionally the privilege of ftse100 companies or those with large treasury or those with large treasury departments and make it accessible to all businesses impacted by currency volatility. o v e r v i e w w h a t w e d o 7 untitled-1 1 29/03/2018 14:07 how we do it hedging programmes our expert currency strategists work in our expert currency strategists work in consultation with our clients to devise and maintain hedging programmes that are bespoke to their unique objectives and commercial environments. partnering with treasurers, cfos, fds, ceos and mds, our focus is on helping these people improve their decision making in order that they can decision making in order that they can manage their currency exposure as e ﬀectively and e ﬃciently as possible. our ‘bespoke as standard’ approach means we have proven expertise across a diverse range of sectors. during the ﬁnancial year we have recruited staﬀ for our london oﬃce who are ﬂuent in foreign languages which has enabled us to steadily expand into select european territories. further operational progress was made with the expansion of our fx analysis team and through obtaining regulatory approval to sell derivative products. as always, we expect staﬀ contributions to increase incrementally as individuals develop along the learning curve, and i am pleased that yet again, new starters in fy17 outperformed those in fy16 - a trend i expect to continue due to the compounding eﬀect of surrounding great people with more great people, alongside our evolving service and infrastructure and the growing reputation of alpha in our target markets. the majority of remaining new team members joined our technology team, spearheading new product development and technological innovation, with a particular focus on evolving alpha’s online currency management platform and payment functionality, as well as developing custom platform solutions for our clients. morgan tillbrook chief executive oﬃcer 248225 alpha fx_pp12-pp26.qxp 03/04/2018 15:07 page 15 strategic report our strategy 16 • acquire new clients • retain existing clients and increase share of their spend • develop our oﬀering • nurture our culture • build scale and eﬃciencies our strategy “a clear strategy lies before a highly capable and motivated team, who now have an enhanced service oﬀering and wealth of new resources at their disposal.” 6 the group exclude training accounts (those that have generated less than £10,000 in revenue since being onboarded) in order to provide a clearer picture of client numbers for the purposes of these ﬁgures. • since the year end, we have invested in our fund and institutional fx oﬀering, hiring two highly experienced sector heads, who lead a team solely focused on penetrating this space. • options department formed, led by an fca approved individual with over ten years’ experience, expanding the range of products we can oﬀer our clients and allowing us to cater eﬀectively to the needs of those with more complex exposures. these facilities enable the group to book both forward and spot contracts on behalf of its clients. the liquidity policy provides that: • weekly stress tests are carried out that subject the group’s net currency positions to simulated signiﬁcant fx market volatility; • robust margin call terms are maintained with clients; • an over extension of hedging facilities is managed through internally mandating a minimum amount of alpha’s free cash to be placed against each hedging facility extended; and • alpha’s balance sheet must be well capitalised with cash so that in the event that they are called for margin collateral by a banking counterparty but unable to call on their clients as they have granted them a ‘hedging facility’, they are able to fund the position. 248225 alpha

any trade error should be identiﬁed early), as well as ensuring trades greater than £2,000,000.00 are reconciled within the hour. the group also maintains a whistleblowing policy, which is communicated to all members of staﬀ. health & safety (covering rights) the board takes seriously its responsibility towards employees to provide a safe and healthy working environment. recycling of oﬃce supplies is undertaken where possible and the group has adopted a largely paperless marketing model. lisa is also a non-executive director of albert technologies plc, an ai technology business operating in the digital marketing sector and of orange eyes limited (trading as magic light pictures), a leading children’s ﬁlm and television production company. such a system is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. all other development expenditure is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as an expense. as far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditor is unaware, and each director has taken all reasonable steps that he or she ought to have taken to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the group’s auditors are aware of this information. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the ﬁnancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. the prior year comparative was set with reference to proﬁt before tax and applying a percentage of 6%. we recalculated the credit valuation adjustment using industry accepted techniques to compare against management’s own assessment of fair value. we also agreed to report diﬀerences below this threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. ifrs 9 is eﬀective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018, with early application

statements notes to the c onsolidated financial statements 59 14. derivative ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities (continued) derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are intended to reduce the level of foreign currency risk for expected future cash ﬂows. daily stress tests are carried out to assess and minimise client credit risk exposures under various market volatility scenarios. derivatives are entered into with banking counterparties, which minimises credit risk further, as the group is only exposed to the net position of its derivative assets and liabilities and this position is collateralised on a daily basis. the group also attempts to ensure it maintains (as closely as is possible) a balanced position in each currency, with regular stress testing of its net long or short in a particular currency against sudden and unforeseen market movements (“black swan events”). consequently, management does not believe that the group has a material exposure to liquidity risk. summarised ﬁnancial information in relation to the non-controlling interest of alpha fx limited, before intra-group eliminations, is given below. the subsidiary undertaking traded
