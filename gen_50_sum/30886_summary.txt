importantly, all investments were originated in off-market deals from the zenith platform and are, therefore, assets on which we have excellent performance visibility. we believe that this strategy will serve us well in italy too given our long-term commitment to the market. clodagh has significant experience driving risk strategy at large financial companies and will play a pivotal role in ensuring that arrow continues to grow prudently. consensus regarding forecasts for uk and european gdp growth remains positive, but we remain well positioned to capitalise on any market opportunities presented by a turn in the economic cycle. as previously guided, we do not expect brexit to impact our ability to operate and purchase portfolios in europe, since we are individually licensed in all of our jurisdictions and are not reliant on the uk’s continuing membership of the eu. we remain relatively well insulated against the potential for interest rate rises when viewed alongside our strengthened funding position and reduced weighted average cost of debt fixed over a long duration. all portfolios continue to be monitored carefully and, where appropriate, adjusted for in the erc forecast based upon our detailed modelling. after further discussion, it was agreed that a lower repayment than jennifer initially suggested would be taken over five months, but with the provision to review if this caused her any problems. this income is recognised after taking account of new portfolios, collections, updated erc forecasts, disposals and any fx impacts. however, with other industries, such as telecoms and health services becoming interested in this opportunity, we expect an increase of debt sale projects. heerenveen almere amsterdam hilversum ghent assets under

policies are consistent with this approach. where the group acquires purchased loan portfolios via forward flow agreements, being contracted multiple future purchases, there is no difference in accounting treatment from that described above. net interest expense and other expenses related to the defined benefit pension plan are recognised in profit or loss. deferred tax liabilities are provided, using the liability method, on all taxable temporary differences at each reporting date. where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, movements in their fair value are recognised immediately within the profit or loss. operational factors, that may impact future estimated cash flows, are also considered such as improved collections processes and systems. 2017 £000 2016 £000
