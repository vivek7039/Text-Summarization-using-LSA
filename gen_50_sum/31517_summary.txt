acknowledgements dignity would like to thank all those who participated in producing this annual report, particularly the members ofstaff for their contributions. size and scale we operate a network of 826 funeral locations throughout the uk, generally trading under established local names. we believe the funeral industry will beneﬁt signiﬁcantly from proper regulation to ensure that clients are not misled into accepting below-par service and standards. this size still gives the group good scope to acquire owner managed businesses in areas where it is not well represented. they should be interpreted as a direction of travel for consumer behaviour rather than precise metrics about the entire market. there is much catching up to do but also major opportunities for those leading players who get it right. overview 01 – 03 strategic report 04 – 43 governance 44 – 74 financial statements 75 – 129 other information 130 – 132 chief executive’s review continued 12 | dignity plc annual report & accounts 2017 while increasing competition often leads to higher standards, in an unregulated industry this is far less certain and the funeral industry is a case in point. ground-breaking research into cremations we wish to provide our clients with the best possible service, one which fully meets or exceeds their needs. 8 8 dignity plc annual report & accounts 2017 | 13 chief executive’s review – outlook q&a what has happened in your market to trigger this change of strategy? 1 dec6 dec7 dec8 dec9 dec10 dec11 dec12 dec13 dec14 dec15 dec16 dec17 overview 01 – 03 strategic report 04 – 43 governance 44 – 74 financial statements 75 – 129 other information 130 – 132 key performance indicators continued we strive to maintain and improve client satisfaction across our business. this ﬁnancial performance reﬂects the lower number of funerals performed, offset by some increases in average income and acquisition activity. this is why working closely with these organisations means we can continue to uphold the very best industry practices. maintenance capital expenditure of £2.9 million has been incurred on central projects predominantly relating to it that will help the business as a whole operate more eﬃciently. financial review continued 30 | dignity plc annual report & accounts 2017 dignity plc annual report & accounts 2017 | 31 financial review – outlook q&a 2018 will be a challenging year for the group but i am conﬁdent we have the ﬁnancial and management strength to meet these challenges head on. however, the group took decisive action to reduce its funeral pricing in january 2018, which will be supported by an improved online presence. each year 20,000 people complete their time with the british army, navy or royal air force and resettle into civilian life. dignity plc annual report & accounts 2017 | 43 cdp encourages best practice in reporting and reducing environmental impact through a scoring process. dignity’s lower market-based carbon emissions ﬁgure in scope 2 reﬂects a larger proportion of purchased electricity generated by low-carbon sources than the uk grid average. there were five independent non-executive directors who served for the period: jane ashcroft, alan mcwalter, martin pexton, david blackwood and mary mcnamara. this term may then be renewed by mutual consent up to a maximum of nine years in accordance with the code. he was replaced by mary mcnamara who joined on 1 march 2017. all, committee members, apart from myself, are independent non-executive directors. 2017 annual bonus outcome the group demonstrated good operational performance, continued excellent client survey results and made further acquisitions of established funeral businesses. this performance was achieved against the backdrop of a challenging environment which is becoming increasingly competitive in 2018 and beyond. the annual bonus in 2017 was measured against stretching earnings before interest and tax ('ebit') targets, our key short-term ﬁnancial performance indicator. the ltip award granted in 2015 was subject to performance against two equally weighted measures, relative total shareholder return (‘tsr’) and earnings per share growth (‘eps’). see note 1. following vesting, executive directors will be required to retain their net of tax vested shares for two years. the maximum annual award that can be made to an individual in any given ﬁnancial year is 150 per cent of salary. notes • minimum comprises fixed pay, which includes 2018 basic salary, the value of benefits in 2017 and a 15 per cent company pension contribution. overview 01 – 03 strategic report 04 – 43 governance 44 – 74 financial statements 75 – 129 other information 130 – 132 report on directors’ remuneration continued for the 52 week period ended 29 december 2017 64 | dignity plc annual report & accounts 2017 how shareholder views are taken into account the remuneration committee is committed to ensuring an open dialogue with our shareholders and therefore, where changes are being made to the remuneration policy or where there is a material change in which we operate our policy, we will consult with major shareholders in advance. however, full retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be provided in next year's remuneration report. mary mcnamara was appointed to the board on 1 march 2017 and her remuneration as non-executive director is from that date. therefore there is a risk that central management may override controls to intentionally misstate revenue transactions through inappropriate manual journal entries. this included analysing and selecting journals for testing which appeared unusual in nature either due to size, preparer or being manually posted. • based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identiﬁed in the paragraphs above. our procedures involved: journal entry testing, with a focus on manual journals and journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the business; enquiries of group management, internal audit; and focused testing, as referred to in the key audit matters section above. 82 | dignity plc annual report & accounts 2017 consolidated income statement for the 52 week period ended 29 december 2017 52 week period 53 week period ended

by prior year taxation items of £2.0 million which are not expected to recur. accordingly, the board believes that earnings per share calculated by reference to this underlying profit after taxation is also a useful indicator of financial performance. dignity plc annual report & accounts 2017 | 131 contact details and advisers overview 01 – 03 strategic report 04 – 43 governance 44 – 74 financial
