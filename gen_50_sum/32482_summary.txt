our managed cloud services are delivered from a network of fully owned data centres across the uk. we have again enjoyed a substantial increase in profitability over the year, driven by that organic and acquisitive revenue growth. after nearly 6 years of first class commitment and service, crawford beveridge has chosen not to stand for re-election as non-executive director at our forthcoming annual general meeting. we are well established as a major player in providing the flexible cloud solutions that businesses require. our server infrastructure business, delivering dedicated physical servers to customers, is run as one unit encompassing the rapidswitch and redstation brands. this was offset by administrative expenses rising at a slower rate than revenue which improved the segment’s ebitda percentage margin. as a result, the group spent £10.2m (2016: £12.4m) on assets, net of related finance lease drawdowns, trade creditor movements and non-cash reinstatement provisions. we have therefore added adjusted diluted eps and in particular the growth of this measure as a kpi. any diminution in the level of service could have serious consequences for customer acquisition and retention. in all cases these supplies are obtained from reputable organisations chosen after a thorough selection process. from 1992 to 2002 richard served as finance director of kingston scl, which provided administration and billing software to the mobile communications market, during which time he was involved in a management buy-out and subsequent trade sale of the company. immediately prior to joining iomart richard served as finance director of epoint group limited, a technology company based in scotland. during a 16-year career with deloitte llp, ian undertook roles within corporate finance and global advisory services. two directors will retire from office at the company’s forthcoming agm and stand for re-appointment. significant variances from plan are discussed at board meetings and actions set in place to address them. in line with best practice, we will also voluntarily submit this report to an advisory shareholder vote at the annual general meeting. • performance is assessed based on the achievement of profit targets in three years set with reference to our organic and acquisitive growth strategy. non-executive directors’ fees were reviewed during the year to ensure that they are appropriate for a company of our size and complexity. year ended 31march 2017 36 iomart group plc annual report and accounts 2017 2. accounting policies (continued) acquisitions of subsidiaries are dealt with by the acquisition method. consequently, these acquisition costs are included as administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. the group considers adjusted profit before tax to be a useful measure of performance because it eliminates the impact of certain non-recurring items associated with acquisitions and other charges commonly excluded from profit before tax by investors and analysts for valuation purposes. with the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. loans and receivables are measured subsequent to initial recognition at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. financial derivatives such as forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are carried at fair value through profit or loss subsequent to initial recognition. all other financial liabilities are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest-related charges recognised as an expense in finance costs through profit or loss. all goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. all share-based remuneration plans are ultimately recognised as an expense through profit or loss with a corresponding credit to ‘retained earnings’. the segment uses several routes to market including iomart cloud, rapidswitch, redstation, backup technology and systemsup. these calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the board covering a two-year period. the lease agreements are typically for periods of 2 to 3 years and do not have contingent rent or escalation clauses. the agreements have industry standard terms and do not contain any restrictions on dividends, additional debt or further leasing. year ended 31march 2017 61 iomart group plc annual report and accounts 2017 27. share based payments (continued) summary of share options that were
