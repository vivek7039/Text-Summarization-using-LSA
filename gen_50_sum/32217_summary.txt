limited (cal) the group was delighted cal joined us in december 2016. harpal singh and john phillips have done an excellent job in building a profitable business with an excellent reputation; their openness to improving both our businesses’ profitability is welcome. the group has had another busy year bringing on new clients while coping with changing market conditions. solicitors also generate

annual report 2017 our market over the period, housing transactions have declined significantly compared to the previous year, and are markedly below long term average levels. activity recovered through spring into the eu referendum vote, at which point things became markedly quieter, before some sort of recovery got underway in september. many homeowners find it unnecessary or too expensive to move up a rung on the ladder. changes to stamp duty haven’t helped certainly in london and have hindered other areas. the result of few people moving from one home to another is reduced housing stock for sale. uls is exploring ways to become more active in this market, which offers upside potential for the group. currently, it looks as though any initial referendum shock has largely worn off and business is returning to normal. from a positive point of view, firstly the housing market is already trading at low levels compared to historical norms. uls continues to successfully grow its strong relationships with many of these large specialist firms, through procuring many more new customers for them, and by building integrated technology links designed to make all parties’ involvement in the conveyancing process as straightforward and painless as possible. organic growth uls has very strong, successful and loyal business partners that make up its conveyancing distribution. for example, the group is now much more involved in procuring and servicing conveyancing needs for customers requiring and using an estate agent - both traditional estate agents, as well as those that trade online only. this is an important channel for uls to be invested in, as it provides scalability and a degree of control over longer term future new business volumes. acquisitions over the last year uls has been actively looking at potentially complementary acquisition opportunities. in addition, cal has been successful in forging a good proportion of its growth from providing estate agents with conveyancing related technology and services, a path that we have deliberately wanted to explore and grow into. strategic acquisition conveyancing alliance 15,170 completions in

clear strategy of growing market share, revenue and profit, through a combination of organic growth and tactical acquisition activity. uls technology annual report 2017 14 the group is pleased to report that it has successfully tailored and embedded its technology within hoa’s website and that this has delivered new conveyancing growth over the last year. uls has been pursuing complementary acquisition opportunities, and at the end of 2016, acquired conveyancing alliance holdings limited. cal is therefore the second channel that uls has acquired and will use to grow conveyancing market share in the estate agency sector, helping customers to access a breadth of choice at comparatively low cost, and move home as seamlessly as possible. uls technology annual report 2017 18 risk areas
