growth and record trading margins. 18 ferguson plc annual report and accounts 2017 group chief executive’s review continued 20% e-commerce now accounts for 20 per cent of group revenue at £3 billion we operate in large fragmented markets with strong growth characteristics the usa continues to be our largest market with the greatest opportunities for growth. professional contractors typically operate within about 20 miles of a local branch and may visit it several times per week. they deliver excellent customer service, develop strong relationships, maximise operational efficiencies and accelerate the adoption of new operating models. over the past year new incentive programmes have been re-developed in each business for branch and sales associates to ensure that high performance is well rewarded. in our uk business, where signiﬁcant change is underway, associate engagement survey scores have remained constant whilst participation has risen to over 70 per cent. kate was recently recognised by supply house times as one of the top women in industry for her achievements. besides supporting more efficient driving behaviours and optimising fuel consumption this also serves to increase the safety of our driver population. there are improved product lists and a quotation centre where customers can store their quotes, with improvements in quote-to-order functionality. we aim to have the best transactional e-commerce capability in our industry which is increasingly becoming a competitive advantage over smaller regional competitors. since the year end we have acquired two more b2c businesses, ac wholesalers and supply.com which generate £86 million of annualised revenue. these branches are served by six distribution centres providing same and next day product availability, a key service offering to our customers. for example, customers of our online business build.com can ﬁlter their product search to view products with recognised national environmental labels. liquidity the group maintains sufficient borrowing facilities to ﬁnance all investment and capital expenditure included in its strategic plan with an additional margin for contingencies. the development of new business models in our market place is closely evaluated – both for investment potential and threats. this was achieved by driving the beneﬁts of scale in sourcing, growing own label sales and through good pricing discipline. these technology systems, on which our branches, distribution centres and e-commerce businesses rely, may be disrupted for several hours or days. particular focus is being placed on quality control and assurance procedures to support the successful growth of own label sales. these changes are underway in all of our key markets, especially the uk, and will continue for several years. ms bamford has broad business experience having held senior advisory roles in both the uk and usa across a range of sectors. mr daly undertook various
