thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at £50,000, being 2% of total assets (2016: £50,000). materiality for the parent company financial statements was set at £45,000, being 2% of total assets (2016: £45,000). we also agreed to report differences below this threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. the group’s operations principally comprise exploration & evaluation of mining assets located in kazakhstan. these locations, which were subject to full scope audit procedures represent the principal business units. how the matter was addressed in our audit we evaluated management and board’s assessment of whether there were any facts or circumstances that would

to those ruling when the transactions took place. interest expense includes initial transaction costs and any premium payable on redemption, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is not settled; p liability components of convertible loan notes are measured as described further below; p trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using an effective interest method; p loans from related parties are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. kemin resources plc annual report 2017 notes to the financial statements continued year ended 31 december 2017 24 1. accounting policies continued exploration and evaluation assets exploration and evaluation assets comprise of exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred on projects where insufficient work has been performed to confirm whether significant mineralisation exists or whether the project is economically feasible. depreciation is provided to write off the cost of such assets other than land over their useful economic lives on a straight line basis. it is therefore reasonably possible that changes could occur which may affect the recoverability of assets. changes in estimates are dealt with on a prospective basis as they arise. management has considered whether any indicators of impairment have arisen over certain assets relating to the group’s exploration licenses. as a result there could be significant adjustments to the provisions established which would affect future results. those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows. as a result, tax liabilities are recognised based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. 8. investments the company has the following investments in subsidiary
