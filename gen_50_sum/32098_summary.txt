customers ﬁnd this balance. we would like to thank our employees for their continued dedication, commitment and hard work in delivering the full year results. we are conﬁdent that this level of debt will not reduce our ability to deliver growth, invest in products and/or make appropriate acquisitions. we achieve this through the rigorous application of our four-box model which has at its core direct engagement with customers to enable highly targeted product development and delivery. the remaining focus area is on it systems where our stated goal of driving standardization will take longer to deliver than originally anticipated. the teams have been reorganized with compensation and incentives changed to be targeted on delivering successful software implementations rather than more

manual systems management processes are past for any enterprise that needs to also innovate and compete. – meeting regulatory compliance requirements – to stay compliant, enterprises must have comprehensive monitoring, conﬁguration management controls and remediation capabilities in place. application containers organizations can improve business agility by adopting a software-deﬁned infrastructure approach to support containerization of their applications. as the weighted average contract duration reduces, we would generally expect to get a higher ‘in ﬁscal year yield’. good solid performance across all countries in the region together with closing of some large enterprise deals contributed to this outstanding growth. indirect represents customers that subscribe via the
