needs of consumers who are unable or unwilling to borrow from mainstream institutions through three distinct business divisions: branch- based lending, home credit and guarantor loans. we also welcome their recent high-cost credit review update in which they note: “consumers can benefit from using high-cost credit where repayments are sustainable and appropriate forbearance is shown if they have temporary repayment problems.” 1 whilst supportive of the fca’s objectives, we believe that any potential gains from additional regulation must always be measured against the cost of achieving them. we are pleased that the fca appears to have no major concerns regarding branch-based lending or guarantor loans. however, we do not believe it has provided any clear evidence that such harm or detriment exists in the home credit market. loans at home is the third largest home credit operator in the uk and each of our 1,000 self- employed agents is out seeing their customers every week, chatting about their lives, making sure they are on-track and, importantly, that nothing has changed that we need to know about. normalised revenue 100% non-standard finance plc annual report 2017 12

explanation liquidity the group may not be able to meet its financial obligations because it: • is unable to borrow to fund lending by its operating businesses • has failed to renew/replace existing debt facilities as they become payable • cannot fund growth and further acquisitions • the group’s short-term loans to customers provide a natural hedge against medium-term borrowings • the group successfully refinanced all of its bank facilities in august 2017 and raised additional long-term debt funding from a range of different providers • the new £225m loan facility is for six years and is supplemented by a £35m revolving credit facility • cash and covenant forecasting is conducted on a monthly basis as part of the regular management reporting exercise with net debt of c.£197m and total debt facilities of £260m at 31 december 2017 , the group has sufficient headroom on its existing facilities to fund the group’s growth plans in 2018. reputational lending money at high rates of interest means that consumer finance can attract a higher level of media and political scrutiny than certain other business sectors. nick teunon chief financial officer financial summary year ended 31
