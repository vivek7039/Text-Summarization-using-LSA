products to customers that combine hardware and software in one package. assurance acquisitions ncc group plc annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 may 2017 9 ncc ar2017 - proof

their customers are exposed to is more important than ever. the threat of being hacked or having valuable data stolen continues to evolve rapidly and at a seemingly unstoppable pace. management estimate that ncc group is one of the largest “pure play” cyber security companies focusing on services as opposed to products but yet has relatively low market shares in most segments and geographies. to avoid unnecessary cost increases or duplication of roles, there will be some “double-hatting” in smaller businesses as they grow. our unique offering sees us work with a full spectrum of clients from cyber security transformation to assessing the technology in autonomous next generation vehicles. for our commercial customers, we provide a world-class service in cyber incident response from situation management through to technical analysis and remediation. our dns, dhcp and ip address management (ddi) guard product help safeguard the network infrastructure of clients ranging from national telecommunications providers to international financial services firms. as investment increases with regard to cyber security, senior management are increasingly looking for key performance indicators which can be quantified. by focusing on higher value added services we will avoid growth for its own sake while simultaneously protecting our margins. they often rely on manual activity and disparate information systems that can lead to a lack of clarity in decision-making. by focusing on higher value added services we will avoid growth for its own sake while simultaneously

profit on disposal of open registry (also treated as an adjusting item). nearly one-third (30 per cent) of all nhs trusts were affected, with staff being forced to turn patients away and cancel appointments. how our business model enables this in these crisis situations, ncc group’s 24/7 security operations centres and managed services capability demonstrate their worth. in one specific case, a large-scale software testing project (referenced above) was already underway with staff deployed on the ground. ncc group understands that organisations are using an increased number of suppliers, and on-site audits for the whole supply chain is not financially or operationally feasible. ncc group has therefore developed a risk based approach to help organisations gain assurance that information security risks and requirements such as gdpr are managed effectively for their suppliers. lastly, any information about the attackers is used by our threat analysts as a starting point for further investigation into that attacker. many of the embedded computers present within vehicles have been connected to each other for years in closed on-board vehicle networks. how we will leverage this going forward most businesses rely on it applications to run important and critical functions within their organisation. in mss we are also shifting focus away from one part of the business that previously concentrated on simply reselling third party products often without value added after sales services. while we do see longer term value in this business, some of the revenue generating intangible assets have been slower than originally anticipated to generate revenues and a retained customer base. discretionary spend includes a number of new office locations that have either been acquired or moved into in the year ending 31 may 2017 . the group’s primary banking covenants are: z leverage limit of 2.5 times and this is calculated as adjusted ebitda / net debt. however, the group’s risk management programme can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that principal risks are managed to an acceptable level. if such rights are not sufficiently protected, the group could potentially no longer be able to offer a particular service in some or all countries. furthermore, as the group’s international footprint expands, there is an inherent risk of adverse foreign exchange movements affecting profitability. the rapid changes occurring in our marketplaces mean that a longer period would not have an acceptable level of forecasting accuracy. z all materials

evidence. intangible assets carrying value (including acquired intangibles, software and capitalised development costs) (recurring item: see note 1 1 to the financial statements). tax equalisation may also be considered if an executive is adversely affected by taxation due to their employment with the company. the committee’s policy is to offer service contracts for executive directors with notice periods of between six and twelve months exercisable by either party. although rob cotton’s service agreement provides for a 12 month notice period, it was mutually agreed that this would be reduced to a period of eight months’ garden leave, during which he would receive payment by monthly instalments equating to eight months’ salary, pension and car allowance (total of £399,600). all eligible employees, including executive directors, may be invited to participate on similar terms for a fixed period of three years. 1 16,714 shares were transferred out of treasury in order to satisfy options
