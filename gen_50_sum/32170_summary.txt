investment in primary care premises is an essential enabler for the necessary nhs transformations. jonathan murphy ceo overview a year of political disruption has contributed towards uncertainty in the financial and commercial property markets. despite this backdrop assura has continued to deliver superior risk adjusted returns built on a secure and long-term income stream funded by the nhs. firstly, we are typically able to source developments at an effective yield on cost that is 100 basis points higher than through acquisitions. we also maintain a database of every primary care property in the uk that enables us to identify and analyse potential acquisition opportunities. this was assura’s first issue in the us private placement market and demonstrates our ability to attract a new source of long-term funding at an attractive rate. more community pharmacists, nurse practitioners, physician associates and mental health therapists will operate from the primary care setting; however, if primary care premises do not have the capacity to host them, these desperately needed boosts to staffing levels simply cannot be achieved. in recent years investment has dropped to historically low levels despite a number of seemingly positive central initiatives. this integrated approach enables us to benefit both the tenants and our shareholders in securing lease renewals, property extensions or co-locating appropriate partners such as pharmacies. using the very latest in solar technology, it is designed to be carbon neutral, generating its own energy for heating and lighting. in order to measure ourselves against this objective we have a wide range of key performance indicators (“kpis”). firstly, total property return, which measures our success in choosing the right investments and managing these over time. this overriding objective is reflected in the long-term management incentive schemes implemented, with rewards linked to both tsr and nav growth over a three-year period. we also seek to promote from within and there have been several internal promotions during the past few years. in our most recent survey, over 95% of tenants who responded said they would recommend us as potential landlords to other gps. “ i have worked in conjunction with assura within my role as a practice manager for the past four years. www.assuraplc.com 29 strategic report

which generated an average uplift of 2.49% during the period. during the period we have secured 15 new tenancies with an annual rent roll of £0.4 million covering 4,377 square metres. it is expected that some proportion of dividends paid out in the 2017/18 financial year will need to include a pid element. simon laffin non-executive chairman 40 assura plc annual report and accounts 2017 we were delighted to confirm jonathan’s permanent appointment as ceo in february 2017. we also welcomed andrew darke, property director, to the board in october 2016, retaining responsibility for the property operations and developments. we have commenced the search for a new independent non-executive director who will join these committees and ensure that we comply with code provision b.1.2, which requires at least half the board to be independent, when a new finance director is appointed. jonathan was previously finance director for the fund management business of brooks macdonald and braemar group plc. however, specific pieces of work are commissioned by the audit committee to examine particular processes and controls as deemed necessary. 2016/17 also saw various changes in the structure of our executive board to reflect graham roberts’ very sad death. remuneration in 2017/18 we do not intend to alter our approach to executive remuneration in the forthcoming year, the main features of which will be:  base salaries: jonathan murphy’s and andrew darke’s base salaries will be £335,000 (unchanged) and £225,000 (increased by £5,000) respectively. our success is measured by three kpis:  total property return – measuring income and capital appreciation generated from the portfolio. however, for convenience we have set out opposite a summary of the policy’s key terms: remuneration

on appointment and then reviewed periodically or when an individual changes position or responsibility. pension/benefits a market competitive suite of benefits is provided, which are reviewed periodically to ensure that they remain appropriate. this means that awards rolled over (i.e. accrued but not vested) from previous measurement dates must sustain an 8% p.a. in accordance with guidelines set out by the investment association the company can issue a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling 10-year period to employees under all its share plans, with an inner 5% limit applying to discretionary plans. relative importance of spend on pay the table below sets out the overall spend on pay for all employees compared with the returns distributed to shareholders:

approached as follows:  graham received his usual pay, pension and car allowance plus contractual benefits up to his death. the board monitors these systems on an ongoing basis and this year’s review found them to be operating effectively. we also considered the reasonableness of other assumptions that are not so readily comparable to published benchmarks, such as estimated rental value and void
