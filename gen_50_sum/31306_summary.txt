the total number of safe man- hours now stands at over 1,444,850 man-hours without a lost time incident. work is also planned to upgrade the gas processing facilities, pipeline network and other

risk that commercially productive reservoirs will not be discovered. the group may not be able to develop, find or acquire reserves at acceptable costs. the group has established an ongoing relationship with such external technical consultants to ensure that technical management and planning is of a high quality in respect of all development activities on the group’s fields. financial

practices the group operates in ukraine, an emerging market, where certain inappropriate business practices may, from time to time occur, such as corrupt business practices, bribery, appropriation of property and fraud, all of which can lead to financial loss. in addition, office and site protection is maintained to protect the group’s assets. a prolonged period of low gas, condensate and lpg prices may impact the group’s ability to maintain its long-term investment programme with a consequent effect on growth rate, which in turn may impact the share price or any shareholder returns. in addition, these licences carry ongoing compliance obligations, which if not met, may lead to the loss of a licence. the group ensures compliance with commitments and regulations relating to its production licences through group procedures and controls or, where this is not immediately feasible for practical or logistical considerations, seeks to enter into dialogue with the relevant government bodies with a view to agreeing a reasonable time frame for achieving compliance or an alternative, mutually agreeable course of action. he began his career with shell international,
