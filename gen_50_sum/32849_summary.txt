reserves, with further resources targeted for underground operations. development prognoz is the largest undeveloped primary silver deposit in eurasia with an outstanding exploration upside (only 40% of known vein outcrop has been tested by drilling). most of these injuries occurred at sites where our crm system had not been fully implemented and this is now an urgent priority. overall, this new system has reduced injury risk and we hope will prevent repeat of past accidents in the future. both employees had more than 15 years’ experience working in hazardous conditions, including chemicals, cold climate, noise, vibration, dust and hard physical work. our new energy management system has been developed in compliance with iso-50001 and will be implemented across the company in 2018. following a feasibility study into alternative energy sources in 2017 , approval has been given for a solar power plant at svetloye and a wind farm at the seaport of unchi, with the aim of launching both during 2018. greenhouse gas emissions heat and electricity from our diesel generators, as well as our mining fleet operations, produce greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions. in particular accountants, geologists, dispatchers, engineers, inspectors, mechanics, quantity surveyors, editors, economists, energy specialists, legal advisors etc., and assistants to these positions. • adjusted ebitda 1 was us745 million, down 2% compared with 2016, as increased costs incurred due to a stronger russian rouble largely offset the production growth. adjusted ebitda also excludes the impact of certain accounting adjustments (mainly non-cash items) that can mask underlying changes in core operating performance. though income statement volatility may arise in financial reporting, polymetal believes that the underlying matching of revenue cash flows against debt repayments and related interest represents an economically effective hedging strategy. exploration spending is expected to stay elevated as polymetal will continue its aggressive drilling campaign at the prognoz silver project. companies in the mining sector are challenged with managing a rapidly changing risk landscape, including market volatility, widespread macroeconomic changes, geopolitical crises and environmental risks. chairman’s letter respect for our stakeholders, employees and the environment are all integral to making polymetal a profitable business. the board has determined jonathan best, christine coignard, leonard homeniuk, russell skirrow, tracey kerr and giacomo baizini to be independent non-executive directors. the challenge of succession recognised pressure for forthcoming board refreshment, and importantly that polymetal’s strong group ceo would be difficult to replace. it is our intention that deloitte will be invited to participate in this tender process, along with other appropriately qualified international audit firms. stringent psp vesting conditions, based on above median relative tsr and underpinned by positive absolute shareholder returns, are therefore fully aligned with shareholder- value creation. where a recoverability risk has been identified, we have recalculated the projected net realisable values based on expected commodity prices, technological recoveries and costs to complete. james leigh, fca for and on behalf of deloitte llp recognized auditor london 9 march
