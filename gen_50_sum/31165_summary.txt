another record year of profit, further demonstrating that our strategy of being diversified by sector and geography is working, with adjusted profit before tax growing 20% to £11.0m (2016: £9.2m). the group has also seen average staff numbers increase by 7% as we continue to invest in line with our leading brands strategy. progress: at 1.75 in 2017 we have seen a small decline on 1.79 in 2016, but this remains above all other years since 2013. staff productivity 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 1.73 1.72 1.73 1.79 1.75 key performance indicator adjusted profit before tax £11.0m 2016: £9.2m permanent

brands we have started to use our offshore recruitment outsourcing business in india to take over certain internal accounting processes, to deliver consistency, build scale and manage costs. this was an accounting loss only and meant we did not need to make any further cash injections. joost kreulen chief executive officer 13 march 2018 debt as a % of debtors this demonstrates how leveraged the group is. however, excluding this the underlying movement in net fee income was a reduction of 2%, due to lower sales within our insurance and technical & industrial brands. with this division operating at lower pay brackets, these changes have increased pressure on margins and projects are being managed to meet client service period restrictions. a key focus in the year has been on setting up new pilot bases for their largest client. there were additional bad debt write offs for historic issues and the uk base has been closed down. there is no legal restriction over this cash, but given the requirement to repay it over a three year period, when calculating our ‘debt to debtors’ ratio we exclude the cash held as pilot bonds, giving an adjusted net debt of £19.5m (2016: £15.7m) at year end. the £10.0m revolving credit facility is with hsbc bank plc, entered into for investment funding in 2016. connected to this facility is a £5.0m accordion arrangement which has been agreed in principle by the bank, but would need new credit approval for any draw down from this amount. during a downturn there is typically an unwinding of working capital as trade receivables are collected, so reducing the financing requirement and subsequent interest cost. an interest optimisation model allows currency balances (including overdrafts) to be included within the cash pooling arrangement. risk register this is reviewed by the board at each meeting with risks added, amended or removed as appropriate and actions updated. the group finances its operations by a combination of cash reserves from retained profit, bank borrowings and issuing new equity. the board gives due consideration to risks arising from social, environmental and ethical issues as part of its ongoing risk review process. staff also took part in a richmond park run to raise money for the royal marsden cancer charity. staff also took part in a richmond park run to raise money for the royal marsden cancer charity. all board meetings have a pre-agreed formal agenda setting out those matters for discussion, together with supporting papers. situations which may create a conflict of interest are presented to the board for review and approval as appropriate. any specific actions arising during meetings are agreed by the board and a follow-up procedure monitors their completion. no person has any special rights of control over the company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. all directors continue to serve in their roles and no other compositional changes were proposed by the nomination committee. shareholding guidelines there are no requirements for executive directors or senior executives to hold shares in the company. we determined that profit before tax is a key measure used by analysts in presenting business performance to users of the financial statements. • ‘other reserves’ represents the share based payment reserve of £0.6m (2016: £0.8m) and exchange differences on intercompany long-term receivables amounting (£1.3m) (2016: (£1.2m)) which are treated as a net investment in foreign operations. the impact of this change as at 31 december 2015 was £nil and therefore a ‘consolidated balance sheet’ for 2015 has not been presented. subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation) are recognised initially in other comprehensive income. the analysis of the group’s revenue and net fee income by client destination is set out below: year
