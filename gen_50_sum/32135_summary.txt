while every fuller’s beer and pub does stand proudly on its own – each an achievement in its own right – the fuller’s name tells you they have all been crafted with the same passion, care and attention to detail that we bring to everything we do. with more flavour coming in and a new piece of kit to play with, our brewers are experimenting even more than ever and that’s already resulted in a black ipa, which was part of the seasonal calendar for the spring. it will be a long term process, but i look forward to updating you on progress in the coming months and years. this has proved successful and we have provided permanent jobs for all those who completed the apprenticeship programme. craft beers also continued to perform well across the managed estate, with sales increasing of both fuller’s own range and those from other brewers. we have upgraded over 100 of our pub websites with fully responsive, mobile optimised sites where photography is at the heart. it is truly wonderful to see this grand old lady of herne hill once again proudly dominating the local scene. since acquiring the stable just three years ago, it has trebled in size, and now stands at 17 sites. brewer street is available only at fuller’s and we support those tenants that take it on by helping with a promotional starter kit. it still has a full flavour and is served colder, which appeals to today’s craft beer drinker. we have made a number of other improvements that have resulted in a positive impact on our efficiency, such as new electric forklift trucks with lower carbon emissions and changes to our loading bank to create more space and easier stock movement. in addition, we have added cornish orchards blush, with a hint of fresh raspberry, to our draught portfolio. the perfect delivery 29 we have a fleet of 29 branded delivery vehicles based in chiswick and horndean, hampshire f u l l e r ’ s c r a f t “ it’s the personal relationship we have with our customers that sets us apart. this is where our corporate social responsibility starts and those communities do not just revolve around geographical locations. shooting star chase is an amazing charity that helps improve the lives of children with life-limiting illnesses, both at home and in its two hospices. at the brewery, we have installed solar panels and converted to electric forklift trucks, which will reduce our carbon footprint. the perfect service 147 there are 147 service coaches working in our managed pubs and hotels f u l l e r ’ s c r a f t “ we might be living in a digital world, but you can never replace the human touch. and some of them have progressed even further up the fuller’s career ladder – with at least six former service coaches now managing their own pubs. taken together, these communications have allowed the group to engage successfully with all our employees, wherever they are employed. the group also has an equal opportunities policy which is designed to ensure that all employees are treated equally in terms of training, career development and promotion. griffin brewery chiswick lane south london w4 2qb registered in england under number: 241882 42 annual report and
