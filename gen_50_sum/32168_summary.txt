getting there faster doesn’t mean paying a small fortune – our flexible and competitive fares are designed with everyone in mind, from early planners to spontaneous types. margins are very tight in

including major shareholders, trade bodies, regulators, brokers, airports, suppliers and franchise partners. it is anticipated that salary increases will generally be in line with those awarded to salaried employees as a whole. awards can be granted as conditional shares or a nil/ nominal cost option vesting subject to the achievement of three-year performance conditions. a post- vesting holding period also applies, such that vested shares are not receivable in full until the fifth anniversary of grant. there is a three-year time bar on this malus provision, i.e. no award can be lapsed if the trigger event comes to light more than three years after its occurrence. it may, however, be necessary in some cases to make buy-out awards on terms that are more bespoke than the existing arrangements. sir timo anderson and elizabeth mcmeikan’s service agreements expire in 2017 but both have agreed with the c ompany to extend their appointments for a further three-year period. we have also evaluated the accuracy of useful economic lives and residual valuations, including assessing external source data for similar assets. t heir quantification can involve complex data flows
