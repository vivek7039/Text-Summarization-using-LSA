first-class proprietary technology, leading business intelligence capabilities and clear focus on operating in markets where it is legal to do so. this investment gives the group an entry into a rapidly growing market with enormous potential for profitable growth. this has been a very busy year for the group as we have integrated acquisitions, launched new products and adapted to regulatory changes whilst still delivering strong organic growth. in line with the group’s strategic focus, real money gaming ngr generated from stride’s proprietary platform increased by 39% to £48.6 million, accounting for 54% of group revenue (2016: pro-forma of 31% to £34.9 million accounting for 45% and reported: 73%). • continued strong organic growth • excellent performance with ngr from real money

professional advice with regard to its activities in its principal countries of operation including any changes in legislation, and monitors updates on any potential future jurisdiction where it may start accepting customers. it is therefore important that the group remains up to date with all changes affecting its tax position. for example, the system is designed to flag up immediately any unusual transactions such as high value and number of deposits in a day, deposits made in accounts which already have a significant balance and types of methods used for withdrawals especially where these differ from the deposit method. we anticipate some further margin improvement once acquisition earn-out periods conclude in the new financial year. this was stable year on year at 22% of ngr (2016: pro-forma 22%) despite the group’s continued investment in talent, software development, business intelligence and products in line with our vision to build a leading online gaming business. both of these amounts were settled post year end and therefore represent agreed balances. the board believes that adjusted basic earnings per share (excluding exceptional items such as impairment, contingent remuneration and consideration, acquisition costs, amortisation of intangible assets excluding those arising from internal development, share-based payments and associated taxes) enables a better understanding of the underlying business performance. reported results 31 august 2016 £’000 adjustment £’000 pro-forma results 31 august 2016 £’000 net gaming revenue – social gaming 12,825 —
