group at a glance making a difference across our chosen end markets our four business units provide unrivalled global, mobile connectivity to our customers 1,700+ employees 4 core values based in 50 locations across every continent passionate, open, enterprising, market-driven maritime government aviation enterprise inmarsat offers the most reliable and resilient communications solutions to the maritime industry. space debris in collaboration with several agencies around the globe, we continually monitor close approach of objects near our fleet. 2017 highlights 22 february 2017 inmarsat awarded uk space agency grant funding, to develop satellite application programmes that address pressing social concerns in nigeria, the philippines and indonesia. inmarsat-5 f4 (‘i-5 f4’) was launched by spacex on a falcon 9 rocket from historic launch pad 39a at nasa’s kennedy space center in florida. broadband data is increasingly becoming a mission-critical enabler of our customers’ businesses, to help drive their commercial and operational progress. we expect inmarsat’s core global maritime, aviation and government mobility markets will remain relatively well insulated from this threat. we now have more than 10,000 ships after a challenging year in 2016, which continued into q1 2017 , maritime delivered three consecutive quarters of sequential growth, including year-on-year

end of 2017, 624 installed fx vessels were with our distribution partners (q3: 423, q2: 243, q1: 97). inmarsat has also extended its innovation in the high mobility government l -band market with products and services tailored to specific customers’ needs, further enhancing military satellite systems. consequently, government agencies’ operational reliance on commercially-provided space-based capabilities is expected to become an increasingly common feature of the industry. over the medium term, we expect to transition a portion of these customers onto gx for aviation ifc services. during the year, several customers made progress with their gx terminal installation programmes, including deutsche lufthansa group, and we continue to support them in preparation for active service. in recent years, inmarsat has successfully established a land-based commercial mobile satellite services business focused on providing highly portable satellite communications services to remote communities and/or for use when terrestrial networks are not available, for example, in diverse sectors such as first response, media, aid, mining and construction and other areas. establishing reliable communications is essential to coordinating relief efforts and keeping emergency responders safe in dangerous, sometimes hostile environments. this new satellite technology will be able to deliver a significant step-up in throughput and capacity into key regions of high demand at low cost. the gx network, based on our four inmarsat-5 satellites in ka-band, is fully operational and has been revenue generating since 2016. our fourth gx satellite, launched in 2017, provides in-orbit redundancy and additional capacity and central services results year ended 31 december 2017 m 2016 m

inmarsat’s financial results in 2017 , in particular the delivery of further revenue growth during the year, supported by our ongoing focus on ensuring the group maintains a strong and flexible balance sheet, helped us to further develop a strong platform for future growth highlights 5.4% increase in group revenue (5.5)% decrease in adjusted ebitda › adjusted eps of 0.42 cents › net debt to

restructuring (19.9) – – ebitda 731.5 794.8 (8.0%) inmarsat plc | annual report and accounts 2017 38 strategic report | chief financial officer’s review due to the i-5 f4 and s-band satellites coming into commercial service in the fourth quarter of 2017. as a result of these factors, and lower adjusted ebitda, operating profit for 2017 decreased by 125.6m compared with 2016. net financing cost on an underlying basis net financing costs increased by 13.1m from 86.3m in 2016 to 99.4m in 2017 due to the higher average level of borrowings during the year. borrowings exclude accrued interest and any derivative liabilities 4 non-cash movements relate to the amortisation of deferred financing costs chief financial officer’s review continued based on current management plans, infrastructure capex is expected to meaningfully moderate after 2020 inmarsat plc | annual report and accounts 2017 40 strategic report | chief financial officer’s review capital expenditure the increase in capital expenditure on major infrastructure projects in 2017 relates to continued investment in the gx and i-6 satellite infrastructures. future guidance we are targeting mid-single digit percentage revenue growth (excluding ligado) on average over the next five years, with ebitda and free cash flow generation (both excluding ligado) expected to improve steadily as a result of the combined impact of this growing revenue base, an improved revenue mix, tightly managed overhead costs and new, lower cost, satellite technologies being implemented that we expect to drive a meaningful moderation in our annual infrastructure capex over the medium-term. following a wide-ranging review of our current performance management process, and reviewing external best practice, we have redefined our performance management process and principles and have outlined a new ‘be your best’ approach that will be launched in early 2018. alongside this, we have redefined our total reward philosophy approach for launch also in 2018. the hr team has also continued its own transformation journey to delivering excellence for the organisation it serves. in fact, our analysis shows that if we had equal numbers of men and women at each organisational level, the gap would be reduced to 8.5%. in 2017 we expanded our entry routes into inmarsat for those at the start or early stages of their career. utilising targetjobs for graduate hiring we are partnering with them and other engineering employers on their future female engineer days to bring more women into the sector. the diligence applied by our workforce to consider risk is reflected in business cases which are submitted for approval and ongoing projects have risks reported on a regular basis. › we have launched fleet one to support smaller fishing vessels and offer ‘cyber as a service’, both of which provide additional market opportunities for us. › through our one it project we are building a modern computer infrastructure that enhances protection of critical assets and data. we must agree how it is used in coordination with other satellite operators and need to coordinate its ongoing availability. we may lose highly technical and specialist employees who have very specific skill sets that are vital to the business. the diversity already on our board allows us to be culturally aware and respond where there are areas which need greater focus. during 2017, the board met eight times, with one of those meetings being held over two days in washington dc. business plan approval and procurement process procedures also strengthen the review of contractual commitments before any such commitment is agreed to. each director’s individual experience and background is taken into account in developing a programme tailored to his or her own requirements. whilst the chairman takes ultimate responsibility for this, each director is expected to ask about any specific training needs. in appointing non-executive directors, the board’s practice is to use a combination of external consultants and personal referrals. the committee’s terms of reference have been updated to reflect best practice, and can be found on our website. with several significant changes to ifrs reporting being implemented, the committee received detailed briefings and updates from management regarding progress. it presents its reports at each meeting covering updates on internal audit activities, results of audits and follow-up actions required. 500+ meetings or conference calls with analysts and institutions in 2017 inmarsat plc | annual report
