management’s overall estimate in respect of the purchase price allocation to be reasonable. cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. subsequent to initial recognition, separately intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. this class of intangibles are amortised over their useful lives using the straight-line method, which is estimated at six to eight years, based on management’s expectations and client experience. when a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. the normalised effective tax rate of 16.0% (2016: 16.5%) is in line with prior year due to adjustments being £184k where it was £624k for 2016. sanne-ar2017 back-proof13.indd 102 23/03/2018 16:28:08 25754 – 23 march 2018 2:55 pm – proof 13 103 stock
