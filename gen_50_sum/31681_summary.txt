young people. delivering a safe and secure support of very high quality, ensuring that all our service users enjoy extraordinary days, every day. we also have an outstanding track record for diverting people away from acute care and supporting them in their own homes. these services are highly intensive operations with exceptional staff ratios and include on site or dedicated educational facilities. national presence caretech is very well known as a care company in public ownership that operates throughout england, scotland and wales. i am always drawn to the achievements of our excellent front line staff, which is inevitable as we are first and foremost a care organisation. we plan to introduce another caretech sharesave scheme in 2018 as this is one part of our staff retention strategy. this is where caretech has developed its provision and helps to explain why spending cuts have had minimal impact on the group. this ensures that caretech is in a very strong position to address the demands of our evolving marketplace. nationwide locations the caretech strategy is to offer a strong national presence with local brands and regional service delivery points.

accommodation, community support service users and children that foster carers can currently look after. this ensures that caretech is in a very strong position to address the demands of our evolving marketplace. our adult services offer a solid and reliable provision across the whole spectrum of service offerings which now includes acquired brain injuries and we see a particular volume demand in the area of supported living, balanced by renewed demand for more specialised residential care solutions. conversely, resources for those with the highest level of need are being maintained and increased in some local authorities. we have an outstanding track record for helping people away from acute care and supporting them in their own homes. however, this is changing as the nhs drives to lower bed capacity and accelerated early discharge from acute psychiatric hospital care. it is generally held that fostering in an ordinary family home delivers better quality than any residential setting. our market intelligence suggests that most, if not all, independent sector fostering agencies are still experiencing some degree of “hold back” at present. however, it is also clear that local authorities fail to undertake a full cost analysis of their in-house provision. we can now bridge that gap by supporting young people as they make the transition to adult life. however, both eql solutions and dawn hodge associates faced a challenging start to the new learning sector year. considering non-financial values such as reputation, employee commitment and service user fulfilment helps us develop longer-term opportunities, ultimately adding to the financial bottom line. this year there has been significant policy development and we see some indicators that local authorities have recognised the need to maintain or grow their social care budgets. however, we are mindful about acquisition and have robust criteria which must be satisfied to ensure that any acquired business fits our long-term strategic objectives. haroon sheikh chief executive officer 18 december 2017 strategic review governance – – financial statements caretech holdings plc – annual report and accounts
