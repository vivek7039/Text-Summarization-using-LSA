dr paul golby, cbe freng chairman chairman’s statement nats holdings limited annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report | 09 progress chief executive’s review martin rolfe overall we made good progress in implementing our strategic objectives this year and achieved all but one of the priorities we set ourselves. we faced similar operational challenges when particularly high demand coincided with the introduction of new systems (e.g. itec) into our operation. the group also pays other taxes such as employer’s national insurance contributions and business rates, which are significant costs. more information on our pension arrangements and their governance is provided in note 30 to the consolidated financial statements. this mainly reflected a deterioration in financial market conditions, principally from lower gilt yields, which was only partially offset by investment returns. the uk en route business also benefits from some protections against traffic volume risk afforded by its price control conditions. for nerl, kpis are largely aligned with the single european sky (ses) key performance areas ensuring management focus on meeting safety, service quality, environmental and cost efficiency targets. a number of the metrics are also used to set targets for remuneration purposes and so align incentives with business objectives. the increase in airprox overall was driven by events involving remotely piloted aircraft systems (rpas or drones), none of which are attributable to nats (see graph). we also seek to optimise operational staff performance through annual training, competency assessments and the development of new systems. it will also modernise prestwick lower airspace including manchester and scottish tma as part of a joint programme with airports. these services are mainly provided through the project marshall contract which is being delivered in partnership with thales by our aquila joint venture. if this does not proceed in a timely manner, supported by clear government policy, then uk airspace will reach capacity limits causing increasing delay and constraining aviation growth. also, the group’s air traffic services operate under a european regulatory regime which requires key performance targets to be met. financial market conditions since the 2015 valuation, characterised by historic low real gilt yields in particular, have continued to be a challenge for most uk defined benefit pension schemes. as explained above, nerl has traffic volume risk- sharing arrangements that mitigate revenue reductions to a large extent. every effort is made to maintain good employee relations at all times, including through our working together programme and through joint working groups as part of an employee relations improvement project, to ensure the delivery of an efficient operational service and associated support. together with our joint venture partner, thales, we are committing more resources in 2017/18 to re-plan and execute the delivery schedule for asset provision. ferronats secured atc contracts at andorra - la seu d’urgell, lleida and córdoba airports, which are yet to transfer from the incumbent service provider. certain environmental performance metrics in the table above as at 31 march 2017 have been subject to external assurance by pricewaterhousecoopers llp (pwc). for calendar year 2016 we achieved a 3di score of 30.3, which was within the economic regulator’s service performance range. an engineer by training, martin holds a master’s degree in aerospace systems engineering from the

matters. however, as with all such systems, internal controls can provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against misstatement or loss. the company also takes external advice on various aspects of remuneration policy and competitive pay levels from independent consultants. cash alternative payments of £60,000 are included in his salary and fees for the financial year ended 31 march 2017

investments held at the balance sheet date and comparing their value to supporting documentation. our audit testing of operating cash flows included comparing forecasts to recent financial performance and budgets approved by the board. in addition we have tested a sample of externally generated assets to test existence and that costs are materially accurate. we also agreed to report differences below this threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. if this is deemed impracticable at the date of initial application, an adjustment will be reflected in retained earnings. inter-segment transfers or transactions are entered into under the normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available to unrelated third parties. all qualifying capital
