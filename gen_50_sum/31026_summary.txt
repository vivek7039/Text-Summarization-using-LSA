extrusion technology hpp driving benefits throughout production and distribution see page 19 for more zotefoams plc annual report 2017 04 zotefoams produces high-technology foams for a range of everyday applications around the world. softer foams offer unique sealing properties in many applications such as white goods or other very demanding environments. all business segments reported strong sales growth and our pipeline of commercial opportunities developed positively throughout the year. investments the first phase of investment, hp1, at our site in kentucky, usa has now been successfully commissioned, increasing group high-pressure autoclave capacity by over 20%. we are pleased to announce that doug robertson will be replacing richard as the senior independent director upon his departure. key investments zotefoams’ core autoclave technology is asset intensive with high barriers to entry on cost, lead-time and know-how. this positions kentucky as a significant, stand- alone contributor to group capacity, initially focused on azote ® polyolefin foams, with the site large enough for further investment if needed. we therefore emerge as a better-informed organisation, more capable of managing similar investments in the future, whilst recognising that risks to execution remain on large and complex capital projects. the operational leverage impact of higher sales, while operating at capacity, meant that profits increased significantly in an environment of modest labour cost increases and stable prices for ldpe, our main raw material, despite a more difficult inflationary environment in some other materials and energy. our licensing business mucell extrusion llc (‘mel ’) licenses a patented process that creates ‘micro-bubbles’ in the core of plastic parts or products by injecting gas into them as they are manufactured. we are often working in conjunction with a channel partner and/or on applications where other solutions may be successful. mel faces some similar challenges in working mainly with packaging converters who need to convince their end- user customers of the benefits provided. better healthcare has created a population boom, especially in the older age groups, while globally, discretionary spending power is rising rapidly. zotefoams’ products typically use less plastic than competitive solutions due to the cell structure of foam made in our autoclave process, giving us both a cost and environmental advantage. in order for return on capital to provide meaningful measurement, management has, therefore, altered the definition to recognise the changing financial structure of our business, where a) revolving credit facilities are treated as long-term debt, and b) major capacity and infrastructure investments, such as in walton, ky , which are expected to require considerable capital over a number of years before being commissioned as production assets, are excluded from these calculations until the point of commissioning. over the past three years we have developed our existing site in walton, ky, usa with buildings, infrastructure, a large, high-pressure autoclave and extrusion capability. zotefoams plc annual report 2017 16 producing best-in-class solutions azote ® foams have been selected by an italian defence contractor for use in a series of ultra-hi-tech unmanned crafts. the chosen materials deliver industry-leading fire resistance, lightweight and consistent quality, all made possible using zotefoams’ nitrogen-based autoclave technology. this physical expansion process differentiates zotefoams from competitors manufacturing similar foams with low-density polyethylene (‘ldpe’), which is our main raw material. automobile manufacturers have ambitious plans to produce more than a hundred new electric and battery powered models in the next couple of years. zotek ® n nylon foams can withstand the higher operating temperatures generated from conventional engine and battery packs, which are typically used on hybrid vehicles. t-fit ® clean was developed as a unique thermal insulation system designed for these demanding, highly controlled production environments. energy cost increases, together with, for the most part, non-recurring inventory adjustments in hpp and mel, held back some of this margin gain. distribution and administrative costs the group continues to pursue its expansion strategy, founded on proprietary cellular-materials technology with an increasing portfolio of differentiated products. a principal risk is one that has the potential to affect significantly our strategic objectives, financial position or future performance. the group has invested in its kentucky, usa site, which provides multi-site capability, subject to capacity, on many polyolefin products. the group is operationally geared and its experience is that, in challenging circumstances, operational labour costs can be reduced, polymer prices generally fall with reduced economic demand, giving a cost benefit, and cash can be generated from both reducing working capital as well as slowing capital expenditure projects to help offset the effects of a downturn. risk group revenues and profits could be impacted by the loss, insolvency or divergence of interest with a major customer. these relationships, with balanced commercial contracts, are by their nature longer term, providing a unique technical solution and competitive advantage to the zotek ® foams customers. fig 3. role by gender as at 31 dec 17 female male
