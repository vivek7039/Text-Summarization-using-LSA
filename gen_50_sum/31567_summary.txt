we made a further important acquisition in august, of halarose, an electoral back office software and services business that has significantly enhanced our elections’ capabilities. £m 27.2 accrued income adjustments relating to accounting irregularities identified by finance team (2.8) treatment of certain 6pm licences (see below) (1.0) contracts missed 2017 cut off (4.8) increased audit fees (0.1) 18.5 the miss of the originally expected ebitda target of £27.2m by £8.7m can be summarised as follows: management had an expectation that 6pm licences would be able to be recognised at a point in time and had budgeted for revenue in this way. idox has an exceptionally strong market position in the public sector, a sound balance sheet, and multiple opportunities for growth. “the best thing about idox is that we have a network of specialists who all bring different skills, personalities and experiences to projects. this will be completed during h1 2018 and implemented by the end of 2018. it is expected to have an initially negative impact on revenues as a result of increased saas pricing although this is expected to have a medium-term benefit. the total number of customer solutions has now exceeded over 100. building on this, consultation has begun on the next generation of web based solutions for local government which is scheduled for delivery in incremental stages starting in 2019 through to 2020. overall, we have continued to see further market share gains with 108 new local authority customers, 7 new system sales and 11 managed service customers. they represent our long-term investment in smart city solutions, which we believe represents an attractive opportunity for the group. digital the digital business had an unexciting year in revenue terms but was very proud to have completed and delivered new designs and approaches for a diverse customer base including the church of england, as well as several well- known premier league football clubs. the investment strategy will result in an increased focus on our web cloud and smart city solutions. the new technology needed to facilitate improved citizen engagement and drive efficiencies by delivering a fully integrated, end-to-end service. another factor which increased etr was the non-recognition of losses incurred in malta, owing to uncertainty over their future utilisation. these losses will be recognised where their likelihood of utilisation increases, with any future recognition resulting in a decrease to etr. risk management processes and internal control procedures are established within business practices across all levels of the organisation. a diversified geographical footprint and sector focus reduces the risk of exposure due to adverse country or sector-specific conditions. regular business continuity plans are updated and delivered to the board on at least an annual basis. the group is also affected by economic environments in other territories, which include currency volatility, inflation and recession. signed on behalf of the board by: richard kellett-clarke chief executive officer 28 february 2018 21 company information

investments, bank loans and items such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations. the group has minimal exposure to foreign exchange risk as a result of natural hedges arising between sales and cost transactions. significant variances from budget or strategy are discussed at board meetings and actions set in place to address them. two directors will retire from office at the group’s forthcoming annual general meeting and stand for re-appointment. we are aware that external valuation specialists have been used to perform the valuations of each acquisition. we gained 100% full scope coverage over the carrying value of goodwill and business combinations - acquisitions key audit matters. management have estimated that a range of 1 to 5 years is more appropriate depending on the future revenue projected for each individual asset. all new capitalised development is reviewed on an individual project basis and management will select the most appropriate rate of amortisation for each asset. management may exercise judgements over various elements of a contract, for example: • whether there are ongoing obligations relating to software licences which would require the revenue to be recognised over time rather than at a point in time • whether performance obligations are separable or bundled • whether it is appropriate to recognise revenue on certain contracts such as service agreements, prior to an invoice being raised, where work has been completed and there is a high degree of certainty of the contract being completed and the invoice raised and cash received. with the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. no adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options that have vested are not exercised. deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. exchange adjustments arising are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve and reported in other comprehensive income. 6 finance income and costs 2017 £000 2016 £000 interest receivable 6 4 insurance income – 8 dividends receivable 24

repayments were processed in 2017, not previously provided for, in respect of historic r&d claims covering the reading room group and idox health ltd. these downward pressures on etr were mitigated by impairment, acquisition costs and the non-recognition of overseas losses. these losses will be recognised where their likelihood of utilisation increases, with any future recognition resulting in a decrease to etr. the decision was made to derecognise these assets until there is more certainty over their future utilisation. for value-in-use calculations, the growth rates and margins used to estimate future performance are based on financial year 2018 budgets (as approved by the board) which is management’s best estimate of short term performance based on an assessment of market opportunities and macro-economic conditions. where trade receivables are past due, an assessment is made of individual customers and the outstanding balance. the group has minimal exposure to foreign exchange risk as a result of natural hedges arising between sales and cost transactions. 80 idox plc annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 october 2017 book value £000 provisional fair

group revenue and a profit after tax of £1,310,000. during the year end audit process, it was identified that £1.5 million of historic adjustments were made to offset share option reserve impact of share option exercises against fixed asset investment cost rather than a transfer to the retained earnings reserve. we have obtained sufficient audit evidence to conclude that the carrying value of
