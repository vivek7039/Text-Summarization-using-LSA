apple market challenge entered its 11th year and has involved over 6,500 children since its inception in 2006. this is run in conjunction with the sixth form students at a business enterprise school, ursuline high school wimbledon. as part of this process an updated board diversity policy has been adopted, which is described in greater detail within the nomination committee report. andrew strang, henry staunton and graeme gordon have each served on the board for more than six years. each of these directors has also confirmed that there is no reason why they should not continue to be considered independent. these are often combined with site visits and provide an opportunity for the non-executive directors to meet senior management. variable remuneration includes an annual bonus, half of which is deferred in shares, and awards under the performance share plan (“psp”). each year participants may be granted up to 350 per cent of salary in awards or nil cost options. long-term incentives as mentioned above, the performance conditions for the psp currently comprise two measures: ◦ three-year relative total return (tr, growth in nav per share plus dividends); and ◦ three-year relative total shareholder return (tsr, increase in price of an ordinary share plus dividends). nav is used as a performance measure by over half of ftse350 property companies in their long-term incentive arrangements. the company’s nav is based on independent external valuations carried out in accordance with rics valuation professional standards. fixed pay £’000 annual bonus long-term incentives 0

existing components of remuneration, as follows: element of remuneration policy on recruitment maximum opportunity salary based on scope and nature of responsibilities of the proposed role; the candidate’s experience; implications for total remuneration positioning vs. market pay levels for comparable roles; internal relativities; and the candidate’s current salary. the chairman and non-executive director fees are reviewed on an annual basis, with any increase taking effect from 1 may. – for income statement line items that are deemed to be of particular relevance, we applied a lower materiality. lease payments are allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant financing rate. depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over an asset’s estimated useful life. unallocated expenses consist primarily of costs incurred centrally which are neither directly nor meaningfully attributable to individual segments. at each reporting date appropriately qualified employees of the group verify all significant inputs and review computational outputs. the inputs underlying the valuations include market rent or business profitability, likely incentives offered to tenants, forecast growth rates, yields, ebitda, discount rates, construction costs including any site specific costs (for example section 106), professional fees, planning fees, developer’s profit including contingencies, planning and construction timelines, lease re-gear costs, planning risk and sales prices based on known market transactions for similar properties or properties similar to those contemplated for development. 2 in accordance with the initial recognition exemption provisions under ias 12 ‘income taxes’, no deferred tax is recognised o n
