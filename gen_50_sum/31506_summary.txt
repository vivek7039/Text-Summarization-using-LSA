whilst these forward-looking statements are made in good faith, they are based upon the information available to tax systems at the date of this report and upon current expectations, projections, market conditions and assumptions about future events. we look forward to extending our technology offering by way of continued product development and targeted acquisitions. new order intake was driven by additional technology modules, increased user licenses and cross selling other portfolio solutions to existing customers. new solutions and services launched in the year included ‘data entry’ which is designed to help accountancy firms streamline the process of collecting information from data owners, and a new service to help organisations with country- by-country reporting. i am very pleased with the way employees have embraced change and would like to thank everyone for their contribution. chief executive officer’s review gavin lyons 248502 tax systems pp01-pp05 17/05/2018 10:55 page 04 strategic report 05 tax systems plc annual report 2017 osmo is a leading provider of automated data extraction services that currently connects to 310 versions of accounting software packages, whether they be cloud, on premise or enterprise versions. osmo’s solution is an ideal add-on to the existing software and services that tax systems already provides. we have one final stage of the integration left which is moving osmo’s core it systems and processes onto our standard operating platform within shared services. uk debt levels were at £1,720 billion for the financial year ending march 2017 which represented 86.7% of gross domestic product (“gdp”). ultimately, as with any data project, this will end up with the regulator wanting to consume more and more data so that they can digest it and analyse how best to monetise the facts presented. preparing for future workload: due to the changing regulatory and media landscape, businesses need ensure they have an appropriate tax function in place that is capable of dealing with the increased pressure and workloads arising from external compliance and reporting, an increasing requirement for internal advice relating to strategic activities as well as increasing internal governance demanding effective processes. co-sourcing is a hybrid whereby the business has the benefit of controlling and managing its core end to end compliance cycle using technology that they own but still use an external advisor for what would be considered ‘value add’ and complex areas. since then our solutions have been continually developed and shaped to serve the evolving needs of corporation tax departments. 248502 tax systems pp06-pp17 17/05/2018 10:57 page 10 strategic report 11 tax systems plc annual report

but concluded that, in the short term, alternative acquisition options were our preference. at 31 december 2017, the group’s balance sheet includes deferred income of £6.9m in relation to contracts where outcomes are being delivered over time. adjusted ebitda is defined as operating profit or loss before exceptional items, depreciation, amortisation and share-based payments. governmental

governance 18 tax systems plc annual report 2017 board of directors gavin lyons (40) chief executive officer (“ceo”) gavin is responsible for the planning, setting and execution of the group’s strategy as well as identifying and evaluating acquisition opportunities. prior to accumuli plc, gavin was head of telecoms & utilities at sap uk&i, the global market and technology leader in business management software. gavin has experience of p&l ownership with both independent software vendors and service providers. kevin has completed a number of corporate transactions, including two business sales to private equity. before joining tax systems, kevin has worked with monitise plc and was cfo at bonded services group. paul gibson (53) non-executive director paul gibson is a partner in mxc capital limited and has had a highly successful career in the tmt sector, most recently as chief operating officer of advanced computer software plc (“acs”) prior to its acquisition by vista equity partners for £725m. areas of expertise paul has over 25 years’ software specific operational, financial, commercial and m&a experience. the ceo and cfo are engaged under service contracts which require a notice period of six months. the group is committed to employment policies which follow best practice, based on equal opportunities for all employees, irrespective of ethnic origin, religion, political opinion, gender, marital status, disability, age or sexual orientation. based on our professional judgement, we determined overall materiality for the group financial statements as a whole to be £350,000, which represents 5% of adjusted ebitda (2016: £300,000). where considered appropriate performance materiality may be reduced to a lower level, such as, for related party transactions and directors’ remuneration. errors below that threshold would also be reported to it if, in our opinion as auditor, disclosure was required on qualitative grounds. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. this represents a change in accounting policy for software licences as a consequence of adopting ifrs 15. previously the group’s policy had been to recognise revenue from software licences predominantly on commencement of the licence period. contracts for the sale of professional services can be contracted on a time and materials or fixed fee basis. 2.4. segmental reporting an operating segment is a component of the group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the group’s other components. separately acquired licences have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. 248502 tax systems pp39-pp78 17/05/2018 11:08 page 42 financial statements 43 tax systems plc annual

they are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of reporting period date. the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. the group may issue new shares or realise value from its existing investments and other assets as deemed necessary. 248502 tax systems pp39-pp78

no further credit risk provision required in excess of that stated above for doubtful receivables. other receivables principally comprise deposits and non-interest bearing loans in respect of the ltip holders (see note 29). the ltip is implemented by way of an employee growth shares scheme in t ax systems holdings limited. judgement is also involved in selecting appropriate discount rates for
