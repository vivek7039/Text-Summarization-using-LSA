great progress in implementing its strategy for growth. in addition, a number of initiatives have been progressed during the year to optimise the value of existing assets including investments to improve our revenue management systems and processes and our customers’ online booking experience. further refinements to our hotel development processes and design standards will deliver a lower risk, higher performing model for new projects. this significant increase in our owned estate, together with new franchised hotels opened in brussels, amsterdam arena and amsterdam zaandam (and with others on the way), is providing an ever more solid foundation for our strengthening brand. a programme to refresh two of three legacy owned assets (croydon and glasgow) will be completed within the coming months and we expect to see a similar positive impact on the revenues of those hotels. outlook whilst the wider macroeconomic uncertainty continues to impact consumer confidence, we believe easyhotel is well positioned. jonathan lane obe non-executive chairman 5 december 2017 summary • trading slightly ahead of board expectations and particularly strong across newly opened hotels • growth strategy underpinned by high quality pipeline and strong asset-backed balance sheet • disciplined and well-financed approach taken to deployment of capital with strict investment criteria 3 easyhotel plc annual report and accounts 2017 chairman’s statement continued focus summary • strong trading across existing hotels • continued outperformance against our competitive set • excellent progress achieved across all areas of the business • five new hotels opened and trading strongly • positive customer reaction to stylish new easyhotel format • significantly accelerated pipeline in place to deliver long-term shareholder value strategy i am delighted to be leading this ambitious business at such an exciting time in its history. 2016/17 was a significant year for easyhotel with excellent progress achieved across all areas of the business. with the experienced team we now have in place, continued high levels of staff engagement and improving customer satisfaction, we are in an excellent position to expand the easyhotel brand and deliver improving returns for our shareholders. the new booking engine and revenue management system rollout, together with selling an allocation of rooms via selected online travel agencies (otas), resulted in our owned hotels significantly outperforming their competitive set (as measured by str) throughout the year. we have started a £1.5m refurbishment of our other two legacy owned assets in croydon and glasgow, to improve the quality of the hotels and to bring them into line with our new brand look. 4 easyhotel plc annual report and accounts 2017 transforming our business strategic report chief executive officer’s review together with leased hotel projects, considered on a limited and specific basis where the acquisition of a suitable freehold site is not currently available or does not meet our investment return targets, and our new franchised hotels, which are delivering more fees than initially anticipated, we expect to deliver a 15% unlevered blended roce at group level. consequently, the board is considering its financing options, which may include new equity and debt, to fund these opportunities. having appointed a new senior team last year, to ensure that we have the right breadth of talent in place to deliver our growth plans going forward, our focus this year has been on ensuring that all our team members feel valued and recognised and have the opportunity and support to reach their full potential. with such an exciting future, it is perhaps not surprising that our staff engagement score was 82% during the year. i’m confident that, together, we can continue to deliver on our strategic objectives in the months and years ahead. • customer needs are relatively simple: a great bed, well-trained, friendly staff and well-designed rooms. a weak pound would be expected to increase staycations and inbound tourism, benefiting our predominantly uk based business.
