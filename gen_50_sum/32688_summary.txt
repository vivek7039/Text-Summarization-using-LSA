following a period of significant growth and transactional activity these priorities underline our ongoing ambition to become the uk’s leading income focused reit. progress against our medium‑term financial targets has been positive with key metrics largely on target or moving in the right direction. with growing global appetite for predictable income returns, we believe our income‑led strategy to deliver market leading shareholder distributions remains extremely attractive. significant progress has been made in strengthening our balance sheet and we will continue to target a lower leverage structure over time. annual report 2017 14 targets risks (1) key performance indicators link to remuneration (2) outcomes income focused portfolio • high quality portfolio • limited volatility through

reporting format is now presented in line with industry accepted environmental performance indicators. in 2017, redefine international celebrated its tenth anniversary since listing and to commemorate this milestone, the company undertook a community project called “ten for 10”. significant progress was however made on the eight hotels under third party management, which given their relative size should make a material difference. a minimum epc rating level of d will be sought for planned refurbishments and upgrade works to our portfolio assets. annual report 2017 53 strategic report

specific end use of procured energy and water. with each part of the legislative value enhancement (“lve”) process working actively with one another in equilibrium, redefine international is sure to maintain its lve process and broaden key areas of focus as and when required to maximise the opportunity presented by legislative compliance. we target 100 per cent compliance with energy performance
