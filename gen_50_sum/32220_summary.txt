(“multi-product”) in order to redefine the boundaries between existing products, and combinations of products, and redefined how aume is measured for this new category. when recruiting staff early in their careers some subsequent attrition is inevitable, but this also creates a growing pool of alumni with whom we maintain strong relationships. a full reconciliation of new and historic classifications is provided on page 103. record plc annual report 2017 strategic report 14 the group was founded over 30 years ago, and over this time it has developed a leading position in managing currency for institutional clients. these strong operational capabilities are supplemented by a team of highly experienced personnel within the investment, client services and support teams. consequently, the market displays persistent patterns of behaviour or inefficiencies which record believes are best exploited by quantitative, systematic processes. this convergence-driven return opportunity combined with a selection based on interest rate differentials, relative valuations and discretionary risk management, is expected to result in long-term positive performance of the strategy. this market inefficiency has persisted across different currencies and is present in other asset classes, such as equities. currency is commonly thought of as trending and the momentum strategy seeks to make a return from this phenomenon. for example, if a currency deviates too much from its equilibrium value (as indicated by ppp), then this deviation will be corrected. under the licensing agreement, record provides signals that are used to dynamically hedge currency exposures within wisdomtree’s rules-based index family and this licensing agreement was extended during the year to include their newly-launched canadian rules-based index family. our products are delivered both through segregated mandates and pooled fund structures to suit individual client requirements. with respect to return-seeking currency strategies, all four principal strands – carry, emerging markets, value and momentum – generated positive performance throughout the year. frb10 index, emerging market, momentum and value can also be combined to create the record currency multi-strategy product. record’s multi-strategy mandates combining carry, emerging market, momentum and value strategies delivered positive performance over the period. ftse currency frb10 gbp excess return 3 4.45% 2.04% 4.62% currency value 4 1.37% 2.93% 3.13% currency momentum 5 2.06% 1.82% 3.78% record multi-strategy

these appraisals in 2017 was positive and all roles were considered to be undertaken effectively. the committee meets at least once a month and as necessary in response to individual or specific events requiring review. this ensures that, whilst there is focus on areas deemed to be higher risk, all parts of the business are covered over a three year cycle. following her appointment as committee chair rosemary hilary met privately with the internal audit partner to discuss deloitte’s approach. the committee is, therefore, concerned to ensure that our remuneration structure and policies work at all levels. the remuneration policy for all our staff including executive directors is designed to act in the long-term interests of all our key stakeholders, clients, shareholders, employees and regulators, as it links reward with performance in a straightforward and transparent way. there is no such limit on the value of unapproved options, which may be granted with any exercise price (including nil), although the committee’s policy is for unapproved options awarded to executive directors to be struck at market price. all executive director option awards will be subject to a performance condition based on record’s annual cumulative eps growth. short-term short-term salaries gain on incentive incentive year ended and fees benefits 1 share (gps-cash)
