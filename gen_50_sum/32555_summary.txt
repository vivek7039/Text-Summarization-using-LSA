statement business profile and key performance indicators i am pleased to report that booker group has delivered another good performance. it should also help the booker catering, retail and small business customer prosper in a challenging market. every week we monitor prices versus competitors and during the year our price index remained competitive (see graph). booker has consistently offered low prices on core products and maintains its promise of helping the customer during challenging times. this helps our customers save money, increase recycling levels and support more sustainable communities throughout the uk. this is part of a longer term plan to up- skill and develop our future butchery managers who are all currently working through an in house craft butcher training programme, which has been developed with and is endorsed by the institute of meat. we currently have over 50 drivers working towards becoming a van or large goods vehicle driver in our booker and makro business centres. it should also help the booker catering, retail and small business customer prosper in a challenging market. the goodwill carrying value is more than supported by expected future cash flows discounted back to present day values. if sales are transferred to a replacement business centre in the same vicinity no such adjustment is made. if a business centre is opened where none previously existed, all sales for the first twelve months will be excluded. booker is an inclusive organisation where no-one receives less favourable treatment on the grounds of gender, nationality, marital status, colour, race, ethnic origin, creed, sexual orientation or disability. examples of initiatives this year are: • following on from work started last year, 35 business centres, one distribution centre and two distribution centre freezer rooms have now been converted to led energy efficient lighting with a projected annualised average saving of 22% electricity per annum. we are pleased to report that video conferencing is now set up at all our main business locations. the award demonstrates booker’s long term commitment to successfully measuring, managing and reducing its carbon footprint. we have invested across the estate in balers, instigated waste league tables and continually focus on improvements. its impact includes deforestation, habitat loss of critically endangered species and a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions. the marine conservation society has identified a number of fish species which are from unsustainable, over- fished, highly vulnerable or poorly managed fisheries. substantial investment is made to improve environmental risk management, with a focus on energy efficiency when investing in new capital projects. the group produces a forecast three year business plan which incorporates projections for income and cash flow. special dividend since 2014, the company has annually returned capital to shareholders by way of a “b share scheme”. applications for employment and promotion of disabled persons are treated on the same basis as those from other applicants. arrangements can also be made through the company secretary for major shareholders to meet with newly appointed directors. the results were positive, confirming such areas as effective planning, appropriate focus on risk, continuity, commitment and integrity. additional areas that are addressed by this procedure include criminal activities, improper or unethical behaviour and risks to the environment. this accords with grants made to our two executive directors, excluding charles wilson, in the 2 previous years. accordingly, the committee’s policy, in a competitive market, is to design remuneration packages which reward executive directors and executives fairly for their contribution. any such changes, should they occur, will be fully explained to shareholders in the next remuneration report. none booker group

statement of changes in equity booker group plc annual report & accounts 2017 / financial statements 62 notes to the group financial statements 1. general information a) overview booker group plc is a public limited company incorporated in the united kingdom (registration number 05145685). the model features a contract-based five-step analysis of transactions to determine whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. defined benefit schemes are accounted for in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary but significant estimates are required in relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension increases, inflation, investment returns and mortality that underpin their valuations. the group is party to a number of leases on properties that are no longer required for trading. all actuarial gains and losses were recognised as at 1 april 2006, the date of transition to adopted ifrss. subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that, following an assessment of the quantum and timing of future taxable profits, it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. b) budgens and londis – goodwill allocated £3.1m (2016: £3.1m) a pre tax discount rate of 12.0% (2016: 12.0%) has been applied to the projected cash flows. c) remaining business – goodwill allocated £448.9m (2016: £448.9m) a pre tax discount rate of 9.5% (2016: 9.5%) has been applied to the projected cash flows. fair value hierarchy the table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value, into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine fair value: • level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities • level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) • level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). there is no difference between the discounted and undiscounted cash flows associated with trade payables due to their short term nature. the group has £160.7m of net cash as at 24 march 2017 and is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. investment risk: the present value of defined benefit liabilities is calculated using a discount rate set by reference to high quality corporate bond yields. this shortfall is expected to be recovered through returns on the scheme assets, and no contributions are required. for j smylie & sons (iom) ltd the registered
