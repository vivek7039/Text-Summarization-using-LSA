share-based payment transactions, issued on 20 june 2016 (effective 1 january 2018). certain supported syndicates have non-sterling functional currencies and any exchange movement that they would have reflected in other comprehensive income as a result of this has been included within profit before tax at consolidation level, to be consistent with the group’s policy of using sterling as the functional currency. each syndicate uses a number of statistical techniques to assist in making these estimates. in addition, the nature of short-tail risks, such as property where claims are typically notified and settled within a short period of time, will normally have less uncertainty after a few years than long-tail risks, such as some liability business where it may be several years before claims are fully advised and settled. the provision for unexpired risks is calculated separately by reference to classes of business that are managed together, after taking into account relevant investment return. intangible assets: syndicate capacity syndicate capacity is an intangible asset which represents costs incurred in the corporation of lloyd’s auctions in order to acquire rights to participate on syndicates’ years of account. information about these financial assets is provided internally on a fair value basis to the group’s key management. they are classified as current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting period. these are classified as current liabilities, unless payment is not due within 12 months after the reporting date. risk background the syndicates’ activities expose them to a variety of financial and non-financial risks. the group also manages its exposure to insurance risk by purchasing appropriate member level reinsurance. helios underwriting plc — annual report and financial statements 2017 36 notes to the financial statements continued – year ended 31 december 2017 4. risk management continued
