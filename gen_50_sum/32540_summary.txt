 chile concentrated solar power market revenue is set to witness strong growth of over 25% over the forecast timeframe. hayward tyler is currently working in partnership with several universities and private developers to position itself as an industry leader in this growing technology space and its recent announcement on the c-gen neptune generator project is testament to this. power generation – centralised – nuclear eia's international energy outlook projects that total global nuclear generation will increase by 73% through 2040, from 2.6 trillion kilowatt-hours in 2015 to 4.5 trillion kilowatt-hours in 2040. countries that are not a part of the organisation for economic co-operation and development source: us energy information association, international energy outlook 2016, may 2016 hayward tyler group plc financial statements for the year ended 31 march 2017 11 (non-oecd countries) account for 86% of this increase, with china alone making up more than 54% of total growth. hayward tyler continues to enjoy a stable position in the nuclear supply chain servicing its existing installed base as well as taking orders for new units, both of which result from the key accreditations of our us and uk businesses. hayward tyler’s canned motor technology provides nuclear plants with a robust product for increased life cycle and reduced maintenance costs. chp is an efficient means of producing electric power and useful thermal energy from a single fuel source. it uses less fuel than the alternative methods of separately generating heat by conventional boilers and power stations. whilst short-term demand for this product group remains fairly flat, ten units were secured in conjunction with our strategic partner, eureka pumps as, and with an installed base of more than 250 high-power motors offshore there are additional aftermarket opportunities across key markets. accordingly, spending on subsea trees is expected to increase by around 12% year-on-year to 2018. this demand is driven by the need of over 1,000 source: 2017 oil and gas trends - strategy – pwc, january 2017 source: eic datastream, may 2017 source: douglas – westwood analysis, 2017 hayward tyler group plc financial statements for the year ended 31 march 2017 14 candidate fields to either optimise production or minimise the topside investment burden for multiple wellheads. the 22.6mw extraction back-pressure steam turbine generator was designed, manufactured and tested in accordance with american petroleum institute (api) 612 standards. hayward tyler’s reputation and experience has positioned the business as a key supplier for these applications. since then the submarine programme has provided both original equipment opportunities and secure aftermarket business, which is critical to maintaining casd. this external driven growth is dependent inter alia on positive market conditions which we anticipate will improve during the current year. as an example, in the floating vessels market peter brotherhood has more steam turbine gensets on fpsos than all of its competition combined. the key performance indicators (kpis) set out below help determine how successful we have been in strengthening our business, increasing profitability and generating a positive return to shareholders. revenue from other markets that include chemical, defence, industrial and renewables was more or less level at 16% (fy2016: 17%). hayward tyler group plc financial statements for the year ended 31 march 2017 32 risk potential impact mitigation strategic risk a. growth strategy and competition part 1 – growth a fundamental part of the group’s strategy is growth from both oe and am and as part of that strategy the group has geared-up its fixed cost base to be able to turnover £80 million or more in a year. it has an excellent market profile (quality, reliability and customer relationships), which results in inclusion on sector bid/quote opportunities. recruitment and retention of employees remains a key focus for the group to ensure its continued success. csr is managed by our business units and it forms an integral part of their day- to-day operations. that step has resulted in 60% less crane-usage and the elimination of forklift trucks thereby reducing risks significantly. from 2015 no waste has been sent to landfill, rather it is being recycled, reused or sent for energy regeneration;  combining the values of responsibility for the environment and society, employees of hayward tyler colchester volunteered to organise a local ‘green-up’ day. as part of this day, over 20 employees have cleaned-up four miles of local roads as an annual spring event;  hayward tyler east kilbride holds both iso 9001 and iso 14001 certification, which have contributed to a significant reduction in the business unit’s impact on the environment from projects such as reducing landfill waste, improving energy efficiency on site and manufacturing without using hazardous, toxic or scarce materials. kyle blackwell, june 2017 shak choudhury first came across hayward tyler in 2015 at brunel university’s engineering showcase where he was presenting his third year thesis. shak enrolled onto the imeche mpds programme, which is a mentor-based plan aimed at helping engineers attain chartered status. set out below is a summary of how, at 31 march 2017, the group was dealing with corporate governance issues. these options vest three years from the date of grant and are subject to continued service. the company’s registered office is peregrine corporate services limited, burleigh manor, peel road, douglas, isle of man, im1 5ep. there have been no changes from prior periods in the measurement methods used to determine reported segment profit or loss. 2.8 property, plant and equipment land held for use in production or administration is stated at historical cost. with the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. 2.16 equity, reserves and dividend payments share capital represents the nominal value of shares that have been issued. gains and losses resulting from remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability are included in other comprehensive income. all goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. any adjustment to cumulative share-based compensation resulting from a revision is recognised in the current period. (a) original equipment manufacture the group provides pumps, motors, turbo gen-sets, compressors and steam turbines specifically customised to each customer. revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable in relation to that activity. after initial recognition these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. the impairment loss is then based on recent historical counterparty default rates for each identified group. this grant income is included in operating charges as a deduction from related research, development and training expenses. the new standard establishes a control-based revenue recognition model and provides additional guidance in many areas not covered in detail under existing ifrss, including how to account for arrangements with multiple performance obligations, variable pricing, customer refund rights, supplier repurchase options and other common complexities. estimation uncertainties exist particularly with regard to medical cost trends, which may vary significantly in future appraisals of the group's defined benefit pension obligations. these changes are considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of recent volatility in the currency markets. nicholas flanagan and ewan lloyd-baker have subscribed to the hayward tyler group plc £10 million secured loan note programme. group company year to 31 march 2017 year to 31 march 2016 year to 31 march 2017 year to 31 march 2016 £000 £000 £000 £000 non-cash adjustments: amortisation of intangibles 416 257 -
