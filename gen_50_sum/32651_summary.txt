crawshaw group plc annual report 52 weeks ended 29 january 20 1 7 crawshaw group plc annual report 52 weeks ended 29 january 201 7 number of stores 49 our stores are located across yorkshire, lincolnshire, nottinghamshire, derbyshire, the north west and the midlands. we source only from the best suppliers and all our meat is quality assured. as a result, we have finished the year with some really encouraging sales and margin momentum. crawshaw has demonstrated its ability to manage a major change agenda in parallel with evaluating the ongoing potential of our store rollout programme. whilst we remain completely committed to the high street, shopping centre and market location stores, the factory shop concept is proving to deliver significantly better financial returns with its higher sales, lower operating costs (no hot food-to-go offer) and lower fit out costs. our customers wanted to see some of the old fresh meat pack sizes, price points and offers that were previously on sale in their specific store. t o ensure that all areas of our business were completely focused on delivering the sales recovery programme effectively, it was important to temporarily pause the store rollout programme and provide full support to our store colleagues. having successfully landed our major change agenda, we now believe we have the right operational balance between the disciplined framework required as a platform for rollout with enough freedom for store managers to react to local customer requirements. as previously communicated, this improvement in both sales and customer number momentum has required a moderate level of margin investment. our stores continue to develop local products specific to their community, provide local special offers, as demonstrated with our successful christmas hampers and the planned new bbq packs for the warmer months ahead. our teams have reintroduced a number of store specific favourite dishes to the ‘butcher’ s kitchen’ menu and continuously test new dishes/recipes with input from their customers. this provides customers with a great choice of meal occasion, such as cooked whole chickens, chicken portions, pork loins, gammon joints and ham shanks. encouragingly, these initiatives have already contributed to an increase in customer numbers and sales. crawshaw group plc annual report 52 weeks ended 29 january

outlook for 2018 the uk grocery market will remain competitive and, with industry-wide pressures emerging in commodities and labour costs, the uk consumer outlook will continue to be more challenging
