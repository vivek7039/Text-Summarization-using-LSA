dampening effect of these factors has been outweighed by the structural imbalance between supply and need for new homes in london, particularly at our typical price point. we sell homes early in the development cycle as a means of de-risking projects and advancing investment into new opportunities. this secure and de-risked position is underpinning our stated expectations for growth over the next few years. notwithstanding this we are confident that there remains a healthy market for our typical product from individual buyers. since february 2016 we have entered into four build to rent transactions comprising of nearly 500 homes, together worth over £230 million. in particular, we will pursue longer term partnerships whilst also maintaining an awareness of other opportunities. chief

arrangements’ which states that joint ventures should be accounted for as equity investments rather than by proportional consolidation. the board has prepared an income statement and a balance sheet using proportional consolidation along with generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) compliant versions presenting joint ventures as equity investments. the margin recognised on open market homes is expected to trend down towards the target margin over time as older developments which benefitted from more significant sales price inflation and minimal build cost inflation are replaced with sites appraised more recently. secondly, a greater proportion of the revenue this year is generated from build to rent contracts which attract a lower gross margin to compensate for the advantages of being forward funded and for savings in selling expenses and interest costs. telford homes has a £180 million revolving credit facility which is available to fund developments that are not joint ventures. joint venture developments are funded outside of the revolving credit facility with site specific loans secured as and when required. katie rogers group financial director 30 may
