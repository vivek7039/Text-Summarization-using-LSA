Extractive text summarization using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)

Extractive text summarization is a technique used to generate a concise summary of a document by selecting and extracting key sentences or phrases directly from the original text. Unlike abstractive summarization, which involves generating new sentences to convey the essential meaning, extractive summarization relies on identifying and extracting existing content.
