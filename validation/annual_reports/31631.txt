Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017
A YEAR OF  
SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS
Chairman’s statement
Our position going into the next financial year 
is strong. Our year-end private forward order 
book is at a record level at £242.4m, which, 
combined with a strong pipeline in both 
divisions, positions us well to achieve our 
ambitious growth plans. 
Returns to shareholders
Our share price performed well over the course 
of the financial year, reflecting the performance 
of the business along with continued investor 
education. In the year to 30 September 2017, 
we delivered a total shareholder return of 
46.6 per cent compared to 13.5 per cent for 
the FTSE 250 (excluding Investment Trusts). 
With the growth in earnings, our proposed dividend 
per share has also increased by 147 per cent 
with a recommended final dividend per share 
of 5.0 pence. Subject to approval at the AGM 
on 25 January 2018, the dividend will be paid 
on 9 February 2018 to shareholders registered 
at 22 December 2017. T ogether with the interim 
dividend of 3.4 pence per share, this will give a 
total dividend for the year of 8.4 pence per share.
Priorities of the Board
The Board continues to regard corporate 
governance as a core and vital discipline 
complementing our desire to continually improve 
upon the success of the Group on behalf of 
our shareholders. During 2017, particular areas 
of focus were to develop policies and procedures 
to address the new Consumer Code for Home 
Builders and to prepare for the introduction of 
the Criminal Finance Act and the General Data 
Protection Regulation. 
Countryside has delivered another 
year of significant progress completing 
3,389 homes while maintaining a 
strong balance sheet and with 
excellent visibility over our future 
growth ambitions.
Well positioned for growth
During 2017 the business continued to perform 
well, delivering on the key targets set out at 
our initial public offering (“IPO”) in February 
2016. Political support for the housebuilding 
industry remains strong and we welcome the 
Government’s commitment to housing with 
the white paper “Fixing our broken housing 
market” and subsequently announced increased 
funding for both affordable housing and the 
Help to Buy scheme.
At our interim results in May 2017, we upgraded 
the targets that we set out at our IPO as we 
saw opportunities to accelerate delivery on a 
number of our Partnerships sites. We remain 
firmly on track to deliver these targets and indeed 
exceeded our 28 per cent return on capital 
employed (“ROCE”) target in 2017, a year 
ahead of plan. 
We maintained our focus on capital discipline 
and ended the year with £77.4m of net cash 
on the balance sheet. During the year we 
extended our £300m revolving credit facility 
out to May 2022 and we continue to have 
significant headroom. While there are substantial 
plans for investment in our developments during 
2018, our policy remains to be broadly debt 
neutral at the end of each financial year. 
As we enter 2018, our key areas of focus 
continue to be to support implementation 
of the Group’s business strategy, to deepen 
the succession planning for the Board and 
Executive Committee and to ensure that 
corporate governance and risk management 
mitigation plans are embedded across 
the business.
There were two Board changes during the course 
of the year. On 26 May 2017, we announced 
that Oaktree had completed a sale of shares in 
Countryside, reducing its remaining shareholding 
to approximately 23 per cent of the Company’s 
issued share capital. As a consequence, James 
Van Steenkiste stepped down from the Board 
on 5 June 2017 as per the Relationship Agreement 
between Oaktree and the Company. Additionally, 
on 2 October 2017, Richard Adam announced 
his intention to step down as a Non-Executive 
Director of the Company, with his last day of 
service being 31 December 2017. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
both James and Richard for their significant 
contributions to the Board and its Committees 
since joining Countryside. The whole Board 
wishes them both well for the future. A search 
for Richard’s successor is well under way and 
an announcement of the appointment will be 
made in due course.
Our people
We recognise that our people are the 
most important factor in delivering on our 
ambitious growth plans and we continue to 
invest in developing them at all levels. As at 
30 September 2017 we had over 1,200 employees , 
12 per cent more than a year ago. We are 
recruiting more apprentices, graduates and 
trainees than ever before. In addition, we have 
placed great focus on succession planning at all 
levels during the year. In May, we were delighted 
to announce the reshaping of our Executive 
Committee following the retirement of Richard 
Cherry, with Ian Kelley, Nick Worrall and Phillip 
Lyons, who joined the business as Chief Executive 
of our Housebuilding division, joining the 
executive team. 
The quality and commitment of our people 
was recognised with a number of awards during 
the year including “Large Housebuilder of the 
Year” at the Housebuilder Awards.
I would like to thank each and every one of our 
employees for their hard work during the course 
of the year.

DELIVERING SECTOR-LEADING 
GROWTH FROM OUR MIXED-
TENURE MODEL
Group Chief Executive’s review
The Group continues to make progress with its strategic objectives 
of sector-leading growth, superior return on capital and building 
resilience through the economic cycle. 
Our Housebuilding model is based on an 
industry-leading strategic land bank, all of 
which is located in economically resilient 
markets in Outer London and the Home 
Counties. Over 80 per cent of our land bank 
is strategically sourced via long-term planning 
promotion, which offers Countryside over 
ten years’ visibility of future supply, together 
with an average 10 per cent discount to the 
prevailing open market value. Additionally, as 
73 per cent of this land is controlled via 
options or conditional contracts, it ensures 
both balance sheet efficiency and flexibility 
through the cycle. 
Overview of the market
Overall the backdrop for the UK housing market 
remains positive with continued strong customer 
demand, favourable mortgage lending conditions 
and good political support. During the year all 
political parties recognised the need for additional 
housing, not just because of the chronic need 
for new homes but also because of the important 
role that housebuilding plays in the wider economy. 
In February 2017, the Government issued a 
housing white paper, “Fixing our broken housing 
market”, which set out a broad range of reforms 
to help shape the housing market and increase 
the supply of new homes. One of the main 
themes of the report was a shift in focus from 
home ownership to increasing supply of all 
tenures of housing, including more affordable 
and PRS homes. In October 2017, the Government 
reaffirmed its support for housing, committing 
a further £2bn of funding to deliver more 
affordable homes and an additional £10bn of 
funding for the Help to Buy scheme, which 
currently runs to 2021. 
Group strategy
Our mixed-tenure model gives us the ability 
to build sites out more quickly, delivering much 
needed high-quality housing. We deliver this 
strategy through our two balanced operating 
divisions of Partnerships and Housebuilding, 
both of which offer strong growth through 
differentiated models that deliver capital efficiency 
and manage risk. Our developments offer a wide 
range of price points, with homes for first-time 
buyers through to larger homes from our 
premium brand, Millgate. 
Our Partnerships division operates in Outer 
London, the West Midlands and the North 
West of England. It delivers private, affordable 
and Private Rental Sector (“PRS”) homes on 
larger sites, typically public sector brownfield 
sites or local authority estate regeneration. 
The land is typically sourced via public 
procurement or direct negotiation and is 
developed in partnership with local authorities, 
housing associations or PRS providers. It is 
a low-capital model offering strong returns 
and the flexibility of long-term development 
agreements, many with phased viability and 
priority returns. The division has an excellent 
track record of winning new work, reflecting 
over 30 years’ experience on over 60 regeneration 
schemes, strong relationships with local authorities 
and expertise in placemaking. T ypically, we secure 
around 40 per cent of bids we submit, and 
with a current pipeline of approximately nine 
years, we have excellent visibility of future work. 
Supply of both private and public land remains 
good. In particular, during the period we saw a 
further increase in public sector land being released 
for regeneration giving us additional opportunities 
to secure more work. 
Labour supply continues to be constrained 
across the industry and we, along with the 
Home Builders Federation, have been encouraging 
the Government to protect the status of EU 
construction workers as a vital part of the UK 
economy and to protect future development. 
T o mitigate this risk, we are recruiting a record 
number of apprentices and management trainees 
and have expanded our graduate recruitment 
programme. In addition, our larger site profile 
allows us to retain and expand our supply chain, 
by offering greater visibility of future work and 
longer contracts. Overall, build cost inflation 
was approximately four per cent for the year. 
In order to meet the increased demand for 
housing, despite the labour shortage, the industry 
must also look at different build methodologies 
to deliver growth in output. We already utilise 
off-site timber frame construction on around 
40 per cent of our current output. We are 
examining the way that this process can be 
enhanced to include all windows, first-fix plumbing 
and electrical insulation and plasterboard in a 
closed panel system. We believe that off-site 
construction is integral to meeting our growth 
plans and securing our supply chain for the future. 
Our performance
2017 was another year of strong progress with 
both divisions performing well. Overall, the Group 
has grown strongly, with total completions up 
28 per cent to 3,389 homes (2016: 2,657 homes) 
driven by construction site starts and increased 
open sales outlets. As anticipated, growth of 
private for sale homes was particularly strong, up 
47 per cent to 1,662 homes (2016: 1,127 homes) 
as the large number of sites started in 2016 
reached full production. However, private for 
sale completions were still less than half of our 
overall delivery during the year reflecting our 
strategy of mixed-tenure development.

T otal adjusted revenue was up 32 per cent to

 (2016: £777.0m), with a planned 
decline in the Group private average selling price 
(“ASP”) to £430,000 (2016: £465,000) more 
than offset by an increase in affordable ASP. 
Underlying house price inflation was five per cent 
during the year and offset build cost inflation in 
both divisions. Our net reservation rate was 
above our target range at 0.84 reservations per 
open sales outlet (2016: 0.78) on an increased 
number of open sales outlets at 47 (2016: 43). 
At 30 September 2017, we had a further 
41 sites under construction. 
We continue to focus on capital and operational 
efficiency both at the divisional and at the Group 
level. Group operating margin increased by 20bps, 
which, together with increased revenue, gave 
an adjusted Group operating profit of £164.1m
2
 
(2016: £122.5m), up 34 per cent on the prior 
year. This, combined with our focus on capital 
efficiency, allowed us to exceed our ROCE target 
of 28 per cent, as set out at our IPO, a year 
earlier than planned at 30.5 per cent in 2017, up 
370bps on the prior year (2016: 26.8 per cent).
We pride ourselves on the quality of our 
product and were delighted to be named 
“Large Housebuilder of the Y ear” at the recent 
Housebuilder Awards. In addition, we were 
presented with a further nine awards during 
the year for work at Acton Gardens (London), 
Abode (Cambridge), Woolley Hall (Berkshire) 
and Englemere (Ascot). 
The standard of our business has also been 
maintained throughout this period of growth. 
Our health and safety Accident Incident Rate 
was 220 (2016: 305), significantly better than 
the Health and Safety Executive construction 
index and the Home Builders Federation 
industry benchmark. National House Building 
Council (“NHBC”) reportable items were 
0.21 per home (2016: 0.23), which was again 
significantly ahead of the industry benchmark. 
We maintained our focus on our objective of 
becoming a five-star builder during the year 
and our customer service has continued to 
improve. Our customer satisfaction, as measured 
by the NHBC Recommend a Friend score, now 
stands at 88.6 per cent (2016: 84.8 per cent). 
Outlook
Current trading has remained robust since year 
end. Low interest rates and increased demand 
from first-time buyers, supported by Help to Buy, 
continue to underpin private for sale homes, 
while the structural demand for affordable and 
PRS homes further supports our growth plans. 
We continue to successfully convert our strategic 
land bank to open more sites and, as a result, 
our Housebuilding division is on its way to optimal 
scale. This growth, combined with our excellent 
pipeline of Partnerships work, which allowed 
us to increase our targets at our interim results, 
and a record year-end forward order book, 
gives us great confidence to deliver our 
medium-term plans. We are encouraged by 
the continued political support for all tenures of 
housing with the recently increased commitments 
to both Help to Buy and affordable housing 
and we feel we are ideally placed to benefit 
from these policies.

KEY TRENDS IN  
THE HOUSING MARKET
Our markets
The backdrop for the UK housing market remains positive with 
continued strong customer demand, favourable mortgage lending 
conditions and good political support. 
Mixed-tenure delivery
In part, the structural undersupply in housing has 
been caused by the lack of affordable housing 
being built in England. Large-scale local authority 
housing estates constructed in the 1960s and 
1970s have not been replicated in the past 
35 years and the delivery of social housing 
within private developments under Section 106 
agreements has not kept up with demand. 
Private Rental Sector (“PRS”) housing has 
largely been provided by small independent 
landlords in poor quality older homes, with 
little purpose-built PRS housing being constructed 
over the same period. While there is increased 
appetite from institutional investors, there remains 
a structural undersupply of good quality homes 
for market rent in most urban areas.
Our response
We are committed to delivering a mixed-tenure 
approach on our developments. We differ from 
all other major housebuilders in that the private 
for sale homes made up just less than half, 
49 per cent, of our total completions in 2017, 
with 30 per cent affordable and 21 per cent PRS 
homes. Our Partnerships division delivers a 
balanced mix of all three tenure types, giving it 
the benefit of being able to grow more rapidly, 
with the added benefit of business resilience 
should the private for sale market start to slow.
Government policy
All political parties have recognised the need 
for additional housing, not just because of the 
chronic need for new homes but also because 
of the important role that housebuilding plays in 
the wider economy. Recent policy has focused on 
stimulating demand for home ownership through 
programmes such as Help to Buy, which has 
helped over 140,000 families own a home over the 
past four years. Commitment to the Help to Buy 
programme has been made to 2021 and the 
scheme was recently bolstered by an additional 
£10bn of funding. Additionally, the Government 
has committed a further £2bn of funding to deliver 
affordable homes and the National Planning Policy 
Framework is ensuring that all local authorities 
have a consistently calculated five-year supply 
of land for new homes.
Our response
We are ideally placed to benefit from the 
commitment to deliver more new homes of 
all tenures. In 2017, 88 per cent of our private 
for sale homes were eligible for the Help to Buy 
programme and it was utilised on 27 per cent 
of our total completions across the Group. 
We deliver a greater proportion of affordable 
housing in London than any other major 
housebuilder and through our Partnerships 
division we have a nine-year pipeline of future 
work. We also have an industry-leading owned 
or controlled land bank, all within 50 miles of 
London, the vast majority of which, 83 per cent, 
has been strategically sourced.

Structural undersupply of housing
The long-term undersupply of housing, as first 
identified in the 2004 Barker Review, meant 
that a minimum of 200,000 new homes per year 
were required in England to maintain the supply 
and demand balance. It has subsequently been 
recognised that additional latent demand has 
built up over the past 25 years, such that this 
number needs to be around 250,000 and possibly 
more. While the supply of new housing has 
grown steadily over the past six years, the 
number of net additions to the housing stock 
was just 190,000 last year.
Our response
We have been growing our total annual 
completions over the past five years, from 
1,903 homes in 2012 to 3,389 homes in 2017. 
Our business has the resources both in people 
and financial strength to continue this growth in 
the medium term, both in our existing areas of 
operation and in newer geographies such as the 
West Midlands. We continue to see significant 
future growth in both our Partnerships and 
Housebuilding divisions, which in turn will drive 
improved operating margins from greater scale. Strategic report Governance Financial statements

Future regulation 
Following the tragic events at Grenfell T ower, a 
wide-ranging inquiry has commenced to establish 
the causes and examine the responses to this 
disaster. While the inquiry is yet to be concluded, 
the Government has required all housebuilders 
and property owners to review the fire strategy 
for all buildings built or refurbished since 2005 
and in particular the materials used on buildings 
greater than 18 metres in height. Additionally, a 
consultation has commenced into leasehold 
reform with a focus on the creation of leasehold 
houses, ground rent escalation and freeholder 
management charges. This consultation is due 
to report its findings at the end of 2017.
Our response
We have carried out a thorough review of all 
buildings constructed since 2005 and have little 
exposure to either tall buildings or refurbishments. 
We have identified only one development where 
corrective work is required. In conjunction with 
the housing association which owns the property, 
a scope of works has been agreed to fully remediate 
the fire strategy for the development and will 
be completed by the end of 2017.
On leasehold reform, we have committed 
to ensuring that houses are sold on a freehold 
basis wherever we own the land and, where 
leasehold is required, the terms of the lease are 
clear and affordable. We had a small number of 
developments where, on review, we felt that the 
ground rent rose too quickly and we have 
committed to amend those leases to fairer 
terms at our expense. 
Labour supply
The housebuilding industry has a shortage 
of skilled and experienced labour at all levels. 
Chronic underinvestment over the past 25 years, 
followed by the 2008 recession, has eroded 
the workforce considerably at a time when 
a significant increase in output is required. 
The skills gap has largely been filled by overseas 
workers from the European Union (“EU”) 
and beyond, who now make up a significant 
proportion of the workforce, especially in 
Greater London. Brexit negotiations have 
led to uncertainty over the security of the 
EU workforce, not just from potential future 
employment restrictions but also from possible 
economic migration caused by Sterling devaluation.
Our response
We, together with the Home Builders Federation, 
have been encouraging the Government to 
protect the status of EU construction workers as 
a vital part of the UK economy. At the same 
time, we are mitigating the risk of a lack of 
labour availability by recruiting a record number 
of apprentices and management trainees and 
expanding our graduate recruitment programme. 
Our directly employed workforce has grown 
from fewer than 600 in 2014 to over 1,200 in 2017 , 
as we focus on our growth agenda by recruiting, 
retaining and developing the best talent at all 
levels. Our larger sites also allow us to retain 
and expand our supply chain, by offering 
longer-term contracts and better quality 
working conditions. 
Off-site construction
In order to meet the increased demand 
for housing despite the labour shortage, 
the industry must look at different build 
methodologies to deliver growth in output. 
While the industry has not yet fully embraced 
non-traditional build, several methods of off-site 
construction are being developed, from timber 
frame construction to complete modular build. 
With Government and public sector land owner 
support, together with potential future fire safety 
regulations, the case for off-site construction has 
grown. The principal benefits are speed of build, 
lower reliance on scarce site skills and improved 
build quality from automated processes.
Our response
We already utilise off-site timber frame construction 
on around 40 per cent of our current output. 
We are examining the way that this process can 
be enhanced to include all windows, first-fix 
plumbing and electrical insulation and plasterboard 
in a closed panel system. T ogether with our 
supply chain partners, we are also looking to 
automate the production process of the panels 
to improve capacity, product quality and efficiency. 
We believe that off-site construction is integral 
to meeting our growth plans and securing our 
supply chain for the future. Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017

Measuring our 2017 
performance
2017 has been another year of strong performance 
for the Group in which we made progress on 
all 11 financial and non-financial key performance 
indicators (“KPIs”). Our KPIs are designed to 
ensure that we remain focused on delivering 
growth in our output whilst delivering superior 
shareholder returns within the framework of a 
robust balance sheet. We also ensure that the 
pace of growth does not compromise product 
quality or the safety of those working on our sites.
Transparent measures to 
reward performance
We have maintained a consistent set of KPIs 
at all levels of the business to ensure that all of 
our people understand what drives value for 
our shareholders. There is a clear link between 
performance against our financial KPIs and 
remuneration through our Group bonus scheme 
which has targets including adjusted operating 
profit and return on capital employed.

Strategy
Our Partnerships division specialises in medium 
to large-scale urban regeneration of public sector 
land delivering much needed quality housing. 
It operates primarily in and around London, the 
West Midlands and the North West of England. 
It delivers a resilient, low-risk, low-capital model 
developing urban regeneration in partnership 
with public sector landowners, such as local 
authorities and housing associations. We have 
a strong track record of delivering more 
than 60 regeneration projects over 30 years. 
Developments are mixed tenure in nature 
delivering private, affordable and PRS homes 
in line with the Group’s placemaking ethos. 
The Southern region focuses on local authority 
estate regeneration, delivering increased density 
in apartment-led schemes in Outer London. The 
Northern and Midlands regions typically focus 
on brownfield land delivering low-rise family 
houses in the North West of England and the 
West Midlands. 
Market
During 2017 there was a political shift in focus 
from home ownership to increasing supply of 
all tenures of housing, including more affordable 
and PRS homes. 
This plays to the strengths of our Partnerships 
model where schemes offer a mix of housing 
allowing us to build sites out more quickly without 
saturating the market. During the year, we saw 
further growth in the number of bid opportunities 
for both brownfield and estate regeneration as 
local authorities look to increase housing supply 
and improve the quality of their affordable 
housing stock. Within the PRS market, while 
there is increased appetite from institutional 
investors, there remains a structural undersupply 
of good quality homes for market rent in most 
urban areas.
Our performance
Our Partnerships division continued its 
strong growth trajectory in 2017, with total 
completions up 17 per cent to 2,192 homes 
(2016: 1,874 homes) particularly driven by 
significant growth in private completions, up 
31 per cent to 825 homes (2016: 628 homes). 
Partnerships’ private ASP increased by 12 per cent 
to £343,000 (2016: £307,000), including like-for-like 
growth of seven per cent reflecting house price 
inflation in the London Boroughs and regional 
cities as well as the impact of regeneration 
delivering added value on our developments. 
In total we delivered 1,182 affordable homes 
(2016: 1,131 homes), including 721 PRS homes 
(2016: 738 homes) with the majority through 
our partnership with Sigma Capital in the 
North West and Midlands regions. Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017

All text and images to be supplied 
Our performance continued
During the year we delivered homes on a number of key 
regeneration schemes within our Southern region, including 
at Acton, where we delivered 276 homes completing three 
phases and we commenced development on further phases 
including the neighbourhood centre. At St Paul’s Square in 
Bow, where we accelerated development in the prior year, we 
completed 121 homes and at East City Point in Canning T own 
we delivered 132 homes with both schemes due to be 
completed during 2018.
Our North West region also performed well. We continue 
to build predominantly low-rise family housing on medium-scale 
sites around the Liverpool and Manchester conurbations and 
were operational on around 20 sites during 2017. These included 
the delivery of 146 homes in partnership with Knowsley 
Metropolitan Borough Council, 103 homes at Norris Green 
Village in Liverpool and 107 homes at Heyfields near 
Manchester during the year. 
We were delighted with the performance of our 
West Midlands region following its launch in 2016. 
At 30 September 2017, we had three open sales outlets 
in the region with 180 homes completed in the year. 
While it is still early days in the West Midlands, the pipeline 
continues to grow and we remain confident that we can 
replicate the successful model we have in the North West. 
Across Partnerships, we started on site on 30 new developments 
during the year. In addition, we had another very successful 
year in winning new business, underpinning our longer-term 
growth plans. In addition to those sites already in the land bank, 
including those with preferred bidder status, we secured 7,030 
new plots in the period including at Bilston Urban Village, 
Wolverhampton, Maidenhead, Barking and Bromley. We 
now have 19,223 Partnerships plots under our control 
(2016: 14,504 plots). These projects were awarded to 
Countryside as a result of our proven track record in delivering 
complex, multi-phase schemes alongside design excellence. 
Overall, we have visibility over approximately nine years’ supply 
at current volumes. We had 23 open sales outlets as at 
30 September 2017 (2016: 18) with a further 23 (2016: 20) 
sites under construction. 
Outlook
As announced at the half-year results in May 2017, our 
sustained momentum, in particular regarding both the bid 
win rate and operational delivery, has delivered a growth 
trajectory ahead of the original targets we set at IPO while 
continuing to win new business. We have accelerated a number 
of Partnerships developments and our focus in 2018 is on 
new site starts with growth in all tenures, including PRS 
homes. During 2018, we are planning 42 new site starts 
within Partnerships, 11 of which are large regeneration 
schemes around London. At 30 September 2017, we were 
either bidding on or had identified as bid opportunities a 
further 40,560 plots, up approximately 20 per cent on the 
prior year.

PROCESS BUT IT CAN BE MADE 
EASIER WHEN WORKING WITH 
AN ORGANISATION SUCH 
AS COUNTRYSIDE.”
• Partnership with the London Borough of Barnet and L&Q
• Predominantly two and three-storey terraced houses with private gardens
• 631 high-quality new homes across five development phases
• Target of 37 per cent affordable homes
• New community centre, nursery and shared communal gardens
The former Dollis Valley Estate had significant 
historical social challenges, including petty 
crime and anti-social behaviour. As part of our 
partnership with the council a key component 
of the regeneration was to use master planning 
to alleviate these problems and deliver a successful, 
mixed community. 
We started on site in September 2012 and the 
regeneration is already reconnecting the former 
estate. Many of the existing tenants have already 
been rehoused in high-quality affordable homes, 
with a tenure-blind approach to ensure quality 
and equity throughout the development. 
Our approach integrates the housing tenures 
within the development, creating a genuinely 
mixed community. As the regeneration 
progresses we support local activities that 
bring an unprecedented sense of cohesion 
to the area. 
“Regeneration is a complicated process but 
it can be made easier when working with an 
organisation such as Countryside. I have found 
their experience, knowledge and listening skills 
exceptional. They are always available to listen 
to residents’ comments and concerns, and act 
upon them where possible.”

Strategy
Our Housebuilding division develops medium 
to large-scale sites, providing private and affordable 
housing on land owned or controlled by the 
Group. Operations are focused on Outer 
London and the Home Counties. 
Within our Housebuilding division we look 
to maintain our industry-leading strategic land 
bank with over 80 per cent of our land strategically 
sourced at 30 September 2017. In total, we had 
19,826 plots within our Housebuilding land bank 
(2016: 19,322), of which only 27 per cent was 
owned outright with the rest controlled by 
either option agreements or conditional contracts. 
This provides flexibility, creates value through 
embedded discounts to open market value and 
enhances the efficiency of the balance sheet, 
while still giving us strong visibility of future work. 
Market
2017 was another positive year for the 
housebuilding sector with strong customer 
demand underpinned by the continuing 
structural shortage in housing. The greatest 
demand continues to be from first time buyers 
and supported by Help to Buy. We continue to 
focus on making sure that our homes remain 
affordable for local owner-occupiers, who make 
up the vast majority of our private sales. The 
second hand market continues to be more difficult 
resulting in slower sales rates for product above 
£600,000 and in particular above £1m.
The Government focus on the National Planning 
Policy Framework continues to simplify the 
planning environment with initiatives such as 
a dispute resolution mechanism for Section 
106 agreements. This has facilitated an increase 
in outline planning consents, although clearing 
pre-start conditions remains challenging. 
Our performance
Our Housebuilding division experienced a 
step change in its scale during 2017 and is 
well on its way to achieving increased efficiency 
from greater scale. T otal completions were up 
53 per cent to 1,197 homes compared with 
783 homes in 2016. As with the performance 
in the Partnerships division, we saw strong growth 
in delivery of private homes, up 68 per cent in 
the period, to 837 homes (2016: 499 homes). 
In line with our plans to ensure our homes 
remain affordable, the Housebuilding private 
ASP decreased by 23 per cent to £515,000 
in the period, as we reduced our exposure to 
higher end product, focusing on the areas 
where we see the strongest demand but also 
reflecting some slowing in reservation rates at 
the higher end. Underlying sales values remained 
robust with house price inflation of four per cent 
offsetting build cost inflation during the period. 
1. Adjusted revenue includes the Group’s share of revenue from associate and joint ventures of £125.1m (2016: £69.0m; 2015: £51.9m).
2. Adjusted operating profit includes the Group’s share of the operating profit from associate and joint ventures of £22.9m 
(2016: £18.3m; 2015: £13.6m).
3. Divisional adjusted operating profit excludes Group items of £6.8m (2016: £2.4m; 2015: £1.2m), comprising share-based payment 
expense net of deferred tax of £5.1m average (2016: £1.1m; 2015: £Nil) and brand amortisation of £1.7m (2016: £1.3m; 2015: £1.2m).
4. TNAV is calculated as TNOAV plus net cash allocated pro rata based on divisional TNOAV.

Our Performance continued
In certain locations where it is taking slightly longer to 
reposition higher product price points, we have seen a 
slowing in net reservation rates albeit sales values were 
broadly in line with our expectations. Demand for high-quality 
locations and premium product has continued to be met by 
our Millgate brand. 
The previously highlighted operational issues at Mill Hill 
continued to be a drag on the Housebuilding division with 
67 homes completed in the year. The development should 
be fully built by the end of the calendar year with 18 homes 
left to complete. 
We have seen strong demand at Greenwich Millennium 
Village, where we completed 122 homes; Springhead Park, 
Ebbsfleet, where we completed 110 homes; and Beaulieu, 
Chelmsford, where we completed 155 homes across four 
phases in the period. 
We made good progress on delivery at our legacy sites at 
King’s Park, Harold Wood and Horsted Park, Chatham, in 
the period delivering 217 units in total. On our current 
plans, both of these sites should be completed during 2019. 
In line with our strategy, we have maintained the land bank 
in our Housebuilding division, acquiring 2,896 plots on 16 sites 
during the year. We completed four land sales during the 
period including a commercial sale at Cambridge Medipark, a 
parcel of land at the site in Bicester where we are an associate 
partner and two residential sales at Bury St Edmunds and 
Silsden, which we chose not to develop. The Housebuilding 
land bank now stands at 19,826 plots (2016: 19,322 plots), 
of which 83 per cent has been sourced strategically.

Outlook 
We started on 21 new Housebuilding sites during 
the period. The increase in sales reservations and 
completions led to several sales outlets closing 
earlier than anticipated and we had 24 open sales 
outlets at 30 September 2017, compared to 25 
one year ago. However, we have a further 18 sites 
under construction to ensure we increase the number 
of selling outlets in 2018. This gives us great visibility 
over delivery for 2018, which is set to be another 
year of strong growth in our Housebuilding division 
as we get closer to optimum scale. All of our planned 
delivery for the next three years is identified and the 
majority, over 75 per cent, already has some form 
of planning.  Strategic report Governance Financial statements

A GREAT SENSE OF COMMUNITY
ST LUKE’S PARK 
• Collection of 575 homes comprising apartments and traditional houses
• Set within 200 acres of landscaped grounds
• New primary school
• Includes a selection of one to three-bedroom homes on the low-cost home ownership scheme
St Luke’s Park is situated on the site of the 
former Runwell Hospital in Essex. It has plans 
for over 200 acres of landscaped grounds and 
is surrounded by mature trees and woodland. 
Although many developments integrate into an 
existing neighbourhood, the vision for St Luke’s 
Park was to create a new community within 
a village setting. Tucked away on its own 
purpose-built road and with no other residential 
schemes close by, St Luke’s Park is more than 
just a collection of new homes. As well as the 
central village green, there are plans for the 
Grade II-listed chapel to be refurbished along 
with a new primary school. We started on the 
first of five phases in May 2015 with construction 
due to be completed in 2022. 
“There’s a real sense of community and all of 
our neighbours are lovely, so it’s been fantastic 
for the kids. Theo and T oby have made so 
many friends. They are always desperate to get 
home from school or wherever we have been 
to play out with their friends. I feel it’s a really 
safe environment for them to play out; everyone 
keeps an eye on each other.”

at St Luke’s Park, Runwell

ANOTHER YEAR OF  
STRONG PERFORMANCE
Group Chief Financial Officer’s review
We have delivered another strong set of results, with both 
divisions performing well and we are on track to deliver our 
growth objectives.
A combination of factors, including the geographical 
mix of the business, management of our pricing 
exposure and legacy issues at a Housebuilding 
site in Mill Hill, London, meant that our 
operating margin progress was modest during 
the year. We made good progress with controlling 
overheads as a result of a number of initiatives 
including a small restructuring of Head Office 
functions in the first half which resulted in 
overheads falling further as a percentage of 
sales to 5.0 per cent (2016: 5.9 per cent). 
Overall, adjusted operating margin increased 
by 20bps to 16.0 per cent (2016: 15.8 per cent) 
which contributed to a 34 per cent increase in 
adjusted operating profit to £164.1m 
(2016: £122.5m). 
Reported operating profit was up 48 per cent 
to £128.9m (2016: £87.3m) with the difference 
to adjusted operating profit being the proportionate 
consolidation of the Group’s associate and joint 
ventures and a non-underlying item relating to 
the restructuring costs referred to above. Further 
details of the difference can be found in Note 6 
to the financial statements. 
Our net reservation rate per open sales outlet 
increased to 0.84 (2016: 0.78) which reflected 
continued strong demand for our homes, with 
an increase in open sales outlets to 47 (2016: 43) 
helping to drive the increase in revenue. We 
saw a moderation in sales rate immediately 
following the General Election in June, but 
this reversed before year end with a normal 
summer trading pattern in 2017 compared to 
the very strong performance in August 2016. 
A further 41 sites were under construction but 
not yet open for sale, sustaining the production 
growth underpinning our medium-term targets.
This growth in sales outlets, when combined 
with our continued strong sales rate, has not only 
increased completions but delivered a record 
year-end private forward order book up eight 
per cent to £242.4m (2016: £225.4m).
Group performance
2017 was a year of substantial growth for the 
Group, with total completions up 28 per cent 
to 3,389 homes (2016: 2,657 homes). 
We continued to manage down private ASP 
to moderate our exposure to higher price 
points which resulted in an eight per cent 
reduction in ASP to £430,000 (2016: £465,000). 
Affordable ASP increased by 13 per cent to 
£135,000 (2016: £120,000), driven by the 
increasing use of shared ownership and 
low-cost housing by Registered Providers. As a 
result, the Group delivered adjusted revenue 
of £1,028.8m (2016: £777.0m), up 32 per cent 
from last year as the Group passed the £1bn 
sales mark for the first time. 
Statutory revenue increased by 26 per cent to 
£845.8m (2016: £671.3m). The difference between 
the adjusted and reported measures reflects 
the proportionate consolidation of the Group’s 
associate and joint ventures.
We continued to see price growth during the 
year, particularly at the lower price points, and 
house price inflation for the full year was similar 
to the prior year at around five per cent. During 
the year, we saw cost price inflation moderate 
in London and the South East, driven by some 
weakness in the London construction market. 
Cost price inflation in the North West was 
higher, although broadly consistent with the 
prior year. Given the Group’s forward purchasing 
for the 2018 financial year, there is limited 
near-term risk to margin from these trends.
Overall, Group adjusted gross margin (including 
the Group’s share of associate and joint venture 
gross profit) was 21.2 per cent, slightly behind 
last year’s margin of 21.9 per cent, as a result 
of the impact of the changing mix of the business 
towards the North West and a conscious 
management of our pricing in the South East. 
We also experienced some modest reductions 
in selling price at premium price points in excess 
of £1m across the business. Our legacy issues 
at a Housebuilding site in Mill Hill, London, also 
impacted gross margin in that division and we 
expect to conclude this development in the 
2018 financial year.
Within this, profit from land sales contributed 
£8.9m (2016: £10.6m) as we tactically sold parcels 
of land where we no longer expect to build, 
and £5.6m (2016: £5.9m) from commercial 
sales, again principally at the Medipark site in 
Cambridge, where we sell serviced parcels of 
land for commercial use.
We ended the year with net cash of £77.4m 
(2016: £12.0m), slightly higher than planned due 
to the delayed start of two developments in 
our Partnerships division which will begin early 
in the new financial year. As a result of the lower 
interest cost of our new facility and lower average 
debt levels during the year, the Group’s bank 
interest cost fell to £3.0m (2016: £5.2m). 
Despite a change to the discount rate applied 
to our land creditors and overage liabilities 
discussed in further detail below, reported net 
finance costs decreased to £16.9m (2016: £28.2m).
Partnerships
We began to see the results of our increased 
investments since IPO in our Partnerships division 
during 2017 with total completions up 17 per cent 
to 2,192 homes (2016: 1,874 homes). With private  Strategic report Governance Financial statements

ASP increasing 12 per cent to £343,000 
(2016: £307,000) and affordable ASP up 
nine per cent to £121,000 (2016: £111,000), 
adjusted revenue increased 36 per cent to 
£476.7m (2016: £349.9m).
Private completions of 825 homes were up 
31 per cent on the prior year (2016: 628 homes) 
as key developments at St Paul’s Square, Bow 
and East City Point, Canning T own, delivered a 
full year of production. We were also able to 
begin the acceleration of our Acton, London, 
development using the proceeds raised at IPO 
in February 2016 and made good progress in 
our first year of delivery from our new West 
Midlands region based in Wolverhampton. 
We were actively selling on 23 outlets at 
30 September 2017 (2016: 18).
Affordable completions were up 10 per cent at 
1,367 homes (2016: 1,246 homes). These affordable 
completions included the delivery of PRS housing, 
principally from our ongoing partnership with 
Sigma Capital in the North West and West 
Midlands, of 721 homes (2016: 738).
The adjusted gross margin for the Partnerships 
division was 20.6 per cent, slightly behind the 
21.3 per cent delivered last year due to the 
increased proportion of sales from the North Wes t 
and West Midlands regions compared to last 
year. As we benefited from the scaling up of 
our business, adjusted operating margin increased 
to 16.7 per cent (2016: 16.2 per cent). As a result 
of the increased volume and improved operating 
margin, adjusted operating profit of £79.4m was 
up 40 per cent (2016: £56.8m). 
On a reported basis, Partnerships revenue 
increased to £418.8m, up 34 per cent 
(2016: £313.2m) as a result of the growth in 
sales outlets delivering a greater number of 
completions along with an increase in ASP. 
Reported Partnerships operating profit 
increased to £68.7m (2016: £52.4m).
We had another very successful year in winning 
new business in the Partnerships division, 
underpinning our longer-term growth plans. 
In addition to those sites already in the land 
bank, including those with preferred bidder 
status, we secured 7,030 new plots in the 
period. We now have 19,223 Partnerships 
plots under our control (2016: 14,504 plots). 
This represents approximately nine years’ 
supply at current volumes and provides 
significant visibility.
Housebuilding
The increased production which started in 2016, 
together with strong customer demand at the 
sub £600,000 level, allowed us to significantly 
increase completions, up 53 per cent to 
1,197 homes (2016: 783 homes). T otal 
adjusted revenue from Housebuilding was 
up 29 per cent to £552.1m (2016: £427.1m).
Private completions increased by 68 per cent 
to 837 homes (2016: 499 homes). With the high 
rate of sales, we sold out on a number of sites 
during the year, resulting in open sales outlets 
at the year end down one at 24 (2016: 25). 
With an additional 18 active sites in production, 
we anticipate a material increase in open selling 
outlets by the end of the 2018 financial year. 
Private ASP of £515,000 was 23 per cent lower 
than last year (2016: £665,000). This reduction 
was driven in part by our decision to manage 
price points down to focus on the market below 
£600,000 where demand remains strongest 
but also some reductions in sales rates at 
premium price points over £1m. Despite 
these pressures at the upper end of the 
market, volumes have remained in line with 
our expectations and ahead of 2016.
Affordable revenue increased by 47 per cent 
to £65.7m (2016: £44.6m) with completions 
up 27 per cent to 360 (2016: 284) at an ASP 
of £183,000 (2016: £157,000), up 17 per cent.
Housebuilding adjusted gross margin was 
21.6 per cent (2016: 22.4 per cent), a reduction 
of 80bps driven by delayed completions at our 
joint venture with Annington Developments 
Limited at Mill Hill in North London, together 
with some pressure at higher price points. 
Operating costs reduced as a percentage of 
turnover as our operating regions reached scale 
and we saw the benefit of operational gearing, 
which together resulted in a 70bps increase in 
adjusted operating margin to 16.6 per cent 
(2016: 15.9 per cent). Overall, the Housebuilding 
adjusted operating profit increased by 34 per cent 
to £91.5m (2016: £68.1m).
On a reported basis, Housebuilding revenue 
increased by 19 per cent to £427.0m 
(2016: £358.1m) with growth coming from 
the increased average number of open sales 
outlets and house price growth. Reported 
Housebuilding operating profit increased 
to £68.6m (2016: £49.8m).
In line with our strategy, we have maintained 
the land bank in our Housebuilding division and 
have acquired 2,896 plots on 16 sites during 
the period. The Housebuilding land bank now 
stands at 19,826 plots (2016: 19,322 plots), of 
which 83 per cent has been strategically sourced.
Non-underlying items
In the first half of the year, certain Group 
operations were restructured, principally the 
outsourcing of architecture and design services. 
As a result of this, a number of people left the 
Group at a cost of £1.6m. 
From 1 April 2017, the discount rate applied 
to committed land payments recognised as 
land creditors or overage was reduced from 
6.0 per cent to 3.4 per cent. This change was 
made to better align the discount rate with 
the Group’s cost of debt. The impact of this 
change was £7.6m.

Non-underlying items continued
In the prior year, a number of items totalling £13.1m were reported as 
non-underlying, relating to the Group’s listing on the London Stock Exchange 
including legacy share incentive costs, the refinancing of the Group and 
the reversal of an historical receivable impairment. 
A total tax credit of £1.7m (2016: £1.0m) in relation to all of the above 
non-underlying items was included within taxation in the income statement.

rates and average borrowing levels during 2017. As discussed above the 
impact of a change in discount rate applied to deferred land and overage 
payments was £7.6m. Excluding the impact of this change underlying net 
finance costs fell to £9.3m (£25.0m). In the prior year, £16.5m of interest

Group Chief Financial Officer’s review continued
Countryside expects net finance costs in 2018 to be lower than 2017, 
as no further change is anticipated to the discount rate applied to land 
creditors and overage.
Taxation
The Group published its tax strategy for the first time in 2017, as part of 
its approach to maintaining an open and transparent relationship with tax 
stakeholders including HMRC. The Group continues to hold a low-risk 
tax rating. The strategy confirms the Group’s view that it seeks to comply 
fully with its statutory and other regulatory obligations and to act in a 
way which upholds its reputation as a responsible corporate citizen, 
including full and transparent disclosure to tax authorities. 
In line with Countryside’s broader corporate strategy, the key goals 
directing our tax strategy are: 
• adherence to applicable laws and regulations; 
• maximisation of shareholder value on a sustainable basis; and 
• protection of our reputation and brand. 
We believe that our obligation is to pay the amount of tax legally due 
at the right time in accordance with rules set by the relevant authorities. 
We also have a responsibility to shareholders to ensure that strategic 
business objectives are met without incurring unnecessary tax costs.
The income tax charge was £24.1m (2016: £17.3m), with an adjusted tax 
rate of 18.5 per cent (2016: 21.8 per cent) and, on a reported basis, an 
effective tax rate of 17.0 per cent (2016: 22.0 per cent). 
The adjusted rate has reduced due to a reduction in disallowable 
expenditure during the year, due to the IPO transaction costs and the 
redemption of mandatory redeemable preference shares in the prior

Profit before tax and tax thereon 141.7 24.1 17.0
In 2018, Countryside expects the adjusted tax rate to continue to be 
slightly lower than the UK statutory corporation tax rate due to claims 
for enhanced tax relief in relation to land remediation costs.
Earnings per share (“EPS”)
Adjusted basic earnings per share increased by 71 per cent to 27.8 pence 
(2016: 16.3 pence) reflecting the increase in adjusted operating profit 
during the year, together with a decrease in adjusted net finance costs 
and a lower adjusted effective tax rate. 
The weighted average number of shares in issue was 450m (2016: 450m).
Basic earnings per share was 26.0 pence (2016: 13.6 pence). Basic earnings 
per share is lower than adjusted basic earnings per share due to the 
effect of non-underlying items that are excluded from adjusted results. Strategic report Governance Financial statements

Dividend
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 5.0 pence per share 
(2016: 3.4 pence per share), representing a pay-out of 30 per cent of 
adjusted profit after tax. This brings the total dividend for 2017 to 8.4 pence 
per share (2016: 3.4 pence per share). This will be paid on 9 February 2018 
to shareholders on the Register of Members at the close of business on 
22 December 2017 subject to approval by shareholders at the AGM. 
The proposed final dividend was recommended by the Board on 
21 November 2017 and, as such, has not been included as a liability 
as at 30 September 2017.
In 2018, Countryside intends that the dividend will continue to represent 
30 per cent of adjusted profit after tax.
Statement of financial position
As at 30 September 2017, TNAV was £627.0m (2016: £537.4m), an 
increase of £89.6m, which was mainly attributable to retained earnings 
after the payment of the Group’s dividends during the year. As we continued 
to grow the business, inventory grew by £83.5m to £667.1m (2016: £583.6m) 
as we were active on 88 sites at 30 September 2017 (2016: 72 sites). 
Investments in associate and joint ventures were maintained at £61.4m 
(2016: £59.1m) as Oaklands Hamlet in Chigwell, Essex, reached maturity 
as an open selling outlet.
Improving returns
During the year, a significant focus on working capital efficiency and cash 
generation saw asset turn (defined as adjusted revenue divided by average 
TNAV excluding net cash or debt) increase to 1.9 times (2016: 1.7 times). 
This, together with the adjusted operating margin improvements, helped 
our return on capital employed increase by 370bps to 30.5 per cent 
(2016: 26.8 per cent). This is 250bps ahead of our medium-term ROCE 
target and is in part driven by the high level of cash on the balance sheet 
at 30 September which was the result of two delayed starts on site in our 
Partnerships division which will take place in the first half of the 2018 
financial year.

Financing
On 3 May 2017, the Group signed a one-year extension to its £300m 
revolving credit facility agreement. The agreement has a variable interest 
rate based on LIBOR and now expires in May 2022, although the Group 
has the opportunity to extend the term of the facility by a further year 
on the next anniversary. A number of other changes to the facility in 
May 2017 have given the Group greater flexibility, particularly in driving 
the scale of the Partnerships division.

As we have continued to grow the Group, our net investment in working 
capital increased by £56m (2016: £107m). Our year-end net cash position 
improved by £65m after making this investment, as we increased the 
profitability of our business. 
Impact of the new revenue accounting standard
During the second half, the Group has undertaken a detailed exercise 
to determine whether the new revenue accounting standard, IFRS 15 
‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ will have a material impact on 
the Group’s results. The new standard is effective for the Group for the 
2019 financial year commencing on 1 October 2018. This exercise is 
substantially complete and we have not yet identified any areas of our 
business where we will see material changes to the way in which we 
currently recognise revenue. 
We are working with advisors and others in the industry to determine 
the appropriate treatment for the recognition of revenue on land sales 
to Registered Providers of social housing and await further guidance on 
this matter from the International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee at their meeting in November 2017. We expect to reach a 
conclusion on this in the first half of the 2018 financial year.

OUR PEOPLE MAKE THE 
DIFFERENCE EVERY DAY
Our people
We are a growing business. Our people play a pivotal role in that 
growth; without them we would not be able to build sustainable 
communities where people want to live.
People remain a 
key differentiator
Countryside continues to attract and retain the 
best people in the housebuilding sector to deliver 
our strategy. We believe that our people truly 
differentiate us from our competition. In the 
last three years, we have more than doubled 
our employee numbers and now have just over 
1,200 people working for us. Our aim is to 
“grow our own” as much as we can, together 
with a healthy balance of new recruits. 
We saw record investment in 
developing our people
We have maintained and developed our 
Group-wide approach to succession and talent 
management as part of our “grow our own” 
people strategy. We have commenced 
implementation of a coaching programme for 
our senior population, using a combination of 
internal and external coaches, tailored to the 
individual’s needs. Our focus on quality of training 
delivery remains, particularly around induction 
and externally accredited leadership programmes.
We are committed to developing our people 
at all levels of the organisation through leadership, 
professional and vocational qualifications and 
e-learning. Building a pipeline of talent is critical 
to our success.
Our employee engagement is 15 per cent 
higher than the UK average
Our approach to future talent 
continues to be a priority
Our two-year graduate programme was highly 
commended by graduate recruitment website 
The Job Crowd. The programme is proving 
very successful, and we continue to attract 
large numbers of high-calibre graduate candidates.
We have recently recruited a further 12 graduates, 
and in addition now have nearly 30 apprentices, 
both on site and in our offices. We have added 
internships to our Early Careers offering, and 
we aim to extend this further in the year ahead.
Our people are our shareholders
In December 2016, we launched our second 
all-employee Save as you Earn (“SAYE”) plan. 
This plan, together with our first launched just 
after IPO, means that 70 per cent of our eligible 
employees have signed up to buy shares 
in Countryside.
December 2016 also saw the second grant of 
our Long T erm Incentive Plan to our Director 
group as a retention tool for this key population. 
We believe we continue to offer a highly 
market-competitive reward package.
In 2017 we ran the Group’s second all-employee survey, and once 
again over 80 per cent of our people responded. We were very 
pleased that we achieved a high overall engagement score of 
79 per cent. From this, we believe that our people feel valued, 
well led and excited about the future. 
The key action areas remain fairly consistent to those agreed in 
2016. Whilst improvements have been made during the year, 
the two main areas of focus for the Group are:
• continuing to encourage a more flexible approach to working 
hours across the business; and
• promoting inter-departmental teamwork.
In addition, specific regional action plans will be developed.
Our people are highly engaged
2017 employee survey results

We want our people to choose 
the right benefits for them and 
their families
Our approach to reward is centred on choice. 
These benefits range from buying and/or selling 
days of annual leave, through to reduced fees 
on life, dental and travel insurance, to discounted 
medical and cancer screening. During our 2017 
flexible benefits annual enrolment window, 
70 per cent of employees logged in to the benefits 
site and over 50 per cent of employees selected 
a new benefit or amended an existing one.
For those of our employees who qualify for a 
car or cash allowance, we offer a sector-leading 
fleet proposition. This focuses on offering our 
employees choice based on their lifestyle, while 
remaining environmentally conscious by capping 
our CO
2
 emissions.
Health and safety
Countryside conducts its business with due 
regard for the health, safety and welfare of its 
employees, contractors, clients, visitors and 
members of the public. We develop a positive 
culture towards health and safety throughout 
our operations and as a minimum we observe 
all the requirements of the Health and Safety 
at Work etc. Act 1974 at all times. 
Countryside operates a comprehensive health 
and safety management system (fully registered 
to OHSAS 18001) and we are committed to 
continual improvement through a comprehensive 
training programme and by actively encouraging 
feedback from all levels of our workforce. 
Regular on-site inspections are carried out 
internally by the Group’s qualified health and 
safety professionals. The day-to-day management 
of these activities is overseen by the Group’s 
Head of Health and Safety. 
The company’s Accident Incident Rate (AIR) 
continues to be below the National Incident 
Rate (NIR) benchmark. During the reporting 
period the company’s AIR averaged at 220 
(2016: 305) reportable incidents per 100,000 
persons at risk, compared with the NIR of 398 
(2016: 421). For the fourteenth consecutive year 
our AIR has been below the national benchmark. 
We intend to maintain this performance.

Committee member responsible for health 
and safety throughout the Group.

Sustainability report
From the design and character of the homes 
we build, to the planning of public spaces 
and infrastructure, our creative approach 
to placemaking and engagement with the local 
community and our customers ensures we 
have a positive impact on all those who live 
in and around our developments. We provide 
a collaborative culture for our workforce and 
supply chain to ensure they support our 
sustainability strategy and assist in our 
continual improvement as a business.
Our strategy
Our sustainability strategy focuses on the five areas 
material to our business:
£3.3m
in sustainability-related 
savings during the year
We are passionate about building Places People Love which 
enhance the communities in which we operate, whilst ensuring 
that our operations are carried out in an environmentally 
responsible, ethical, safe and sustainable manner.
Performance
We continue to set strategic sustainability 
objectives based on our material issues. We 
also have in place targeted divisional, site and 
personal objectives to support these aims. In 
addition we made £3.3m of sustainability-related 
savings during the year. Details of our objectives 
can be found in the Group Sustainability Report 2017 
at www.countryside-properties.com/about-us/
who-we-are/sustainability.
We have policies in place to support this 
strategy that are applied throughout the 
business and communicated to our supply 
chain to ensure all stakeholders assist us in 
delivering our overall corporate strategy as 
outlined on pages 12 and 13.

Risk management and standards
Overall responsibility for risk is managed by 
the Board assisted by the Risk Management 
Committee. Oversight of more detailed 
aspects is managed through the Health, Safety, 
Quality and Environment Committee. 
In addition, an Environmental Aspects, Impacts 
and Legislation Register is maintained at Group 
level and is used by the divisions to inform and 
manage environmental risks and opportunities.
For further details on the Group’s risk 
management process see pages 36 to 39.
In accordance with our approach to continuous 
improvement and managing risk, the Group is 
fully accredited to the ISO 9001:2015 (Quality), 
ISO 14001:2015 (Environmental) and BS OHSAS 
18001:2007 (Health and Safety) standards. 
Each of these standards is certified by a UK 
accreditation Service-accredited certification 
body. In 2017, we achieved certification to the 
revised ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 9001:2015 
standards: we were one of the first property 
developers to do so.
Legal compliance
We are pleased to report that we continue 
to uphold our good record in environmental 
compliance, with zero prosecutions or fines 
for over 12 years. During the year, we had 
two non-conformances raised against health 
and safety regulations. We fully complied with 
investigations into these matters by the relevant 
enforcing authorities and resolved both issues 
to their satisfaction.
Cost benefits of being a 
sustainable business
The Group achieved sustainability-related cost 
savings of £3.3m during the year (2016: £2.9m). 
A substantial amount of this saving was due 
to reducing the amount of waste produced by 
our developments. As the Group maintained 
its strong growth trajectory, we maintained our 
focus on sustainability, embedding improvement 
programmes across the Group.
Awareness and communication 
of sustainability issues
We provide information and guidance about our 
policies, processes, procedures and responsibilities 
to our staff and contractors through a variety 
of channels including monthly staff presentations, 
new starter inductions, training courses and 
toolbox talks and via our intranet. 
This is our 17th year of sustainability reporting 
– the longest track record in our sector. Since 
we began reporting in 2000 we have received 
357 awards for our sustainability practices 
which highlights our commitment to 
sustainable development.  Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017

Community
We recognise that whilst we aim to have a positive 
effect on the communities in which we operate, 
existing and future residents may have concerns 
about perceived negative impacts of our construction 
and the future life of our developments.
We appreciate that the local community has 
a right to enjoy their homes and working 
environment without nuisance caused by our 
works and our sites have stringent procedures 
in place to reduce noise, dust and nuisance 
which may be caused by additional vehicular 
traffic both during the construction period 
and after construction.
The majority of our sites are registered for the 
Considerate Constructors Scheme and in 2017 
our average score across the Group improved 
to 36.3 out of 50 (2016: 34.4), which is above 
the national average of 35.9/50 (to August 2017).
CUSTOMERS 
AND COMMUNITY
Our approach to environmental sustainability is informed by our values, compliance requirements 
and the needs of our stakeholders. This applies to all aspects of our business and involves setting 
objectives and measuring performance against them in order to ensure continual improvement.
Energy
The energy efficiency of the homes we have built, as measured by the Standard Assessment Procedure 
(“SAP”) – continues to be above national standards at an average rating of 85.45 out of 100 (2016: 84.8 
out of 100).
For the second year we have collated and are reporting performance on energy use within the 
business covering head office, site and business travel. Details of our energy use and associated 
carbon footprint are detailed below:
Office activities
For the reporting period, we cut our office-based CO
2
 emissions by 13.6 per cent per employee.
Ethical business
Our policies and procedures are designed to 
ensure we comply with UK law and best practice 
guidelines, including areas such as business 
conduct, equal opportunities, anti-corruption, 
whistleblowing and countering modern slavery 
and human trafficking. Our contracts explicitly 
oblige suppliers to meet all current 
employment legislation.
Health and safety
The Group recognises the value and importance 
of promoting high standards in all health, safety 
and welfare matters for the benefit of everyone 
who may be affected by our operations.
For the 14th consecutive year, our Accident 
Incident Rate (“AIR”) is below the industry average 
and the Health and Safety Executive’s National 
Incident Rate (“NIR”) benchmark, a record of 
which we are proud. During the year, our AIR 
averaged 220 (2016: 305) compared with the 
NIR of 398 (2016: 421). We continue to remain 
focused on making our sites a safe environment 
for our employees and contractors.
During the year, we undertook a series of events 
and audits to focus on the health and wellbeing 
of our employees and contractors based on site. 
Seminars were also held in our office locations 
highlighting health issues including dementia and 
prostate cancer.
Our people
Our people are our most valuable resource and 
without them we would be unable to build 
sustainable communities where people want 
to live.
For more information on how we engage and 
develop our staff see pages 30 and 31.

Customers
Moving into a new home in a new community should be an enjoyable and exciting experience. 
We continue to build on improvements to our customer journey which began in 2016, focusing 
on customer engagement throughout the purchase process and dealing quickly with quality issues. 
This has resulted in an improvement in our customer satisfaction scores during the year as measured 
by the NHBC. In 2017, 85.1 per cent (2016 81.6 per cent) of our customers were satisfied eight 
weeks after occupation and 88.6 per cent (2016: 84.8 per cent) would recommend us to a friend.

from 3.93m

 per employee. This reflects the growth of the company and opening of additional 
offices and floors in existing buildings.
Transport
We encourage the use of sustainable transport modes by providing an increasing number of cycling 
facilities and electric charging points at our developments. In 2017, 96 per cent of our developments 
were located within 1km of a public transport node and 79 per cent are within 500m, providing a 
choice of travel modes to our customers and helping to reduce their impact on the environment.
Ecology
We are committed to establishing and enhancing ecological networks that are resilient to current and 
future climate change pressures. We installed green or brown roofs on 22 per cent of our developments 
during the year (2016: 18 per cent).
T o manage local risks, qualified ecologists undertook full ecological surveys as part of the site evaluation 
process on 95 per cent (2016: 98 per cent) of our projects. 
Countryside strives to work with suppliers and 
sub-contractors who share our values and who 
can support our business in a manner that is 
safe, efficient and ethical, and reduces adverse 
effects on the environment.
All our supply chain members are required to 
complete a prequalification process to enable 
us to ascertain that these values are met. We 
engage with our contractors and suppliers on 
a regular basis to ensure that they are meeting 
the requirements we set them and also work 
with them to improve their standards and 
therefore our own.
We have in place a Sustainable Procurement 
Policy which sets out our commitments and 
standards. This can be viewed on our website

Risk management
OPTIMISING OUR  
RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
Risk management
How we manage risk
Risk identification and management is built into 
every aspect of Countryside’s daily operations, 
ranging from the appraisal of new sites, assessment 
of the prospects of planning success, building 
safely and selling effectively to achieve long-term 
success through the property market cycle. 
Risk management is built into standardised 
processes for each part of the business at every 
stage of the housebuilding process. Financial 
risk is managed centrally through maintenance 
of a strong balance sheet, forward selling new 
homes and the careful allocation of funds to 
the right projects, at the right time and in the 
right locations. Risk management also includes 
the internal controls described within the 
Corporate Governance Report on

The Risk Management Committee normally meets 
every quarter to review the Group’s risk register. 
The Group’s risk register is maintained to record 
all principal risks and uncertainties identified in 
each part of the business. A member of the 
Executive Committee is allocated, as appropriate, 
as the “risk owner” for each risk. The risk owners 
call upon the appropriate expertise to conduct 
an analysis of each risk, according to a defined 
set of assessment criteria which includes:
• How does the risk relate to the Group’s 
business model and/or strategy?
• What is the likelihood of the risk occurring?
• What is the potential impact were the risk 
to occur?
• Would the consequences be short, medium 
or long-term?
• What mitigating actions are available and 
which are cost effective?
• What is the degree of residual risk and is it 
within the Group’s risk appetite parameters?
• Has the risk assessment changed and what is 
expected to change going forward?
The Risk Management Committee reviews the 
assessments made, compares it to the Group’s 
appetite for each risk, reviews the current level 
of preparedness and determines whether further 
actions or resource are required. In reviewing 
and agreeing the mitigating actions, the Risk 
Management Committee considers the impact 
of risks individually and in combination, in both 
the short and the longer-term.

Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017
Viability Statement
The following statement is made in accordance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(April 2016) provision C.2.2. After considering 
the current position of the Company, the 
Directors have assessed the prospects and 
viability of the Company over a three-year 
period to September 2020. In making this 
statement, the Board has performed a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Company, including those risks that would 
threaten Countryside’s business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity. The principal 
risks facing Countryside and how the Company 
addresses such risks are described in this Strategic 
Report and are summarised in the “Principal 
risks and uncertainties” section of this report.
Although longer-term forecasts are prepared 
to support the strategic planning process, the 
nature of the risks and opportunities faced by 
the Group limits the Directors’ ability to 
reliably predict the longer term. Accordingly, a 
three-year horizon is used to allow for a greater 
degree of certainty in our assumptions.
The Directors’ assessment includes a financial 
review, which is derived from the Group’s strategic 
forecasts and identifies divisional business 
performance, expected cash flows, net debt 
headroom and funding covenant compliance 
throughout the three years under review. 
These forecasts also incorporate severe but 
plausible downside case scenarios, illustrating 
the potential impact upon viability of one or more 
of the Group’s principal risks crystallising during 
the period, both individually and in combination.
A number of reasonable assumptions are 
included within these assessments, including:
•  the assumption that the Group’s debt facility, 
which expires in 2022, will continue to be 
available on the same or similar basis 
throughout the period under review;
•  the assumption that, following a material 
event, the Group would adjust its strategy 
accordingly to preserve cash. This would 
include, inter alia, suspending the purchase 
of land, changing the build profile of existing 
developments or adjusting Group 
dividend policy;
•  the assumption that counterparties including 
local authorities and housing associations 
honoured the phased viability terms and 
conditions contained in a number of the 
Group’s Partnerships contracts; and
•  the assumption that the Group will be able 
to effectively mitigate risks through enacted 
or available actions, as described in the 
“Principal risks and uncertainties” section 
of this report.
The sensitivity analysis is performed based on 
assumptions modelled on the 2007 to 2009 
period, adjusted for changes in Countryside’s 
business divisions, during which the Housebuilding 
sector saw significant reductions in sales rates and 
average selling prices and illiquidity in the land 
market during a prolonged economic recession. 
These assumptions include, inter alia, a 20 per cent 
fall in house prices and an up to 50 per cent 
reduction in sales rates, offset by a 10 per cent 
build cost deflation.
It considers all of our principal risks, although 
our assumption that we will be able to effectively 
mitigate some of our risks leads to a greater 
emphasis on those risks that are beyond our 
control (such as external macroeconomic factors).
Having had due regard to the sensitivity analysis, 
the Directors have concluded that we do not 
face a risk to our viability except in the event 
of highly improbable combinations of material 
events within the three-year window.
Based on this conclusion, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company will 
be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period of 
the assessment.

Key areas of focus during 2017
Data protection 
Given that the EU’s General Data Protection 
Regulation (“GDPR”) takes effect from 25 May 2018, 
the business-wide objective of ensuring all business 
divisions are in compliance in advance of the 
deadline has been overseen by the Risk 
Management Committee during 2017. The 
process commenced with an internal audit 
of the Group’s state of readiness, followed 
by the development and implementation of an 
operational road map, using the findings of the 
audit, to embrace GDPR and develop sustainable 
privacy with respect to Countryside’s employees, 
customers and suppliers.
Cyber 
Recognising that cyber risk continues to grow 
as a leading issue for all organisations, there has 
been a significant focus during 2017 on reviewing 
the Group’s material IT controls, policies and 
procedures to ensure their resilience to support 
business performance. The Board received a 
presentation on the mitigating actions being 
undertaken and an assessment of the Group’s 
state of preparedness on 27 July 2017. A case 
study of the work undertaken to address cyber 
risk is set out on page 54. 
Market
The Board, Executive Committee and 
Risk Management Committee have spent 
considerable time during 2017 to ensure that 
the Group’s mixed-tenure approach and 
product mix are best suited to ensure we 
maintain affordability and serve the areas of 
strongest demand. In order to better monitor 
potential changes in market risk, management has 
expanded the range of third party data it 
reviews (such as the monthly Barclays UK 
spend trend) and increased the use of third 
party market assessments in advance of all 
major new projects. Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017

Adverse macroeconomic 
conditions
*
A decline in macroeconomic conditions, or 
conditions in the UK residential property market, 
can reduce the propensity to buy homes. Higher 
unemployment, interest rates and inflation can 
affect consumer confidence and reduce demand 
for new homes. Constraints on mortgage availability, 
or higher costs of mortgage funding, may make 
it more difficult to sell homes.
Adverse changes to Government 
policy and regulation
*
Adverse changes to Government policy in areas 
such as tax, housing, the environment and 
building regulations may result in increased costs 
and/or delays. Failure to comply with laws and 
regulations could expose the Group to 
penalties and reputational damage. 
Funds are allocated between the Housebuilding 
and Partnerships businesses. In Housebuilding, 
land is purchased based on planning prospects, 
forecast demand and market resilience. In 
Partnerships, contracts are phased and, where 
possible, subject to viability testing. In all cases, 
forward sales, cash flow and work in progress 
are carefully monitored to give the Group time 
to react to changing market conditions. 
The potential impact of changes in Government 
policy and new laws and regulations are monitored 
and communicated throughout the business. 
Detailed policies and procedures are in place to 
address the prevailing regulations.

Board, Audit Committee and Risk Management 
Committee responsibility
The Audit Committee reviewed the Group’s risk register and the assessment 
of the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties prepared by the Risk 
Management Committee at its meetings in July and October 2017. The 
Audit Committee also considered the effectiveness of the Group’s systems, 
and has taken this into account in preparing the Viability Statement on 
the previous page.
The Audit Committee reported on its findings at the Board’s July and October 
meetings, in order to support it in making its confirmation that it had 
carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks. 
Principal risks and uncertainties

Inability to source and 
develop suitable land
Competition or poor planning may result in a 
failure to procure land in the right location, at 
the right price and at the right time. 
Inability to attract and retain 
talented employees
*
Inability to attract and retain highly skilled, 
competent people at all levels could adversely 
affect the Group’s results, prospects and 
financial condition. 
Inadequate health, safety 
and environmental procedures
A deterioration in the Group’s health, safety and 
environmental standards could put the Group’s 
employees, contractors or the general public at 
risk of injury or death and could lead to litigation 
or penalties or damage the Group’s reputation. 
A robust land appraisal process ensures each 
project is financially viable and consistent with 
the Group’s strategy. 
Remuneration packages are regularly 
benchmarked against industry standards to 
ensure competitiveness. Succession plans are 
in place for all key roles within the Group. 
Exit interviews are used to identify any areas 
for improvement.
Procedures, training and reporting are all carefully 
monitored to ensure that high standards are 
maintained. An environmental risk assessment 
is carried out prior to any land acquisition. 
Appropriate insurance is in place to cover 
the risks associated with housebuilding. 
Constraints on 
construction resources
*
Costs may increase beyond budget due to the 
reduced availability of skilled labour, or shortages 
of sub-contractors or building materials at 
competitive prices to support the Group’s 
growth ambitions. The Group’s strategic 
geographic expansion may be at risk if 
new supply chains cannot be established.
Programme delay 
(rising project complexity)
Failure to secure timely planning permission 
on economically viable terms or poor project 
forecasting, unforeseen operational delays due 
to technical issues, disputes with third party 
contractors or suppliers, bad weather or changes 
in purchaser requirements may cause delay or 
potentially termination of project.
Optimise use of standard house types and 
design to maximise buying power. Use of 
strategic suppliers to leverage volume price 
reductions and minimise unforeseen disruption. 
Robust contract terms to control costs. 
The budgeted programme for each site is 
approved by the Divisional Board before 
acquisition. Sites are managed as a portfolio 
to control overall Group delivery risk. Weekly 
monitoring at both divisional and Group level.

COMMITTED TO  
GOOD GOVERNANCE
Chairman’s introduction to governance
Supporting implementation of the 
business strategy
The Board has been heavily involved in monitoring 
and supporting the implementation across the 
Group of the strategy outlined during Countryside’s 
initial public offering in February 2016. 
Much progress has been made in 2017 with 
the further development of our Housebuilding 
and Partnerships business divisions, including a 
number of changes to our Executive Committee 
(as shown on pages 44). This has resulted in a 
diverse and experienced executive team to drive 
the performance of those business divisions. 
As set out on pages 50 and 51, the Board has 
combined a number of Board meetings with 
site visits, at which we received presentations 
from the Regional Managing Directors and their 
respective teams. Our site visits and the discussions 
between Non-Executives and members of the 
divisional teams have helped to inform our 
view of the success, and the challenges, of the 
implementation of the Group’s strategy.
Implementing succession planning for 
the Board and Executive Committee
Led by our Nomination Committee, we are 
focused on ensuring that our talent pipeline 
is managed to support the Group’s strategy. 
During 2017 we have assisted the executive 
management in identifying and appointing 
candidates for the Executive Committee and 
other senior management roles, and I am 
delighted with the appointments we have made 
which add significantly to the diversity in skills, 
background and experience at senior management 
level. Biographies of our Executive Committee 
members can be found on page 44, and my 
Nomination Committee Report on page 56 
gives further detail about our input into the 
appointment process.
The Board has continued to support and review 
the success of our leadership development 
programmes. We are confident that these, 
our talent pipeline, and other initiatives such 
as our two female Non-Executive Directors 
talking about their careers and overcoming 
challenges with the senior women within the 
business, mean that we are well set to continue 
our success in developing internal staff into diverse 
and experienced managers of the future. 
Succession planning for the Board and 
Committees has also been on the Nomination 
Committee’s agenda, particularly given the 
Board changes as a result of Oaktree Capital 
Management’s (“Oaktree”) share sell down. 
Again, more detail on our succession planning 
activity can be found in the Nomination 
Committee Report on page 56.
Dear Shareholders,
This report sets out our approach to governance, 
and how our governance framework supported 
our activities throughout the year. 
The Board regards corporate governance as a 
core and vital discipline complementing our 
desire to continually improve upon the success 
of the Group on behalf of our shareholders. 
Our governance framework (described in this 
report) allows for the continued monitoring, 
review, development and implementation of 
the policies, procedures and culture that 
support our high governance standards. 
The success of our strategy is very much dependent 
on developing a culture across the Group that 
supports the implementation of our strategy. 
I am pleased to report that our boardroom 
culture is good, with constructive challenge 
flowing freely from the Non-Executive Directors, 
underpinned by a genuine sense of mutual 
respect between all Directors. This has been 
borne out by our performance evaluation 
process for 2017, the results of which are 
described on page 48.
During 2017, the principal areas of focus for 
the Board have been:
• supporting implementation of the 
business strategy;
• implementing succession planning for the 
Board and Executive Committee;
• improving the management of risk to 
support implementation of the Group’s 
strategic goals; 
• developing policies and procedures to 
address the new Consumer Code for Home 
Builders; and
• preparing for the introduction of the Criminal 
Finances Act and the General Data 
Protection Regulation. 
We have made good progress against all 
of these areas of focus in the year.
Improving the management of risk 
to support implementation of the 
Group’s strategic goals
Risk management, and in particular the 
principal risks faced by the Group, are key 
elements of the Board’s ongoing agenda and 
have been in particular focus this year as we 
monitor the housebuilding market and related 
issues following the UK’s vote in June 2016 
to leave the European Union. Details of our 
principal risks and uncertainties are set out on 
pages 38 and 39. 
Our IT governance and security were 
strengthened during 2017, and security 
generally (but particularly cyber security) 
has remained high on our agenda in 2017. 
The Group has completed a thorough risk 
assessment of information security during 
the year, with regular reports on progress 
considered by the Audit Committee.
Other activities in 2017
Health and safety
A focus on health and safety processes is critical 
for our business. Health and safety KPIs are 
reviewed by the Board regularly.
Our approach to health and safety, including a 
description of the metrics by which we measure 
our health and safety performance, are 
described in detail on page 34. 
The Board published its first statement under 
Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act on the 
Group’s website in November 2016, setting 
out the steps we have taken during the year 
to ensure that our operations and supply 
chains are free from trafficking and slavery. 
The second statement, which includes further 
improvements made during 2017 to combat 
modern slavery, was published on the Group’s 
website in October 2017. 
Meeting our major shareholders
We have developed a comprehensive investor 
relations programme with our Executive Directors 
meeting investors and analysts regularly, supported 
where appropriate by me and other members of 
the Board. Our investor relations programme, 
which is described on page 50, is supported by 
Victoria Prior, who we appointed as Director of 
Investor Relations in November 2015. We have 
carried out a series of shareholder engagement 
events during 2016/17, as shown on page 41. We 
again received positive feedback for each event 
and see them as a valuable opportunity to 
understand the views of and develop constructive 
relationships with our major shareholders.
Corporate governance is a core and vital 
discipline to the success of the Group. Financial statements

Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017
Governance Strategic report
The Board
On 26 May 2017, we announced that Oaktree had completed a sale of 
shares in Countryside, reducing its remaining shareholding in Countryside to 
approximately 23 per cent of the Company’s issued share capital. As 
required by the Relationship Agreement with Oaktree (as described on 
page 49), James Van Steenkiste stepped down from the Board on 5 June 
2017. On 2 October 2017, we announced that Richard Adam had notified 
the Company of his decision to step down as a Non-Executive Director, 
Chairman of the Audit Committee and Senior Independent Director of 
the Company, with his last day of service being 31 December 2017. The 
Board has commenced a formal search for his replacement and a further 
announcement will be made as soon as the details and commencement 
date of Richard’s successor have been agreed. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank James and Richard for their 
valuable contributions to Countryside since joining the Board. I would also 
like to thank my remaining colleagues on the Board for their continued 
support, commitment, challenge and passion for our business. 
Independence of Directors
The Board reviewed the independence of all Non-Executive Directors 
(excluding the Chairman) at the Board meeting on 27 July 2017, and 
determined that they all continue to be independent, with the exception 
of Federico Canciani, who holds the position of Managing Director at 
Oaktree Capital Management (UK) Limited, a substantial shareholder 
of the Company. The Board is satisfied that the Chairman was 
independent upon appointment. 
Board and Committee effectiveness 
In 2017 a Board and Committee evaluation was carried out. The decision 
was made to conduct an internal review, led by me and assisted by the 
Company Secretary. An externally facilitated review will be organised next 
year. I am delighted to confirm that no significant issues were raised and 
the view of the Board is that the governance structure, together with the 
Board and its Committees, all continue to operate effectively, with a 
positive and open culture. The review process is described in more detail 
on page 48. 
I am satisfied that the Non-Executive Directors continue to be effective 
and show a high level of commitment to their roles. All Directors, with 
the exception of Richard Adam (given his departure), will, as they will every 
year, stand for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
David Howell
Chairman

Compliance with the Code 
From 5 June 2017 until 30 September 2017, Countryside has complied 
with all the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 
(the “Code”). Richard Adam will remain as the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director, the Chairman of the Audit Committee and a 
member of both the Remuneration and Nomination Committees until 
his last day of service to the Company on 31 December 2017. During this 
time Countryside will remain compliant with all provisions of the Code.
In planning for Richard Adam’s succession, the Nomination Committee 
has instigated a formal search for his replacement with the intention that 
his successor take on the role of Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director, Chairman of the Audit Committee and join both 
the Remuneration and Nomination Committees.
If Richard Adam’s successor is appointed prior to 31 December 2017, 
and there are no other changes to the Board composition, Countryside 
will remain compliant with all provisions of the Code.
Prior to 5 June 2017, Countryside complied with all the provisions of 
the Code save that, excluding the independent Non-Executive Chairman, 
the Board had only three Non-Executive Directors which it considered 
to be independent. This constituted non-compliance with Code provision 
B.1.2 that recommends at least half the Board, excluding the Chairman, 
comprises independent Non-Executive Directors. Nonetheless, as 
reported in our previous Annual Report, the Board determined that 
the composition of the Board, comprising two Executive Directors and 
six Non-Executive Directors, brought a desirable range of skills and 
experience in light of the Company’s challenges and opportunities 
following admission to the London Stock Exchange, while at the same 
time ensuring that no individual (or small group of individuals) could 
dominate the Board’s decision making. 
Oaktree currently has one Non-Executive Director appointed to the 
Board, following James Van Steenkiste stepping down on 5 June 2017 
after Oaktree’s reduction of its shareholding in the Company to below 
25 per cent. As and when Oaktree reduces its shareholding below 
10 per cent, its right to make Board appointments ceases.

Board role and composition 
The Board is responsible for reviewing and guiding corporate strategy,

to maximise shareholder value. In discharging its responsibilities, the Board 
is supported by its management together with specialist committees. 
In compliance with the Code, the Board has established three Committees:

These Committees have appropriately skilled members, senior management

Review of Board effectiveness
The 2017 Board and Committee evaluation process started with a written 
questionnaire for all Directors, followed by individual interviews during 
which Board members were invited to evaluate and comment on the 
operation of the Board and its Committees. The Chairman and Company 
Secretary met to discuss the results of the process and a report was 
submitted to the Board setting out the principal issues raised and 
suggesting appropriate action points. 
The principal issue raised in the 2017 performance evaluation was Board and 
Executive succession planning which was discussed at the September 2017 
Board meeting. Based on the feedback received, the Board concluded 
that the Board and its Committees continue to operate effectively. 
A list of specific actions was agreed to address the comments made 
by Directors, including the continued improvement of senior management 
succession plans. During the 2017 evaluation process, the Non-Executive 
Directors (in the absence of the Chairman) met with Richard Adam, as 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, to review the performance 
of David Howell during 2017. Mr Adam later debriefed the Chairman. 
All Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman then met to evaluate 
the performance of the Group Chief Executive, Ian Sutcliffe. Finally, the 
Group Chief Executive joined the meeting to brief the Board on the 
performance of the Group Chief Financial Officer, Rebecca Worthington. The 
performance of the Non-Executive Directors during 2017 was reviewed by 
David Howell, taking into account the views of the other Directors.

Directors’ inductions, 
training and development
Countryside has a structured induction programme 
for all newly appointed Non-Executive Directors 
which includes visits to the business divisions 
and their respective management teams in each 
of Countryside’s business sectors and meetings 
with members of the Executive Committee. 
The Non-Executive Director selected to replace 
Richard Adam will undergo Countryside’s induction 
programme. Newly appointed Directors have 
access to the Company Secretary’s assistance 
both in orientation and guidance around the 
Countryside Group, in addition to the exposure 
gained at regular Board meetings.
All Directors receive ongoing updates on the 
Company’s projects and activities and on legal 
and regulatory changes. In 2017 this included 
briefings on the requirements (and implementation) 
of the new General Data Protection Regulation 
(effective from May 2018) and the Criminal 
Finance Act, and changes to the Consumer 
Code for Home Builders in April 2017. 
Formal papers are circulated to the Directors 
before each Board meeting, which enable them 
to make an informed decision on the issues under 
consideration. In addition to formal Board meetings, 
during 2017 the Chairman maintained regular 
contact with the Group Chief Executive, the 
Group Chief Financial Officer and other senior 
executive management to discuss specific issues. 
The Company Secretary acts as an advisor to 
the Board on matters concerning governance 
and ensures compliance with Board procedures. 
All Directors had access to the Company Secretary’s 
advice and during 2017 this was sought from 
time to time. Directors may also take independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense. 
In the event that any Director has concerns 
about the running of the Company, or a proposed 
action, which cannot be resolved within the 
Board forum, such concerns may be reflected 
in the Board minutes. Minutes of each Board 
meeting are circulated by the Company Secretary 
following the meeting to allow such comments 
to be raised.
The Board continued
Relationship Agreement 
with Oaktree
For so long as Oaktree qualifies as a “controlling 
shareholder” according to the Listing Rules 
(LR 6.1.4D), the Company is required to have 
in place a written and legally binding agreement 
which is intended to ensure that Oaktree complies 
with the independence provisions set out in 
LR 6.1.4D. Details of the Relationship Agreement 
entered into with Oaktree are set out in the 
Directors’ Report on page 74. 
Role and responsibilities of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible to 
shareholders for creating and sustaining 
shareholder value through the management 
of the Group’s businesses, and the long-term 
success of the Group. It sets the Group’s 
strategic plan and budgets, monitors their 
implementation and, with the assistance of 
the Audit Committee, ensures that executive 
management maintains a system of internal 
operational, financial and regulatory controls 
that identify and manage appropriately the 
risks set out on pages 38 and 39.
Summary of matters reserved 
for the Board
The Board has a formal schedule of matters 
reserved for its decision, which includes the 
approval of half-year and full-year financial 
statements, changes to the Company’s capital 
structure and significant investments, contracts, 
acquisitions, mergers and disposals. These 
reserved matters were last reviewed by the 
Board on 20 November 2017. Other specific 
responsibilities are delegated to the Board 
Committees, which operate within clearly 
defined terms of reference.
Full details of the schedule of matters 
reserved for decision by the Board and 
the responsibilities delegated to the Board 
Committees can be found on the Group’s 
website at investors.countryside-properties.com.
The roles of the Chairman 
and the Group Chief Executive
The roles of the Chairman and the Group 
Chief Executive are clearly segregated and the 
division of responsibilities between them is set 
out in writing and was last agreed by the Board 
on 16 October 2017. The Chairman is responsible 
for leadership of the Board, and ensuring its 
effectiveness by facilitating debate and the 
contribution of Non-Executive Directors. 
Meeting agendas are set by collaboration 
between the Chairman, the Group Chief 
Executive and the Company Secretary. 
The Group Chief Executive is responsible for 
running Countryside’s business, and providing 
strategic leadership to the Group, in 
consultation with the Board.
BOARD SITE VISIT TO GATEACRE 
AND BELGRAVIA, LIVERPOOL
“CREATING PLACES OF REAL 
QUALITY AND DEVELOPING 
A SENSE OF COMMUNITY.”
During 2017, the Board visited 11 different 
development sites, including at least one in 
each business region (as outlined on pages 
50 and 51).
On 13 September 2017, the Board visited 
two sites in our Partnerships North Region 
– Gateacre and Belgravia – both in Liverpool. 
The visits started with a presentation by 
Ian Kelley (Chief Executive of Partnerships 
North) and members of his senior 
executive team, followed by a tour of the 
two sites, led by Ian Kelley and his 
respective site managers.
The prior evening, the Board was joined by 
senior management representatives from 
the Liverpool, Manchester and the new 
West Midlands businesses, to discuss the 
Group’s performance and expansion plans 
in the North West and the Midlands. Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017

Directors’ interests
Under Countryside’s Articles of Association, 
the Board may authorise any actual or potential 
conflicts of interest for Directors. Each Director 
provides the Company Secretary with information 
regarding any actual or potential interests that 
may conflict with those of Countryside, such 
as other directorships, and any other potential 
interests that each thinks may cause a conflict 
requiring prior Board authorisation on a 
semi-annual basis. If the circumstances of any 
of these disclosed interests change, the relevant 
Director is required to update the Company 
Secretary promptly. The register setting out each 
Director’s current disclosures (where relevant) 
was last reviewed and approved by the Board 
at its meeting on 16 October 2017. In each 
such situation, the Director under consideration 
did not vote on the matter. The Board will 
continue to review the register of interests 
regularly to ensure the authorisations, and any 
conditions attached to them, are appropriate 
for the relevant matter to remain authorised. 
The Company Secretary maintains a list of all 
authorisations granted to Directors, setting out 
the date of authorisation and its expiry and 
scope and any limitations imposed (as applicable).
Tenure, election and 
re-appointment of Directors
All Non-Executive Directors, excluding the 
Chairman, have three-year appointments from 
17 December 2015. The Chairman’s three-year 
appointment started on 14 December 2015. 
All Non-Executive Director appointments may 
be terminated by either party upon three months’ 
(or in the case of David Howell, six months’) 
written notice, or by shareholder vote at the 
AGM. The Non-Executive Directors do not 
have any entitlement to compensation if their 
office is terminated. Full details of the remuneration 
of the Non-Executive Directors can be found 
on page 67 of the Remuneration Report. Under 
the Articles of Association, all Directors are 
subject to re-election at the AGM at intervals 
of no more than three years. In line with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, all Directors 
(except for Richard Adam, given his resignation) 
will be put forward for re-election at the 2018 
AGM. The Board believes that each of the 
Directors makes a valuable contribution to 
Countryside, and supports their re-election 
in each case. 
Communications with shareholders
The Board places importance on communication with shareholders and gives them the opportunity to 
meet the Chairman and Directors as appropriate. Shareholders will continue to be given the opportunity 
to meet the Chairman and Directors in the coming 12 months. Arrangements can be made for major 
shareholders to meet with any newly appointed Directors. The Company’s Investor Relations team 
organises an ongoing programme of dialogue and meetings between the Group Chief Executive 
and Group Chief Financial Officer and institutional investors, fund managers and analysts. Brokers’ 
reports and investors’ feedback are circulated regularly to the Board, who discuss these and any 
other key matters relating to investors. In each case the Board, in conjunction with advisors where 
appropriate, determines the strategy to address significant issues raised.
The Company’s Annual General Meeting on 25 January 2018 will provide a valuable opportunity for 
the Board to communicate with private investors. We encourage shareholders to attend the meeting 
and to ask questions of any of the Directors following the conclusion of the formal part of the meeting. 
Details of proxy voting by shareholders, including votes withheld, will be made available on request 
and will be placed on the Company’s website following the meeting.

Dear Shareholders,
During the year, the Committee continued 
in its oversight role on behalf of the Board, 
protecting the interests of shareholders by 
monitoring the Group’s internal control 
framework, financial management and the 
integrity of published financial information 
as well as the effectiveness of the internal 
and external audit processes.
T o ensure that the Group received the best 
support in managing its risk framework, it 
was decided to undertake an external tender 
process for the Group’s internal audit services. 
The Audit Committee reviewed high-quality 
proposals from KPMG and Mazars, and 
considered the alternative of bringing the 
Internal Audit function in house, deciding 
ultimately to recommend the appointment 
of KPMG from 1 October 2017. This decision 
was subsequently approved by the Board.
The Committee determined the scope of 
internal audit activity for the 2017 financial 
year and reviewed the findings of audits 
performed during the year. 
The Committee also ensured that 
recommendations for internal control 
improvements were being implemented by 
management on a timely basis. The Committee 
continued to monitor the integrity of the 
Group’s financial statements, including the 
key judgements and estimates applied by 
management, and scrutinised the scope, 
performance and effectiveness of the external 
audit process. Particular areas of focus were 
the Group’s taxation strategy (ahead of 
its publication on the Group’s website in 
September 2017), profit recognition, carrying 
value of inventory and shared equity loans, 
Viability Statement testing and presentation 
of non-underlying items.
As well as the activities described above, 
the Committee is provided with a number 
of complementary reports by management 
and the internal and external auditors. 
The Committee has regularly met both 
the internal and external auditors without 
management being present and I have discussed 
various matters with the Group Chief Financial 
Officer and Company Secretary in relation 
to issues relevant to the Committee’s work.
Richard Adam
Chairman of the Audit Committee
21 November 2017
Composition 
During 2017, the composition of the Audit 
Committee complied with the Code and 
comprised three Independent Non-Executive 
Directors: Richard Adam, Amanda Burton and 
Sally Morgan. The Board considers Richard Adam, 
the Chairman, to have recent and relevant financial 
experience working with financial and accounting 
matters. The Audit Committee maintains a 
formal agenda for each year to ensure compliance 
with the requirements of the Code, and met 
four times during the year. 
Details of attendance at the Audit Committee 
meetings during the 2017 financial year are set 
out on page 53.
Internal controls
The Board, assisted by the Audit Committee, 
is responsible for regularly reviewing the 
operation and effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal controls. The internal control system is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives and can 
only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance 
against material errors, losses or fraud. The Board 
is also responsible for ensuring that appropriate 
systems are in place to enable it to identify, 
assess and manage key risks. 
The financial reporting process and control 
system (which includes the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements) is monitored 
and maintained through the use of internal control 
frameworks which address key financial reporting 
risks, including risks arising from changes in the 
business or accounting standards. Effectiveness 
is assessed through self-certification and 
independent testing of the controls. 
Whistleblowing
The Group’s whistleblowing policy is supported 
by an external helpline. All cases of whistleblowing 
are investigated by the Company Secretary and 
the results of any investigations are reported 
to the Audit Committee. The Committee is 
satisfied that the policy and its administration 
remain effective.
Risk management
The successful management of risk is critical 
to achieving Countryside’s strategic objectives. 
The Board has delegated responsibility for 
reviewing and maintaining effective risk 
management systems and internal controls to 
the Audit Committee. Day-to-day management 
of the Group’s risk management framework is 
conducted by the Risk Management Committee. 
Its membership and role are detailed on page 47. Financial statements

Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017
Governance Strategic report
The Board reviews the Group risk register annually, 
with the last review occurring on 16 October 2017. 
In managing risk we analyse the nature and extent 
of risks and consider their likelihood and impact, 
both on an inherent and a residual basis, after 
taking account of mitigating controls. This allows 
us to determine how we should manage each 
risk in order to achieve our strategic objectives. 
At the quarterly meetings of the Risk Management 
Committee, management discusses the key risks 
along with the mitigating action plans. Following 
sign off by the Executive Committee, the output 
of this review is presented to the Audit Committee. 
The Group’s key risk management procedures 
have been in place throughout 2017 and up to 
the date of approval of this Annual Report.
Overview of risk 
management process
Internal control 
The Group’s key internal control procedures 
include the following:
• review of the Group’s strategy and the 
performance of principal subsidiaries, 
through a comprehensive system of 
reporting based on variances to annual 
budgets, key performance indicators 
and regular forecasting;
• a quarterly business review for each business 
division. This covers financial performance, a 
detailed range of strategic risks, 
opportunities and KPI metrics which 
measure the overall performance of the 
business sector. This process also identifies 
the key operational issues and actions 
required to address any deficiencies;
• well defined Group policies and processes, 
communicated through the Group Financial 
Reporting Procedures Manual and the intranet, 
and a defined process governing the approval 
of sales opportunities and capital expenditure;
• a defined organisational structure with 
appropriate delegation of authority across 
all levels of the organisation;
• formal authorisation procedures for 
all investments with clear guidelines on 
appraisal techniques and success criteria; and
• formal authorisation procedures for all 
significant sales opportunities and bid 
management, with clear guidelines on 
success criteria and contracting practices.
The Audit Committee has, on behalf of the 
Board, conducted an annual review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control 
systems for 2017 and the period prior to 
approval of this Annual Report. 
The Audit Committee Chairman reported its 
findings to the Board at the 20 November 
2017 Board meeting. It considered all material 
controls in accordance with the Turnbull 
guidance. Following this review no significant 
weaknesses or failings were identified and noted 
improvement areas are being addressed by 
management. The internal control environment 
will continue to be monitored and reviewed 
by the Board and the Audit Committee.
Fair, balanced and understandable
At the request of the Board, the Audit Committee 
considered whether the 2017 Annual Report 
was fair, balanced and understandable and whether 
it provided the necessary information for the 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy. The Audit Committee 
took into account its own knowledge of the 
Group, its strategy and performance in the 
year and comprehensive reviews undertaken at 
different levels in the Group to ensure consistency 
and overall balance. A similar detailed review 
undertaken by senior management and the 
results of the external audit were also taken 
into account by the Audit Committee. 
Prior to the publication of both the interim 
and full-year results for the Group, the Audit 
Committee undertook a detailed assessment 
of the appropriateness of the adoption by 
the Group of the going concern basis in 
the preparation of the financial statements. 
For further information in respect of going 
concern, please refer to the Directors’ Report 
on pages 74 to 76.
Shortly before publication of the full-year financial 
results for 2017, the Audit Committee undertook 
a detailed assessment of the Viability Statement 
and recommended to the Board that the 
Directors can believe that they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the three-year period of their 
assessment. For the detailed Viability Statement, 
please refer to our risk section on page 37 of 
the Strategic Report.
Internal Audit
The work performed by Deloitte, which 
performed Internal Audit services throughout 
the year, focused on areas of greatest risk to the 
Group, including those matters identified 
through the risk management framework and 
any significant change projects occurring within 
the business. 
The objective of Internal Audit is to provide 
independent assurance to the Audit Committee 
over the financial, operational and compliance 
controls and to assist the Audit Committee in 
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal 
controls. Internal Audit reports directly to the 
Group Chief Financial Officer, but has the right 
to report to the Audit Committee Chairman 
independently of the Executive Directors. 
All significant Internal Audit reports are reviewed 
by the Executive Committee and the Audit 
Committee and all reports are made available 
to the external auditor. During the year the 
Audit Committee approved the internal audit 
plan, reviewed the findings from audits and 
monitored the follow-up of actions identified 
in audits.
Oversight of the external audit
Following a tender for external audit and audit-related 
services in 2016, the Audit Committee and 
Board selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
(“PwC”). PwC’s appointment was approved 
by shareholders at the 2017 AGM. The 
Committee’s oversight of the external auditor 
includes reviewing and approving the annual 
audit plan. In reviewing the plan, the Committee 
discusses and challenges the auditor’s assessment 
of materiality and financial reporting risk areas 
most likely to give rise to material error.
PwC reported to the Board and confirmed its 
independence in accordance with ethical standards 
and that it had maintained appropriate internal 
safeguards to ensure its independence 
and objectivity.
The Committee considered the findings of 
the FRC’s Audit Quality Review (“AQR”) team’s 
report into the conduct of PwC audits generally. 
In addition, the AQR team selected to review 
the audit of the Group’s 2016 financial statements 
as part of its annual inspection of audit firms. 
The chairman of the Committee received a copy 
of the findings of the AQR team and has discussed 
this with PwC. Whilst there were no significant 
findings, some areas of PwC’s audit procedures 
were identified as requiring improvement and 
we are satisfied with the responses implemented 
by PwC in the audit of the Group’s 2017 financial 
statements. None of the findings related to the 
Group’s accounting policies.

Report of the Audit Committee continued
Non-audit services policy 
The total of non-audit fees paid to PwC during 
the year is set out in the table opposite. In order 
to maintain its independence and objectivity, 
PwC undertook its standard independence 
procedures in relation to each of these assignments. 
The Audit Committee has received a report at 
each meeting describing the extent of such 
services provided by PwC.
The award of non-audit services to the Company’s 
external auditor is subject to controls agreed 
by the Audit Committee to monitor and maintain 
the objectivity and independence of the external 
auditor. In order to comply with the Ethical 
Standard for Auditors, the Audit Committee 
considered, and re-approved, the Group’s policy 
for auditor independence and the provision 
of non-audit services at its meeting on 
3 October 2017. 
The policy provides details of permitted, prohibited 
and audit-related services in accordance with 
the Ethical Standard. Services including, inter 
alia, those relating to taxation, internal audit, 
the design or implementation of internal controls 
and HR services are prohibited. Authority to 
approve permitted non-audit services has been 
delegated to the Group Chief Financial Officer 
where the services are considered to be clearly 
trivial, defined as those with a fee of less than 
£50,000. Where the services are not clearly 
trivial, or where the cumulative fee in the financial 
year exceeds £100,000, pre-approval is required 
from the Audit Committee. Further Audit 
Committee approval is required when non-audit 
fees reach 70 per cent of the average audit fees 
over the last three years, although this cap will 
not formally apply to the Group until the 
financial year beginning on 1 October 2019. 
During the year the Group obtained the following services from the Group’s auditor as 
detailed below:

SECURITY REVIEW
“ENSURING THAT THE GROUP’S 
INFORMATION IS SECURE AND 
MANAGED CORRECTLY HAS BEEN 
A KEY FOCUS IN 2017.”
As part of Countryside’s review of risk 
management, a thorough information security 
review was conducted between 28 June and 
13 July 2017. Overseen by the Group’s IT 
Management Committee, the project was 
led by the Group IT Director, with the 
support of our security partners, Saepio 
and Pen T est Partners.
The review consisted of an internal and 
external penetration test followed by an 
ISO 27001 audit.
A presentation of the results was made to 
the Board on 27 July 2017 and a detailed 
roadmap of improvements is being put in 
place with the support of our security 
partners and the Board.
An internal audit by Deloitte, to confirm the 
Group’s assessment of cyber risk readiness, 
was carried out in October with the results

Annual evaluation of Audit Committee performance
As part of the overall Board evaluation process, the Audit Committee reviewed its effectiveness during 2017. This evaluation considered areas such as 
its composition, its effectiveness in reviewing the work of the internal and external auditors and the Group’s internal control systems, the quality of 
reporting and the management of risk. No significant issues were raised and the Audit Committee concluded that it continues to operate effectively.
Areas of significant judgement considered by the Audit Committee in 2017
The Audit Committee considered the following matters in respect of the Group’s financial statements, based upon its interaction with both management 
and the external auditor during the year.
Significant matters considered Our response to these matters
Estimation of site profitability
As disclosed in Note 1 to the financial statements, gross profit is recognised as 
homes are sold based on a profit margin for the development taken as a whole. 
Calculating this margin includes forecasting revenue and costs for the development 
as well as allocating land and infrastructure costs on a pro-rata basis.
Profit recognition in relation to commercial land transactions can be subjective 
and dependent on contractual terms.
The accuracy of allocation is monitored at Board level via the monthly 
management accounts and quarterly forecasts, with any judgements being 
discussed with the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee has reviewed and approved the Group’s 
accounting policy in relation to profit recognition.
The external auditor regularly examines the allocation of revenue 
and costs as a routine part of the external audit and no significant 
issues have been identified in this regard.
Carrying value of inventory
Inventory is material to the Group’s balance sheet and there is a risk that the 
carrying value will exceed its net realisable value, particularly in challenging 
market conditions.
Management regularly reviews the carrying value of all sites under development 
and other inventory such as undeveloped land. These reviews have regard 
to the latest cash flow forecasts for the relevant development or land parcel 
and comparable market valuations for land where applicable.
The Audit Committee considered management’s review of the 
carrying value of inventory and the appropriateness of the level 
of provisions held.
The external auditor reported on this matter to the Audit 
Committee at the half-year review and again for the final audit.
The Audit Committee was satisfied that the carrying value 
of inventory is appropriate.
Carrying value of shared equity loans
The Group’s shared equity loan portfolio is held at fair value as an available -for-sale 
financial asset. The fair value is calculated using a discounted cash flow forecast 
based on likely future redemptions and defaults, taking into account future 
house price inflation and discounted using an interest rate equivalent to a 
second charge mortgage.
Management reviews the carrying value regularly and takes into account third 
party evidence where available.
The Audit Committee reviewed the fair value methodology and the 
assumptions applied in determining the fair value of the shared equity 
portfolio and has agreed that the carrying value is appropriate.
The valuation methodology has also been audited by the external auditor.
Viability Statement testing
The Viability Statement testing performed by management was based on the 
latest available three-year forecast. T o ensure that the financial position of the 
Group was robust, downside sensitivity testing was performed by applying 
a range of overlays including reduced sales rates and average selling prices, 
a reduction in land sales and reduced affordable housing sales. We also 
included operational inefficiency downsides including delays to the delivery 
of key sites and enhanced cost inflation.
Each of the above assumptions was based on management’s assumption 
of a reasonable downside outcome.
The Audit Committee reviewed the assumptions applied by 
management in arriving at the conclusion on the Group’s viability 
and agreed that they were reasonable.
Presentation of non-underlying items
During the year, the Group presented certain restructuring costs and the 
impact of a change in the discount rate applied to deferred land and overage 
payments as non-underlying items and excluded them from adjusted 
profit measures.
Having discussed the presentation of these items outside adjusted 
profit with the external auditor, the Committee accepted 
management’s view that the costs presented as non-underlying items 
were non-recurring in nature and that it was appropriate to present 
them outside adjusted profit.
The Committee expects that the presentation of items outside 
adjusted profit will be infrequent. Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017

Report of the Nomination Committee
Review of Board composition
The Nomination Committee leads the process 
for all Board appointments and is responsible 
for reviewing candidates and making a final 
recommendation to the Board, in compliance 
with the Code. The Nomination Committee 
also reviews the structure, size and membership 
of the Board itself, as well as Board Committees 
from time to time, to ensure an appropriate 
mix of experience and skill, and orderly succession 
as required. During 2017, the composition of 
the Nomination Committee complied with the 
Code, comprising a majority of independent 
Non-Executive Directors.
The Nomination Committee recognises that 
diversity, in all its dimensions, across an organisation, 
including at Board level, is important to support 
innovation, strategic development and operational 
efficiency. The Nomination Committee 
will consider candidates for appointment as 
Non-Executive Directors from a wider pool, 
including those with limited (or no) listed 
company experience. It is not the Board’s 
policy to have specific voluntary targets, but it 
will continue to recruit Board members based 
on skills and experience, having regard to the 
requirements of the Code in respect of diversity, 
including gender. 
The Nomination Committee meets at least 
once a year. During 2017 it met twice, to agree 
a succession plan strategy for the Directors, to 
agree changes to the membership, composition 
and responsibilities of the Executive Committee 
and to review the findings of the 2017 Board 
and Committee evaluation. 
While no new appointments were made in the 
financial year to 30 September 2017, there is 
a rigorous and transparent procedure for 
appointments to the Board and its Committees, 
involving undertaking an assessment of the skills 
and capabilities required, drafting a description 
of the role, and carrying out an assessment of 
potential candidates, before making a 
recommendation to the Board.
Annual evaluation of Nomination 
Committee performance
As part of the overall Board evaluation process, 
the Nomination Committee reviewed its 
effectiveness during 2017. This evaluation 
considered areas such as adherence to its terms 
of reference and whether it was operating 
effectively to keep under review the leadership 
needs of the Company. No significant issues 
were raised and the Nomination Committee 
concluded that it continues to operate effectively.
Details of the Nomination Committee’s meetings 
during the 2017 financial year are set out below.

Areas of focus in 2017
• Reviewing the balance of skills, knowledge 
and diversity of experience of the Board, 
in light of the resignation of James Van 
Steenkiste on 5 June 2017
• Ensuring that plans are in place for 
orderly succession for appointments to 
the Board and senior management, to 
retain an appropriate balance of skills and 
experience within Countryside and on 
the Board 
• Leading the process for the replacement 
of Richard Adam
• Oversight of changes to the Executive 
Committee during 2017
Dear Shareholders,
The report below describes the main 
responsibilities of the Nomination Committee 
and how it achieved these in 2017. I would 
like to draw your attention to what we achieved 
in 2017 and what we will focus on in 2018. 
The Board is responsible for succession generally, 
but the Nomination Committee will advise 
the Board on appropriate succession planning 
in the year ahead. The Nomination Committee 
reviewed the composition of the Board in 
light of James Van Steenkiste’s resignation on 
5 June 2017. They concluded that the Board 
retained an appropriate mix of experience 
and skills and that no additional appointments 
were necessary. From 5 June 2017, the Board 
and its Committees have been compliant with 
the Code. The Nomination Committee will also 
lead the search for a replacement for Richard 
Adam. The process commenced on 
2 October 2017.  
During 2017, a number of important changes 
have been made to the membership and 
responsibilities of the Executive Committee, 
full details of which can be found on page 44 
of the report. The Nomination Committee 
has overseen the changes made and reviewed 
the long-term succession planning for the 
members of the Executive Committee and 
key managerial promotions during the year.
I am pleased to report that the feedback from 
the Board effectiveness evaluation process (which 
you can read about on page 48) provided 
confirmation that the Board, and the Board 
Committees, continues to operate effectively.

The work of the Remuneration Committee
During Countryside’s first full financial year as a listed company, the Committee undertook a review 
of senior manager remuneration to ensure the Group could continue to attract and retain suitable 
talent. The review concluded that senior manager remuneration was set at a competitive level. The 
Committee also approved grants under the Group’s share plans, including a discount to market 
value again applied to the SAYE plan.
During 2018, the Committee will undertake a benchmarking exercise on Executive Director remuneration 
as it will be three years since formal benchmarking was carried out, a review of benefits for all 
employees and a review of the Group’s gender pay reporting.

The Group delivered another year of strong growth in both divisions with total completions up 
28 per cent to 3,389 as our Partnerships business continued to deliver on its new business delivery 
and we achieved scale in Housebuilding. This enabled us to deliver a 34 per cent growth in adjusted 
operating profit to £164.1m and ROCE up 370bps to 30.5 per cent.
As highlighted above, 2017 was a year of continued growth building on a strong prior year. 
The annual bonus in 2017 was measured against stretching targets, with performance against them 
detailed below:
2017 pay-out 2016 pay-out
Annual bonus Adjusted operating profit 60% 60%
Adjusted operating margin — 20%
Group return on capital employed 20% —
Personal performance 20% 20%
The Committee believes the bonus outcome is fully warranted and reflects the strong performance 
of the Group. Full details of the targets and performance against them are provided in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration (see pages 67 and 68).
Long T erm Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) awards were granted in December 2016, subject to performance 
against stretching targets, being relative total shareholder return (“TSR”), ROCE and TNAV.
Directors’ remuneration report
Dear Shareholders,
On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report of the 
Remuneration Committee the (“Committee”). 
We sought approval for our remuneration 
policy at the 2017 AGM and were pleased to 
receive more than 99 per cent of votes in 
favour of both the binding remuneration 
policy vote and the advisory Remuneration 
Report vote. On behalf of the Remuneration 
Committee, I would like to thank shareholders 
for their support. Since no changes are 
proposed to the remuneration policy this 
year, there will be only a single advisory vote on 
this statement and the Annual Report on 
Remuneration at the Annual General Meeting 
in January 2018.

Remuneration policy for 2018
Summary of remuneration policy
Element Policy summary
Base salary Base salaries will be set based on the market value of the role and the experience and performance of the individual.
Pension The Company will provide either contributions to the Group’s defined contribution pension scheme or a pension 
salary supplement. Where a salary supplement is chosen, a deduction is made for employer’s National Insurance contributions.
Annual bonus A maximum award of 150 per cent of salary.
The annual bonus is paid annually and is dependent on achievement of financial and other strategic performance 
metrics over the financial year.
T wo-thirds of amounts earned are paid in cash, with one-third deferred as shares for a period of three years.
Long T erm Incentive Plan 
(“LTIP”)
A maximum award of 200 per cent of salary.
LTIP awards will vest subject to stretching targets which may include relative TSR, ROCE and TNAV.
The Committee has discretion to introduce a post-vest holding period and reviews this prior to each year’s award.
The Committee reviewed the salaries of the Executive Directors in September 2017 and awarded salary increases of three per cent with effect from 
1 October 2017, in line with the wider employee base. In addition, Executive Directors will be awarded the maximum bonus opportunity of 150 per cent 
and LTIP of 200 per cent of base salary.
The structure of the annual bonus and LTIP will remain unchanged in 2018, save for the replacement of the personal objective component, which will 
be replaced by Group adjusted operating margin. The annual bonus targets will therefore be based on Group adjusted operating profit, Group adjusted 
operating margin and Group return on capital employed. In line with the overall discretion of the Remuneration Committee to determine the size of any 
bonus payment, as described on page 62, the Committee will take into account the overall performance of an Executive Director against the in-year and 
longer-term strategic goals of the Group when determining bonus awards. LTIP targets will continue to be based on ROCE, TNAV and relative total 
shareholder return.
Conclusion 
The Committee recognises the importance of developing a close relationship with shareholders in facilitating the work of the Committee in developing 
the remuneration policy. We were extremely pleased with the levels of support received for our policy and Annual Report on Remuneration at the 
Company’s first AGM following its IPO. We will continue to ensure that our remuneration policy is both aligned with shareholders’ interests, and 
attracts and retains executives of the required calibre to ensure the Company’s continued success. On behalf of the Committee, I welcome your 
feedback and ask for your support at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Summary of remuneration for 2017 – 
alignment between performance and pay
In 2017, the meetings of the Committee covered the following key areas: 
• benchmarking of senior manager remuneration;
• consideration and approval of grants under the 2016 LTIP and 
2016 SAYE plan;
• determination of LTIP recipients, grant level and targets;
• determination of bonus targets and awards;
• determination of annual salary increases for the Group; and
• consideration of structures and measures for the 2017 annual bonus.
The full Directors’ remuneration policy, approved for three years from 
the 2017 AGM held on 26 January 2017, is shown on pages 60 to 62 for 
ease of reference. No changes have been made to the wording of the 
policy other than to reflect the passage of time or to take account of the 
fact that the policy is now approved and enacted rather than proposed.
Remuneration policy report
Overview of remuneration policy
The Company’s remuneration policy was reviewed fully prior to listing, 
in accordance with current regulation and guidance, in order to ensure 
the remuneration policy in place was appropriate for a listed company.
The Company’s aim is to attract, retain and motivate the best talent 
to help drive continued growth and success as it enters the next stage 
of its development operating as a listed company.
Our remuneration policy aims to align the interests of the Executive Directors, 
senior executives and employees with the long-term interests of shareholders. 
It aims to support a high performance culture with appropriate reward 
for superior performance without creating incentives that will encourage 
excessive risk taking or unsustainable Company performance.
Overall remuneration levels have been set at levels that are considered by 
the Committee to be appropriate for the size and nature of the business. 
All variable pay awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions in 
accordance with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code. Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017

Objective Link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures and assessment
Base salary Recognises the market value of an 
Executive Director’s role, skill, 
responsibilities, performance 
and experience.
Salaries are normally reviewed annually, with any changes effective as of 1 October each year.
Current salaries, effective from 1 October 2017, are as follows:
Group Chief Executive: £530,000
Group Chief Financial Officer: £318,000
Salaries are set by reference to a market benchmark based on companies of a comparable size 
operating in a similar sector. Salary reviews will also take into consideration an individual’s 
performance, responsibility levels and internal relativities.
There is no formal maximum salary. Other than where there is 
a change of role or responsibility, any increases will normally 
be only for inflation and/or in line with the wider workforce.
Not applicable.
Other 
benefits
Provides a market-competitive package. Reviewed periodically to ensure benefits remain market competitive.
The main benefits currently provided include:
 – car or cash allowance;
 – life, personal accident, disability and health insurance;
 – Directors’ and officers’ insurance; and
 – other benefits, including flexible benefits, as provided from time to time, for example 
where a Director relocates.
Executive Directors are eligible for other benefits which are introduced for the wider 
workforce on broadly similar terms.
In addition, the Executive Directors can claim reasonable business expenses and any tax 
thereon may be reimbursed by the Company.
Benefit values vary year on year depending on premiums and the 
maximum potential value is the cost of the provision of 
these benefits.
Not applicable.
Annual bonus 
scheme
Incentivises the Executive Directors to 
deliver against goals linked to the 
Company’s strategy.
Long-term alignment with shareholder 
interests is ensured through the 
deferral element.
Bonus awards may be granted annually.
The performance period is one financial year with pay-outs determined by the Committee 
following the year end, based on achievement against a range of performance targets.
In line with the overall discretion of the Remuneration Committee to determine the size of 
any bonus payment, as described on page 62, the Committee will take into account the overall 
performance of an Executive Director against the in-year and longer-term strategic goals 
of the Group when determining bonus awards. 
Up to two-thirds of the bonus award will be paid out in cash with the remainder deferred 
into shares for a period of three years (subject to continued employment). 
Malus and clawback arrangements will apply to annual bonus awards enabling the reduction in 
vesting or recovery of amounts paid in certain circumstances.
Maximum opportunity: 150 per cent of salary.
Participants may be entitled to dividends or dividend equivalents 
on the deferred shares representing the value of dividends paid 
during the deferral period.
Performance targets will be set by the Committee annually based on a range of 
financial and strategic measures selected to reflect the in-year goals of the business and 
its longer-term strategy and KPIs. At least 50 per cent of the bonus will be based on 
financial measures in any year.
Targets are normally set on a sliding scale, with no more than 25 per cent of the 
maximum typically payable at threshold performance and 50 per cent of the maximum 
typically payable for on-target performance.
Long Term 
Incentive 
Plan (“LTIP”)
Incentivises the Executive Directors to 
successfully deliver the Company’s 
objectives over the longer term and 
to create alignment with investors over 
this period.
Awards of shares that vest three years from the date of grant subject to achievement 
against performance measures, measured over a three-year period. Awards are subject 
to malus and clawback provisions enabling the reduction in vesting or recovery of amounts 
paid in certain circumstances.
The Committee retains the flexibility to incorporate a two-year post-vest holding period as 
part of the LTIP in which Executive Directors will not be permitted to sell vested shares. This 
would take the total period from grant to release of LTIP shares to five years. 
The maximum LTIP award level is 200 per cent of base salary. 
Participants may at the Committee’s discretion receive dividends 
or dividend equivalents representing the value of dividends paid 
during the performance period on LTIP awards.
LTIP performance will be assessed against a mix of metrics that will include a balance 
between financial and shareholder metrics. For the awards to be granted in the 2018 
financial year these are:
 – relative TSR measured against a broad-based comparator group;
 – TNAV; and
 – ROCE.
Targets are set on a sliding scale with no more than 25 per cent of each element 
vesting at threshold performance. The Committee will review and set weightings for 
measures and appropriate targets before each grant. 
The Committee may change the balance of the measures, or use different measures 
for subsequent awards as appropriate.
Pension Aids retention and to provide 
competitive levels of retirement benefit.
Pension contributions are made into the Group’s defined contribution scheme.
Alternatively, a participant may receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension (typically in the 
scenario where they have reached the lifetime allowance for pension tax relief set by HMRC). 
The cash allowance is paid net of employer’s National Insurance contributions.
The maximum contribution or equivalent allowance of up to 
25 per cent of base salary for the Group Chief Executive and 
17.5 per cent for the Group Chief Financial Officer.

The table below sets out the key elements of the policy for Executive Directors, including the rationale for their use and details of their operation: Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017

Notes to the policy table
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors’ remuneration policy 
at the 2017 AGM, authority was given to the Company to honour any 
commitments entered into previously with Directors.
Malus and clawback
The circumstances in which malus and clawback may apply include a 
material misstatement of the Company’s accounts, error in assessment 
of performance or calculation of the number of awards, individual gross 
misconduct or conduct resulting in reputational damage to the Group.
Performance measures and targets
The short and long-term incentive plans have a number of different financial 
performance measures aligned to the performance of the Company. Targets 
will be set with reference to prior year performance, budget and brokers’ 
forecasts (and other external market expectations). Performance targets 
will be set so as to be achievable but representing stretching performance 
for the business.
Annual bonus performance metrics are determined at the start of each 
financial year based on the key business priorities for the year ahead. 
The majority will be linked to a profit metric as this is the primary 
indicator of our sustainable growth. The target ranges for the measures 
used in the annual bonus scheme are considered to be commercially 
sensitive at the start of the financial year and prospective disclosure is not 
in the interest of shareholders. Other than in exceptional circumstances 
where elements remain commercially sensitive, actual targets, performance 
achieved and awards made will be published at the end of the performance 
periods so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any pay-outs.
LTIP metrics are determined at the time of grant with performance 
measures selected to support the Company’s long-term strategy. 
Future metrics will align our long-term goal of value creation for 
shareholders through strong underlying financial growth. It is intended 
that awards under the December 2017 grant will be made on the same 
basis as the two existing awards using TNAV, ROCE and relative TSR as 
the performance measures.
Discretion
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion over certain elements 
of the policy as set out in the report including the operation of the 
variable incentive schemes. The Committee may adjust elements of the 
plans including, but not limited to:
• participation;
• the timing of the grant of award and/or payment;
• the size of an award (up to plan limits) and/or payment;
• in exceptional circumstances, to grant and/or settle an LTIP award 
in cash; 
• discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event 
of a change of control;
• determination of a good leaver (in addition to any specified categories) 
for incentive plan purposes;
• adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, 
corporate restructuring and special dividends); and
• the ability to recognise exceptional events within existing 
performance conditions.
Should any such discretion be exercised, an explanation would be provided 
in the following Annual Report on Remuneration and may be subject to 
shareholder consultation as appropriate.
Non-Executive Director remuneration policy
The Board as a whole is responsible for setting the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors, other than the Chairman, whose remuneration is 
determined by the Committee and recommended to the Board. The table below sets out the key elements of the policy for Non-Executive Directors:
Objective Link to strategy Operation Maximum potential value
Fees Core element of remuneration, 
set at a level sufficient to attract 
and retain individuals with 
appropriate knowledge and 
experience in organisations of 
broadly similar size and 
complexity.
Fee levels are sufficient to attract 
individuals with appropriate 
knowledge and experience.
Non-Executive Directors are paid a 
base fee and additional fees for 
chairmanship of Committees and 
the role of Senior Independent 
Director. In exceptional 
circumstances, fees may also be paid 
for additional time spent on the 
Company’s business outside of 
normal duties.
Fees are reviewed each year, with any increases normally effective 
from 1 October.
Any increases in fees will be determined based on time 
commitment and will take into consideration the level of 
responsibility and fees paid in other companies of comparable size 
and complexity, e.g. median fee levels of comparable companies 
within the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts).
Non-Executive Directors do not receive any variable remuneration 
element or receive any other benefits, other than being covered for 
disability benefits under the Company’s insurance whilst travelling 
on Company business.
The Company will pay reasonable expenses incurred by the 
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors. The Company may also 
provide limited hospitality and selected benefits and settle any tax 
thereon provided that this is in connection with the performance 
of their role.

Approach to recruitment remuneration
The Committee’s approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract candidates of the appropriate calibre and 
experience needed for the role. The remuneration package for any new recruit will be assessed following the same principles as for the 
Executive Directors, as set out in the remuneration policy table.
Where an existing employee is promoted to the Board, the Executive Director policy will apply. Historical entitlements will continue to be honoured 
and allowed to pay out on their original terms, and will be fully disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration at the relevant time.
The table below summarises our key policies with respect to recruitment remuneration:
Remuneration element Recruitment policy
Base salary and benefits The salary level will be set taking into account a number of factors, including market practice, the individual’s 
experience and responsibilities and other pay structures within Countryside and will be consistent with the salary 
policy for existing Executive Directors. Starting salaries may therefore be set below the market level and, subject 
to performance, increased by more than inflation as the employee gains experience over time.
The Executive Director will be eligible to receive benefits in line with Countryside’s benefits policy as set out in 
the remuneration policy table.
Pension An Executive Director will be able to participate in Countryside’s defined contribution pension scheme, or receive 
cash allowance in lieu of pension benefits in line with policy for existing Executive Directors.
Annual bonus An Executive Director will be eligible to participate in the annual bonus scheme as set out in the remuneration 
policy table.
The maximum opportunity will be no more than 150 per cent of salary, of which up to one-third may be deferred 
in shares, as per the policy for existing Executive Directors.
Depending on the timing of the appointment, the Committee may deem it appropriate to set different annual 
bonus performance conditions for Executive Directors for the first year of appointment.
Long-term incentives An Executive Director will be eligible to participate in Countryside’s Long Term Incentive Plan as set out 
in the remuneration policy table.
The maximum opportunity offered may be up to 200 per cent of salary, as per the policy for existing 
Executive Directors.
An LTIP award can be made shortly following an appointment (assuming the Company is not in a closed period).
Share buy-outs/replacement awards The Committee’s policy is to not provide buy-outs as a matter of course. However, should the Committee believe 
it necessary to grant awards to replace awards from a previous employer, the Committee will seek to structure 
any replacement awards such that overall they are no more favourable than the awards due to be forfeited.
In determining the quantum and structure of any buy-out, the Committee will take into account the fair value and, 
as far as practicable, the timing and performance requirements of remuneration foregone.
Where possible, existing arrangements will be used, although the Committee may also make use of the flexibility 
provided by the Listing Rules to make awards without prior shareholder approval in unusual circumstances.
Relocation policies Should relocation of a newly recruited Executive Director be required, reasonable costs associated with this 
relocation will be met by the Company. Such relocation support could include but not be limited to payment of 
legal fees, removal costs, temporary accommodation/hotel costs, a contribution to Stamp Duty, replacement of 
non-transferable household items and related taxes incurred. In addition, and in appropriate circumstances, the 
Committee may grant additional support in relation to the payment of school fees.
The Company’s policy when setting fees for the appointment of new Non-Executive Directors is to apply the policy which applies to current 
Non-Executive Directors. Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017
64
Service agreements and compensation for loss of office
When setting notice periods, the Committee has regard to market practice and corporate governance best practice. Our policy is that notice periods 
for Executive Directors should be no greater than 12 months. Both the Group Chief Executive and the Group Chief Financial Officer have contracts 
with notice periods of 12 months from either side. The notice period for Non-Executive Directors is three months, save in the case of the Chairman 
whose notice period is six months.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but are appointed under letters of appointment which provide for a review after an initial 
three-year term with the possibility of annual renewal. All service contracts and letters of appointment are available for viewing at the Company’s 
registered office and at the AGM.
When approving any termination payments for a departing Director the Committee will always seek to minimise cost to the Company whilst 
complying with the contractual terms and seeking to reflect the circumstances in place at the time. 
The Committee reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation 
(or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation) or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination 
of an Executive Director’s office or employment and may provide assistance with outplacement costs.
The table below sets out, for each element of total remuneration, the Company’s policy on payment for loss of office in respect of Executive Directors 
and any discretion available to the Committee. Broadly, treatment will depend on the circumstances of departure and in particular whether a leaver is 
a “good leaver”. For a “good leaver” the following will normally apply:
Remuneration element Treatment on cessation
Salary, benefits and pension Received for the notice period or payment in lieu of notice. Statutory redundancy payments as appropriate. 
Annual bonus No entitlement to a bonus; however, a pro-rated bonus may be paid following the end of the financial year 
in which they leave. 
Deferred bonus Vesting of deferred bonus shares on cessation.
LTIP The rules of the LTIP set out the treatment of good leavers. In summary, awards will normally vest on the normal 
vesting date and be subject to pro-rating, although the Committee has discretion to allow awards to vest on 
cessation and to waive pro-rating where it feels it is appropriate to do so.
The Committee may pay any statutory entitlements or settle compromise claims in connection with a termination of employment, where considered 
in the best interests of the Company.
Change of control
On a change of control of the Group, the following provisions will apply to Executive Directors:
Remuneration element Treatment on change of control
Salary, benefits and pension Received for the notice period or payment in lieu of notice if notice is given. Statutory redundancy payments 
as appropriate. 
Annual bonus No entitlement to a bonus; however, a pro-rated bonus may be paid following the end of the financial year 
in which they leave. 
Deferred bonus Vesting of deferred bonus shares.
LTIP The rules of the LTIP set out the treatment on a change of control. However, in summary, awards will normally 
vest at the date of change of control and normally be subject to pro-rating, although the Committee has 
discretion to waive pro-rating where it feels it is appropriate to do so.

The Non-Executive Directors are entitled to claim out-of pocket expenses incurred in the performance of their duties and payment in lieu of notice where 
notice is served. They are not entitled to participate in the Company’s share, bonus or pension schemes. The notice period for Non-Executive Directors 
is three months, save in the case of the Chairman, whose notice period is six months.
Statement of consideration of employment 
conditions elsewhere in the Group
Whilst the Committee does not consult directly with employees on 
Executive Directors’ remuneration, the Committee does receive updates 
regarding remuneration for employees across the Company. This is 
considered when determining the remuneration for the Directors.
Differences in remuneration policy between 
Executive Directors and other employees 
The policy described above applies to the Company’s Executive Directors. 
The principles of the policy are designed with due regard to employees 
across the Group. Variable remuneration, particularly the LTIP, is restricted 
to the most senior employees in the Company who may directly influence 
Company performance. However, the Committee is committed to promoting 
a culture of widespread share ownership, including the provision of an 
all-employee share plan.
Policy in respect of external Board appointments 
for Executive Directors
It is recognised that external non-executive directorships may be beneficial 
for both the Company and the Executive Director concerned. At the 
discretion of the Board, Executive Directors are permitted to retain fees 
received in respect of any such non-executive directorships.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The Committee is committed to maintaining a dialogue with our shareholders 
and we welcome their feedback. Any feedback received will be considered 
as part of the Committee’s annual review of remuneration policy. Dialogue 
with prospective shareholders in the lead-up to the Group’s IPO was an 
intrinsic part of its success and underpinned our remuneration policy. The 
share incentive and bonus plans were designed with simplicity and 
shareholder preference in mind, and we have received no adverse comment 
from shareholders about our current plans. We have continued our dialogue 
with shareholders during the year and have had no adverse comments 
from shareholders about our policy or remuneration payments.  Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017

Annual bonus targets and outcomes (audited)
The table below sets out the 2017 bonus targets and outcomes relating to the annual bonus figures shown in the single figure in the table above. 
The Committee was satisfied that these payments fairly reflected Group performance in the year.

As disclosed to shareholders in last year’s report, during 2016 the Board took the strategic decision to re-phase a number of sites, which included sites 
that are now to be built out, rather than sold. This had the effect of deferring £5m of profit in relation to those sites from 2016 to 2017. The Board 
believed that this change was in the best interests of shareholders. However, in order to ensure that the 2017 targets were appropriately stretching 
and management did not benefit as a result, the Remuneration Committee set the targets for 2017 taking account of this profit deferral. 
The personal performance targets and out-turn for each Director are summarised in the table below:

Bonus payments vest in a straight line between threshold and maximum. No bonus is paid if performance falls below the threshold adjusted operating 
profit measure. For Executive Directors and certain members of senior management, one-third of bonus payments are deferred in shares which vest 
after three years. The deferred shares have no performance conditions, but the individual must remain employed by the Group.
The breakdown of the cash and deferred elements of the annual bonus is set out in the table below:

Annual bonus
Both Executive Directors are eligible to receive up to 150 per cent of base salary. The metrics and their weightings for 2018 are as follows:
Metric % of maximum bonus
Group adjusted operating profit 60
Group adjusted operating margin 20
Return on capital employed 20
Note: Details of the targets for each metric are commercially sensitive and will not be disclosed prospectively.
In line with the overall discretion of the Remuneration Committee to determine the size of any bonus payment, as described on page 62, the Committee 
will take into account the overall performance of an Executive Director against the in-year and longer-term strategic goals of the Group when determining 
bonus awards. 
Long Term Incentive Plan
The Committee intends to grant both Executive Directors awards at a level of 200 per cent of salary shortly following the announcement of the 2017 results. 
The proposed performance metrics and their weightings are set out below:

The 2017 ROCE out-turn is discussed on page 29. Given the Group’s plans for further significant investment in growth over the three years to 
30 September 2020, the Committee is satisfied that these targets are appropriately stretching.
For each performance condition, vesting occurs on a linear basis for performance between each point. Performance is measured over three financial 
years to 30 September 2020. 
The TNAV targets are subject to Committee discretion to make such adjustments as are appropriate in the event that the Company’s dividend policy 
changes in future years. Any such adjustments will be fully disclosed to shareholders and will be designed to ensure that the targets are no less 
challenging than the original targets.
Fees for the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors
As disclosed to shareholders in last year’s report, the fees for the Chairman have been increased to reflect the increased responsibility and time 
commitment following the shareholding in Oaktree Capital Management falling below 30 per cent. A summary of current annual fees is shown below:

the advice received by NBS in relation to executive remuneration matters during the year was objective and independent. T erms of engagement are 
available on request from the Company Secretary. NBS is a members of the Remuneration Consultants Group and abides by the Remuneration

Directors’ report
The Directors present their report and the audited ﬁnancial statements 
of Countryside Properties PLC (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries 
(together, the “Group”) for the year ended 30 September 2017.
General information
Countryside Properties PLC is a public limited 
company, listed on the Main Market of the London 
Stock Exchange, incorporated and domiciled in 
the UK. The registered address of the Company is 
Countryside House, The Drive, Brentwood, Essex 
CM13 3AT. The Company acts as the holding 
company and ultimate parent for the Group.
Principal activities and 
Strategic Report
Countryside is a UK homebuilder and urban 
regeneration partner, operating in London and 
the South East of England, and with a presence in 
the West Midlands and the North West of England. 
We operate through two divisions: Housebuilding 
and Partnerships. Our Strategic Report on pages 
2 to 39 sets out detailed information on the 
Group and its strategy, its principal activities, 
the operation of the businesses, and the 
results and ﬁnancial position for the year ended 
30 September 2017. Information on the 
principal risks and uncertainties facing the 
Group, trends and economic factors impacting 
the business and likely future developments 
can also be found in the Strategic Report. 
Board changes
Following Oaktree’s reduction of its 
shareholding in the Company to below 25 per 
cent on 26 May 2017, James Van Steenkiste, a 
Non-Executive Director appointed to the Board 
by Oaktree, resigned on 5 June 2017 in accordance 
with the terms of the Relationship Agreement 
(described below). On 2 October 2017, the 
Company announced that Richard Adam will 
step down from the Board on 31December 2017.
For more details on the members of the Board, 
see pages 42 and 43. The Corporate Governance 
Report on pages 46 to 51 gives more 
information on how the Board functioned 
during the year.
Directors’ interests
The Directors’ interests in the shares and share 
options of the Company are shown on page 70 
of the Remuneration Report.
Significant contractual 
agreements
The Strategic Report describes the most important 
customer and supplier contracts and other 
arrangements essential to the Group. We do 
not consider ourselves to be dependent on a single 
key supplier. Countryside entered into a new 
£300m revolving credit facility on 12 May 2016, 
expiring in May 2021. The first of two options 
on the first and second anniversaries was 
exercised extending the facility to May 2022.
Relationship Agreement with 
controlling shareholders
Where a listed company has a controlling 
shareholder, it is required to have in place at all 
times a written and legally binding agreement 
which is intended to ensure that the controlling 
shareholder complies with the independence 
provisions set out in LR 6.1.4D. A “controlling 
shareholder” is defined as any person who 
exercises or controls on their own, or together 
with any person with whom they are acting in 
concert, 30 per cent or more of the votes able 
to be cast on all or substantially all matters at 
general meetings of a company. LR 6.1.4D 
requires that the agreement must contain 
undertakings that:
(a)  transactions and arrangements with the 
controlling shareholder (and/or any of its 
associates) will be conducted at arm’s length 
and on normal commercial terms;
(b)  neither the controlling shareholder nor any 
of its associates will take any action that 
would have the effect of preventing the 
listed company from complying with its 
obligations under the Listing Rules; and
(c)  neither the controlling shareholder nor any 
of its associates will propose or procure the 
proposal of a shareholder resolution which 
is intended or appears to be intended to 
circumvent the proper application of the 
Listing Rules.
The Board confirms that, in accordance with 
the Listing Rules, on 29 January 2016, the 
Company entered into such an agreement 
(the “Relationship Agreement”) with, among 
others, OCM Luxembourg Coppice T opco S.Á R.L. 
and various Oaktree funds
1
 (together, the 
“Oaktree Shareholders”) which, at the time, 
had a combined total holding of approximately 
56 per cent of the Company’s voting rights. 
Under the terms of the Relationship Agreement, 
the Oaktree Shareholders agreed to the 
independence obligations contained in the 
Relationship Agreement.
On 26 May 2017, the Oaktree Shareholders 
sold shares in the Company, and reduced their 
combined total shareholding to approximately 
23 per cent of the Company’s voting rights. 
Below 25 per cent holding, under the terms 
of the Relationship Agreement, Oaktree 
Shareholders retained the right to appoint 
only one Non-Executive Director to the Board 
of the Company, and so James Van Steenkiste 
resigned from the Board on 5 June 2017. All other 
provisions of the Relationship Agreement, including 
the right for Oaktree Shareholders to appoint 
one Non-Executive Director to the Board of 
the Company, remain in force until such time 
as Oaktree Shareholders reduce their combined 
total shareholding to below 10 per cent of 
the Company’s voting rights. 
The Board confirms that, since the entry into 
the Relationship Agreement on 29 January 2016 
until 21 November 2017, being the latest 
practicable date prior to the publication of 
this Annual Report:
(i)  the Company has complied with the 
independence provisions included in 
the Relationship Agreement; and
(ii)  so far as the Company is aware, the 
independence provisions included in the 
Relationship Agreement have been complied 
with by the Oaktree Shareholders and 
their associates.
As there have been no controlling shareholders 
of the Company other than the Oaktree 
Shareholders, there has been no need for the 
Relationship Agreement to require the Oaktree 
Shareholders to procure compliance by any third 
parties with the independence provisions of 
the Relationship Agreement.

Significant agreements – change 
of control
Upon a change of control of Countryside 
Properties, a number of signiﬁcant agreements 
take effect, alter or terminate as follows:
• Revolving credit facility: Under the terms of 
the £300m revolving credit facility, entered into 
on 12 May 2016, extended in maturity until 
May 2022 on 2 May 2017 and provided by a 
syndicate of banks to Countryside Properties , the 
lenders may, following such change in 
control, elect to continue to provide such 
facility, or alternatively cancel it and require 
all monies borrowed under such facility to 
be repaid.
• Directors and employees: There are no 
agreements between the Company and 
its Directors or employees providing for 
compensation for loss of ofﬁce or employment 
that occurs because of a takeover bid or change 
of control.
Equal opportunities
The Group is committed to employment policies 
which follow best practice based on equal 
opportunities for all employees, irrespective of 
gender, race, nationality, colour, disability, marital 
status, sexual orientation, age or religion. All 
decisions relating to employment practices are 
objective, free from bias and based upon work 
criteria and individual merit. The Group’s 
policy is to offer appropriate training and 
career development to disabled persons that 
are, as far as possible, identical to other 
employees and in line with best practice. In the 
event of a member of staff becoming disabled, 
the Group makes every effort to continue 
employment, arrange appropriate retraining 
and offer opportunities for promotion. 
For more information on our diversity 
statistics, please refer to the Our people 
section on page 31.
Employee involvement
The Group systematically provides employees 
with information on matters of concern to them, 
consulting them or their representatives regularly, 
so that their views can be taken into account 
when making decisions that are likely to affect 
their interests. Employee involvement in the 
Group is encouraged; a common awareness 
on the part of all employees of the financial 
and economic factors affecting the Group 
plays a major role in maintaining the Group’s 
customer-focused approach. For more information 
on how the Group engages its employees, 
refer to page 30 of the report. For more 
information on how employees can participate in 
the Group’s performance through membership 
of the LTIP and SAYE employee share plans, 
refer to pages 116 and 117 of the report. 
Policy on financial instruments
The policy with respect to ﬁnancial instruments 
is covered in the accounting policy (Note 3) 
to the ﬁnancial statements. The Notes to the 
financial statements include the Company’s 
policies and processes for managing its capital; 
its financial risk management objectives; details 
of its financial instruments and hedging activities; 
and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Independent auditor
The Board is satisfied that 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) 
remained independent for the purpose of 
the 2017 audit. 
Corporate governance
A report on Countryside’s corporate 
governance framework, together with its 
compliance with the principles and provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code can

Dividend
The Directors recommend the payment of a 
final dividend of 5.0 pence (2016: 3.4 pence) 
per ordinary share which, if approved by 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, 
will be paid on 9 February 2018 to those 
shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 22 December 2017.
The Company will be operating a Dividend 
Reinvestment Plan (“DRIP”), further details 
of which can found on our website at: 
investors.countryside-properties.com/
shareholder-information/dividends. The DRIP will 
operate automatically in respect of the 2017 
final dividend for those shareholders who have 
previously registered a DRIP mandate (unless 
varied by shareholders beforehand) and also 
in respect of all future dividends, until such 
time as each participating shareholder elects 
to withdraw from the DRIP or the DRIP is 
suspended or terminated in accordance with 
its terms and conditions. The Board will continue 
to keep the availability of the DRIP under 
regular review. 
Shareholders are again reminded to check their 
position regarding any dividend mandates which 
are in place, should they either wish to participate 
in the DRIP or discontinue or vary any participation, 
as existing mandates will apply to all dividend 
payments unless or until revoked.
The right to receive any dividend has been waived 
by the Trustee of the Company’s Employee Benefit 
Trust over those shares held by that Trust.
Power of the Directors
Subject to the Company’s Articles of Association, 
the Companies Act and any directions given by

Directors’ indemnities
By means of a Deed of Indemnity entered into 
separately by the Company and each Director, 
there is a qualifying third party indemnity 
provision (as per the Companies Act 2006) 
that provides, for the ﬁnancial year ended 
30 September 2017 and as at the date of this 
document, that the Company may pay for 
Directors’ indemnities out of its own assets. 
The Company has obtained directors’ and 
ofﬁcers’ insurance for this purpose.
Share capital
At the date of this report, 450,000,000 
ordinary shares (the same number as at 
admission to the London Stock Exchange) 
of £0.01 each have been issued, are fully paid 
up and are admitted to trading on the London 
Stock Exchange. The Company’s Articles of 
Association, copies of which can be obtained 
from the Company’s website, set out the rights 
and obligations attaching to the Company’s 
ordinary shares, as well as the powers of the 
Company’s Directors.
Details of employee share plans are provided in 
Note 30 to the Group financial statements. 
Purchase of the Company’s 
own shares
At the 2017 AGM shareholders approved a 
resolution permitting the Company to make 
purchases of its own shares up to a maximum 
of 45,000,000 ordinary shares representing 
10 per cent of the issued share capital at 
14 December 2016. This resolution remains 
in force until the conclusion of the 2018 AGM. 
The Company has made no purchases of its 
own shares to date. 
The Company will seek to renew this authority 
at the 2018 AGM. 
Authority to allot shares
At the 2017 AGM shareholders approved a 
resolution permitting the Directors to allot 
shares up to an aggregate nominal value of 
£1,500,000. Shareholders also approved a 
resolution authorising the Directors to allot 
shares up to a further aggregate nominal 
amount of £1,500,000 in connection with a 
rights issue. As at 21 November 2017 the 
Directors had not used these authorities and 
these authorities will remain in force until the 
conclusion of the 2018 AGM. 
The Company will seek to renew this authority 
at the 2018 AGM. 
Statement of disclosure of 
information to the auditor
Each Director of the Company confirms that, 
as far as each Director is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the Company’s 
auditors is unaware and that each of the 
Directors has taken all the steps they ought to 
have taken individually as a Director in order to 
make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors is aware of that information.
Going concern
The Directors have reviewed the liquidity position 
of the Group for the 18-month period from 
21 November 2017. The cash ﬂows of the 
Group have been assessed against the Group’s 
available sources of ﬁnance on a monthly basis 
to determine the minimum and maximum 
expected levels of headroom. Based on this analysis 
and an assessment of the potential cash risks, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. The Group therefore continues to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing its 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements. The Directors’ 
Viability Statement can be found in the 
Strategic Report on page 37.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
in respect of the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulation.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union 
and Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 102 
‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in 
the UK and Republic of Ireland’, and applicable 
law). Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Group 
and Parent Company for that period. In preparing 
the financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union have been followed 
for the Group financial statements and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 102, have been followed for 
the Company financial statements, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements;
• make judgements and accounting estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to 
presume that the Group and Parent Company 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are sufficient 
to show and explain the Group and Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Group and Parent Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and 
Parent Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the Parent Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report 
and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group 
and Parent Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions 
are listed in the Board of Directors section 
confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the Parent Company financial statements, 
which have been prepared in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 102 
‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable 
in the UK and Republic of Ireland’, and 
applicable law), give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and loss of the Company;
• the Group financial statements, which have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Group; and
• the Directors’ Report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Group and 
Parent Company, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
it faces.

Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion:
• Countryside Properties PLC’s Group financial statements and parent company financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true and fair 
view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 September 2017 and of the Group’s profit and cash flows for the year 
then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland”, and 
applicable law); and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise: the consolidated and parent company statements of 
financial position as at 30 September 2017; the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated cash flow statement, and the 
consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include 
a description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs 
(UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the 
UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements.
T o the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group 
or the parent company.
Other than those disclosed in note 6 to the financial statements, we have not provided any non-audit services to the Group or the parent company in 
the period from 1 October 2016 to 30 September 2017.
Our audit approach
Context
Countryside Properties PLC is a British housebuilder and urban regeneration company listed on the London Stock Exchange. The Group is wholly UK 
based, operating in London and the South East of England, and with a presence in the Midlands and North West of England through its Partnerships division.
The Group is susceptible to external macro-economic factors such as government regulation, mortgage availability and changes in the wider building 
sector such as customer demand, supply chain availability and build cost inflation. This was particularly relevant for our work in the areas of margin 
forecasting and the valuation of inventory.
Overview
• Overall Group materiality: £7.2 million (2016: £4.6 million), based on 5% of profit before tax, 
adjusted for non-underlying items.
• Overall parent company materiality: £6.5 million (2016: £4.1 million), based on 1% of total 
assets, restricted to an amount below the Group overall materiality.
• The Group operates in two business segments, Partnerships and Housebuilding, as set out in 
the Strategic Report (refer to pages 2 to 39). Each of the operating segments is broken down 
into a number of reporting units which are consolidated into the Group financial statements 
along with central reporting entities.
• We performed audit work over the complete financial information of 17 reporting units, including 
central reporting entities and the parent company which accounted for 85 per cent of the Group’s 
revenues and 83 per cent of the Group’s profit before tax, adjusted for non-underlying items.
• Cost forecast and margin estimates. (Group).
• Land and inventory valuation. (Group).
• Commercial land transactions. (Group).
• Shared equity valuation (available for sale financial assets). (Group).
• Recoverability of investments. (Parent).

Report on the audit of the financial statements continued
Our audit approach continued
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we 
looked at where the Directors made subjective judgments, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions 
and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal 
controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the 
current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) including those which had the 
greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, 
and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified 
by our audit. 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Cost forecast and margin estimates (Group)
Refer to Note 3 (Accounting policies) and Note 2 (Critical accounting policies).
The Group’s margin recognition framework is based on the margin forecast for each 
site. These margins, which drive the recognition of costs as each unit is sold, reflect 
estimated selling prices and costs for each development. This process is effectively a 
method of allocating the total forecast costs, representing both land and build costs of 
a development over each individual unit.
There is a risk that the margin forecast for the site and the margin subsequently 
recognised on each unit sale is not appropriate and reflective of the actual final profit 
margin that will be recognised on a development.
We consider the appropriate margin recognition across the life of the site to be the 
most significant financial reporting risk for the Group, principally due to the high level 
of management judgment involved in the accounting for the Group’s developments 
given that sales prices and build costs are inherently uncertain and are influenced by 
changes in external market factors, such as the availability of mortgages and build 
cost inflation.
We obtained an understanding of management’s process for preparing a site forecast and 
evaluated management’s controls over cost forecasting and changes to forecasts.
We tested management’s controls over the approval of initial forecasts as well as the 
controls over the regular updating of forecasts. We also attended a number of 
management’s monthly divisional board meetings which gave us additional evidence over the 
robustness of the forecasting process.
We held discussions with management to understand the status and progress of a sample of 
sites and tested that the explanations received were consistent with the latest management forecast.
Our substantive procedures focused on sites that generated significant revenue in the year 
and we:
• assessed the appropriateness of a sample of underlying assumptions within the forecasts, 
including sales prices and costs which have a significant impact on the site forecasts;
• assessed management’s historic forecasting accuracy on completed sites in FY17, 
understanding the reasons and testing, where appropriate, differences to the FY16 
forecast margin;
• tested a sample of forecast sales prices to the actual sales price attained for similar 
properties to support the validity of the estimated sales price in the forecast; and 
• tested a sample of costs incurred to third party support. 
Based on the procedures performed, we did not identify any sites where we considered the 
forecast margin to be inappropriate.
Land and inventory valuation (Group)
Refer to Note 3 (Accounting policies) and Note 2 (Critical accounting policies).
Inventory is comprised of land held for development, work in progress, raw materials 
and completed units/part-exchanged properties.
Inventory is the most significant balance in the consolidated statement of financial 
position and is held at the lower of cost and net realisable value (‘NRV’) being the 
margin the development is forecast to make over its lifecycle based upon forecast 
sales prices and build costs. 
The NRV of each development is forecast and monitored as described in the key audit 
matter above and is therefore subject to the same key assumptions. Due to the 
influence of the same external factors and the cyclical nature of the housing industry, 
with periodic downturns in customer demand, there is a risk that the calculation of a 
development’s NRV may be subject to estimation error, leading to inventory being 
held at an incorrect value and an unrecorded impairment charge.
We obtained an understanding of management’s process for preparing a site forecast.
We understood and evaluated management’s controls over the cost forecasting process and 
tested the key controls over the approval of the initial forecasts and the monitoring 
of updates required to the forecasts over the course of the site’s life.
We considered margins for all material sites to identify those with low or eroding margins, 
due to specific issues or underperformance. We discussed the identified sites with 
management, including considering the level of provisions, if any, held against these sites and 
corroborated the explanations with available external evidence in respect of the carrying 
value of inventory.
We obtained an analysis of the composition of the inventory balance, specifically the level 
and ageing of completed but unreserved units, to understand if completed stock is held at 
the appropriate carrying value. 
We also assessed the historical accuracy of management’s forecasting on completed sites in 
FY17, understanding the reasons and testing where appropriate, differences to the FY16 
forecast margin. 
For sites with a provision, we compared the inventory valuation with the forecast NRV.
Based on the procedures performed, we did not identify any sites where we determined 
additional impairments were required, above those already recorded by management. Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017

Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Commercial land transactions (Group)
Refer to Note 3 (Accounting policies). 
The Group has entered into a number of commercial land transactions during the 
year. The nature of these transactions can be complex and bespoke. The format of the 
agreements introduces potential accounting to reflect the terms of the agreements.
Due to their complex nature, we focused on this area to ensure that the accounting 
reflected the underlying agreements.
We held discussions with management to understand the substance of material commercial 
land transactions.
Where applicable, we read the relevant extracts from management’s papers on the 
proposed accounting treatment of the transactions.
We substantively tested material or complex land acquisitions through examination of 
contracts and agreements to check that the acquisition and subsequent overage terms had 
been identified and accounted for appropriately, and that all the related liabilities had been 
properly recorded in the financial statements.
We assessed the accounting treatment of the transactions against IAS 18/IAS 11 as applicable.
We were satisfied that management had appropriately accounted for these transactions.
Shared equity valuation (available for sale financial assets) (Group)
Refer to Note 3 (Accounting policies) and Note 2 (Critical accounting policies).
The Group has advanced loans to homebuyers to assist them in the purchase of their 
property under shared equity schemes. These loans are held as available for sale 
financial assets in the balance sheet and are held at fair value.
The valuation method for these assets is not capable of being based on observable 
market data and therefore the valuation model is subject to management judgment 
and estimates, including expected house price movements, credit risk of borrowers, 
discount rates (which incorporate purchaser default rates), recoverability and expected 
timing of receipt.
Changes in the assumptions used can have a significant impact on the fair value of 
these assets.
We evaluated and tested the mechanics of the calculation to check the correct application of 
the underlying assumptions and accuracy of the calculation.
We obtained a sample of the original loan agreements to verify terms of the loans used 
within the calculation.
We tested a sample of cash receipts from redemptions in the year to bank statements. 
Through discussion with management and review of the calculation we identified the key 
assumptions included within the calculation including expected house price inflation, discount 
rates, recoverability and expected timing of receipt.
We corroborated these assumptions by comparing those used by management with 
comparable discount rates used by similar companies, and our own independent research 
on house prices and redemption rates.
In addition to re-performing management’s sensitivities we performed our own sensitivities 
based upon our own independent research to ascertain the extent to which reasonable 
adverse changes would, either individually or in aggregate, materially change the valuation 
of the assets. 
Based on the procedures we performed we identified no changes to key assumptions which 
would result in a material change to the valuation.
Recoverability of investments (Parent)
Refer to Note 1 (Accounting policies)
The parent company holds investments in its subsidiaries totalling over £700 million. 
We focused on this area due to the size of the investment balance as there is a risk of 
material misstatement if the underlying investments are under-performing.
• We obtained management’s assessment of the carrying value of the investments. We 
agreed the cash flow forecast used in the assessment to formally approved forecasts. 
• We assessed key assumptions within management’s forecasts.
• We performed a sensitivity analysis over key assumptions, including the discount and 
growth rates. 
• We assessed for impairment indicators of which there were none.
• We did not note any exceptions arising from our audit procedures.

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, 
taking into account the structure of the Group and the parent company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.
The Group is comprised of two segments, Housebuilding and Partnerships. These are then further broken down into seven operating divisions, five for 
Housebuilding and two for Partnerships. Each of the divisions is broken down into a number of reporting units (which also include joint ventures) that 
are included in the Group financial statements, along with the centralised functions.
The reporting units vary in size and we identified 17 reporting units, including centralised functions and the parent company which required an audit of 
their complete financial information due to their individual size. These 17 reporting units were all audited by the Group engagement team and, where 
applicable, included the audit of the joint ventures. The reporting units where we performed an audit of the complete financial information accounted 
for 83 per cent of the Group’s profit before tax, adjusted for non-underlying items and 85 per cent of the Group’s revenue.
Our audit work at these reporting units, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level on the consolidation, goodwill, joint venture 
adjustments, tax, share based payments and the ‘available for sale financial assets’, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group and 
parent company financial statements as a whole.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with 
qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual 
financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements 
as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgment, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Overall Group materiality £7.2 million (2016: £4.6 million). £6.5 million (2016: £4.1 million).
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax, adjusted for 
non-underlying items.
1% of total assets, restricted to an amount below 
the Group overall materiality.
Rationale for  
benchmark applied
Based on our professional judgment, we determined 
materiality by applying a benchmark of 5% of profit 
before tax, adjusted for non-underlying items. We believe 
that underlying profit before tax is the most appropriate 
measure as it eliminates any disproportionate effect of 
non-underlying charges and credits and provides a 
consistent year-on-year basis for our work.
We believe that total assets is the primary measure used 
by the shareholders in assessing the position of the 
entity, and is an accepted auditing benchmark.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range of materiality 
allocated across components was between £0.2 million and £6.5 million. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that 
was less than our overall Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £0.3 million (Group audit) 
(2016: £0.2 million) and £0.3 million (parent company audit) (2016: £0.2 million) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, 
warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in respect of the Directors’ statement in the financial 
statements about whether the Directors considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial 
statements and the Directors’ identification of any material uncertainties 
to the Group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern over a period of at least twelve months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. However, 
because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement 
is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the Directors’ statement relating to Going 
Concern in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report. Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017

Report on the audit of the financial statements continued
Reporting on other information
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The 
Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we 
do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether 
there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have 
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to 
report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 
have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, (CA06), ISAs (UK) and 
the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below (required by ISAs 
(UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report for the 
year ended 30 September 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not 
identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of 
the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The Directors’ confirmation on page 37 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The Directors’ explanation on page 37 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they 
have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only 
consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the 
relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”); and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge 
and understanding of the Group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: 
• The statement given by the Directors, on page 53, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable, 
and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and parent company’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and parent company obtained in the course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on page 52 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated 
by us to the Audit Committee.
• The Directors’ statement relating to the parent company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant 
provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. (CA06)

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibility Statement set out on page 77, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The Directors are also responsible 
for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to 
liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 
16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose 
or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Appointment
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the members on 19 November 2015 to audit the financial statements 
for the year ended 30 September 2016 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 2 years, covering the years 
ended 30 September 2016 to 30 September 2017.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 30 September 2017
1. General information 
Countryside Properties PLC (the “Company”) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom whose shares are 
publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange. The Company’s registered office is Countryside House, The Drive, Brentwood, Essex CM13 3AT.
The Group’s principal activities are building new homes and regeneration of public sector land.
The parent company financial statements are on pages 119 to 124.
Initial public offering (“IPO”)
The Company listed its shares on the London Stock Exchange on 17 February 2016. Prior to the IPO, there was a reorganisation of the Group, which 
is described in the 2016 financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the merger method of accounting because the transaction under which the Company 
became the holding company of OCM Luxembourg Coppice Midco S.à r.l. (“Midco”) was a Group reconstruction with no change in the ultimate ownership 
of the Group. All the shareholdings in Midco were exchanged via a share-for-share transfer on 11 February 2016. The Company did not actively trade 
at the time. 
The result of the application of the capital reorganisation is to present the financial statements as if the Company had always owned the Group – the 
financial statements have been presented as a continuation of Midco.
2. Critical accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of the Group’s financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) requires the Directors to make estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and related disclosures. 
Critical accounting judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 3, the Directors have made no individual judgements that have 
a significant impact on the financial statements, apart from those involving estimates which are described below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Estimates and underlying assumptions affecting the financial statements are based on historical experience and other relevant factors and are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. This approach forms the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. Changes in accounting estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based 
or as a result of new information. Such changes are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised. 
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities are described below.
Estimation of site profitability
In order to determine the profit or loss that the Group recognises on its developments and construction contracts in a specific period, the Group 
allocates the total cost of each development, or construction contract between the proportion completing in the period and the proportion to 
complete in a future period. The assessment of the total costs to be incurred requires a degree of estimation due to the long-term nature of the 
Group’s activities and because actual costs are subject to market fluctuations. Group management has established internal controls to review and 
ensure the appropriateness of estimates made on an individual development or contract basis.
Carrying value of inventory
Inventory generated through the normal course of business is recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value. A financial appraisal is prepared 
and updated monthly for each development, which records an estimate of future revenues and expenditure. As both future cost and sales prices 
fluctuate in line with local market conditions, significant adverse variances in either costs or sales prices estimates could lead to an impairment of inventory. 
In circumstances where forecast revenues are lower than anticipated expenditure, an inventory provision is made. This inventory provision may be 
reversed in future periods when there is evidence of improved selling prices or reduced expenditure forecast on a development.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets comprise loans that have been advanced to homebuyers to assist in their purchase of property under historical shared 
equity schemes. The loans are generally secured by a second charge over the property and are either interest free or have interest chargeable from the 
fifth year onwards.
The loans are held at fair value, which is based on an estimate of the future cash flows from the loans. The estimate considers the value of the 
property based upon market conditions, including potential future house price increases, and possible borrower default. The loans are discounted at an 
interest rate equivalent to that which would be payable for equivalent loans made against property by a third party.
3. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These financial statements for the year to 30 September 2017 are those of the Company and all of its subsidiaries. It has been prepared in accordance 
with the IFRS as endorsed by the European Union, IFRS Interpretations Committee (“IFRS IC”) interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 
2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in Sterling and rounded to the nearest £0.1m under the historical cost convention, 
except for available-for-sale financial assets and share-based payments.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 39. 
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described on pages 26 to 29 of the Strategic Report. 
Further disclosures regarding borrowings are provided in Note 23.  Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017
Financial statements Strategic report Governance

3. Accounting policies continued
Going concern continued
As described in the Viability Statement, the Directors have assessed the prospects and viability of the Company over a three-year period to September 
2020. The Board has performed a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Company, including those risks that would threaten Countryside’s 
business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
Having considered the Group’s cash flow forecasts, the Directors are satisfied the Group has sufficient liquidity and covenant headroom to enable the 
Group to conduct its business and meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least the next 12 months. Accordingly these financial statements are 
prepared on a going concern basis.
New standards, amendments and interpretations
No new standards, amendments or interpretations effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 October 2016 have had a material 
impact on the financial statements.
The following amendments to standards and interpretations which will be relevant to the preparation of the Group’s financial statements have been 
issued, but are not effective and have not been early adopted for the financial year beginning 1 October 2017:
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, on ‘Classification and Measurement’ (effective 1 October 2018) addresses the classification, measurement 
and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement 
of financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for 
financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through Other Comprehensive Income and fair value through Profit and Loss (“P&L”). The impact of IFRS 9 is 
being assessed by management. The principal change identified is that gains and losses on shared equity loans will no longer be recognised through the 
Statement of Other Comprehensive Income. It is not expected that this change will have a material impact on the reported results of the Group, 
but will introduce an element of volatility in the Group’s reported profit as the valuation of the shared equity loan portfolio changes.
• IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ (effective 1 October 2018) deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for 
reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising 
from an entity’s contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to 
direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ and 
related interpretations. 
  During the second half, the Group has undertaken a detailed exercise to determine whether IFRS 15 will have a material impact on the Group’s 
results. The new standard is effective for the Group for the 2019 financial year commencing on 1 October 2018. This exercise is substantially 
complete and we have not yet identified any areas of our business where we will see material changes to the way in which we currently recognise 
revenue, except as described below. 
  We are working with advisors and others in the industry to determine the appropriate treatment for the recognition of revenue on land sales to 
Registered Providers of social housing where separate construction activity is also performed for the Registered Provider. We understand that this 
matter is due to be considered by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee at their meeting on 22 November 2017. We 
expect to reach a conclusion on this in the first half of the 2018 financial year and will provide further narrative and quantative disclosure on the 
impact of the standard, if any, in our 2018 Annual Report. 
• IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ (effective 1 October 2019) addresses the definition of a lease, recognition and measurement of leases and establishes principles for 
reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the leasing activities of both lessees and lessors. A key change arising from IFRS 16 
is that most operating leases will be accounted for on balance sheet for lessees. The standard replaces IAS 17 ‘Leases’, and related interpretations. 
Whilst management’s full impact assessment of the introduction of IFRS 16 is not complete, the Group does not have a significant number of leases which 
relate principally to office buildings and leased company cars. The principal impact is likely to be the recognition of additional leasing assets and 
liabilities and the income statement impact is not expected to be material.
• Amendments to IAS 7 and IAS 12 (effective 1 October 2018). These amendments require additional disclosures in the statement of cash flows 
and recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses respectively.
• Amendment to IFRS 2 (effective 1 October 2018). This amendment clarifies the measurement for cash-settled, share-based payments and the 
accounting for modifications that change an award from cash settled to equity settled. It also introduces an exception to the principles in IFRS 2 
that will require an award to be treated as if it was wholly equity settled, where an employer is obliged to withhold an amount for the employee’s tax 
obligations associated with a share-based payment and pay that amount to the tax authority.
• Amendment to IFRS 15 (effective 1 October 2018). These amendments comprise clarifications of the guidance on identifying performance

There are no IFRSs or IFRS IC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group for the 
financial year beginning 1 October 2017.
The Group has not applied the following amendments to standards which are EU endorsed but not yet effective:
• Amendments to IFRS 11: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interest in Joint Operations
• Amendments to IAS 1: Disclosure Initiative 
• Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation
• Amendments to IAS 27: Separate Financial Statements on the Equity Method
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014 Cycle 
The Group is currently considering the impact of these amendments on the Group; however, it is anticipated they will be minimal and effects will 
principally relate to the amendment of current disclosures. Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
For the year ended 30 September 2017
3. Accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities which the Group has the power to control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain economic benefits 
from its activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries are consolidated in the financial statements using the acquisition method of accounting from 
the date on which control is obtained up until the date that control ceases. 
Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the income statement, the statement of changes in equity 
and the statement of financial position.
Where the accounting policies of a subsidiary or equity-accounted investee do not conform in all material respects to those of the Group, adjustments are 
made on consolidation to reflect the accounting policies of the Group.
Intragroup transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated in preparing the financial 
statements. Gains arising from transactions with joint arrangements and associate are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity.
Associate and joint ventures
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence but does not exercise control or joint control. 
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. 
The Group has applied IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements. Under IFRS 11 investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or 
joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. 
Under the equity method of accounting, interests in the associate and joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise 
the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other comprehensive income. When the Group’s share of losses in an 
associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the associate or joint venture, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has 
incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture. 
Unrealised losses arising on transactions between the Group and its associate and joint ventures are eliminated unless the transaction provides 
evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. 
The Group funds its associate and joint ventures through a combination of equity investment and shareholder loans. The Directors review the recoverability 
of investments and shareholder loans for impairment annually. Where an investment is held in an associate or joint venture which has net liabilities, the 
investment is held at £Nil and other long-term interests, such as shareholder loans, are reduced by the value equal to the net liabilities, unless it has 
incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of its associate or joint ventures. 
Business combinations
All acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The cost of an acquisition is the aggregate of the fair values of the assets 
transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued at the date of acquisition. The consideration transferred includes the fair value 
of the asset or liability resulting from a deferred and contingent consideration arrangement.
Costs directly relating to an acquisition are expensed to the income statement. The identified assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at 
their fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of cost of acquisition over the aggregate fair value of the Group’s share of the net identified assets 
plus identified intangible assets is recorded as goodwill.
Intangible assets 
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration on acquisition of a subsidiary over the interest in net fair value of the identifiable net assets and 
contingent liabilities acquired. If the total consideration transferred is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is recognised 
directly in the income statement. 
An impairment review is carried out annually or when circumstances arise that may indicate an impairment is likely. The carrying value of goodwill is 
compared to its recoverable amount being the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is charged immediately 
to the income statement and is not subsequently reversed. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating units (“CGUs”), or 
groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated 
represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. 
Brands
The Group carries assets on the balance sheet for brands that have been acquired. Internally generated brands are not recognised. Cost is determined 
at acquisition as being directly attributable cost or, where relevant, by using an appropriate valuation method. Acquired brands are tested for impairment 
when a triggering event is identified. Acquired brands are amortised over a period of 20 years.
Software
Computer software that generates an economic benefit of greater than one year is recognised as an intangible asset and carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation. Computer software costs that are recognised as assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their economic useful life of four years. 
These are reviewed for impairment at such time as there is a change in circumstances by which the carrying value may no longer be recoverable. Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017
Financial statements Strategic report Governance

3. Accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any applicable impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged at rates to write off the cost of the asset on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. The applicable 
annual rates are:
• Plant and machinery 20 per cent to 25 per cent
• Fixtures and fittings 10 per cent
The Group does not own any land or buildings considered to be non-trade related.
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. 
Financial assets 
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: 
• loans and receivables; and 
• available for sale. 
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets 
at initial recognition. Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or the Group 
transfers substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are 
included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified as 
non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise “trade and other receivables” and “cash and cash equivalents” in the consolidated 
statement of financial position.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative assets that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. 
They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the 
reporting period. 
Equity share scheme loans are classified as available-for-sale financial assets and are initially recorded at fair value net of transaction costs. Fair value is 
assessed annually with gains and losses being recognised directly in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income until the loan is repaid. 
The loans are discounted at an interest rate equivalent to market rate. On repayment the accumulated fair value, which had been recognised in the 
consolidated statement of changes in equity, is recognised in the income statement. If a loan is determined to be impaired, any impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in the income statement.
Increases in the fair value of available-for-sale assets are initially deferred and recorded within reserves. Reductions in the fair value of available-for-sale 
assets are recorded as a reduction in reserves, to the extent available, with any additional reduction recorded in the income statement. The net 
deferral of increases in fair value are disclosed in the available-for-sale reserve.
Inventories
Inventories are normally stated at cost (or fair value if acquired as part of a business combination) and held at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Costs comprise direct materials, applicable direct labour and those overheads incurred to bring the inventories to their present location and condition. 
Net realisable value represents estimated selling price less all estimated costs to sell, including sales and marketing costs.
Land options purchased are initially stated at cost. Option costs are written off over the remaining life of the option and are also subject to impairment 
review. Impairment reviews are performed when circumstances arise which indicate an impairment is likely, such as a refusal of planning permission. 
Any impairments are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Land inventory is recognised when the substantial risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the Group after unconditional exchange of contracts. 
Where land is purchased with deferred payment terms, a corresponding liability is recognised within trade and other payables.
Pre-contract expenditure is capitalised where it is probable that a contract will be signed or otherwise is recognised as an expense within costs of sales 
in the income statement.
Provisions for inventories are made, where appropriate, to reduce the value of inventories and work in progress to their net realisable value.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less any provision for impairment. A provision for 
impairment is established when the carrying value of the receivable exceeds the present value of the future cash flows discounted using the original 
effective interest rate. The carrying value of the receivable is reduced and any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. If collection is 
expected in one year or less, receivables are classified as current assets. If not, they are classified as non-current assets. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and other short-term deposits held by the Group with maturities of three months 
or less. Bank overdrafts are classified within current liabilities. Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017
92
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
For the year ended 30 September 2017
3. Accounting policies continued
Trade payables 
Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated initially at their fair value and subsequently amortised cost. 
Where land is purchased on deferred settlement terms the land and associated liability are discounted to their fair value. The discount to fair value is 
amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method. Changes in estimates of the final 
payment due are capitalised into inventory and, in due course, to cost of sales in the income statement.
Trade payables also include liabilities in respect of land overage where the Group is committed to make contractual payments to land vendors related 
to the performance of the development in the future. Land overage is estimated based on expected future cash flows in relation to relevant 
developments and, where payment will take place in more than one year, is discounted.
Deposits received from customers relating to sales of new properties are classified within current trade payables. 
Trade payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are classified as non-current liabilities. 
Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded initially at their fair value and bank loans are reported net of direct transaction costs to the 
extent that borrowings are available for offset. Such instruments are subsequently carried at their amortised cost and finance charges, including premiums 
payable on settlement or redemption, are amortised over the term of the instrument using the effective interest rate method. The excess 
of unamortised borrowing costs is disclosed within prepayments.
Bank loans are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after 
the date of the statement of financial position. Overdrafts are classified as current liabilities.
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal obligation as a result of a past event which it is probable will result in an outflow of 
economic benefits that can be reliably estimated. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the provision is discounted at the pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability. Provisions for onerous leases are recognised when the foreseeable net cash outflows on 
a lease exceed the benefits derived from the lease which has more than one year before expiring or option to exercise a break.
Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in share premium as a deduction 
from the proceeds.
Where any Group company holds shares in the Company’s equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental 
costs, is deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when there is a legally enforceable right 
to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
Revenue 
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of applicable value-added tax, Stamp Duty Land Tax, rebates and 
discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group. Revenue and profit are recognised as set out below.
Private housing 
Revenue is recognised in the income statement on legal completion at the fair value of the consideration received. 
Part exchange 
In certain instances, property may be accepted in part consideration for a sale of a residential property. The fair value is established by independent 
surveyors, reduced for cost to sell. Differences between net proceeds received and fair value are recorded as a reduction/increase in cost of sales. The 
original sale is recorded in the normal way, with the fair value of the exchanged property replacing cash receipts.
Cash incentives
Cash incentives are considered to be a discount from the purchase price offered to the acquirer and are therefore accounted for as a reduction to revenue.
Land and commercial sales
Revenue is recognised when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the land or commercial property transfer to the buyer, generally 
when there is an unconditional exchange of contracts. Revenue is measured as the fair value of consideration received or receivable.
Affordable housing contracts and design and build contracting
Contract revenue and costs are recognised in accordance with IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’. 
Where the outcome of a long-term contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of 
the contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured by surveys of work performed to date. Variations in contract work, claims 
and incentive payments are included to the extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue and they are capable of being reliably measured.
Where the outcome of a long-term contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that 
it is probable will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. When it is probable that total 
contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately in the income statement within cost of sales.
Project management services
Revenue earned for the provision of project management services, typically to the Group’s joint ventures and associate, are recognised on an accruals 
basis in line with the underlying contract. Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017
Financial statements Strategic report Governance

3. Accounting policies continued
Cost of sales
For sales of private housing, the Group determines the value of inventory charged to cost of sales based on the total forecast cost of developing a site. 
Once the total expected costs of development are established they are allocated to individual plots to achieve a build cost per plot. These costs are 
recognised within cost of sales when the related revenue is recognised in accordance with the Group’s revenue recognition policy.
T o the extent that additional costs or savings are identified as the site progresses, these are recognised over the remaining plots unless they are specific 
to a particular plot, in which case they are recognised in the income statement at the point of sale.
For land and commercial property sales, cost of sales represents the carrying value of the related inventory on the Group’s statement of financial 
position and this is recognised within cost of sales when revenue is recognised in accordance with the Group’s revenue recognition policy.
As outlined above, costs in relation to the sale of affordable housing and design and build contracts are recognised in accordance with IAS 11. 
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Rentals payable and incentives receivable under operating leases are recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease. 
Finance costs and finance income
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs in relation to the Group’s debt facility are recognised on an accruals basis. Also included in borrowing costs is the amortisation of fees 
associated with the arrangement of the financing. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are 
accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the 
instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
The Group does not capitalise borrowing costs into developments.
Unwind of discounting
The finance cost associated with the time value of money on discounted receivables and payables is recognised within finance costs as the discount 
unwinds over the life of the relevant item.
Current and deferred income taxation 
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. 
Current taxation 
The current taxation payable is based on taxable profit for the period which differs from accounting profit as reported in the income statement because 
it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and those items never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability 
for current tax is measured using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax rates used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the 
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets 
and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the substantively enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability 
is settled based upon tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in comprehensive 
income, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity, or items 
charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
when the Group intends to settle the balances on a net basis.
Segment reporting 
Segment reporting is presented in the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Group’s business segments. Segmental reporting reflects the 
Group’s management structure and primary basis of internal reporting. 
Segmental results include items directly attributable to the segment, as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
The chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”) has been identified as the Group’s Executive Committee. The CODM reviews the Group’s internal 
reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. The CODM assesses the performance of the operating segments based on 
underlying operating profit and tangible net operating asset values (“TNOAV”).
Pension obligations 
The Group operates a defined contribution pension plan. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed 
contributions to a separate entity. 
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense 
when they fall due.
Share-based payments
The Group provides benefits to employees (including Directors) of the Group in the form of equity-settled share-based payment transactions, 
whereby employees render services in exchange for rights over shares. For equity-settled share-based payments, the fair value of the employee 
services rendered is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares awarded or options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market 
vesting conditions. All share options are valued using an option-pricing model (Black Scholes or Monte Carlo). This fair value is charged to the income 
statement over the vesting period of the share-based payment scheme.  Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017

3. Accounting policies continued
Share-based payments continued
Countryside Properties PLC invoices its subsidiary undertakings an amount equivalent to the fair value of the grant by the Company of options over its 
equity instruments to the employees of subsidiaries. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is 
recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.
The Group does not operate any cash-settled share-based payment plans.
Adjusted measures
Certain items which do not relate to the Group’s underlying performance are presented separately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income as non-underlying items where, in the judgement of the Directors, they need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their nature, size or 
incidence in order to obtain a clear and consistent presentation of the Group’s underlying business performance. As these non-underlying items can 
vary significantly from year to year they create volatility in reported earnings. In addition, the Directors believe that in discussing the performance of 
the Group, the results of joint ventures and associate should be proportionally consolidated, including the Group’s share of revenue, operating profit 
and TNOAV given their importance to the Group’s operations.
As such, the Directors believe that the “adjusted revenue”, “adjusted Group operating profit” and “adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share” 
measures presented provide a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying performance of the Group’s ongoing business for shareholders. 
Adjusted Group operating profit is not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with the “adjusted” or “underlying” profit 
measures of other companies.
Examples of material and non-recurring items which may give rise to disclosure as non-underlying items are:
• fees incurred in relation to business combinations or capital market transactions; 
• adjustments to the statement of financial position that do not relate to trading activity such as the recognition and reversal of non-trade impairments; 
• the impact of material and non-recurring changes to discount rates;
• accelerated write off of unamortised issue costs on the re-financing of borrowings; and
• the costs of Group restructuring exercises.
Share-based payment charges in respect of the pre-IPO Management Incentive Plan established during the year ended 30 September 2013 in connection 
with the acquisition of Copthorn Holdings Limited and its subsidiary companies by Oaktree Capital Management LLC were also treated as a non-underlying 
item in the prior year. This allows the underlying performance of the Group to be measured from period to period, due to the fact that full benefits 
of owning these shares are crystallised only following an exit event, such as the IPO.
Adjusted Group operating profit is one of the key measures used by the Board to monitor Group’s performance.
Dividends
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Dividends payable are recorded in the period in which they are approved or paid, whichever is earliest.
4. Segmental reporting
Segmental reporting is presented in respect of the Group’s business segments reflecting the Group’s management and internal reporting structure and 
is the basis on which strategic operating decisions are made by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision-Maker (“CODM”). The Group’s two business 
segments are Partnerships and Housebuilding. 
The Partnerships division specialises in medium to large-scale housing regeneration schemes delivering private and affordable homes in partnership with 
public sector land owners and operates primarily in and around London, the West Midlands and the North West of England.
The Housebuilding division develops large-scale sites, providing private and affordable housing on land owned or controlled by the Group, primarily 
around London and in the South-East of England, operating under both the Countryside and Millgate brands.
Segmental adjusted operating profit and segmental operating profit includes items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated 
on a reasonable basis. Central head office costs have been allocated between the segments using a percentage of revenue basis. Items below Group 
operating profit have not been allocated.
Segmental net assets and tangible net operating asset value includes items directly attributable to the segment as well as those that can be allocated on 
a reasonable basis with the exception of intangibles, and net cash or bank debt (excluding unamortised bank loan and arrangement fees).
Countryside operates entirely within the United Kingdom. Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017

Restructuring expense
During the year, certain Group operations were restructured, principally the outsourcing of architecture and design services. As a result of this, a 
number of people left the Group at a cost of £1.6m.
Advisory fees
During the prior year, the Group engaged in corporate activity in relation to the listing of its ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange. Advisory 
costs of £Nil (2016: £10.6m) were incurred in relation to this activity. Additionally, £4.6m of IPO-related costs were charged to the share premium 
account in the prior year. These costs primarily relate to the fees of professional advisors.
Impairment of non-trade receivable 
In 2016, £2.6m was received resulting in a partial reversal of an impairment of a receivable recorded in 2015. 
Share-based payments – pre-IPO
In the year ended 30 September 2013, a Management Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) was approved by the Board in which certain senior employees of Countryside 
Properties (UK) Limited, a subsidiary company, were invited to acquire shares issued by OCM Luxembourg Midco S.à r.l. This Plan was treated as a non-underlying item.
The Plan ended in 2016 as a result of the IPO; as such, no costs were incurred in relation to the Plan in 2017 (2016: £1.9m, of which £1.0m arose as 
a result of the IPO).
Impact of change in discount rate
From 1 April 2017, the discount rate applied to deferred land and overage payments was reduced from 6.0 per cent to 3.4 per cent to reflect the Group’s 
cost of debt. This resulted in a material, non-recurring finance cost of £7.6m (2016: £Nil) being recognised as an expense within non-underlying finance costs.
Impairment of unamortised loan arrangement fees
As described in Note 23, the Group refinanced in May 2016. As a result, unamortised debt finance costs in relation to the previous facility as at the 
refinancing date of £Nil (2016: £3.2m) were expensed as a non-underlying finance cost.
Taxation
A total tax credit of £1.8m (2016: £1.0m) in relation to all of the above non-recurring items was included within taxation in the income statement.
(c) Non-GAAP performance measures
The Directors believe that adjusted revenue (including share of revenue from associate and joint ventures), adjusted operating profit (including share 
of operating profit from associates and joint ventures) and underlying diluted and basic earnings per share measures presented provide a clear and 
consistent presentation of the underlying performance of the Group’s ongoing business for shareholders. These are not measures that are defined 
by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with the adjusted or underlying profit measures of other companies.

Changes to the UK corporation tax rates were substantively enacted as part of the Finance Bill 2016 on 15 September 2016. These include reductions 
to the main rate to 19.0 per cent from 1 April 2017 and to 17.0 per cent from 1 April 2020. This will reduce the Group’s future tax charge accordingly. 
Deferred taxes at the balance sheet date have been measured using the enacted rates that are expected to apply to the unwind of each asset or liability.
The tax assessed for the year is lower (2016: higher) than the standard rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom, which is 19.5 per cent 
(2016: 20.0 per cent).  Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017

Adjustments in respect of prior periods
In both years presented the adjustments relate to the finalisation of entity tax computations following the signing of the Group financial statements. 
Expenses not deductible for tax
This includes disallowable accounting charges in respect of share-based payments and, in the case of the prior period, disallowable costs incurred in 
relation to the IPO, principally legal and advisory fees. 
Deferred tax recorded directly to equity
Tax of £0.7m (2016: £0.2m) was credited directly to equity in relation to share-based payments.
Legislative changes
In the March 2016 Budget the Government announced that it will introduce new rules to restrict the deductibility of net interest costs from 1 April 2017, 
and that from the same date the amount of taxable profits that can be offset by brought forward tax losses will be restricted to 50 per cent of those 
profits. As the proposed changes had not been substantively enacted by the end of the financial period to which these financial statements relate, their 
effects are not included in the tax notes. The overall effect of these changes would not have had a material impact on the financial statements, if they 
had been substantively enacted in the period.
10. Earnings per share 
Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares in issue. In the prior year, the weighted average number of shares in issue was calculated from the date of the IPO to 30 September 2016. 
The weighted average number of shares, for 2016, has been stated as if the Group reorganisation had occurred at the beginning of the year. 
(a) Basic and diluted earnings per share

(b) Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share 
Adjusted Group operating profit represents a key measure for the Group. Adjusted earnings per share excludes non-underlying items from Group 
profit as follows:
2017 2016
Profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent (£m) 117.2 61.1
Add: non-underlying items net of tax (£m) 8.1 12.1
Adjusted profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent (£m) 125.3 73.2
Basic weighted average number of shares (millions) 450.0 450.0
Basic adjusted earnings per share (pence per share) 27.8 16.3
Diluted weighted average number of shares (millions) 453.2 450.2
Diluted adjusted earnings per share (pence per share) 27.7 16.3
Non-underlying items net of tax include costs of £10.1m, net of tax of £2.0m (2016: costs of £13.1m, net of tax of £1.0m).
The above analysis represents a non-GAAP measure which has been included to assist understanding of the Group’s business.

Goodwill
Goodwill relates to the acquisition of the Copthorn Holdings Group in April 2013 (£19.3m) and Millgate Developments in February 2014 (£18.5m). 
Both entities are considered to be cash generating units (“CGUs”). The goodwill balance is tested annually for impairment. The recoverable amount has 
been determined as the value in use of the business assessed on the current five-year cash flow forecasts. These forecasts are based on achieving the 
Group’s medium-term targets of 17 per cent operating margin and 28 per cent ROCE with appropriate growth rates applied in following years. Forecast 
revenue is based on a Board-approved five-year plan which takes into account current market trends and the Group’s growth plans. Cash flow beyond 
the five-year period is extrapolated using a growth rate of 2 per cent per annum. Cash flows generated by both CGUs are discounted using a pre-tax 
discount rate of 12.5 per cent, approved by the Board of Directors. 
Sensitivities
The recoverable value of both CGUs is substantially in excess of the carrying value of goodwill. Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken on each goodwill 
impairment review, by changing the discount rates, profit margins, growth rates and other variables applicable to each CGU. None of these sensitivities, 
either individually or combined, resulted in the recoverable amount of the goodwill being reduced to below its current carrying value. 
Brand
Brand relates to both the Countryside brand (£13.5m), acquired as part of the Copthorn Holdings Group in 2013, and the Millgate brand (£10.7m), 
acquired as part of Millgate Developments Limited in 2014. Both brands have been valued using the income method and are being amortised over a 
useful economic life of 20 years.
Amortisation expense in respect of the Group’s brands of £1.2m (2016: £1.2m) has been charged to administrative expenses. Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017

At 30 September 7.4 8.7
The available-for-sale financial assets comprise loans advanced to homebuyers to assist in the purchase of their property under shared equity schemes. 
The loans are secured by either a first or second legal charge over the property and are either interest free or have interest chargeable from the fifth 
year onwards or tenth year onwards, dependent upon the scheme under which the loans were issued.
The assets are held at fair value, which represents the current market value of the properties held discounted to fair value, based on the redemption 
date of the loan. These loans are subject to credit risk, where loans may potentially not be repaid if the borrower defaults on repayment. An 
adjustment for credit risk is built into the calculation by using a discount rate equivalent for home loans, which rank behind mortgages. None of these 
financial assets are either past due or impaired.
The estimated value takes into consideration movements in house prices, the anticipated timing of the repayment of the asset and associated credit 
risk. As the precise valuation and timing of the redemption of these assets remains uncertain, the Group applies assumptions based upon current 
market conditions and the Group’s experience of actual cash flows resulting from these transactions. These assumptions are reviewed at the end of 
each financial year as part of the impairment review conducted by the Directors. The difference between the estimated future value and the initial fair 
value is credited to finance income over the term of the loan. 
Future house price inflation is assumed to be zero (2016: zero). The discount rate applied is 8.5 per cent (2016: 8.5 per cent), which the Directors 
believe approximates the cost of a second charge mortgage on similar properties. 
If UK house price inflation had been one per cent higher or lower, with all other variables held constant and excluding any effect of current or deferred 
tax, the value of shared equity would increase or decrease by £0.1m (2016: £0.1m) respectively, whilst if the discount rate used had been one per cent 
higher or lower, the value of these financial instruments would decrease or increase by £0.4m (2016: £0.5m) and £0.4m (2016: £0.5m), respectively. 
Changes in economic conditions will change the estimates made, therefore impacting the fair value of these loans.
The inputs used are by nature estimated and the resultant fair value has been classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy.

A deferred tax asset of £0.9m (2016: £2.4m) has been recognised in respect of unutilised losses where realisation of the related tax benefit through 
future taxable profits is probable. Deferred tax assets of £1.9m (2016: £0.4m) in respect of share-based payments, and £Nil (2016: £0.5m) in respect 
of other short-term timing differences has also been recognised. T emporary differences arising in connection with interests in associate and joint 
ventures are not significant. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in relation to losses where it is considered that they are not recoverable in the 
near future. The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of £1.2m on historical losses of £7.0m (2016: £1.3m on losses of £7.4m).  Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017

down through cost of sales by £1.0m (2016: £1.2m). During the year, impairment of inventories in previous years amounting to £0.5m (2016: £0.6m), 
has been reversed due to improved market conditions. During the year provisions of £1.7m (2016: £1.1m) were utilised as inventory was consumed.
T otal provisions against inventory at 30 September 2017 were £4.8m (2016: £6.0m).
Interest incurred on deferred land purchases amounting to £Nil (2016: £0.9m) was capitalised during the year to inventories.

The Directors are of the opinion that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk (Note 29). The fair value of the financial assets is not 
considered to be materially different from their carrying value. The fair values are based on discounted cash flows and are within Level 3 of the fair 
value hierarchy.
Trade receivables at year end have been assessed for recoverability. A provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence of impairment, 
which is usually indicated by a delay in the expected cash flows or non-payment from customers. Trade receivables remaining outstanding past 
their due date are £1.3m (2016: £0.5m); however, none were impaired.
A provision of £8.0m (2016: £8.0m) has been made against amounts due from Countryside Neptune LLP, a joint venture, to reflect the Directors’ view 
of the recoverability of this advance.
The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets. Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017

Bank loans
In May 2016, the Group signed a new £300m revolving credit facility with Lloyds Bank plc, Barclays Bank PLC, HSBC Bank plc and Santander UK plc. 
The agreement has a variable interest rate based on LIBOR and expires in May 2021, although the Group has the opportunity to extend the term of 
the facility by a further two years. Subject to obtaining credit approval from the syndicate banks, the Group also has the option to extend the facility 
by a further £100m. This facility is subject to both financial and non-financial covenants and is secured by floating charges over all the Group’s assets. 
In May 2017, the Group exercised the first option to extend the facility by a further year to May 2022.
The carrying value of the loans drawn under both the old and new facilities is equal to their fair value. As the impact of discounting is not significant, 
the fair values are based on discounted cash flows and are within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
Bank loan arrangement fees are amortised over the term of the facility. As a result of the signing of the new facility agreement in the prior year, the 
unamortised loan arrangement fee for the previous facility of £3.2m was expensed to the income statement as a non-underlying finance cost in 2016 
(Note 6b). £2.8m of debt finance costs in 2016 were capitalised in relation to the new facility and a further £0.6m of debt finance costs were capitalised 
in relation to the May 2017 extension. At 30 September 2017, unamortised loan arrangement fees were £2.6m (2016: £2.5m) and £0.6m (2016: £0.8m) 
of debt finance costs are included in finance costs (Note 7). As the Group did not have any debt at 30 September 2017 or 30 September 2016, the 
unamortised loan arrangement fees are disclosed as a prepayment.

Remuneration of key management personnel
The aggregate remuneration of the Executive Committee, who are considered to be key management personnel of the Group, was £7.1m 
(2016: £6.1m). During the year, the Executive Committee was expanded as described on page 44.
Transactions with key management personnel
In 2014, properties were sold at market value by the Group to parties related to key management personnel who continue to lease them back to the 
Group. Payments under those leases were made to the individuals as follows:
• Close family members of Ian Sutcliffe received £17,250 (2016: £17,250).
• A company of which Graham Cherry, a member of the Group’s Executive Committee, is a Director and shareholder received £21,000 (2016: £21,000).
In 2016 a close family member of Ian Sutcliffe jointly purchased a property from Acton Gardens LLP, an entity in which the Group has a 50 per cent 
interest, at market value of £530,000.
In 2016, a close family member of Ian Sutcliffe and a close family member of Graham Cherry were employed by a subsidiary of the Group. Both 
individuals were recruited through the normal interview process and are employed at salaries commensurate with their experience and roles. The 
combined annual salary and benefits of these individuals is less than £100,000 (2016: less than £100,000).

Fair value estimation
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows: 
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly 
(that is, derived from prices).
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs). The key assumptions used in Level 3 
valuations include house price movements, the expected timing of receipts, credit risk and discount rates. Future house price inflation is assumed to be 
zero (2016: zero). The discount rate applied was 8.5 per cent (2016: 8.5 per cent) which Directors believe approximates the cost of a second charge 
mortgage on similar properties. T echniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, have been used to determine fair value for the Level 3 financial 
instruments.

Assets

There were no transfers between levels during the year. 
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation 
techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity-specific 
estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. If one or more of the 
significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.
The fair values of the financial instruments that are measured at amortised cost is not shown, because the difference is not material.
29. Financial risk management
The main financial risks associated with the Group have been identified as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, housing market risk and credit risk. The Directors 
are responsible for managing these risks and the policies adopted are set out below.
Liquidity risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity (Company share capital, reserves and retained earnings) and debt (bank loan facilities). 
The Group manages its liquidity risk by monitoring its existing facilities for both financial covenant and funding headroom against forecast requirements 
based on short-term and long-term cash flow forecasts. Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017

Cash and cash equivalents includes £74.5m (2016: £36.6m), which is available for offset against loans drawn under the Group’s revolving credit facility 
and overdrafts.
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk reflects the Group’s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in the market. This risk arises from bank loans that are drawn under the 
Group’s loan facilities with variable interest rates based upon UK LIBOR. For the year ended 30 September 2017 it is estimated that an increase by 
0.5 per cent in interest rates would have decreased the Group’s profit before tax by £0.4m (2016: £0.7m). Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017

The financial assets of the Group amounting to £215.7m (2016: £191.9m) with the exception of cash and cash equivalents amounting to £77.4m 
(2016: £38.3m) are all non-interest bearing.
The Group has no exposure to foreign currency risk.
Housing market risk
The Group is affected by price fluctuations in the UK housing market. These are in turn affected by the wider economic conditions such as mortgage 
availability and associated interest rates, employment and consumer confidence. Whilst these risks are beyond the Group’s ultimate control, risk is 
spread across business activities undertaken by the Group and the geographic regions in which it operates. We have considered the sensitivity in 
relation to available-for-sale financial assets, which is detailed in Note 15.
Credit risk
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited solely to the United Kingdom for housebuilding activities and by the fact that the Group receives cash at 
the point of legal completion of its sales.
The Group’s remaining credit risk predominantly arises from trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Loans receivable from financial assets held for sale are those advanced to homebuyers to assist in their purchase of property under the shared equity 
schemes. The loans are secured by either a first or second charge over the property and are held at fair value.
Trade receivables on deferred terms arise from land sales. The amount deferred is secured by a charge over the land until such time payment is received.
Trade and other receivables comprise mainly the amounts receivable from the Homes and Communities Agency in relation to the Help to Buy scheme, 
housing associations, joint ventures and the associate. The Directors consider the credit rating of the various debtors is good in respect of the amounts 
outstanding and therefore credit risk is considered to be low.
Cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments are held with UK clearing banks which are either A or A- rated.
Capital management
The Group’s policies seek to protect returns to shareholders by ensuring the Group will continue to trade profitably in the foreseeable future. 
The Group also aims to optimise its capital structure of debt and equity so as to minimise its cost of capital. The Group manages its capital with 
regard to the risks inherent in the business and the sector within which it operates by monitoring its actual cash flows against bank loan facilities, 
financial covenants and the cash flow forecasts approved by the Directors.

30. Share-based payments
The Group recognised £5.1m (2016: £3.0m) of employee costs related to share-based payment transactions during the financial year. A deferred tax 
asset of £1.9m (2016: £0.4m) was recognised in relation to these transactions, of which £0.8m (2016: £0.2m) was credited to the income statement 
and £0.7m (2016: £0.2m) was credited directly to equity. 
National Insurance contributions are payable in respect of certain share-based payment transactions and are treated as cash-settled transactions. 
The cost of these contributions is included within the share-based payment expense. At 30 September 2017, the carrying amount of National Insurance 
contributions payable was £1.2m (2016: £0.2m), which was recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position within accruals. 
The Group operated a number of share-based payment schemes during the financial year (all of which are equity-settled) as set out below: 
(a) Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (“SRSOS”)
The Group operates an SRSOS, which is open to all employees with more than three months’ continuous service. This is a UK tax-advantaged “SAYE” plan.
Under the SAYE, eligible participants are granted options over such number of shares as determined by reference to their monthly savings contract over 
three years. Participants remaining in the Group’s employment at the end of the three-year savings period are entitled to use their savings to purchase 
shares in the Company at a stated exercise price (set at a discount of up to 20 per cent of the share price on the day preceding the date of grant). 
Employees leaving for certain reasons are able to use their savings to purchase shares within six months of their cessation of employment. 
At 30 September 2017, employees held 760 three-year savings contracts (2016: 650) in respect of options over 3.0 million shares (2016: 2.8 million). 254 
employees subscribed to the December 2016 offer, representing a participation rate of 23 per cent of eligible employees (February 2016: 691 
employees, 70 per cent). The reduction in the participation rate was due to the high number of employees subscribing for the maximum allowed 
amount in February 2016. A reconciliation of option movements is shown below. 
Options granted during the year were valued using the Black Scholes option-pricing model. No performance conditions or assumptions regarding 
service were included in the fair value calculations. The fair value per option granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculation are 
detailed in the table below.

The resulting fair value is expensed over the service period of three years, on the assumption that 45 per cent of options will lapse over the service 
period as employees leave the Company based on the Group’s experience of employee attrition rates.
As the first two awards of options under the scheme were made in the current and prior years, none of the options are currently exercisable. 
The weighted average remaining contractual life of share options outstanding at 30 September 2017 was 1.6 years (2016: 2.4 years).  Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017

(b) Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
Under the LTIP, shares are conditionally awarded to senior managers of the Company. The core awards are calculated as a percentage of the participants’ 
salaries and scaled according to grade. The awards granted in 2016 and 2017 are assessed against ROCE, TNAV and relative TSR. Straight line vesting 
will apply if performance falls between two thresholds. Performance will be measured at the end of the three-year performance period. If the required 
level of performance has been reached, the awards vest and the shares under award will be released. Dividends do not accrue on the shares that vest.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of LTIP awards outstanding at 30 September 2017 was 1.8 years. Details of the shares conditionally 
allocated at 30 September 2017 are set out below.
The conditional shares were valued using the following methods:
• for the non-market-based elements of the award, a combination of a Black Scholes option-pricing model; and
• for the relative TSR elements of the award, a Monte Carlo simulation model.
The key assumptions underpinning the Black Scholes option-pricing model and Monte Carlo simulation model are set out in the table below.

No awards under the plan have vested. 
(c) Deferred Bonus Plan (“DBP”)
Under the DBP, certain senior managers and Directors of the Company receive one-third of their annual bonus entitlement as a conditional share 
award. The number of shares awarded is calculated by dividing the value of the deferred bonus by the average mid-market share price on the three 
business days prior to grant. The shares vest after three years subject to the employee remaining in the employment of the Group. If an employee 
leaves during the three-year period, the shares are forfeited except in certain circumstances as set out in the Plan rules.
The fair value of the awards is equal to the share price on the date of grant. The fair value is expensed to the income statement in a straight line over 
four years, being the year in which the bonus is earned and the three-year holding period.
During the year, 0.5 million shares were conditionally allocated on 15 December 2016 (2016: nil) with the share price on the date of grant being £2.42.

(d) Legacy Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”)
Prior to IPO, Ian Sutcliffe and Rebecca Worthington participated in the MIP under which participants were awarded shares in OCM Luxembourg 
Coppice Midco S.à r.l. (“Midco”). These interests were purchased at fair value, determined by a third party.
Immediately prior to IPO, any shares in Midco held by the participants were exchanged for new shares in Countryside Properties PLC. 
On 17 February 2016, the awards vested when the Company was admitted to the London Stock Exchange. No further performance or employment 
conditions are attached to these shares, save for a requirement not to sell for a period of one year following the IPO. 36.5m shares vested under the 
awards. The residual shareholding for Ian Sutcliffe and Rebecca Worthington at 30 September 2017 is disclosed as part of the total shareholding in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report.
31. Operating lease commitments
The Group has various leases under non-cancellable operating lease agreements. The lease terms are between one and 20 years, and the majority of 
lease agreements are renewable at the end of the lease period at market rate.
The Group also leases various vehicles, under cancellable lease agreements. The Group is required to give a six-month notice for termination of these 
agreements. The lease expenditure charged to the income statement during the year is disclosed in Note 6.
At 30 September the future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases were as follows:

32. Capital commitments
The Group was not committed to the purchase of any property, plant and equipment or software intangible assets at 30 September 2017 (2016: £Nil).
33. Parent company guarantees
The Group has made parent company guarantees to its joint ventures and associate in the ordinary course of business.
The Group has entered into counter indemnities to banks, insurance companies, statutory undertakings and the National House Building Council in 
the ordinary course of business, including those in respect of joint venture partners from which it is anticipated that no material liabilities will arise.
34. Litigation and claims 
The Group is subject to various claims, audits and investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. These matters include but are 
not limited to employment and commercial matters. The outcome of all of these matters is subject to future resolution, including the uncertainties 
of litigation. Based on information currently known to the Group and after consultation with external lawyers, the Directors believe that the ultimate 
resolution of these matters, individually and in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on the Group’s financial condition.
35. Dividend
The following dividends have been recognised as distributions in the year:

The Board of Directors recommend a final dividend of 5.0 pence per share, amounting to a total dividend of £22.5m (2016: £15.3m) which will 
be paid on 9 February 2018 to shareholders on the register on 22 December 2017, subject to shareholder approval. The expense has not been 
recognised in these financial statements as the shareholders’ right to receive the dividend had not been established at 30 September 2017. Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017

Notes to the parent company financial statements
For the year ended 30 September 2017
1. Accounting policies
Company information
Countryside Properties PLC was incorporated on 18 November 2015 to serve as a holding company for the purposes of listing on the London Stock 
Exchange. Countryside Properties PLC was admitted to the premium segment of the London Stock Exchange on 17 February 2016.
The Company was incorporated as part of the Group’s reorganisation before IPO, further details of which can be found in Note 1 of the Group 
financial statements on page 88. Countryside Properties PLC is a limited company domiciled and incorporated in England and Wales. The registered 
office is Countryside House, The Drive, Brentwood, Essex CM13 3AT.
1.1 Accounting convention
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic 
of Ireland’ and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. As the Company has not previously prepared financial statements, no comparatives have 
been presented, no transition exemptions or exceptions have been applied and no reconciliations are presented.
FRS 102 allows a qualifying entity certain disclosure exemptions, subject to certain conditions which have been complied with, including notification of, 
and no objection to, the use of exemptions by the Company’s shareholders.
The Company has taken advantage of the following exemptions:
i. from preparing a statement of cash flows, on the basis that it is a qualifying entity and the consolidated statement of cash flows, included in these 
financial statements, includes the Company’s cash flows;
ii. from the financial instrument disclosures, required under FRS 102 paragraphs 11.39 to 11.48A and paragraphs 12.26 to 12.29, as the information is 
provided in the consolidated financial statement disclosures;
iii. from disclosing share-based payment arrangements, required under FRS 102 paragraphs 26.18(c), 26.19 to 26.21 and 26.23, concerning its own 
equity instruments. The Company financial statements are presented with the consolidated financial statements and the relevant disclosures are 
included therein; and
iv. from disclosing the Company key management personnel compensation, as required by FRS 102 paragraph 33.7.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the parent company’s profit and loss account has not been presented in these financial 
statements. The loss for the year was £2.6m (2016: £11.2m from the period from incorporation to 30 September 2016).
The financial statements are prepared in Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies adopted are set 
out below.
The Company has not disclosed the information required by regulation 5(1)(b) of the Companies (Disclosure of Auditor Remuneration and Liability 
Limitation Agreements) Regulations 2008 as the Group accounts of the Company are required to comply with regulation 5(1)(b) as if the undertakings 
included in the consolidation were a single group.
1.2 Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, are set out in the strategic report on pages 2 to 39. 
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Chief Financial Officer’s Review on 
pages 26 to 29 of the Strategic Report. Further disclosures regarding borrowings are provided in Note 24 of the Group financial statements including 
the impact of certain sensitivities.
The Directors are satisfied the Group has sufficient liquidity and covenant headroom to enable the Group to conduct its business and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due for at least the next 12 months. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is inextricably linked to the results of the Group as 
a whole. As such, the Directors consider the Company to be a going concern and these financial statements are prepared on this basis.
1.3 Fixed asset investments
The value of the investment in each subsidiary held by the Company is recorded at cost less any impairment in the Company’s statement of financial position.
A subsidiary is an entity that the Company has the power to control.
1.4 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and other short-term deposits held by the Company with maturities of three months or 
less. Bank overdrafts are classified within current liabilities.
1.5 Financial instruments
Fair value measurement of financial instruments
The Company has adopted IAS 39 ‘Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments’.
Financial assets
Financial assets which primarily represent loans to subsidiary companies and cash are initially recognised at fair value.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded initially at their fair value, net of direct transaction costs. Borrowings are subsequently carried 
at their amortised cost and loan arrangement fees are amortised over the term of the instrument. Finance costs associated with each individual 
drawdown are expensed over the period of that drawdown.
Borrowings are classified as non-current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability until the end of the term 
of the agreement. Further details of the Company’s bank loans can be found in Note 24 of the Group financial statements. Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017 Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017

1. Accounting policies continued
1.6 Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Dividends payable on equity instruments 
are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
1.7 Taxation
Current taxation
Income tax for the years presented comprises current and deferred tax.
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the period which differs from accounting profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive 
income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and those items never taxable or deductible. 
The Group’s liability for current tax is measured using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
1.8 Dividend
Dividend distributions to Countryside Properties PLC shareholders are recognised in the Company’s financial statements in the periods in which the 
final dividends are approved in the Annual General Meeting, or when paid in the case of an interim dividend.
1.9 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as 
a deduction from the proceeds.
1.10 Related parties
The Group discloses transactions with related parties which are not wholly owned within the same Group. Where appropriate, transactions of 
a similar nature are aggregated unless, in the opinion of the Directors, separate disclosure is necessary to understand the effect of the transactions 
on the Group financial statements.
2. Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the financial statements requires the Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the 
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and related disclosures.
Critical accounting judgements
In the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies, which are described above, the Directors have made no individual judgements that have 
had significant impact upon the financial information, apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt with below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and other relevant factors and are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
This approach forms the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
Changes in accounting estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based or as a result of new 
information. Such changes are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised.
The key assumptions about the future and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value 
of assets and liabilities are described below.
Impairment of fixed asset investments
Determining whether fixed asset investments are impaired requires judgement and estimation. The Directors periodically review fixed asset 
investments for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management’s judgement, that the carrying amount 
of an asset may not be recoverable. Such indicating events would include a significant planned restructuring, a major change in market conditions 
or technology and expectations of future operating losses or negative cash flows. The Company did not record any impairment charges during 
the year ended 30 September 2017.
3. Operating loss
The Company had no employees during the year (2016: none).
Director’s emoluments are disclosed in note 5 of the Group financial statements. 
Details of the audit and tax fees can be found in note 6 of the Group financial statements.
