Chairman’s Statement
Strategy
Capital	&	Regional	has	made	significant	
progress	in	the	delivery	of	its	strategic	
objectives	this	year.	The	acquisition	
of	a	controlling	stake	in	The	Mall	and	
the	subsequent	successful	tender	
for	units	held	by	minorities	has	been	
transformational	for	the	Group.	
Conversion	to	a	REIT	at	the	end	of	2014	
which	was	followed	by	the	sale	of	its	
German	portfolio,	completed	shortly	
after	the	year	end,	enables	the	Group	to	
focus	all	its	resources	on	its	stated	aim	
to	become	the	UK’s	leading	community	
shopping	centre	REIT.	
The	Group	is	now	well	positioned	to	
achieve	this	objective	based	on	its	
exposure	to	a	high	quality	portfolio	of	
strong	assets,	dominant	in	their	immediate	
catchment,	which	offer	the	potential	to	
generate	significant	income	and	NAV	
growth	based	on	a	programme	of	exciting	
asset	management	initiatives	across	the	
portfolio.
Performance overview
The	timing	of	the	Mall	acquisition	means	
that	both	existing	shareholders	as	well	
as	those	who	participated	in	the	£165	
million	Firm	Placing	and	Placing	and	
Open	Offer	have	been	able	to	benefit	
from	the	upswing	in	investment	markets	
which	has	gathered	momentum	as	the	
year	has	progressed.	The	62.56%	stake	
was	acquired	for	a	consideration	of	£212	
million	at	a	discount	of	5%	to	property	
values	as	at	30	June	2014.
UK	Shopping	Centre	valuations	have	
increased	by	9.3%,	reflecting	a	mix	of	
yield	compression	and	growth	in	valued	
income.	Much	of	this	improvement	
has	taken	place	in	the	second	half	of	
the	year	as	significant	transactional	
activity	has	highlighted	the	attractions	of	
dominant	community	shopping	centre	
assets,	in	particular	the	strong	income	
characteristics.	It	is	the	resilience	of	
these	assets	and	their	ability	to	respond	
to	changing	consumer	behaviour	and	
a	market	increasingly	dominated	by	the	
internet,	retailers’	requirements	and	Click	
&	Collect	that	underpins	this.
It	is	particularly	pleasing	therefore	to	
report	an	increase	in	Net	Asset	Value	per	
share	of	11%	to	60p,	an	increase	which	
fully	takes	into	account	a	doubling	of	the	
number	of	shares	in	issue.	
Pre-tax	profit	was	£67.2	million	compared	
to	the	£7.3	million	reported	in	2013.	
Dividend
For	2014,	the	Board	is	proposing	a	
final	dividend	of	0.60p	per	share	taking	
the	full-year	dividend	to	0.95p	per	
share,	representing	an	increase	of	46%	
compared	to	last	year.
At	the	time	of	the	capital	raise	in	June	
2014,	the	Board	committed	to	deliver	on	
the	basis	of	the	issue	price	of	47p,	a	
dividend	yield	of	at	least	5%	for	the	year	
ending	2015,	and	at	least	6%	following	
acquisition	of	the	minorities	and	the	
restructuring	of	the	Mall	Fund.	I	am	
pleased	to	report	that	all	minorities	were	
taken	out	by	the	start	of	December	and	
the	fund	has	been	successfully	
restructured.	Following	conversion	to	a	
REIT,	the	Board’s	policy	is	to	distribute	at	
least	90%	of	Mall	Operating	Profit,	
allocated	approximately	equally	between	
interim	and	final	dividend	payments.	
Based	on	2014	Proforma	Mall	Operating	
Profit	we	anticipate	this	will	result	in	a	full	
year	dividend	payment	for	2015	of	at	least	
2.9p	per	share.	
Our people
This	year	has	been	exceptionally	
challenging	for	our	management	teams.	
Not	only	have	they	had	to	handle	
transactions	of	particular	complexity	at	
a	corporate	level	but	have	had	to	retain	
their	focus	on	delivering	operational	
excellence	to	our	retail	and	leisure	
operators	whilst	rolling	out	an	ambitious	
asset	management	programme	across	
the	portfolio.	Completion	of	the	Mall	
transaction	now	enables	the	team	to	
focus	all	its	energies	on	successful	
delivery	of	this	plan.	As	I	have	mentioned	
in	the	past,	the	management	platform	is	
key	to	delivery	of	our	growth	ambitions	
and	I	would	like	to	thank	all	our	staff	for	
their	role	in	contributing	to	this	year’s	
progress.
Responsible business
The	value	we	attach	to	our	people	is	
reflected	in	our	continuing	recognition	
as	an	“Investor	in	People”.	A	further

engagement	which	have	again	been

contributes	towards	improving	efficiency	
which	directly	benefits	our	retailers	and	
leisure	operators.	Further	details	are	set	
out	in	the	Responsible	Business	review	in	
the	Strategic	Report.
The Board
The	Group	has	further	strengthened	its	
corporate	governance	during	the	year	
with	the	appointment	of	an	additional	
independent	non-executive	director,	in	
line	with	the	commitment	made	at	the	
time	of	the	Capital	Raise.	I	am	delighted	
to	welcome	Ian	Krieger	who	joined	the	
Board	on	1	December	2014.	Ian	brings	
a	wealth	of	experience	gained	during	a	
40	year	career	first	with	Arthur	Andersen	
and	then	Deloitte.	Ian	has	significant	
boardroom	experience	in	the	real	estate	
and	retail	sectors	and	has	worked	with	a	
wide	variety	of	companies	throughout	his	
career.	Ian	has	joined	both	the	Audit	and	
Remuneration	Committees.
Philip	Newton	has	indicated	his	intention	
to	step	down	from	the	Board	at	the	
AGM	in	2016,	by	which	time	he	will	have	
served	nine	years	as	a	non-executive	
director.	Philip	will,	until	then,	continue	
to	be	the	Senior	Independent	Director	
and	Chairman	of	the	Remuneration	
Committee.

The	positive	underlying	UK	economic

There	were	approximately	£5.7	billion	of

25%	higher	than	2013	and	the	highest	
annual	total	since	2006.

Shopping	habits	continue	to	change	in	a	
multichannel	retail	environment.	In	2014	
Black	Friday	was	firmly	established	but	
the	failure	of	City	Link	alongside	profit	
warnings	by	pure	play	online	operators	
point	to	the	fragility	of	the	home	delivery	
model.	The	popularity	of	Click	&	Collect	
has	increased,	for	example	it	now	forms	
56%	of	John	Lewis’	online	sales.	Across	
the	C&R	portfolio,	70%	of	our	occupiers	
now	offer	this	service	(up	from	58%	in	
2013).	So	whilst,	according	to	CBRE	
research,	over	50%	of	consumers	from	
all	age	groups	shop	online,	they	do	so	as	
part	of	a	multichannel	approach	and	the	
importance	of	the	physical	store	remains	
clear.
C&R	has	been	at	the	forefront	of	
embracing	and	developing	technical	
innovations	such	as	Wi-Fi,	websites,	
apps	and	social	media	to	benefit	
and	complement	the	physical	retail	
environment.	Whilst	Beacons,	
Augmented	Reality	and	Wearables	
push	their	way	into	the	psyche	of	the	
UK	consumer,	what’s	clear	is	that	a	
trip	to	the	shops	engaging	all	physical	
senses	provides	a	good	antidote	to	
what	otherwise	could	be	everyday	digital	
overload.	The	need	for	the	physical	was	
played	out	this	Christmas	with	increased	
sales	of	books	and	records	reported	by	
leading	retailers.
To	be	truly	relevant	within	a	community,	
our	centres	are	increasingly	stretching	
beyond	retail	and	car	parks,	leisure,	
office,	hotel,	gym,	and	latterly	residential	
are	all	part	of	the	offer	that	we	continue	
to	develop.	With	over	20%	of	our	income	
now	coming	from	uses	beyond	retail,	the	
relevance	and	robustness	of	our	income	
stream,	in	the	context	of	the	town	centre,	
continues	to	strengthen.
All	the	evidence	points	to	the	importance	
of	our	schemes	as	retail	led	hubs,	
fulfilling	social	and	experiential	needs,	as	
well	as	the	more	traditional,	but	equally	
important,	requirements	of	convenience,	
security	and	value.

Enviromall	Days	in	June	and	Mall	
Monster	Summer	Party	in	August.
Over	22,000	loyalty	card	members	
took	part	in	the	campaign.	Average	
promotional	spend	on	Sundays	
during	the	campaign	was	more	
than	double	the	normal	average	
and	this	helped	drive	Sunday	footfall	
to	increase	by	5%	year	on	year	
between	March	and	October.	The	
campaign	will	be	extended	through	
2015.
The	Mall	Camberley	was	the	first	
community	shopping	centre	in	the	UK	to	
receive	the	CollectPlus	service	allowing	
customers	to	collect	and	return	their	
parcels	from	over	260	brands.
As	well	as	driving	customers	to	our	Mall	
the	service	helps	us	to	understand	which	
brands	our	local	shoppers	are	buying	
from,	offering	useful	intelligence	for	future	
leasing	strategy.	Customer	reaction	to	the	
service	has	been	very	positive.
CollectPlus	will	be	rolled	out	to	the	
remainder	of	The	Mall	portfolio	in	Q2	
2015.

longer to do more shopping.”

Our Business Model
Our core strength is owning and managing dominant community shopping centres 
in the UK. Complementing this we also seek to exploit entrepreneurial opportunities 
across the retail and leisure property sectors. With our experienced team, our strong 
retailer relationships and our extensive community connections, we seek to generate 
sustainable income growth by combining active asset management and development 
with operational excellence. 
Our approach to identifying and adding value to a scheme is illustrated as follows:
We	believe	there	are	a	
number	of	assets	that	meet	
our	potential	investment	
criteria.	Typically	these	
will	be	assets	that	are	
underperforming	in	their	
catchment	but	have	
significant	asset	management	
or	development	opportunities.
If	suitable	we	will	acquire,	
wherever	possible	
leveraging	our	deep	industry	
relationships	to	secure	off	
market	transactions.
Operational Excellence
•	 Develop	excellent	local	
team
•	 Drive	footfall	through	
creative	marketing
•	 Maximise	commercial	
income	opportunities
•	 Reduce	costs
•	 Enhance	website	and	
develop	digital	database
•	 Introduce	C&R	Finance	
Process
Asset Management/
Development
•	 Improve	retail/leisure	mix
•	 Build	local	authority	
partnerships
•	 Deliver	improvements	to	
retail	environment/refurbish
•	 Identify	and	deliver	
development	opportunities
•	 Improved	customer	
experience
•	 Attractive	retail	environment
•	 Relevant	retail	and	leisure	
space
•	 Increased	market	share
•	 Increased	footfall	and	
spend
All	contributing	to	Income 
and Capital Growth
Each	asset	is	held	in	order	to	
generate	sustainable	income	
growth.	If	an	asset	is	ex	
growth,	we	will	look	to	sell	
and	recycle	the	proceeds	into	
new	opportunities.

Connecting with communities
Critical	to	maintaining	and	enhancing	the	
relevance	and	success	of	our	centres	
is	the	role	they	play	in	connecting	
communities.	Such	connections	manifest	
themselves	in	different	ways:
Connecting emotionally
People	have	a	natural	affinity	with	their	
home	town.	Memories	are	made,	
relationships	formed	and	friendships	
sealed.	We	create	the	right	environment	
in	which	people	feel	comfortable	in	
‘their’	mall	-	an	appreciation	of	place	
that	enables	people	to	engage	in	the	
shopping	experience,	a	connection	which	
strengthens	over	time.	At	the	heart	of	
The	Mall	are	our	values:	caring,	dynamic	
and	easy.	We	care	about	getting	it	right	
and	being	the	best	we	can.	We	are	
dynamic	in	meeting	the	needs	of	our	
customers,	always	looking	for	better	ways	
of	doing	things.	We’re	easy	to	deal	with,	
making	sure	that	our	customers	always	
get	a	quick	response	to	any	question	or	
problem	they	may	have.
Connecting physically
Our	Malls	sit	at	the	centre	of	the	towns	
within	which	we	invest	and	typically	
dominate	the	landscape.	They	connect	
physically	with	the	streetscape	of	the	
town	immediately	outside.	Entrances	are	
located	to	provide	convenient	pedestrian	
access.	Car	parks	offer	quick	entry	and	
are	typically	located	near	a	major	public	
transport	hub.	The	result	is	a	centre,	
permeable	to	visitors,	with	natural	flows	in	
and	out	from	the	wider	town	centre	and	
community.
Connecting digitally
C&R	have	pioneered	digital	innovations	
since	we	launched	the	first	shopping	
centre	portfolio	web	site,	theMall.co.uk	
in	2006,	which	has	since	attracted	
more	than	10	million	hits.	Our	free	Wi-
Fi	is	enjoyed	by	customers	(used	2.8	
million	times	in	2014).	Our	centres	are	
increasingly	being	viewed	as	digital	hubs,	
where	customers	are	fulfilling	sales	using	
Click	&	Collect.	Over	70%	of	our	retailers	
now	offer	this	service.	The	combination	
delivers	a	strong	digital	connection	to	our	
communities.
Connecting responsibly
People	are	at	the	heart	of	our	business;	
our	responsible	business	projects	and	
community	partnerships	focus	on	them	
and	are	driven	by	them.	By	reducing	the	
impact	we	have	on	the	environment,	our	
employees,	suppliers,	stakeholders	and	
the	communities	around	reap	the	benefits	
and	further	engage	with	us	to	maintain	
momentum	on	this	shared	responsibility	
agenda.
Connecting commercially
Many	of	our	occupiers	are	independent	
retailers	with	local	heritage.	These	retailers	
provide	a	link	with	the	community	and	
represent	a	real	point	of	difference	for	
shoppers.	Our	Mall	teams	know	the	
customers	and	care	about	the	success	
of	their	Mall,	proud	to	contribute	to	its	
management	and	development.	We	are	
in	business	with	local	authorities,	through	
head	lease	contracts	and	local	planning	
arrangements.	These	commercial	
connections	further	link	us	to	our	
communities.

The	Mall	Camberley	was	the	headline	
gold	sponsor	of	the	penultimate	stage	
of	the	2014	Tour	of	Britain	Cycle	Race	
in	Camberley	in	September	2014.	
As	Camberley	is	also	a	Business	
Improvement	District	(BID)	there	was	
an	opportunity	to	work	with	the	other	
businesses	and	the	BID	team	to	
provide	additional	activities	throughout	
the	town	centre	encouraging	visitors	to	
stay	in	the	town	centre	after	the	cyclists	
had	ridden	out.	As	a	result	the	footfall

Managing Risk
Risk Impact Mitigation
Property risks
Property investments market risks
•	 Weakening	economic	conditions	
and	poor	sentiment	in	commercial	
real	estate	markets	could	lead	to	low	
investor	demand	and	market	pricing	
adjustment
•	 Small	changes	in	property	market	yields	
have	a	significant	effect	on	the	value	of	
the	properties	owned	by	the	Group
•	 Impact	of	leverage	could	magnify	the	
effect	on	the	Group’s	net	assets
•	 Monitoring	of	indicators	of	market	
direction	and	forward	planning	of	
investment	decisions
•	 Review	of	debt	levels	and	
consideration	of	strategies	to	
reduce	if	relevant
There are a number of risks and uncertainties which could have a material impact 
on the Group’s future performance and could cause results to differ materially from 
expectations. 
T wice	a	year	the	Group	undertakes	
a	comprehensive	risk	and	controls	
review	involving	interviews	with	relevant	
management	teams.	The	output	of	this	
process	is	an	updated	risk	map	and	
internal	control	matrix	for	each	component	
of	the	business	which	is	then	aggregated	
into	a	Group	risk	map	and	matrix	which	is	
reviewed	by	executive	management,	the	
Audit	Committee	and	the	Board	and	forms	
the	basis	for	the	disclosures	made	below.	
This	process	clearly	outlines	the	principal	
risks	and	considers	their	potential	impact	
on	the	business,	the	likelihood	of	them	
occurring	and	the	actions	being	taken	to	
manage,	and	the	individual(s)	responsible	
for	managing,	those	risks	to	the	desired	
level.
The	Group’s	transactional	activity	in	the	
year,	most	significantly	the	acquisition	
of	100%	of	The	Mall	and	its	disposal	
of	its	German	joint	venture	(completed	
in	February	2015),	has	resulted	in	the	
removal	of	three	principal	risks	from	the	
table	below	on	the	basis	that	they	are	no	
longer	relevant	or	significantly	reduced	in	
relevance.		
These	are:
•	 Property management income	–	As	
the	Group	now	owns	100%	of	The	
Mall	the	large	majority	of	its	property	
management	income	is	within	the	
Group.
•	 Nature of investments and 
relationships with key business 
partners	–	Given	the	Group	now	owns	
100%	of	The	Mall	and	has	disposed	
of	its	German	joint	venture	the	risk	
of	the	Group’s	relationships	with	key	
business	partners,	while	still	relevant,	is	
significantly	reduced	compared	to	prior	
periods.
•	 Foreign exchange exposure risks	–		
At	30	December	2014	the	Group	had	
hedged	94%	of	the	expected	disposal	
proceeds	in	relation	to	its	German	joint	
venture.	Following	completion	of	the	
disposal	the	Group	no	longer	has	any	
material	foreign	currency	exposure.
A	new	risk	of	execution	of	business	plan	
has	been	added	reflecting	the	risk	of	
failing	to	deliver	on	the	Group’s	stated	
business	plan,	primarily	the	multi-year	
£65	million	capital	expenditure	investment

Positive operational performance
It	is	particularly	pleasing	that	in	a	year	
which	has	been	dominated	by	corporate	
activity	and	against	a	backdrop	of	often	
challenging	conditions	for	our	retailers,	
the	Group	has	been	able	to	report	an	
improvement	in	its	key	operational	metrics	
during	2014.
After	a	number	of	years	in	which	shopper	
numbers	have	fallen,	footfall	was	up	
across	the	seven	shopping	centres	in	
absolute	terms	(by	0.9%)	and	continued	
to	outperform	the	benchmark	(by	1.8%).	
This	is	supported	by	information	from	our	
indicative	C&R	trade	index	which	showed	
retailers’	sales	across	our	portfolio	were	
up	2.2%	in	2014	compared	to	a	0.5%	
decrease	in	2013.	
Administrations	were	sharply	lower	in	
2014	compared	to	2013.	This	has	helped	
occupancy	grow	from	95.0%	as	at		
30	December	2013	to	96.1%	at	the	
end	of	2014	on	a	like-for-like	basis.	
This	increased	occupancy	has	led	to	an	
increase	in	passing	rent,	particularly	in	the	
second	half	of	the	year	from	£62.8	million	
as	at	30	June	2014	to	£64.5	million,	an	
increase	of	2.7%	as	at	30	December	
2014.
Increased asset management activity
Completion	of	the	Mall	acquisition	
has	enabled	the	Group	to	accelerate	
delivery	of	a	number	of	value	enhancing	
initiatives	across	the	portfolio	which	were	
previously	compromised	by	uncertainty	
surrounding	the	future	of	the	Mall	Fund.	
The	much	needed	certainty	provided	by	
the	transaction	has	resulted	in	heightened	
levels	of	engagement	between	our	asset	
managers,	local	councils,	retailers	and	
leisure	operators.	The	Group	is,	as	a	
consequence,	in	a	much	stronger	position	
to	commit	increased	investment	to	its	
shopping	centre	portfolio.	Three	clear	
trends	as	we	accelerate	delivery	of	our	
plans	are	visible:
•	 Fashion	retailers	are	still	taking	new	
space	in	shopping	centres	where	
refurbishment	and	reconfiguration	have	
made	it	attractive	and	affordable.	The	
very	successful	opening	of	the	Next	
and	H&M	stores	at	Waterside,	Lincoln,	
highlight	the	potential	that	can	be	
unlocked	as	these	lettings	enabled	the	
Group	to	dispose	of	the	asset	at	a	yield	
of	5.88%.
•	 There	is	still	strong	demand	from	
leisure	operators	to	take	space.	
Unused	office	space	in	Wood	Green	
is	now	being	reconfigured	to	support	
the	opening	of	both	a	hotel	and	the	
extension	of	a	gym	by	the	end	of	2015.	
The	creation	of	The	Hub	at	Redditch,	
which	has	attracted	a	gym	operator	as	
well	as	three	restaurants	alongside	the	
Vue	Cinema,	has	led	to	a	significant	
increase	in	footfall	across	the	scheme.	
At	the	same	time,	the	refurbishment	of	
Worcester	Square	led	to	Costa	taking	a	
second	unit	and	attracted	new	retailers	
such	as	Swarovski,	which	has	opened	
with	an	exceptionally	strong	trading	
performance.
•	 Changing	demographics	are	having	
a	significant	impact	on	demand	for	
space	in	and	around	London.	Fashion	
retailers	are	excited	by	the	plans	to	
extend	the	Walthamstow	scheme	
whilst	residential	opportunities	in	
Walthamstow	and	Wood	Green	seem	
to	have	much	greater	potential	than	
originally	anticipated.
Innovative technology
The	Group	has,	for	many	years,	been	
at	the	forefront	of	developing	digital	
technology	to	support	footfall	and	spend	
across	its	shopping	centres.	During	the	
course	of	the	year,	the	Group	entered	
into	a	“Click	&	Collect”	agreement	
with	CollectPlus,	the	leading	UK	store-
based	parcel	service.	This	is	the	first	
such	agreement	to	include	dominant	
community	shopping	centres.	Initial	
trials	in	Camberley	and	Redditch	have	
proved	to	be	successful,	particularly	as	
the	service	attracts	customers	of	retailers	
which	are	not	represented	in	our	malls	into	
the	centres.
Aggressive recycling of capital
The	sale	of	the	Group’s	German	portfolio	
(which	completed	shortly	after	the	
year-end),	together	with	the	earlier	sale	
of	its	interests	in	Hemel	Hempstead	
and	Lincoln,	reflect	a	year	of	aggressive	
recycling	of	capital.	In	contrast	to	previous	
years,	the	proceeds	were	re-invested	
in	growth	through	the	acquisition	of	a	
controlling	stake	in	the	Mall	Fund	from	
Aviva	Investors.	Importantly,	recycling	
has	been	well	timed	to	take	advantage	 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 8
21
www.capreg.com Strategic Report > Chief Executive’s Statement
  Connecting with 
communities
of	an	investment	cycle	which	began	to	
accelerate	as	the	year	has	progressed.	
The	key	highlights	were:
•	 The	sale	of	Lincoln	for	£46	million.	The	
net	proceeds	to	the	Group	of		
£15.7	million	represented	an	uplift	of	
£4.8	million	or	44%	on	the	30	June	
2014	carrying	value.	
•	 The	German	portfolio	was	sold	at	
a	small	premium	to	year	end	NAV	
resulting	in	net	cash	proceeds	of	£42.1	
million.	
•	 The	acquisition	of	a	62.56%	stake	in	
The	Mall	in	July	2014	at	a	5%	discount	
to	the	June	2014	valuation.
Strengthening of balance sheet
Following	completion	of	the	acquisition	
of	The	Mall	and	the	sale	of	Lincoln	and	
Germany,	the	proforma	see-through	net	
loan	to	value	of	the	Group	has	fallen	from	
54%	to	45%	as	at	30	December	2014.	
With	the	exception	of	£15.5	million	in	
respect	of	the	Redditch	investment,	all	
of	the	Group’s	proforma	see-through	net	
debt	of	£352.1	million,	adjusted	for	the	
sale	of	Germany	and	payment	of	The	
Mall	performance	fee	and	income	due	to	
former	unit	holders,	is	now	on	balance	
sheet.
In	May	2014	the	Mall	CMBS	was	
refinanced	by	entering	into	a	new		
£350	million	five	year	secured	bank	loan	
and	an	additional	£25	million	capex	
facility	at	a	day	one	cost	of	3.37%.	The	
structure	of	the	facility	was	subsequently	
amended,	following	completion	of	our	
62.56%	acquisition	to	enable	the	tender	
for	the	minorities	to	be	funded	from	within	
the	Mall.
The	Group’s	Revolving	Credit	Facility,	
which	was	increased	to	£50	million	to	
accommodate	the	offer	for	The	Mall,	has	
now	been	reduced	to	£20	million	following

Chief Executive’s Statement
Continued
The	Group	raised	£165	million	of	new	
equity	during	the	year	to	fund	the	
acquisition	of	The	Mall.
Outlook
Income	growth	will	be	the	key	driver	of	
property	valuations.	There	is	still	scope	
for	further	yield	compression	given	
the	continuing	strength	in	investment	
markets,	but	we	expect	growth	in	valued	
income	to	be	a	more	significant	factor	
in	the	future.	This	will	be	driven	by	the	
fact	that	increased	consumer	spending	
provides	retailers	and	leisure	operators	
with	confidence	to	take	units	in	schemes	
where	we	have	shown,	and	continue	to	
demonstrate,	a	commitment	to	invest	in	
the	creation	of	attractive	and	affordable	
space	right	across	the	portfolio.	
The	Group’s	operational	focus	is	now	on	
the	delivery	of	the	Mall	asset	management	
programme	announced	in	conjunction	
with	the	Capital	Raise	in	June	2014	which	
we	now	expect	to	total	£65	million.	A	
significant	part	of	the	investment	takes	
place	in	the	next	two	years.	We	are	
expecting	total	income	returns	of	at		
least	10%.
Key	decisions	on	the	two	developments	
at	Camberley	and	Maidstone	can	be	
expected	this	year.	We	are	now	entering	
a	period	of	intense	discussion	and	
negotiation	with	both	local	councils	and	
anchor	retailers	on	the	scope	of	the	
developments	and	expect	to	be	able	to	
clearly	define	both	projects	together	with	
the	Group’s	commitment	by	the	end	of	
the	year.
Acquisitions	will	focus	on	opportunities	
which	enable	the	Group	to	boost	
income	and	support	a	progressive	
approach	to	dividend	growth.	At	this	
stage	in	the	property	cycle	we	see	
attractive	opportunities	to	acquire	
assets	comparable	in	size	to	Lincoln	
(as	evidenced	by	the	announcement	
of	the	acquisition	of	the	Buttermarket	
Shopping	Centre	in	Ipswich)	which	offer	
the	opportunity	for	repositioning	through	
asset	management	which	will	facilitate	the	
introduction	of	new	retailers	and/or	leisure	
operators.

Operating Review
There	were	two	fundamental	strategic	
objectives	for	the	group	in	2014,	both	of	
which	have	been	successfully	achieved.	
In	the	UK	the	Group	consolidated	its	
ownership	of	the	Mall	Fund	through	the	
acquisition	of	all	of	the	units	in	the	fund	
which	it	did	not	own.	In	Germany	the	
Group	exchanged	contracts	for	the	sale	
of	all	of	its	property	interests	in	December	
2014,	with	completion	following	on		
10	February	2015.
As	a	result	the	Group	is	now	fully	focused	
on	its	investments	in	UK	shopping	
centres	through	the	Mall	and	in	its	
joint	ventures	in	Redditch	and	Ipswich,	
following	the	investment	in	March	2015.	
There	was	one	disposal	from	the	UK	
shopping	centre	business	which	was	
at	Lincoln	where,	subsequent	to	the	
reconfiguration	of	the	scheme,	the	
Group	and	its	joint	venture	partner	took	
advantage	of	the	strong	investment	
market	to	sell	the	asset	realising	a	profit	
on	disposal	of	£4.7	million	to	the	Group.

leasing	activity	across	the	UK	Shopping	
Centre	business	with	in	excess	of		
£5	million	of	annualised	rental	income	
achieved	through	completed	new	lettings	
and	lease	renewals	during	the	year.	
In	Camberley,	following	the	opening	of	
the	new	TK	Maxx	store	in	2013,	further	
lettings	have	been	achieved	with	other	
fashion	operators.	Jones	the	Bootmaker	
has	taken	a	10	year	lease	on	a		
1,400	sq	ft	unit.	Deichmann	and	Select	
have	also	taken	10	year	leases	over	units	
of	4,400	and	5,000	sq	ft	respectively.	
Costa	has	upsized	to	a	1,900	sq	ft	unit	
also	on	a	10	year	term.
At	Luton	significant	lettings	have	been	
made	with	Poundland	which	has	taken	a	
10,500	sq	ft	store	for	10	years,	and	HMV	
who	have	taken	a	lease	to	2018	on	a		
4,500	sq	ft	shop.
The	refurbishment	of	the	scheme	in	
Walthamstow	is	well	progressed	and	
notable	deals	have	been	concluded	
with	TK	Maxx	taking	27,500	sq	ft	of	
retail	space,	which	is	being	created	
partly	from	the	car	park,	and	Vodafone	
taking	a	1,900	sq	ft	unit	on	a	10	year	
term.	Burton/Dorothy	Perkins	has	also	
relocated	within	the	scheme	on	a	new	
five	year	term	to	a	unit	of	5,100	sq	ft.
There	has	been	a	strong	level	of	activity	
at	Blackburn	where	B&M	has	opened	in	
a	19,000	sq	ft	unit	on	a	five	year	term.	
Warren	James	has	upsized	to	a		
1,300	sq	ft	unit	and	tReds	has	taken	a	
2,700	sq	ft	unit,	both	for	terms	of	ten	
years.	Ed’s	Diner	also	signed	a	15	year	
lease	on	a	5,400	sq	ft	unit,	while	further	
deals	were	concluded	with	Vodafone,	
The	Fragrance	Store	and	M	Bitz.
At	Wood	Green,	Vodafone	has	completed	
a	10	year	lease	on	a	2,000	sq	ft	store	
and	Costa	has	opened	a	new	1,800	
sq	ft	outlet	also	on	a	10	year	term.	In	
Maidstone,	Yours	Clothing	took	a	five	year	
lease	on	a	2,100	sq	ft	unit	and	renewals	
were	completed	with	H	Samuel	and	Card	
Factory.
In	Redditch,	three	of	the	four	newly	
created	restaurant	units	have	opened	
and	this	has	generated	significant	letting	
interest	from	other	operators.	Costa	has	
opened	a	second	outlet	in	Worcester	
Square	following	its	refurbishment.	
The	remaining	refurbishment	works	
to	the	main	fashion	pitch	in	Evesham	
Walk	are	scheduled	to	complete	early	
in	the	second	quarter	of	2015,	adding	
momentum	to	the	600	sq	ft	and	2,300	sq	
ft	lettings	made	to	a	Swarovski	franchise	
and	tReds	respectively.

Income security
Credit	risk	is	managed	through	the	
assessment	of	the	covenant	strength	of	
all	incoming	tenants	and	by	monitoring	
credit	ratings	of	key	existing	tenants.	
Where	possible	we	look	to	pre-empt	the	
consequences	of	administrations	through	
contingency	planning	and	by	actively	
seeking	to	reduce	exposure	to	known	
risks.

Acquisition of Buttermarket Centre, 
Ipswich
On	3	March	2015	the	Group	completed	
the	acquisition	of	the	Buttermarket		
Centre,	Ipswich	in	a	50:50	joint	venture	
with	Drum	Property	Group.	The	centre	
has	been	acquired	on	a	freehold	basis	for	 	
£9.2	million	equivalent	to	a	Net	Initial	
Yield	of	8.46%.	
The	Buttermarket	Centre	has	235,000	
sq	ft	of	retail	space	over	two	core	trading	
levels	and	an	integrated	420	space	car	
park.
We	believe	there	is	significant	potential	
for	repositioning	the	centre	with	an	
enhanced	mix	of	retail	and	leisure	and	
have	plans	for	a	£26	million	development	
to	be	largely	funded	from	new	debt	within	
the	joint	venture	structure.

due	to	year-on-year	revenue	growth	in

marketing	strategy	and	improvements	
in	customer	service,	which	have	helped	
generate	better	retention	and	usage. 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 8

On	5	February	2014,	the	Kingfisher	Limited	Partnership	completed	a	refinancing	of	its	loan	facilities	and	increased	its	senior	facility.	
The	additional	funds	raised	were	used	to	repay	the	partnership’s	mezzanine	debt.	The	term	of	the	facility	was	extended	to	April	
2019.	As	a	result	the	partnership’s	cost	of	debt	fell	from	6.2%	to	4.6%.
Covenants
The	Group	and	its	associates	and	joint	ventures	were	compliant	with	their	banking	and	debt	covenants	at	30	December	2014.	
Further	details	are	disclosed	in	the	‘covenant	information’	section	at	the	end	of	this	report.
Foreign currency exposure management
At	30	December	2014	the	Group	used	a	forward	foreign	exchange	contract	to	hedge	the	expected	proceeds	due	from	the	sale	of	
its	German	joint	venture.	The	contract	was	for	€50	million	at	a	fixed	exchange	rate	of	1.2721.	This	was	closed	out	on	11	February	
2015	following	receipt	of	the	proceeds.	 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 8

Acquisition of Mall units
The	Group	acquired	the	70.74%	of	Mall	units	that	it	did	not	already	own,	through	three	transactions	in	2014:
•	 Acquisition	of	62.56%	of	Mall	units	from	Aviva	and	Karoo	for	£212.4	million	which	completed	in	July	2014
•	 £28.2	million	redemption	by	the	Mall	Unit	Trust	of	the	units	held	by	eight	of	the	nine	remaining	minority	unit	holders	completed	in	
October	2014	resulting	in	the	Group’s	effective	shareholding	in	The	Mall	increasing	from	91.82%	to	99.45%
•	 £2.1	million	acquisition	of	the	units	held	by	the	final	minority	unit	holder	in	December	2014.
The	acquisition	of	the	Aviva	and	Karoo	units	resulted	in	an	immediate	uplift	of	£11.5	million	to	the	Group’s	income	statement	
representing	the	fair	value	of	the	units	acquired	in	excess	of	the	amounts	paid	(see	Note	25	of	the	financial	statements	for	further	
details).
Transaction	costs	of	£3.1	million	were	charged	to	the	income	statement	(excluding	£4.1	million	of	costs	directly	relating	to	the	
capital	raise	that	were	deducted	from	Share	Premium)	and	a	further	£0.3	million	of	restructuring	costs	were	incurred	in	achieving	the	
approximate	£1.5	million	of	annual	cost	savings	expected	to	be	delivered	in	2015.
Disposals
Waterside Shopping Centre, Lincoln
On	12	November	2014,	the	Group	and	its	JV	Partner,	Karoo,	sold	the	Waterside	Shopping	Centre,	Lincoln	to	Tesco	Pension	Fund	
Trustees	for	a	net	consideration	of	£46.0	million	representing	a	net	initial	yield	of	5.88%.	The	net	proceeds	attributable	to	the	Group	
were	£15.7	million	(including	performance	fees	of	£0.9	million)	and	the	resulting	profit	on	disposal	was	£4.7	million.	
German joint venture
On	24	December	2014,	the	Group	announced	the	conditional	exchange	of	contracts	for	the	sale	of	its	50:50	German	joint	venture	
to	clients	and	funds	under	management	of	Rockspring	Property	Investment	Managers.	Under	the	terms	of	the	transaction	the	
Group	will	retain	for	approximately	five	years	a	small	minority	stake.	The	Group’s	net	assets	in	respect	of	Germany	at	30	December	
2014	were	£41.4	million	including	£2.7	million	for	the	retained	minority	stake.	
The	sale	completed	on	10	February	2015.	The	net	proceeds	received	were	€54.6	million,	this	equated	to	£42.1	million	(after	all	
costs	and	including	the	benefit	of	the	Group’s	Forward	Contract)	and	is	expected	to	result	in	a	profit	on	disposal	after	costs	of	
approximately	£0.6	million	to	be	recognised	in	the	year	ending	30	December	2015,	subject	to	any	final	adjustments	arising	out	of	
the	completion	accounts	and	before	the	impact	of	hedging	and	foreign	exchange	reserve	reclassifications.	
On	completion,	and	included	within	the	proceeds,	the	Group	entered	into	a	long-term	loan	payable	of	€3.5	million	(£2.7	million	at	
year	end	exchange	rate	of	1.2783)	repayable	after	five	years.	After	completion	a	distribution	of	€1.5	million	was	made	in	respect	
of	the	retained	minority	stake	(reducing	the	carrying	value	of	this	to	approximately	€2.2	million),	this	was	used	to	reduce	the	
outstanding	amount	of	the	loan	to	€2.0	million.
REIT conversion
Immediately	after	the	year	end,	on	31	December	2014,	the	Group	converted	to	a	Real	Estate	Investment	Trust	(REIT).	The	REIT	
regime	enables	the	Group	to	benefit	from	a	zero	corporation	tax	rate	on	qualifying	property	income	and	capital	gains.
Non-qualifying	profits	and	gains	of	the	Group	continue	to	be	subject	to	corporation	tax	as	normal.	In	order	to	achieve	and	retain	
group	REIT	status,	several	entrance	tests	had	to	be	met	and	certain	ongoing	criteria	must	be	maintained.	The	main	criteria	are	as	
follows:
•	 at	the	start	of	each	accounting	period,	the	assets	of	the	property	rental	business	plus	cash	must	be	at	least	75%	of	the	total	
value	of	the	Group’s	assets;
•	 at	least	75%	of	the	Group’s	total	profits	must	arise	from	the	property	rental	business;	and
•	 at	least	90%	of	the	Group’s	UK	property	rental	profits	as	calculated	under	tax	rules	must	be	distributed. 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 8

Going concern
As	stated	in	note	1	to	the	consolidated	financial	statements,	the	directors	are	satisfied	that	the	Group	has	sufficient	resources	to	
continue	in	operation	for	the	foreseeable	future,	a	period	of	not	less	than	12	months	from	the	date	of	this	report.	Accordingly,	they	
continue	to	adopt	the	going	concern	basis	in	preparing	the	consolidated	financial	statements.
Discontinuation of Interim Management Statements
Following	recent	changes	to	EU	regulation	on	financial	disclosure,	the	Financial	Conduct	Authority	has	removed	its	requirement	for	
UK	companies	to	publish	Interim	Management	Statements	(IMSs).	As	a	result,	and	reflecting	the	long	term	nature	of	our	business,	
the	Board	has	taken	the	decision	to	cease	publication	of	formal	IMSs	in	May	and	November.	The	Group	remains	committed	to	full	
and	transparent	disclosure	and	will	continue	with	full-year	and	half-year	announcements	as	well	as	other	market	updates	when	
appropriate.
Dividend
For	2014,	the	Board	is	proposing	a	final	dividend	of	0.60p	per	share	taking	the	full-year	dividend	to	0.95p	per	share	representing	
an	increase	of	46%	compared	to	last	year.	As	explained	in	the	prospectus	issued	at	the	time	of	the	capital	raise	in	June	2014,	the	
earnings	for	2014	which	are	not	distributed	will	be	used	to	part	fund	the	Group’s	ongoing	£65	million	capital	expenditure	programme	
in	The	Mall.
The	key	dates	in	relation	to	the	payment	of	the	dividend	are:
16	April	2015 Ex-dividend	date
17	April	2015 Record	date	for	the	payment	of	final	dividend
14	May	2015 Dividend	payment	date
Following	conversion	to	a	REIT,	the	Board’s	dividend	policy	going	forward,	commencing	with	the	interim	dividend	in	2015	which	
is	expected	to	be	paid	in	October	2015,	will	be	to	distribute	at	least	90%	of	Mall	Operating	Profit.	This	will	be	paid	approximately	
50%	as	an	interim	dividend	and	50%	as	a	final	dividend.	Based	on	the	2014	Mall	Proforma	Operating	Profit	set	out	on	page	28	we	
anticipate	paying	a	full	year	2015	dividend	payment	of	at	least	2.9p	per	share.

Introduction
Our	intent	is	to	create	sustainable	value	by	connecting	with	our	communities;	meeting	
both	our	shareholders	and	stakeholders	expectations.
Our	shopping	centres	create	jobs	for	people;	provide	social	hubs	and	venues	for	
the	community	around	them;	create	demand	for	local	suppliers	and	improvements	
in	the	physical	environment	–	just	for	starters.	All	this	we	aim	to	do	as	efficiently	and	
sustainably	as	possible.	The	retailers,	venues	and	businesses	we	bring	to	the	shopping	
centres	and	properties	provide	more	job	opportunities	and	help	further	drive	demand	
for	goods	and	services.	In	turn	this	enhances	the	appeal	of	the	location,	which	attracts	
more	people	and	businesses	to	the	area	and	into	our	space. 
Being	recognised	as	a	responsible	company	has	always	been	a	fundamental	part	of	
our	business	and	that	doesn’t	happen	overnight	–	you	have	to	keep	working	at	it	–	and	
that	is	what	we	are	doing.	We	see	responsible	business	as	part	of	every	employee’s	
everyday	working	life;	we	all	take	those	responsibilities	seriously	and	pride	ourselves	
on	our	achievements	in	this	area.	This	report	provides	an	update	on	our	continuing	
progress	throughout	2014	and	our	targets	for	2015.	
2014 highlights 
Environmental
Once	again	we	have	made	good	progress	against	our	environmental	targets	this	year:
•	 Our	energy	CO
2
	emissions	were	down	by	10%	in	2014	and,	with	the	benefit	of	
the	mildest	winter	on	record,	our	gas	consumption	also	reduced	drastically.	Our	
electricity	usage,	which	is	not	winter	weather	dependent	reduced	by	over	4%.	This	
produced	a	saving	of	over	£225,000	and	followed	savings	of	£240,000	in	2013.
•	 In	2014,	over	5,800	tonnes	of	waste	was	generated	at	our	properties	and	we	
initially	diverted	99.8%	from	going	direct	to	landfill;	80%	was	recycled	back	to	the	
supply	chain,	12%	waste	used	for	energy	and	8%	sent	to	landfill	after	treatment.	
•	 We	retained	the	Global	Real	Estate	Sustainability	Benchmark	(GRESB)	Green	Star	
Status.
Investors in People
We	have	been	recognised	as	an	Investor	in	People	since	2002	and	undertook	our	
fifth	successful	assessment	review	in	June	2014.	While	we	are	delighted	with	the	
assessors’	feedback	we	will	continue	to	strive	for	further	improvement:
“I have visited many organisations with varying degrees of depth of practice, but it 
is seldom that I meet people who are so enthusiastic and committed to what the 
organisation is working to achieve.”
RoSPA
We	were	delighted	to	retain	the	RoSPA	Gold	Award	for	the	8th	consecutive	year.	
 
“The RoSPA Awards encourage the raising of occupational health and safety 
standards across the board. Organisations that gain recognition such as Capital 
& Regional, contribute to a collective raising of the bar for other organisations to 
aspire to, and we offer them our congratulations.”
David Rawlins,	RoSPA’s	awards	manager
Enviromall
32
Our	2014	Enviromall	campaign	was	
launched	on	5	June	2014,	on	World	
Environment	Day	and	focused	on	the	
overuse	of	plastic	bags.	Every	year	
more	than	10	billion	plastic	bags	are	
used	by	shoppers	with	the	majority	
ending	up	in	landfill	sites	and	taking	
hundreds	of	years	to	break	down.
The	Mall	introduced	a	Great	British	Bag	
Swap	whereby	for	a	week	shoppers	
could	swap	10	plastic	carrier	bags	for	
free	cotton	bags	for	life.	Over	1,000	
customers	took	part.	The	bags	for	life	
that	were	given	away	to	customers	
were	designed	by	local	school	children	
with	six	winning	designs	being	printed	
from	1,300	entries.
Seeing the bigger picture
Shopping as it should be
We don’t just try 
to save you money.
We’re trying to save 
the planet too.
From 2nd June - 8th June 
customers who bring 10 
plastic carrier bags will be given 
A FREE BAG FOR LIFE 
from The Mall

The Environment
For	many	years	we	have	worked	hard	to	reduce	our	impact	on	the	environment	in	the	three	key	areas	of	waste,	water	and	energy.	In	
addition,	we	continue	the	focus	on	reducing	the	carbon	footprint	of	our	properties.	We	have	long	recognised	that	any	development	
activity	should	mirror	this	and	have	proactively	ensured	we	minimise	energy	consumption	and	mitigate	the	effects	of	climate	change

In	2010	as	part	of	our	ongoing

usage’	based	reporting	system,	which	
provides	data	on	electricity	usage	
every	half	hour	to	two	large	public	TV	
screens.	The	system	also	allows	us	to	
set	daily	usage	targets	and	provides	a	
visual	display	of	performance	against	
these	targets.
The	system	gives	us	a	means	of	
measuring	in	real-time	the	impact	
of	remedial	actions	so,	for	example,	
when	we	re-timed	the	heating/cooling	
systems	or	changed	lighting	to	low	
energy	LED	systems	we	could	see	the	
benefit	straight	away.	EcoDriver	has	
helped	The	Mall	Camberley	reduce	its

2010.

The Community
Our	aim	is	to	have	a	key	role	in	the	ongoing	development	of	the	communities	and	environments	in	which	we	operate.	We	work	
closely	with	key	stakeholders	to	ensure	we	listen,	engage	and	use	feedback	to	develop	or	refine	our	approach.	We	use	social	media	
to	collect	feedback	and	respond.	We	aim	to	provide	safe,	welcoming,	clean	and	attractive	shopping	and	leisure	venues	where	
people	choose	to	shop,	work	and	socialise.	We	aim	to	make	a	positive	contribution	to	each	local	community	by	being	a	responsible,	
socially	aware	and	proactive	partner.
2014 Target 2014 Performance
To	maintain	our	involvement	in	local	Crime	Reduction	
Partnerships	supporting	the	police	with	targeted	crime	reduction	
and	community	safety	campaigns	in	order	to	further	reduce	the	
levels	of	recorded	crime	during	2014
This	area	of	the	business	continues	to	gain	momentum.	For	
example	the	Blackburn	team	were	shortlisted	for	a	National	
Award	by	the	National	Association	of	Business	Crime	
Partnerships	
Involvement	with	local	crime	partnerships	continues	to	work	
well	across	all	sites
To	complete	the	implementation	of	body	worn	CCTV	systems	
at	the	shopping	centres	to	continue	to	prevent	crime	and	
anti-social	behaviour.	To	also	implement	a	new	detailed	audit	
process	for	CCTV	systems	installed	at	the	shopping	centres
All	centres	except	one	have	purchased	these	cameras	and	
they	have	proved	very	successful.	Control	room	procedures	
are	reviewed	monthly	but	a	more	formal	audit	process	is	
being	developed
To	review	the	role	of	first	aid	trained	staff	in	responding	to	
emergencies	both	within	centres	and	the	town	centres	in	which	
we	operate	and	explore	opportunities	to	train	key	individuals	as	
first	responders
This	continues	to	be	explored	by	our	soft	services	partner.	
The	business	already	has	several	first	responders	in	place
2015 Target
To	actively	engage	with	local	crime	reduction	partnerships,	police	and	other	local	enforcement	agencies	to	proactively	target	
prolific	shop	lifting,	anti-social	behaviour,	and	drug	taking	offences.	To	achieve	a	5%	reduction	in	recorded	crime	at	the	shopping	
centres	during	2015
To	maintain	an	average	BSPM	score	across	Cleaning	and	Security	of	above	94%

To	increase	at	each	centre	customer	databases	by	5,000	people	and	Facebook	followers	by	500	with	focus	on	timely	and	high	
quality	content
Successful	roll	out	of	the	CollectPlus	service	across	all	our	malls

C&R	works	closely	with	its	services	
partner	VSG	Security,	to	deliver	award	
winning	services	in	its	malls.	In	2014	
one	of	our	dedicated	customer	service	
officers,	Robbie	Smith	at	The	Mall	
Maidstone,	received	the	BSIA	award	as	
‘National	Winner	for	Outstanding	Act’.	
Robbie,	a	key	team	member	with	over	
ten	years’	experience,	was	on	duty	when	
an	infant	stopped	breathing	after	suffering	
a	fit.	Responding	to	the	mother’ s	call	for	
help	Robbie	acted	swiftly	and	decisively	
clearing	the	infant’ s	airways	and	lowering	
her	temperature.	The	infant	made	a	full	
recovery	and	the	mother	was	very	clear	
that	Robbie’ s	quick	action	had	saved	her	
daughter’ s	life.
In	September	2014	we	launched	a	
competition	to	ask	our	shoppers	to	get	
creative	and	design	the	exclusive	Mall	
Christmas	Gift	Card.	We	were	looking	
for	the	best	design	that	captured	all	the	
magic	of	Christmas	and	the	one	lucky	
winner	would	see	their	piece	of	artwork	
become	2014’s	official	Christmas	Gift	
Card	and	receive	their	own	Card,	loaded	
with	£250	to	spend	in	the	Mall.
Although,	the	fantastic	competition	was	
open	to	all	ages,	with	hand	drawn	and	
computer	generated	entries	accepted,	
Ophelia	Brooks-Buckingham	aged	four	
was	chosen	as	the	lucky	winner	with	her	
fantastic	Snowman	design	beating	over	
150	other	entrants	including	her	two	older	
brothers!
2,500	of	the	special	Christmas	Gift	Cards	
were	ordered	and	sold	out	with	weeks		
to	spare.
Robbie Smith
Christmas Gift Card Competition
Commenting	on	the	event	and	the	prestigious	award	he	received,	Robbie	said:
I was just doing my job, this is what I have been trained for, 
but it was nice to have such good things said about what I did, 
especially from the child’s mother”.

Corporate Governance Report
Chairman’s introduction
I	am	pleased	to	present	the	Board’s	annual	report	on	corporate	
governance.	
The	Board	remains	committed	to	high	standards	of	corporate	
governance	which	it	considers	to	be	central	to	the	effective	
management	of	the	business	and	to	maintaining	the	confidence	
of	investors.	The	report	which	follows	explains	how	we	have	
applied	the	principles	of	good	corporate	governance	advocated	
by	the	UK	Corporate	Governance	Code	2012	(‘the	Code’)	as	
they	apply	to	smaller	(i.e.	non	FTSE	350)	companies.
It	is	the	view	of	the	Board	that	the	Company	has	been	
compliant	with	the	principles	of	the	Code,	as	they	apply	to	
smaller	companies,	during	the	past	financial	year.
John Clare CBE 
Chairman
Application of the principles
The	Company	has	applied	the	principles	set	out	in	section	
1	of	the	Code,	including	both	the	main	principles	and	the	
supporting	principles,	by	complying	with	the	Code	as	reported	
above.	Further	explanation	of	how	the	principles	and	supporting	
principles	have	been	applied	is	set	out	below	and	in	the	
Directors’	Remuneration	Report.
Role of the Board
The	Board	has	a	collective	responsibility	to	promote	the	long-
term	success	of	the	Company	for	its	shareholders.	Its	role	
includes	reviewing	and	approving	key	policies	and	decisions	
of	the	Company,	particularly	in	relation	to	Group	strategy	and	
operating	plans,	governance	and	compliance	with	laws	and	
regulations,	business	development	including	major	investments	
and	disposals	and,	through	its	Committees,	financial	reporting	
and	risk	management.
The	Board	has	established	a	schedule	of	matters	reserved	for	
Board	decision.	This	schedule	details	key	aspects	of	the	affairs	
of	the	Company	which	the	Board	does	not	delegate.	
The	Board’s	agenda	is	managed	to	ensure	that	shareholder	
value	and	governance	issues	play	a	key	part	in	its	decision	
making.	
The	responsibilities,	which	the	Board	has	delegated,	are	
given	to	committees	that	operate	within	specified	terms	of	
reference	and	authority	limits,	which	are	reviewed	annually	
or	in	response	to	a	change	in	circumstances.	The	executive	
directors	take	operational	decisions	and	also	approve	certain	
transactions	within	defined	limited	parameters.	An	Executive	
Directors’	Committee	meets	on	a	weekly	basis	and	deals	
with	all	major	decisions	of	the	Group	not	requiring	full	Board	
approval	or	authorisation	by	other	Board	committees,	minutes	
of	these	meetings	are	circulated	to	the	Board.	The	Executive	
Directors’	Committee	is	quorate	with	three	executive	directors	
in	attendance;	if	decisions	are	not	unanimous	the	matter	is	
referred	to	the	Board	for	approval.	
The	Audit	Committee,	the	Remuneration	Committee	and	
the	Nomination	Committee	consist	of	the	Chairman	and	
independent	non-executive	directors.	The	Audit	Committee	
and	the	Remuneration	Committee	meet	at	least	twice	a	year,	
the	Nomination	Committee	meets	at	least	once	a	year	and	as	
required.	The	terms	of	reference	of	the	respective	Committees	
are	available	on	the	Group’s	website.	
Board	meetings	are	scheduled	to	coincide	with	key	events	in	
the	Company’s	financial	calendar,	including	interim	and	final	
results	and	the	AGM.	Other	meetings	during	the	year	will	review	
the	Company’s	strategy	and	budgets	for	the	next	financial	year	
and	the	Company’s	key	risks	as	well	as	reviewing	performance	
by	the	Group’s	operating	segments.
Board balance and independence
Details	of	the	directors	are	set	out	before	the	Directors’	report.	
The	Board	currently	comprises	of	the	Chairman,	four	executive	
directors	and	five	non-executive	directors.	
Louis	Norval	and	Neno	Haasbroek	as	non-executive	directors	
are	not	considered	independent	for	the	purposes	of	the	Code,	
as	they	represent	a	significant	shareholder	of	the	Company.	Ian	
Krieger	was	appointed	during	the	year	bringing	the	number	of	
Independent	non-executive	Directors	to	three.	
The	Board	and	Nomination	Committee	are	satisfied	that	the	
Board	composition	provides	an	appropriate	balance	of	power	
and	authority	within	the	Company.	The	Board	believes	that	
all	the	non-executive	directors,	excluding	Louis	Norval	and	
Neno	Haasbroek,	are	independent	and	act	independently	of	
management	but	will	continue	to	review	this	position.	The	terms	
and	conditions	of	appointment	of	non-executive	directors	are	
available	for	inspection	at	the	Company’s	registered	office.

Governance > Corporate Governace Report www.capreg.com
Philip	Newton	continued	to	serve	as	the	Senior	Independent	
Director	throughout	the	year.
The	Company	has	well	established	differentiation	between	
the	roles	of	Chairman	and	Chief	Executive.	Written	terms	
of	reference,	which	have	been	approved	by	the	Board,	are	
available	for	inspection	on	the	Group’s	website.
In	the	Company’s	view,	the	breadth	of	experience	and	
knowledge	of	the	Chairman	and	the	non-executive	directors	
and	their	detachment	from	the	day-to-day	issues	within	
the	Company	provide	a	sufficiently	strong	and	experienced	
balance	with	the	executive	members	of	the	Board.	The	other	
commitments	of	the	directors	are	detailed	in	the	directors’	
biographies.
Information and professional development
The	Board	schedules	five	meetings	each	year	as	a	minimum,	
and	arranges	further	meetings	as	the	business	requires.	Prior	
to	Board	meetings,	each	member	receives,	as	appropriate	to	
the	agenda,	up-to-date	financial	and	commercial	information,	
management	accounts,	budgets	and	forecasts,	details	of	
acquisitions	and	disposals	and	relevant	appraisals	(prior	Board	
approval	being	required	for	large	transactions),	cash	flow	
forecasts	and	details	of	funding	availability.
Induction	training	is	given	to	all	new	directors	appointed	to	the	
Company	and	consists	of	an	introduction	to	the	Board,	onsite	
visits	to	properties	managed	by	the	Group,	an	introduction	
to	key	management,	an	induction	pack	and	access	to	
independent	advisers.	The	ongoing	training	requirements	of	
the	directors	are	reviewed	on	a	regular	basis	and	undertaken	
individually,	as	necessary,	although	it	is	recognised	that	all	
members	of	the	Board	experience	continuous	professional	
development	from	working	together.	This	is	achieved	by	virtue	
of	the	mix	of	the	directors,	and	their	sharing	of	knowledge	and	
experiences	gained	from	a	range	of	commercial	backgrounds.
Board and committee meetings
The	number	of	meetings	of	the	Board	and	of	the	Audit,	
Remuneration	and	Nomination	Committees	during	2014,	and	
individual	attendance	by	directors,	is	set	out	below.	Due	to	the	
high	level	of	transactional	activity	during	the	year	there	were	
a	number	of	ad	hoc	meetings	called	at	short	notice	and	as	a	
result	full	attendance	was	not	always	practicable.	
By	invitation,	Charles	Staveley	attended	the	three	Audit	
Committee	meetings,	Louis	Norval	and	Neno	Haasbroek	
attended	the	three	Remuneration	Committee	meetings	and	
Hugh	Scott-Barrett	attended	one	of	the	Responsible	Business	
Committee	meetings.

Board evaluation
A	formal	process	has	been	established	for	the	annual	evaluation	
of	the	performance	of	the	Board,	its	appointed	committees	and	
each	director,	to	ensure	that	they	continue	to	act	effectively	
and	to	identify	any	training	requirements.	This	process	was	
led	by	the	Chairman	and	each	director	completed	an	in-depth	
questionnaire	which	covered:
•	 performance	of	individuals	and	of	the	Board	together	as	a	
unit;
•	 processes	which	underpin	the	Board’s	effectiveness	
(including	consideration	of	the	balance	of	skills,	experience,	
independence	and	knowledge	of	the	persons	on	the	Board);
•	 strategy;	and
•	 performance	of	the	Board’s	sub-committees.
The	completed	questionnaires	were	then	collated	by	the	
Chairman	and	considered	in	detail	by	the	Board	at	the	November	
Board	meeting.	This	year’s	review	found	that	the	performance	of	
the	Board	and	its	Committees	continued	to	be	effective	in	dealing	
with	both	day-to-day	and	ongoing	strategic	issues;	and	that	the	
Board	and	Committee	structure	ensured	that	the	governance	
requirements	of	the	business	were	met.	
The	Chairman	also	meets	as	necessary,	but	at	least	once	each	
year,	with	the	non-executive	directors	without	the	executive	
directors	present.	The	non-executive	directors	meet	annually	
without	the	Chairman	in	order	to	appraise	his	performance.	
This	meeting	is	chaired	by	the	Senior	Independent	Director.	The	
Chairman	evaluates	the	performance	of	the	Chief	Executive	
having	received	input	from	the	other	directors.	The	Chief	
Executive	evaluates	the	performance	of	the	other	Executive	
directors	and	the	results	of	the	appraisals	are	analysed	and	
summarised	by	the	Chairman.	Subsequently,	the	results	are	
discussed	by	the	Remuneration	Committee	and	relevant	
consequential	changes	are	made	if	required.
Shareholder relations
The	Company	has	always	encouraged	regular	dialogue	with	
its	shareholders	at	the	AGM,	and	through	corporate	functions	
and	property	visits.	The	Company	also	attends	roadshows,	
participates	in	sector	conferences	and	in	October	2014	hosted	a	
Capital	Markets	day.	In	addition,	following	the	announcement	of	
final	and	interim	results,	and	throughout	the	year,	as	requested,	
the	Company	holds	update	meetings	with	institutional	investors.	
All	the	directors	are	accessible	to	all	shareholders,	and	queries	
received	verbally	or	in	writing	are	addressed	as	soon	as	
possible.	
Announcements	are	made	to	the	London	Stock	Exchange	
and	the	business	media	concerning	business	developments	
to	provide	wider	dissemination	of	information.	Registered	
shareholders	are	sent	copies	of	the	annual	report	and	relevant	
circulars.	The	Group’s	website	is	kept	up	to	date	with	all	
announcements,	reports	and	shareholder	circulars.
Financial reporting
The	Group’s	annual	report	includes	detailed	reviews	of	the	
activities	of	the	business,	its	financial	results	and	financing	
position.	In	this	way	the	Board	seeks	to	present	a	fair,	balanced	
and	understandable	assessment	of	the	Group’s	position	and	
prospects.
Internal control 
The	Board	is	responsible	for	maintaining	a	sound	system	of	
internal	control	and	risk	management	to	safeguard	shareholders’	
investment.	Such	a	system	is	designed	to	manage,	but	not	
eliminate,	the	risk	of	failure	to	achieve	business	objectives.	There	
are	inherent	limitations	in	any	control	system	and,	accordingly,	
even	the	most	effective	system	can	provide	only	reasonable,	
and	not	absolute,	assurance	against	material	misstatement	or	
loss.	
In	accordance	with	the	revised	version	of	the	Turnbull	
Committee	on	internal	control	and	the	Code,	an	ongoing	
process	has	been	established	for	identifying,	evaluating	and	
managing	risks	faced	by	the	Group	and	the	Board	is	satisfied	
that	its	process	accords	with	the	guidance	in	these	documents.	
This	process	has	been	in	place	for	the	year	under	review	to	
the	date	of	approval	of	these	financial	statements.	Each	year	
the	Board	conducts	a	review	of	the	effectiveness	of	the	current	
system	of	internal	control.	Twice	a	year	the	Group	undertakes	
a	comprehensive	risk	and	controls	review,	this	is	detailed	in	the	
Managing	Risk	section	of	the	Strategic	Report.
Other	key	features	of	the	Group’s	system	of	internal	control	are	
as	follows:
•	 Defined	organisational	responsibilities	and	authority	limits	
exist	throughout	the	Group.	The	day-to-day	involvement	of	
the	executive	directors	in	the	running	of	the	business	ensures	
that	these	responsibilities	and	limits	are	adhered	to;
•	 Financial	and	operating	reporting	to	the	Board	including	the	
preparation	of	budgets	and	forecasts,	cash	management,	
variance	analysis,	property,	taxation	and	treasury	reports	and	
a	report	on	financing;
•	 Review	and	approval	of	the	Group’s	risk	matrix	twice	a	year	
by	senior	management,	the	Audit	Committee	and	the	Board	
as	detailed	in	the	Managing	Risk	section	of	the	Strategic	
Report;	and
•	 The	Group’s	whistleblowing	policy	–	see	the	Audit	Committee	
report	for	further	details.
Steps	are	continuously	being	taken	to	embed	internal	control	
and	risk	management	further	into	the	operations	of	the	
business	and	to	deal	with	areas	of	improvement	which	come	to	
management’s	and	the	Board’s	attention. 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 8

Remuneration Committee
The	Remuneration	Committee	makes	recommendations	to	the	
Board,	within	existing	terms	of	reference,	on	remuneration	policy	
and	determines,	on	behalf	of	the	Board,	specific	remuneration	
packages	for	each	executive	director.	The	statement	of	
remuneration	policy	and	details	of	each	director’s	remuneration	
are	set	out	in	the	Directors’	Remuneration	Report	on	pages	49		
to	64.	
Nomination Committee
The	Committee	comprises	of	John	Clare	(Chairman),	Philip	
Newton	and	Tony	Hales.	The	Nomination	Committee	meets	
as	required	to	select	and	recommend	to	the	Board	suitable	
candidates	for	both	executive	and	non-executive	appointments	
to	the	Board.	On	an	annual	basis,	the	Nomination	Committee	
also	considers	succession	planning	for	the	Board.	
During	the	year	the	Nomination	Committee	conducted	the	
recruitment	of	a	new	non-executive	director	resulting	in	the	
appointment	of	Ian	Krieger	to	the	Board	from	1	December	2014.	 	
The	recruitment	was	conducted	internally	with	potential	
candidates	proposed	by	existing	Directors.	The	Committee	
was	satisfied	that	the	pool	of	candidates	that	resulted	was	of	
appropriate	quality	and	diversity	such	that	external	assistance	
was	not	required.	Each	of	the	members	of	the	Committee	met	
with	each	of	the	shortlisted	candidates	and	all	other	directors	
met	with	Ian	prior	to	the	Board	approving	his	appointment.	
Diversity
Whilst	we	pursue	diversity,	including	gender	diversity,	throughout	
the	business,	and	the	Board	endorses	the	aspirations	of	the	
Davies	Review	on	Women	on	Boards,	we	are	not	committing	
to	any	specific	targets.	Instead,	when	relevant,	we	will	seek	to	
use	executive	search	firms	who	have	signed	up	to	the	voluntary	
code	of	conduct	setting	out	the	seven	key	principles	of	best	
practice	to	abide	by	throughout	the	recruitment	process	and	we	
will	continue	to	follow	a	policy	of	appointing	talented	people	at	
every	level	to	deliver	high	performance.	We	will	also	ensure	that	
our	development	in	this	area	is	consistent	with	our	own	strategic	
objectives	and	is	enhancing	in	terms	of	Board	effectiveness.

Significant issues considered in relation to the financial 
statements
During	the	year,	the	Committee	considered	key	accounting	
matters	and	judgements	in	respect	of	the	financial	statements	
relating	to:
Investment property valuation	–	At	30	December	2014	
the	Group’s	property	assets	including	its	20%	share	of	the	
Kingfisher	Centre,	Redditch	was	£939.7	million	(see	note	10b	
of	the	financial	statements	for	further	details).	The	valuation	
of	investment	property	is	inherently	judgemental	and	involves	
a	reliance	on	the	work	of	independent	professional	qualified	
valuers.	The	Audit	Committee	considered	the	independence	
and	qualifications	of	the	valuers	engaged	and	reviewed	and	
challenged	the	valuations	at	each	period	end	to	understand	the	
basis	for	them	and	the	rationale	for	movements	in	the	context	
of	both	the	individual	properties	and	the	general	property	
investment	market.
Accounting for the acquisition of The Mall Fund	–	The	
Committee	considered	the	accounting	for	the	transactions	that	
resulted	in	the	Group	acquiring	100%	of	The	Mall	Fund	during	
2014.	This	included	the	calculation	of	the	gain	on	acquisition	
which	involved	an	assessment	of	the	fair	value	of	the	assets	
and	liabilities	acquired	and	arising	from	the	transactions	and	
consideration	of	the	classification	and	treatment	of	associated	
transaction	costs.
Performance fee recognition –	The	Committee	considered	the	
basis	and	rationale	for	management’s	conclusion	that	it	was	
appropriate	to	recognise	a	performance	fee	liability	within	the	
Mall	Fund	accounts	and	the	Group’s	share	of	income	within	
Capital	&	Regional	Property	Management	as	at	the	year	end	
(see	note	25	for	further	details).	This	involved	understanding	the	
conditions	of	the	underlying	contracts	and	the	calculation	and	
agreement	of	the	amounts	accrued.
Going concern and covenant compliance	–	The	Committee	
reviewed,	challenged	and	concluded	upon	the	Group’s	going	
concern	review	including	giving	due	consideration	to	the	
appropriateness	of	key	judgements,	assumptions	and	estimates	
underlying	the	budgets	and	projections	that	underpin	the	review	
and	a	review	of	compliance	with	key	financial	covenants.	
Accounting for the conditional exchange on disposal of 
Germany	–	In	2014	the	results	of	the	Group’s	German	joint	
venture	were	classified	as	Discontinued	Operations	(see	
note	26	for	further	details).	The	Audit	Committee	reviewed	
management’s	rationale	for	concluding	that	these	operations	
met	the	definition	as	Discontinued	Operations	and	the	
classification	and	valuation	as	an	asset	held	for	sale	at	30	
December	2014.
Impairment of inter-company investments and receivables 
–	Management	perform	an	annual	review	of	inter-company	
investments	and	receivables	to	determine	the	values	to	be	
maintained	in	the	Plc	Company	only	and	individual	subsidiary	
balance	sheets.	The	Committee	considered	the	movement	over	
the	year	and	the	key	assumptions	particularly	where	balances	
were	held	with	reference	to	value	in	use	as	opposed	to	net	
assets	of	the	underlying	entity.
Oversight of the external auditor
The	Committee	carried	out	a	review	of	the	effectiveness	of	the	
external	audit	process	and	considered	the	re-appointment	of	
Deloitte	LLP .	The	review	was	structured	using	a	questionnaire	
which	was	completed	by	all	Committee	members	and	relevant	
senior	management	with	the	results	being	collated	and	
aggregated	for	discussion	at	the	following	Committee	meeting.	
The	review	covered	amongst	other	factors,	the	quality	of	the	
staff,	the	expertise,	the	resources,	and	the	independence	of	
Deloitte	LLP .	The	Committee	reviews	the	audit	plan	for	the	
year	carefully	and	subsequently	considers	how	the	auditor	
performed	to	the	plan.	They	consider	the	quality	of	written	and	
oral	presentations	and	the	overall	performance	of	the	lead	audit	
partner.	
The	Audit	Committee	is	also	responsible	for	reviewing	the	cost-
effectiveness	and	the	volume	of	non-audit	services	provided	to	
the	Group	by	its	external	auditor.	The	Group	does	not	impose	an	
automatic	ban	on	the	Group’s	external	auditor	undertaking	non-
audit	work,	rather	the	Group’s	aim	is	always	to	have	any	non-
audit	work	involving	the	Group’s	external	auditor	carried	out	in	a	
manner	that	affords	value	for	money	and	ensures	independence	
is	maintained	by	monitoring	this	on	a	case	by	case	basis.
During	the	year	the	Committee	reviewed	and	updated	its	policy	
on	the	use	of	its	external	auditor	for	non-audit	services.	The	
changes	made	included	stating	that	under	no	circumstances	
would	the	external	auditor	be	engaged	to	perform	valuation	
work,	accounting	services	and	any	recruitment	services	or	
secondments.	It	was	also	agreed	that	for	any	piece	of	work	
likely	to	exceed	£10,000	at	least	one	other	alternative	firm	
provide	a	proposal	for	consideration.	Consideration	was	also	
given	to	the	likelihood	of	a	withdrawal	of	the	auditor	from	
the	market	and,	it	was	noted	that	there	were	no	contractual	
obligations	which	would	restrict	the	choice	of	an	alternative	
auditor. 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 8

Audit Committee Report
Continued
Details	of	the	fees	paid	to	Deloitte	LLP	for	non-audit	services	
during	the	year	are	provided	in	note	6	to	the	financial	
statements.	Other	than	the	interim	review	the	only	work	for	
which	Deloitte	LLP	was	engaged	was	their	role	as	Reporting	
Accountants	on	the	£165	million	capital	raise	and	acquisition	
of	62.56%	of	Mall	Units	for	which	they	were	paid	£137,500.	
Deloitte’s	work	primarily	involved	providing	the	required	
Accountant’s	Report	on	the	historical	financial	information	
provided	in	respect	of	The	Mall	and	the	unaudited	proforma	
financial	information.	Grant	Thornton	LLP	were	engaged	to	
provide	private	reports	on	Working	Capital,	Capitalisation	
and	Indebtedness	and	Financial	Position	and	Prospects.	The	
Committee	considered	a	proposal	by	Grant	Thornton	LLP	to	
perform	the	work	for	which	Deloitte	were	engaged	but	given	
Deloitte	LLP’s	role	as	auditor	it	was	considered	they	were	best	
placed	to	perform	the	work	both	in	terms	of	effectiveness	and	
efficiency	especially	given	the	time	constraints	involved.
The	Committee	agreed	that	it	was	appropriate	to	recommend	
to	the	Board	that	Deloitte	LLP	be	reappointed	as	auditor	
for	a	further	year	and,	accordingly	a	resolution	will	be	put	to	
shareholders	at	the	2015	Annual	General	Meeting.
Independence safeguards
In	accordance	with	best	practice	and	professional	standards,	
the	external	auditor	is	required	to	adhere	to	a	rotation	policy	
whereby	the	audit	engagement	partner	is	rotated	at	least	every	
five	years.	2014	is	the	second	year	that	Georgina	Robb	has	
acted	as	lead	audit	engagement	partner.
Deloitte	LLP	have	been	auditor	of	Capital	&	Regional	plc	since	
1998.	The	audit	was	last	put	out	to	tender	in	2009	where	
Deloitte	were	re-appointed.	The	Group	intends	to	put	the	audit	
out	to	tender	at	least	every	10	years	as	recommended	by	the	
UK	Corporate	Governance	Code.	
Internal audit
The	Group	does	not	have	an	internal	audit	function	but	
manages	an	ongoing	process	of	control	reviews	performed	
either	by	staff,	independent	of	the	specific	area	being	reviewed,	
or	by	external	consultants	when	deemed	appropriate.	During	
the	year	the	Committee	reviewed	updates	on	controls	over	the	
Group’s	Capital	Expenditure	controls,	IT	and	data	security	and	
compliance	with	the	Group’s	gift	and	hospitality	policy.	The	
Committee	also	reviewed	and	agreed	a	plan	and	schedule	for	
reviews	for	2015.	
While	the	Committee	will	continue	to	review	the	position	
at	present	it	continues	to	believe	that	the	current	size	and	
complexity	of	the	Group	does	not	justify	establishing	an	internal	
audit	function.
Whistleblowing
The	Group	has	in	place	a	whistleblowing	policy	which	
encourages	employees	to	report	any	malpractice	or	illegal	acts	
or	omissions	or	matters	of	similar	concern	by	other	employees	
or	former	employees,	contractors,	suppliers	or	advisers	
using	internal	mechanisms	for	reporting.	The	policy	acts	as	a	
mechanism	to	report	any	ethical	wrongdoing	or	malpractice	
or	suspicion	which	may	amount	to	ethical	wrongdoing	or	
malpractice.	Examples	of	ethical	wrongdoing	or	malpractice	
include	bribery,	corruption,	fraud,	dishonesty	and	illegal	
practices	which	may	endanger	employees	or	other	parties.	
There	have	been	no	instances	of	whistleblowing	during	the	year	
under	review.

Directors’ Remuneration Report –  
Annual Statement
Governance > Directors’ Remuneration Report 
Philip Newton  
Chairman	of	Remuneration	Committee
Information not subject to audit:
Annual Statement
Dear	Shareholder
On	behalf	of	the	Board,	I	am	pleased	to	present	the	
Remuneration	Committee’s	report	of	the	Directors	remuneration	
for	the	year	ended	30	December	2014	for	which	we	will	be	
seeking	approval	at	the	Annual	General	Meeting	on	12	May	2015.
The	Committee	recognises	that	executive	remuneration	continues	
to	be	an	area	of	focus	for	shareholders	and	the	wider	public	and	
we	are	supportive	of	the	continued	drive	to	increase	simplification	
and	transparency	of	reporting	to	provide	shareholders	with	
greater	understanding	of	our	policy	and	its	relationship	with	our	
strategy.
Stretching	operational	and	financial	targets	were	set	for	the	
executive	directors	to	drive	the	achievement	of	the	Company’s	
strategic	objectives	in	2014.	It	has	been	a	transformational	year.	
The	executive	directors	have	achieved	excellent	results	in	all	key	
strategic,	financial	and	operational	areas:
•	 Acquisition	of	100%	of	The	Mall	and	restructuring	the	fund	to	
remove	at	least	£1.5	million	of	annualised	costs
•	 Successful	disposals	of	Germany	(£42.1	million)	and	Lincoln	
(£15.7	million)
•	 £165	million	capital	raise	resulting	in	enhanced	liquidity	for	
shareholders
•	 Strong	progress	on	£65	million	Capex	plan	within	The	Mall	
portfolio
•	 Footfall	up	by	0.9%	outperforming	the	national	benchmark	by	
1.8%	
•	 REIT	conversion	completed	and	effective	31	December	2014
•	 Share	price	growth	from	43.6p	at	30	December	2013	to	
52.75p	at	30	December	2014
•	 Full	year	2014	dividend	payment	of	0.95p	per	share
It	is,	therefore,	the	Committee’s	view	that	the	executive	directors’	
variable	remuneration	should	reflect	the	strategic	progress	
made	throughout	this	past	year	and	that	this	and	the	excellent	
results	are	reflected	in	the	variable	remuneration	of	the	broader	
management	team.
In	2013	we	undertook	consultation	with	key	shareholders	on	
modifications	to	the	long	term	incentive	scheme	and	annual	
performance	bonus	levels,	these	changes	were	fully	integrated	
in	2014	and	feedback	continues	to	inform	the	Committee’s	
progressive	thinking.	The	Company	holds	regular	update	
meetings	with	institutional	investors	and	the	Remuneration	
Committee	members	are	accessible	to	all	shareholders;	any	
queries	received	verbally	or	in	writing	are	addressed	immediately.	
During	the	year	the	Committee	conducted	a	review	of	the	
effectiveness	of	the	current	remuneration	and	incentives	and	how	
they	link	to	business	strategy.	The	Committee	believes	that	the	
elements	of	fixed	and	variable	remuneration	remain	appropriate	
in	the	current	market	environment.	Overall	the	incentives	have	
provided	strong	alignment	between	shareholder	and	executive	
team.	
The	Committee	is	recommending	the	Remuneration	Policy	for	
approval	at	the	Annual	General	Meeting	as	we	believe	it	continues	
to	support	the	Company’s	success	and	objective	of	increasing	
long	term	shareholder	value	whilst	providing	sufficient	levels	of	
remuneration	and	reward	to	attract	and	retain	our	executive	
directors.	The	Committee	believe	that	this	remuneration	policy	
structure	is	appropriate	for	Capital	&	Regional.
We	continue	to	benchmark	against	a	relevant	comparator	
group,	details	of	the	comparator	group	are	on	page	54.	We	
have	maintained	our	policy	of	total	compensation	for	executive	
directors	at	the	median	or	above	against	our	comparator	group,	
with	appropriate	upward	and	downward	variability	based	on	
performance.	
For	2015	Executive	Directors	salaries	will	increase	by	2.5%,	being	
the	same	percentage	increase	provided	to	employees	across	the	
business.	This	is	the	first	increase	for	Executive	Directors	since	
2012,	more	information	on	this	is	available	on	page	60.
Long	Term	Incentive	Plan	(LTIP)	awards	were	made	to	the	
Executive	Directors	in	August	2014	and	in	March	2015	to	reflect	
the	progress	detailed	above.
The	policies	set	out	in	the	2013	Directors’	Remuneration	Report	
received	a	vote	in	favour	of	85.5%	of	votes	cast	at	the	AGM	and	I	
thank	shareholders	for	their	continued	support.	
Capital	&	Regional	remains	committed	to	clear	and	open	
communication.	I	am	available	to	shareholders	to	raise	matters	
directly	and	the	Committee	remains	open	to	discussion	with	
shareholders	should	there	be	any	concerns	that	they	wish	to	
raise.	In	respect	of	executive	remuneration	there	have	been	no	
departures	from	normal	policy.
Shareholders	will	be	invited	to	approve	this	Report	and	vote	on	
the	Policy	at	the	Annual	General	Meeting	of	the	Company	on		
12	May	2015	to	apply	until	the	2016	AGM.

Directors’ Remuneration Report – Policy
In	this	section	we	explain	our	remuneration	strategy	and	policy;	how	our	remuneration	packages	support	this	strategy;	why	we	have	
chosen	the	performance	conditions	we	have	and	how	they	align	with	shareholders’	interests.	
This	report	has	been	prepared	in	accordance	with	the	provisions	of	the	Companies	Act	2006	and	Schedule	8	of	the	Large	and	
Medium-sized	Companies	and	Groups	(Accounts	and	Reports)	Regulations	2008	(as	amended).	This	report	sets	out	the	Company’s	
current	remuneration	policy,	highlighting	any	changes	from	that	which	was	approved	at	the	2014	AGM.	A	binding	resolution	to	
approve	this	report	will	be	put	to	shareholders	at	the	forthcoming	2015	AGM.	In	terms	of	an	approved	policy,	it	will	take	effect	from	
the	date	it	is	approved	by	shareholders	until	the	2016	AGM.
The	Committee	reviewed	the	remuneration	policy	during	the	year	and	concluded	that	the	policy	is	appropriate	for	the	business.	
There	may	be	further	enhancements	which	could	be	made	and	the	Committee	will	continue	to	review	best	practice	which	may	
further	inform	the	policy	in	future	years.
The Remuneration Committee
Philip	Newton	chairs	the	Remuneration	Committee;	he	is	the	Senior	Independent	Director.	The	other	members	of	the	Committee	are	
Tony	Hales,	John	Clare	and	Ian	Krieger	(from	1	December	2014).
The	Committee	met	three	times	during	2014	and	held	a	number	of	informal	meetings	to	discuss	wider	remuneration	issues.	In	
addition	to	the	Committee	members,	the	Chief	Executive	and	other	non-executive	directors	are	invited	to	attend	meetings	as	
required,	except	in	circumstances	where	their	own	remuneration	is	being	discussed.
The	Remuneration	Committee	agrees	the	framework	for	the	remuneration	of	the	Chairman	and	the	Executive	Directors.	This	
includes	the	policy	for	all	cash	remuneration,	executive	share	plans,	service	contracts	and	termination	arrangements.	The	
Committee	approves	salaries	and	sets	performance	objectives	and	levels	of	award	for	annual	cash	bonuses.	It	sets	the	share	
awards	conditions	for	executive	directors.	It	approves	new	share	plans	and	any	changes	to	them	and	makes	recommendations	to	
the	Board	on	matters	which	require	shareholders’	approval.	The	Committee	also	determines	the	basis	on	which	awards	are	granted	
under	the	share	plans.
The	Committee	engaged	independent	remuneration	consultants	PricewaterhouseCoopers	to	provide	advice	during	the	year	in	
relation	to	amendments	to	the	existing	August	2013	LTIP	awards	to	offset	the	impact	of	the	£165	million	capital	raise,	fees	charged	
during	2014	were	£7,500.

Remuneration philosophy and principles
Our	principles	are	to	maintain	a	competitive	remuneration	package	that	will	attract,	retain	and	motivate	a	high	quality	top	team,	
avoid	excessive	or	inappropriate	risk	taking	and	align	their	interests	with	those	of	shareholders.	These	principles	are	designed	to:
•	 Drive	accountability	and	responsibility	
•	 Provide	a	balanced	range	of	incentives	which	align	both	short	term	and	long	term	performance	with	the	value/returns	delivered	to	
shareholders
•	 Apply	demanding	performance	conditions	to	deliver	sustainable	high	performance;	setting	these	conditions	with	due	regard	to	
actual	and	expected	market	conditions	and	business	context
•	 Ensure	a	large	part	of	potential	remuneration	is	delivered	in	shares	in	order	that	executives	are	expected	to	build	up	a	
shareholding	themselves	and	therefore	they	are	directly	exposed	to	the	same	gains	or	losses	as	all	other	shareholders
•	 Take	account	of	the	remuneration	of	other	comparator	companies	of	similar	size,	scope	and	complexity	within	our	industry	sector	
•	 Keep	under	review	the	relationship	of	remuneration	to	risk,	the	members	of	the	Remuneration	Committee	are	that	of	the	Audit	
Committee
•	 Ensure	that	the	incentive	structure	does	not	raise	any	environmental,	social	or	governance	risks	through	compliance	with	our	
Responsible	Business	ethics	and	standards	of	operating	
How the Committee sets remuneration

The	Committee	benchmarks	remuneration	against	our	selected	comparator	group	companies	(see	page	54)	and	ensures	that	
directors	fixed	compensation	is	around	the	median	in	the	comparator	group.
The	Committee	views	that	by	putting	an	emphasis	on	performance	related	compensation,	executives	are	encouraged	to	perform	
to	the	highest	of	their	abilities.	The	performance	based	compensation	is	targeted	to	be	at	median	or	above	within	the	comparator	
group.	The	overall	effect	is	that	our	total	compensation	is	at	median	or	above. 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 8

Exit payment policy 
When	considering	termination	payments	the	Committee	takes	into	account	the	best	interests	of	the	Company	and	the	individuals’	
circumstances	including	the	reasons	for	termination,	contractual	obligations,	bonus	and	LTIP	scheme	rules.	The	Remuneration	
Committee	will	ensure	that	there	are	no	unjustified	payments	for	failure	on	an	Executive	Director’s	termination	of	employment.	The	
policy	in	relation	to	leavers	is	summarised	as	follows:
•	 In	normal	circumstances	the	Executive	Director	will	work	their	notice	period	and	receive	usual	remuneration	payments	and	
benefits	during	this	time.	The	Remuneration	Committee	can	exercise	discretion	on	the	leaver	being	treated	as	a	good	leaver	for	
the	purposes	of	the	LTIP	scheme.
•	 In	the	event	of	the	termination	of	an	Executive	Director’s	contract	and	the	Company	requesting	the	executive	cease	working	
immediately,	either	a	compensation	for	loss	of	office	payment	will	be	made	or	a	payment	in	lieu	of	notice	plus	benefits	may	be	
made.	The	value	of	the	compensation	for	loss	of	office	will	be	equivalent	to	the	contractual	notice	period,	pension	and	benefits	
value.	
•	 The	Executive	Director	may	also	be	considered	for	a	performance	related	pay	award	upon	termination.	The	financial	performance	
of	the	Company	and	meeting	of	KPIs	and	targets	is	the	prime	driver	for	determining	whether	to	make	an	award	and	the	quantum.	
The	Remuneration	Committee	can	exercise	discretion	on	the	leaver	being	treated	as	a	good	leaver	for	the	purposes	of	a	pro	rata

•	 In	the	event	of	termination	for	gross	misconduct,	neither	notice	nor	payment	in	lieu	of	notice	will	be	given	and	the	Executive	will	
cease	to	perform	their	services	with	immediate	effect.
In	the	event	that	the	Committee	exercises	the	discretion	detailed	above	in	this	section,	the	Committee	will	provide	an	explanation	in	
the	next	remuneration	report.
Executive directors’ contracts 
The	service	agreements	of	Hugh	Scott-Barrett,	Ken	Ford	and	Charles	Staveley	entitle	them,	on	termination	of	their	contract	by	C&R,	
to	payment	equal	to	basic	salary	and	the	value	of	benefits	for	12	months.	Mark	Bourgeois’	agreement	entitles	him	to	the	earlier	of		
12	months	from	notice	of	termination	or	him	obtaining	full-time	employment.	
External appointments
The	Company	allows	Executive	Directors	to	take	up	external	positions	outside	the	Group,	providing	they	do	not	involve	a	significant	
commitment	and	do	not	cause	conflict	with	their	duties	to	the	Company.	These	appointments	can	broaden	the	experience	and	
knowledge	of	the	Director,	from	which	the	Company	can	benefit.	Executives	are	allowed	to	retain	all	remuneration	arising	from	any	
external	position.	During	the	year	under	review	the	following	external	positions	were	held:
Executive Appointment 
H	Scott-Barrett Non-Executive	Director	GAM	Holding	AG
Non-Executive	Director	The	Goodwood	Estate	Company	Ltd
K	Ford –
C	Staveley –
M	Bourgeois Junior	Vice	President	of	the	British	Council	of	Shopping	Centres
Non-executive directors
Non-Executive	Directors	have	letters	of	appointment	for	a	fixed	three	year	term.	All	Board	appointments	automatically	terminate	in	
the	event	of	a	director	not	being	re-elected	by	shareholders.	The	appointment	of	a	non-executive	director	is	terminable	(on	notice)	
by	the	Company	without	compensation.	At	the	end	of	the	initial	term,	the	appointment	may	be	continued	by	mutual	agreement.	
Details	of	the	fees	received	by	each	non-executive	director	can	be	found	within	the	audited	information	on	page	60.	The	individuals	
who	are	members	of	both	the	Audit	and	Remuneration	Committees	receive	an	additional	fee	of	£5,000	per	annum.	
Senior management
The	policy	for	senior	management	remuneration	is	set	in	line	with	the	policy	for	the	executive	directors,	with	a	degree	of	discretion	
for	the	Committee	to	take	into	account	specific	issues	identified	by	the	Chief	Executive,	such	as	the	performance	of	a	specific	
individual	or	division. 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 8

Remuneration Policy in 2015
The	Committee	is	not	proposing	any	changes	to	the	remuneration	structure	in	2015	however	it	does	aim	to	further	develop	the	link	
between	performance	and	reward	in	any	way	it	can	and	taking	into	account	best	practice	as	it	evolves	within	the	field	of	executive	
remuneration.	We	will	continue	to	consult	with	key	shareholders	on	these	matters.
Salary
When	determining	the	base	salary	of	the	Executives,	the	main	points	the	Committee	takes	into	consideration	are	as	follows:
•	 Salary	levels	of	the	comparator	group
•	 Performance	of	the	executive	director
•	 Performance	and	development	of	the	business
•	 Directors’	experience	and	responsibilities
•	 Pay	and	conditions	throughout	the	business	
•	 Pay	and	conditions	throughout	our	sector	and	other	relevant	recruitment	sources
The	Remuneration	Committee	has	access	to	information	and	benchmarking	research	on	the	pay	and	conditions	of	other	employees	
in	the	company	when	determining	remuneration	for	the	Executive	Directors.	The	Remuneration	Committee	actively	considers	
the	relationship	between	general	changes	to	employees’	pay	and	conditions	and	any	proposed	changes	to	Executive	Directors	
remuneration.	Employee	pay	levels	were	reviewed	and	benchmarked	and	an	inflationary	2.5%	increase	was	awarded	with	effect	
from	1	January	2015.	A	benchmarking	exercise	was	also	completed	against	our	updated	comparator	group	for	the	Executive	
Directors.	On	reflection	of	this	it	was	concluded	that	Executive	Director	salaries	for	2015	should	also	increase	by	the	same	2.5%	
awarded	to	all	employees.	This	represents	the	first	increase	for	Executive	Directors	since	2012.
Annual bonus 
The	Committee	policy	position	on	annual	bonus	is	within	the	range	of	median	or	above.	The	maximum	bonus	opportunity	for	
Executives	directors	is	100%	of	basic	salary.	This	top	level	of	annual	bonus	is	only	payable	if	the	Company’s	financial	and	business	
performance	achieves	the	stretching	objectives	set,	which	are	designed	to	deliver	exceptional	results	to	shareholders.	
Within	the	objectives	bandings	the	detailed	targets	are	based	on	benchmarks	that	reflect	stretching	internal	and	external	
expectations.	The	benchmarks	for	any	year	may	include:	
•	 NRI	and	Net	Valued	Income;
•	 Operating	Profit	growth;	
•	 Valuation	metrics;	
•	 Valuations	on	disposal;	
•	 Returns	from	sales	of	assets;	
•	 NAV	and	EPRA	NAV;	
•	 Execution	of	strategic	objectives;	
•	 Relationship	management;	
•	 Leadership	and	management	metrics;	and
•	 TSR/shareholder	returns.
The	Committee	set	challenging	targets	within	the	objectives	bandings	for	2014	which	required	stretching	levels	of	performance	in	
order	for	any	bonus	to	be	earned.	The	Committee	has	assessed	performance	against	the	bonus	criteria	and	determined	that	the	
thresholds	detailed	below	have	been	met	in	respect	of	on	target	performance.
Benefits
The	Company	makes	available	the	normal	benefits	in	kind	for	Executives	of	their	level	such	as	private	healthcare,	permanent	health	
insurance,	life	insurance	and	critical	illness	cover.	The	benefits	policy	position	is	at	the	median	range.
Pension 
The	Executive	Directors	received	either	cash	in	lieu	of	pension	contributions	or	cash	contributions	directly	to	their	own	personal	
pension	scheme.	The	pension	policy	position	is	at	the	median	range. 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 8

From	1	January	2010,	the	Executive	Directors	(CEO	from	2009	–	salary	reduced	from	£360,000	in	2008)	voluntarily	reduced	
their	annual	salaries	for	two	years	whilst	the	Group	went	through	a	period	of	strengthening	the	balance	sheet	and	refocusing	the	
business.	With	effect	from	1	January	2011,	The	Committee	approved	an	inflationary	salary	increase	for	the	Executive	Directors,	
applied	to	the	reduced	level	of	salaries.
Following	expiry	of	the	two	year	voluntary	reduction	in	Executive	Director	salaries	on	1	January	2012,	the	Committee	considered	
it	was	appropriate	to	conduct	a	review	of	Executive	Director	salaries.	This	review	used	external	benchmarking	data	to	ensure	that	
executive	director	salaries	are	in	line	with	current	market	rates	for	similar	sized	listed	property	companies	and	director	experience.	
There	was	no	increase	to	Executive	Directors’	salaries	between	2012	and	2014.	As	noted	above	salaries	for	Executive	Directors	for	
2015	have	been	increased	by	2.5%	in	line	with	the	inflationary	increase	provided	to	employees.	 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 8

Share awards (LTIP)
The share award (LTIP) policy is at the median or above range.
The	Remuneration	Committee	granted	LTIP	awards	to	Executive	Directors	on	14	August	2014.	The	CEO	received	awards	equivalent	
to	150%	of	salary	with	other	Executive	Directors	receiving	awards	equivalent	to	100%.	A	small	group	of	management	also	received	
an	award.	
The	number	of	awards	and	the	performance	periods	are	summarised	in	the	table	below	for	all	existing	issues.	The	performance	
period	for	these	awards	is	three	years	from	the	date	of	grant	although	there	is	then	a	further	deferral/holding	period.	For	the	awards	
issued	on	16	August	2013	the	deferral/holding	period	is	one	year	after	the	performance	date,	for	the	awards	issued	on	14	August	
2014	the	deferral/holding	period	is	one	year	for	50%	of	the	awards	and	two	years	for	the	remaining	50%.

Share	price	of	52.75p	plus	cumulative	dividends	from	14	August	2014	to	30	December	2014	of	0.35p	per	share.
The	Committee	engaged	and	consulted	with	key	shareholders	and	considered	current	market	practice	ahead	of	the	August	2013	
award	which	was	the	first	of	a	planned	rolling	annual	cycle	of	LTIP	awards	linked	to	performance	targets	each	measured	over	a	
three	year	period.	Awards	were	also	made	to	a	small	group	of	senior	managers.
The	performance	targets	for	the	awards	relate	to	absolute	TSR.	The	awards	trigger	if	the	share	price	at	the	end	of	the	vesting	period	
(adjusted	for	cumulative	dividends	and	distributions	paid	in	the	performance)	is	within	the	specified	range	based	on	the	average	
price	for	the	30	day	period	preceding	the	date	of	vesting.	25%	of	the	award	will	vest	at	threshold	(40p	for	the	August	2013	award,	
60p	for	the	August	2014	award)	with	100%	vesting	at	70p	for	the	August	2013	award	and	85p	for	the	August	2014	award.	Vesting	
between	the	threshold	and	maximum	points	will	be	on	a	straight-line	basis.	
The	Company	has	made	significant	progress	in	the	execution	of	the	transformation	strategy	to	simplify	and	increase	the	focus	of	the	
business	through	disposal	of	non-core	assets	and	the	recycling	of	capital	into	its	core	shopping	centre	activities.	The	Committee	
concluded	that	absolute	share	performance	was	appropriate	on	the	basis	that:
•	 Capital	&	Regional	differed	from	almost	all	other	quoted	companies	in	the	sector	during	this	transformation;	and
•	 The	level	of	de-risking	of	the	balance	sheet	meant	that	geared	growth	potential	would	differ	from	other	companies	in	the	sector.
The	key	objective	of	the	business	strategy	is	to	deliver	value	to	shareholders.	Although	this	may	be	achieved	through	share	price	
growth	and	superior	returns,	it	is	possible	that	in	seeking	to	deliver	value	to	shareholders,	management	may	look	to	create	a	
significant	liquidity	event.	It	is	essential	that	management	take	the	right	decisions	for	the	future	of	the	business	and	in	the	interests	
of	the	shareholders.	If	this	results	in	a	liquidity	event	before	the	end	of	the	three	year	performance	period,	management	will	not	be	
penalised	for	early	delivery	of	the	strategic	objectives.
If	such	an	event	occurs	with	the	three	year	performance	period	which	causes	the	awards	to	vest	early	(e.g.	takeover	of	a	significant	
liquidity	event	with	a	return	of	cash	to	shareholders)	and	the	TSR	performance	target	has	been	met	at	that	time	as	a	result	of	the	
transaction,	the	level	of	the	vesting	will	not	reduce	to	take	account	of	the	length	of	the	performance	period	remaining.	Although	any	
final	decision	will	be	taken	based	on	the	circumstances	at	the	time	the	Committee	intends	to	exercise	discretion	to	allow	full	vesting	
if	the	performance	targets	have	been	met	in	full.	If	the	performance	target	is	met	in	part,	the	vesting	schedule	would	be	followed	
through	again	and	no	proration	of	the	awards	would	apply.	The	same	approach	will	be	adopted	if	a	liquidity	event	does	not	give	rise	
to	early	vesting	under	the	rules	but	instead	results	in	an	executive	leaving	employment. 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 8

If	there	is	no	liquidity	event	within	the	three	year	performance	period	but	the	TSR	targets	are	achieved,	a	discretionary	underpin	will	
apply	to	the	LTIP	such	that	the	Committee	must	be	satisfied	that	the	TSR	performance	genuinely	reflects	management	effort	and	
action	in	delivering	financial	performance.
In	the	event	of	a	capital	raising	or	any	other	such	event	that	would	have	a	dilutive	impact	upon	the	awards	the	Remuneration	
Committee	may,	in	line	with	the	scheme	rules,	adjust	the	awards	granted	to	take	account	of	this.	In	August	2014	the	awards	
granted	in	August	2013	were	increased	by	2%	to	reflect	the	dilutive	impact	of	the	£165	million	Capital	Raise	that	completed	in	July	
2014.
A	deferral/holding	period	applies	to	vested	LTIP	awards.	In	respect	of	the	August	2013	awards	these	must	be	held	for	a	period	of	12	
months	following	vesting,	for	the	August	2014	awards	50%	must	be	held	for	one	year	and	50%	for	two	years	(deferral	periods	will	
not	apply	in	the	case	of	a	liquidity	event	within	three	years).
The	Company’s	clawback	provisions	apply	during	the	deferral/holding	period	where	the	level	of	vesting	may	be	reduced,	including	to	
nil.
Following	the	year	end	on	6	March	2015	a	further	grant	of	the	LTIP	was	made	at	the	following	levels:

C	Staveley 100% 496,969
M	Bourgeois 100% 399,350
A	group	of	senior	management	also	received	an	award.
The	number	of	shares	was	determined	by	the	closing	share	price	on	4	March	2015.	
The	awards	are	subject	to	similar	absolute	performance	targets	as	the	2013	and	2014	awards	with	a	threshold	of	65p	and	100%	
vesting	at	90p	over	a	three	year	period.	The	same	deferral	period	applies	as	for	the	2014	awards	such	that	50%	of	vested	awards	
must	be	held	for	a	period	of	12	months	following	vesting	with	the	other	50%	being	held	for	a	further	12	months	after	that	(this	will	
not	apply	in	the	case	of	a	liquidity	event	within	three	years).
The	Company’s	clawback	provisions	will	apply	during	the	deferral/holding	periods	where	the	level	of	vesting	may	be	reduced,

Payment for loss of office
In	2013	the	Committee	chose	to	exercise	its	right	to	make	a	loss	of	office	payment	to	Xavier	Pullen	of	£356,845	(equivalent	to	one	
year’s	salary	and	other	benefits)	and	an	annual	bonus	of	£118,000.	
Executive share ownership 
The	Committee	believes	that	the	interests	of	executives	should	closely	align	with	shareholders.	Accordingly	all	executive	directors	
are	expected	to	build	up	and	maintain	a	minimum	shareholding	equivalent	to	one	year’s	basic	salary	(two	years	for	the	Chief	
Executive)	based	on	current	market	value	or	aggregate	purchase	price.

Substantial shareholdings 
As	at	23	March	2015	(the	latest	practicable	date	prior	to	issue	
of	this	report)	the	Company	has	been	notified	of	the	following	
interests	in	its	issued	ordinary	share	capital	which	represent	3%

Premier	Asset	Management 23,484,630 3.35
APG	Asset	Management 22,213,598 3.17
Capital structure
The	Company	has	one	class	of	ordinary	shares	of	1	pence	each	
with	equal	voting	rights.	In	addition,	the	trustees	of	the	Long	
Term	Incentive	Share	Scheme	have	the	right	to	vote	on	behalf	of	
the	Group’s	employees.	Further	information	is	given	in	note	19	
to	the	financial	statements.
Significant contracts or arrangements
The	Group	has	the	following	significant	contracts	and	
agreements	in	place	which	alter	upon	a	change	of	control	of	the	
Company	as	follows:	
•	 The	Group’s	core	revolving	credit	facility	can	be	called	in	if	
there	is	a	change	of	control	of	the	Company,	which	is	defined	
to	be	either	the	Company	ceasing	to	hold	not	less	than	100%	
of	the	issued	share	capital	and	voting	rights	of	the	borrower,	
or	50%	of	the	Company’s	issued	share	capital	being	held	by	
or	on	behalf	of	a	single	entity	or	group,	or	30%	of	the	issued	
share	capital	being	held	by	or	on	behalf	of	a	single	entity	
or	group	and	more	than	50%	of	the	directors	immediately	
following	the	completion	of	the	Amendment	and	Restatement	
of	the	current	facility	in	August	2012,	ceasing	to	be	directors	
at	the	time	the	30%	limit	is	breached.	If	this	occurs	the	
bank	has	the	right	to	repayment	of	the	loan.	In	the	case	of	
Parkdev,	the	30%	limit	is	ignored	if	their	holding	exceeds	
30%	and	no	mandatory	takeover	offer	is	required	as	a	result	
of	a	whitewash	resolution	being	passed.
•	 Certain	tax	losses	could	be	lost	in	some	circumstances	
where	there	are	varying	degrees	of	change	of	ownership	of	
the	Group’s	shares.
In	addition	the	Group	could	lose	its	status	as	a	REIT	as	a	result	
of	the	actions	of	third	parties	(for	example	in	the	event	of	a	
successful	takeover	by	a	company	that	is	not	a	REIT	and	which	
does	not	qualify	as	an	institutional	investor	for	REIT	purposes)	or	
due	to	a	breach	of	the	close	company	condition	if	it	is	unable	to	
remedy	the	breach	within	a	specified	period.
Purchase of own shares
The	Company	did	not	make	any	purchases	of	its	own	shares	
during	2014	or	in	2015	up	to	23	March	2015	being	the	latest	
practicable	date	prior	to	the	issue	of	this	report.	
The	Company	was	authorised	by	shareholders	at	the	2014	
AGM	held	on	30	May	2014	to	purchase	up	to	a	maximum	of	
10.0%	of	its	ordinary	shares	in	the	market.	This	authority	will	
expire	at	the	2015	AGM	and	the	directors	will	be	seeking	a	new	
authority	for	the	Company	to	purchase	its	ordinary	shares.	This	
will	only	be	exercised	if	market	and	financial	conditions	make	it	
advantageous	to	do	so.	
Articles of Association
Various	amendments	were	agreed	to	the	Company’s	Articles	
of	Association	during	2014	in	connection	with	the	Company’s	
conversion	to	REIT	status.	The	revised	Articles	were	approved		
by	special	resolution	at	a	general	meeting	of	shareholders	on		
2	December	2014	and	became	effective	from	31	December	
2014	being	the	date	of	the	Group’s	conversion	to	REIT	status.	
Shares held by Employee Share Ownership Trust
The	Capital	&	Regional	Employee	Share	Ownership	Trust	did	
not	acquire	any	shares	in	2014.	At	30	December	2014	the	Trust	
held	1,070,583	shares	in	the	Company.	The	shares	held	by	the	
Trust	are	registered	in	the	nominee	name,	Forest	Nominees	
Limited	and	a	dividend	waiver	is	in	place	to	cover	the	entire	
holding.
Employees
The	Group	is	committed	to	a	policy	that	treats	all	of	its	
employees	and	job	applicants	equally.	No	employee	or	potential	
employee	receives	less	favourable	treatment	or	consideration	
on	the	grounds	of	race,	colour,	religion,	nationality,	ethnic	
origin,	sex,	sexual	orientation,	marital	status,	or	disability.	Nor	
is	any	employee	or	potential	employee	disadvantaged	by	any	
conditions	of	employment	or	requirements	of	the	Group	that	
cannot	be	justified	as	necessary	on	operational	grounds.
We	give	full	consideration	to	applications	for	employment	from	
disabled	persons	where	the	requirements	of	the	job	can	be	
adequately	fulfilled	by	people	with	disabilities.	We	endeavour	to	
retain	the	employment	of,	and	arrange	suitable	retraining	for,	any	
employee	who	becomes	disabled	during	their	employment	as	
well	as	providing	training,	career	development	and	promotion	to	
disabled	employees	wherever	appropriate.
During	the	year,	the	Group	maintained	arrangements	to	provide	
employees	with	information	on	matters	of	concern	to	them,	to	
regularly	consult	employees	for	views	on	matters	affecting	them,	
to	encourage	employee	involvement	in	the	Group’s	performance	
through	share	schemes,	and	to	make	all	employees	aware	of	
financial	and	economic	factors	affecting	the	performance	of	the	
Group. 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 8

The	Group	has	not	made	any	political	donations	during	the	
year	and	intends	to	continue	its	policy	of	not	doing	so	for	the	
foreseeable	future.
Human rights
The	Group	operates	in	the	UK,	Jersey	and	Germany	and,	as	
such,	is	subject	to	the	European	Convention	on	Human	Rights	
and	the	UK	Human	Rights	Act	1998.
The	Group	respects	all	human	rights	and	in	conducting	its	
business	the	Group	regards	those	rights	relating	to	non-
discrimination,	fair	treatment	and	respect	for	privacy	to	be	the	
most	relevant	and	to	have	the	greatest	potential	impact	on	its	
key	stakeholder	groups	of	customers,	employees	and	suppliers.
The	Board	has	overall	responsibility	for	ensuring	the	Group	
upholds	and	promotes	respect	for	human	rights.	The	Group	
seeks	to	anticipate,	prevent	and	mitigate	any	potential	negative	
human	rights	impacts	as	well	as	enhance	positive	impacts	
through	its	policies	and	procedures	and,	in	particular,	through	
its	policies	regarding	employment,	equality	and	diversity,	treating	
its	stakeholders	and	customers	fairly	and	information	security.	
Group	policies	seek	to	ensure	that	employees	comply	with	the	
relevant	legislation	and	regulations	in	place	to	promote	good	
practice.	The	Group’s	policies	are	formulated	and	kept	up	to	
date	and	communicated	to	all	employees	through	the	Staff	
Policy	Manual.	The	Group	has	not	been	made	aware	of	any	
incident	in	which	the	organisation’s	activities	have	resulted	in	an	
abuse	of	human	rights.
Going concern 
The	strategic	review	discusses	the	Group’s	business	activities,	
together	with	the	factors	likely	to	affect	its	future	development,	
performance	and	position	and	sets	out	the	financial	position	
of	the	Group,	its	cash	flows	and	liquidity.	Note	18	of	the	
financial	statements	sets	out	the	Group’s	objectives,	policies	
and	processes	for	managing	capital	and	its	financial	risk	
management	objectives,	together	with	details	of	financial	
instruments	and	exposure	to	credit	risk	and	liquidity	risk.
The	Group	has	available	financial	facilities	and	a	positive	cash	
position.	The	Board	has	prepared	forecasts,	including	sensitivity	
analysis,	which	demonstrates	that	the	Group	will	continue	
to	operate	within	its	available	resources.	After	reviewing	this	
analysis	the	Board	believes	that	the	Company	and	Group	have	
adequate	resources	and	facilities	to	continue	in	operational	
existence	for	the	foreseeable	future	and	therefore	the	financial	
statements	are	prepared	on	the	going	concern	basis.

Directors’ Responsibilities Statement
The	directors	are	responsible	for	preparing	the	Annual	Report	and	the	financial	statements	in	accordance	with	applicable	law	and	
regulations.	
Company	law	requires	the	directors	to	prepare	financial	statements	for	each	financial	year.	Under	that	law	the	directors	are	required	
to	prepare	the	Group	financial	statements	in	accordance	with	International	Financial	Reporting	Standards	(IFRSs)	as	adopted	by	
the	European	Union	and	Article	4	of	the	IAS	Regulation	and	have	elected	to	prepare	the	parent	company	financial	statements	in	
accordance	with	United	Kingdom	Generally	Accepted	Accounting	Practice	(United	Kingdom	Accounting	Standards	and	applicable	
law).	Under	company	law	the	directors	must	not	approve	the	financial	statements	unless	they	are	satisfied	that	they	give	a	true	and	
fair	view	of	the	state	of	affairs	of	the	Company	and	of	the	profit	or	loss	of	the	Company	for	that	year.	
In	preparing	the	parent	company	financial	statements,	the	directors	are	required	to:
•	 select	suitable	accounting	policies	and	then	apply	them	consistently;
•	 make	judgements	and	accounting	estimates	that	are	reasonable	and	prudent;
•	 state	whether	applicable	UK	Accounting	Standards	have	been	followed,	subject	to	any	material	departures	disclosed	and	
explained	in	the	financial	statements;	and
•	 prepare	the	financial	statements	on	the	going	concern	basis	unless	it	is	inappropriate	to	presume	that	the	Company	will	continue	
in	business.
In	preparing	the	Group	financial	statements,	International	Accounting	Standard	1	requires	that	Directors:
•	 properly	select	and	apply	accounting	policies;
•	 present	information,	including	accounting	policies,	in	a	manner	that	provides	relevant,	reliable,	comparable	and	understandable	
information;	
•	 provide	additional	disclosures	when	compliance	with	the	specific	requirements	in	IFRSs	are	insufficient	to	enable	users	to	
understand	the	impact	of	particular	transactions,	other	events	and	conditions	on	the	entity’s	financial	position	and	financial	
performance;	and	
•	 make	an	assessment	of	the	Company’s	ability	to	continue	as	a	going	concern.
The	directors	are	responsible	for	keeping	adequate	accounting	records	that	are	sufficient	to	show	and	explain	the	Company’s	
transactions	and	disclose	with	reasonable	accuracy	at	any	time	the	financial	position	of	the	Company	and	to	enable	them	to	ensure	
that	the	financial	statements	and	the	Directors’	Remuneration	Report	comply	with	the	Companies	Act.	They	are	also	responsible	for	
safeguarding	the	assets	of	the	Company	and	hence	for	taking	reasonable	steps	for	the	prevention	and	detection	of	fraud	and	other	
irregularities.	
The	directors	are	responsible	for	the	maintenance	and	integrity	of	the	corporate	and	financial	information	included	on	the	Company’s	
website.	Legislation	in	the	UK	governing	the	preparation	and	dissemination	of	financial	statements	may	differ	from	legislation	in	other	
jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We	confirm	that	to	the	best	of	our	knowledge:
•	 the	financial	statements,	prepared	in	accordance	with	the	relevant	financial	reporting	framework,	give	a	true	and	fair	view	of	the	
assets,	liabilities,	financial	position	and	profit	or	loss	of	the	Company	and	the	undertakings	included	in	the	consolidation	taken	as	
a	whole;	and
•	 the	Strategic	Report	includes	a	fair	review	of	the	development	and	performance	of	the	business	and	the	position	of	the	Company	
and	the	undertakings	included	in	the	consolidation	as	a	whole,	together	with	a	description	of	the	principal	risks	and	uncertainties	
that	they	face;	and
•	 the	annual	report	and	financial	statements,	taken	as	a	whole,	are	fair,	balanced	and	understandable	and	provide	the	information	
necessary	for	shareholders	to	assess	the	Company’s	performance,	business	model	and	strategy.
This	responsibility	statement	was	approved	by	the	Board	of	directors	on	26	March	2015	and	is	signed	on	its	behalf	by:

Opinion on financial statements of Capital & Regional plc
In	our	opinion:
•	 the	financial	statements	give	a	true	and	fair	view	of	the	state	of	the	Group’s	and	of	the	parent	company’s	affairs	as	at	30	
December	2014	and	of	the	Group’s	profit	for	the	year	then	ended;
•	 the	Group	financial	statements	have	been	properly	prepared	in	accordance	with	International	Financial	Reporting	Standards	
(IFRSs)	as	adopted	by	the	European	Union;
•	 the	parent	company	financial	statements	have	been	properly	prepared	in	accordance	with	United	Kingdom	Generally	Accepted	
Accounting	Practice;	and
•	 the	financial	statements	have	been	prepared	in	accordance	with	the	requirements	of	the	Companies	Act	2006	and,	as	regards	
the	Group	financial	statements,	Article	4	of	the	IAS	Regulation.
The	financial	statements	comprise	the	Consolidated	Income	Statement,	the	Consolidated	Statement	of	Comprehensive	Income,	the	
Consolidated	Balance	Sheet,	the	Consolidated	Statement	of	Changes	in	Equity,	the	Consolidated	Cash	Flow	Statement,	the	related	
notes	1	to	32,	the	Company	Balance	Sheet	and	the	related	notes	A	to	G.	The	financial	reporting	framework	that	has	been	applied	
in	the	preparation	of	the	Group	financial	statements	is	applicable	law	and	IFRSs	as	adopted	by	the	European	Union.	The	financial	
reporting	framework	that	has	been	applied	in	the	preparation	of	the	parent	company	financial	statements	is	applicable	law	and	
United	Kingdom	Accounting	Standards	(United	Kingdom	Generally	Accepted	Accounting	Practice).
Going concern
As	required	by	the	Listing	Rules	we	have	reviewed	the	directors’	statement	contained	within	the	directors’	report	on	page	67	that	
the	Group	is	a	going	concern.	We	confirm	that:
•	 we	have	concluded	that	the	directors’	use	of	the	going	concern	basis	of	accounting	in	the	preparation	of	the	financial	statements	
is	appropriate;	and
•	 we	have	not	identified	any	material	uncertainties	that	may	cast	significant	doubt	on	the	Group’s	ability	to	continue	as	a	going	
concern.
However,	because	not	all	future	events	or	conditions	can	be	predicted,	this	statement	is	not	a	guarantee	as	to	the	Group’s	ability	to	
continue	as	a	going	concern. 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 5

Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The	assessed	risks	of	material	misstatement	described	below	are	those	that	had	the	greatest	effect	on	our	audit	strategy,	the	
allocation	of	resources	in	the	audit	and	directing	the	efforts	of	the	engagement	team:
Risk Our response
Property valuations
The	valuation	of	investment	property	is	dependent	upon	
a	number	of	assumptions	and	judgements,	such	as	
occupancy	rates,	lease	incentives,	break	clauses	and	
yields.	Changes	in	these	assumptions	and	judgements	
could	lead	to	significant	movements	in	property	values	
and	consequently	unrealised	gains	or	losses	in	the	
consolidated	income	statement.	
The	accounting	policy	for	investment	property	is	set	out	
in	note	1	to	the	Group	financial	statements.
•	 We	met	with	the	third	party	valuers	appointed	by	management	
to	value	the	property	portfolio	and	challenged	the	significant	
judgements	and	assumptions	applied	in	their	valuation	model.	We	
verified	movements	in	the	key	judgements	and	benchmarked	the	
inputs	against	market	data.	We	assessed	each	individual	property	
valuation	within	the	property	portfolios.
•	 We	assessed	the	integrity	of	the	information	provided	to	the	valuers	
by	management	pertaining	to	rental	income,	purchasers’	costs	and	
occupancy.	
•	 We	considered	the	competence	and	independence	of	the	external	
valuers.
Acquisition of control of the Mall fund
The	accounting	treatment	for	the	acquisition	of	
control	over	the	Mall	fund	in	2014	and	the	calculation	
of	goodwill	arising	on	acquisition	has	significantly	
impacted	the	result	of	the	Group	for	the	year	ended	
30	December	2014.	This	has	been	identified	as	a	new	
significant	risk	this	year.
The	Mall	fund	had	net	assets	of	£370.6	million	at	
14	July	2014,	the	date	of	acquisition	of	control,	and	
£377.2	million	at	30	December	2014.	Disclosure	of	the	
acquisition	is	set	out	in	note	25	to	the	Group	financial	
statements.	The	accounting	policy	for	acquisitions	is	
set	out	in	note	1	to	the	Group	financial	statements.
•	 We	audited	the	basis	of	accounting	for	the	acquisition,	including	the	
calculation	of	the	goodwill	arising	on	acquisition.
•	 We	obtained	and	reviewed	the	legal	documentation	prepared	for	the	
acquisition	of	control	of	The	Mall	fund	by	the	Group.
•	 We	performed	substantive	audit	procedures	upon	the	acquisition	
balance	sheet.	This	included	auditing	the	carrying	values	of	
investment	property	and	other	material	balances	to	assess	whether	
the	acquired	balances	were	materially	correct.
•	 We	audited	the	consideration	payable	for	the	acquisition	of	control	
of	The	Mall	through	inspection	of	payments	made	and	agreement	to	
sales	contracts.
Going concern and covenant compliance 
The	acquisition	of	control	of	The	Mall	fund	was	in	part	
financed	through	utilisation	of	external	loan	facilities	
available	to	the	Group,	and	the	acquisition	resulted	in	
the	Group	acquiring	additional	external	debt	held	by	
The	Mall	fund.
The	existence	of	covenants	on	external	loans	held	by	
the	Group	and	the	ability	of	the	Group	to	meet	the	
covenant	requirements	both	during	the	year	and	for	a	
period	of	one	year	from	the	date	of	this	Auditor’s	Report	
is	identified	as	a	significant	risk.	External	borrowings	
had	a	carrying	value	of	£396.8	million	at	30	December	
2014.
Management’s	consideration	of	the	going	concern	
basis	of	preparation	is	set	out	in	note	1	to	the	Group	
financial	statements.
•	 We	challenged	the	judgements	and	assumptions	applied	by	
management	in	their	going	concern	assessment	and	associated	
forecasts	of	financial	performance,	financial	position	and	covenant	
compliance	including	examining	current	business	and	economic	
trends	and	significant	developments	during	and	subsequent	to	the	
year	ended	30	December	2014. 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 5

Risk Our response
Revenue recognition
Revenue	recognition,	including	the	potential	recognition	
and	provision	of	management	performance	fees	and	
the	accuracy	of	their	calculation	in	respect	of	the	
property	portfolios	and	accounting	for	lease	incentives	
is	identified	as	a	significant	risk.	The	calculation	of	
lease	incentives	involves	complex	calculations	and	the	
recognition	of	performance	fees	requires	judgement	
as	to	when	the	recognition	criteria	are	met,	including	
the	performance	of	the	property	portfolio	against	a	
benchmark	index.	The	accuracy	of	the	performance	
fee	and	lease	incentive	calculations	are	identified	as	
significant	risks	over	revenue.
Performance	fees	within	the	Group	total	£6.8	million	
in	2014,	disclosed	in	note	2b	to	the	Group	financial	
statements.	Lease	incentives	had	a	carrying	value	of	
£19.3	million	at	30	December	2014,	disclosed	in	note	
13	to	the	Group	financial	statements.	The	accounting	
policies	for	performance	fees	and	lease	incentives	are	
set	out	in	note	1	to	the	Group	financial	statements.
•	 We	challenged	the	appropriateness	of	the	Group’s	revenue	
recognition	in	respect	of	performance	fees.	We	have	agreed	the	
required	internal	rate	of	return	for	the	recognition	of	a	performance	
fee	for	each	management	contract	to	the	underlying	agreement	
and	compared	it	against	the	current	forecast	investment	return	
based	on	the	property	valuations	at	30	December	2014	and	
forecast	value	movements.	
•	 We	have	performed	our	audit	testing	for	lease	incentives	by	
verifying	the	mechanical	accuracy	of	calculations	and	agreeing	
inputs	to	the	lease	contacts.	Our	work	was	focused	upon	
identifying	unusual	or	complex	lease	contracts	to	consider	whether	
they	were	correctly	accounted	for	under	IAS	17:	‘Leases’,	and	
new	contracts	to	assess	the	completeness	of	the	lease	incentive	
calculations.
Impairment of company only investments
There	is	a	risk	of	impairment	of	the	investments	and	
intercompany	debtors	in	the	parent	Company	balance	
sheet.	In	particular,	this	relates	to	the	reasonableness	of	
cash	flow	forecasts	which	support	investments	held	at	
above	net	asset	value	of	the	subsidiaries.
Investments	had	a	carrying	value	of	£333.5	million	at	
30	December	2014,	comprising	70%	of	the	parent	
company’s	assets.	Intercompany	debtors	had	a	
carrying	value	of	£138.9	million	at	30	December	2014,	
comprising	29%	of	the	parent	company’s	assets.	
The	accounting	policies	for	both	investments	and	
intercompany	debtors	are	set	out	in	note	A	to	the	
parent	company	financial	statements.
•	 We	challenged	management’s	investment	impairment	model	and	
the	cash	flow	forecasts	employed	therein	including	comparison	of	
the	input	assumptions	to	externally	and	internally	derived	data.	The	
inputs	considered	included	the	cash	flow	projections	and	discount	
rates.	
•	 We	considered	the	sensitivity	of	the	model	to	changes	in	key	
assumptions.
•	 We	also	assessed	whether	the	forecasts	employed	are	consistent	
with	those	used	to	support	other	judgements	in	the	financial	
statements.
The	description	of	risks	above	should	be	read	in	conjunction	with	the	significant	issues	considered	by	the	Audit	Committee	as	
detailed	on	page	47.
Our	audit	procedures	relating	to	these	matters	were	designed	in	the	context	of	our	audit	of	the	financial	statements	as	a	whole,	and	
not	to	express	an	opinion	on	individual	accounts	or	disclosures.	Our	opinion	on	the	financial	statements	is	not	modified	with	respect	
to	any	of	the	risks	described	above,	and	we	do	not	express	an	opinion	on	these	individual	matters.
Our application of materiality
We	define	materiality	as	the	magnitude	of	misstatement	in	the	financial	statements	that	makes	it	probable	that	the	economic	
decisions	of	a	reasonably	knowledgeable	person	would	be	changed	or	influenced.	We	use	materiality	both	in	planning	the	scope	of	
our	audit	work	and	in	evaluating	the	results	of	our	work.
We	determined	materiality	for	the	Group	to	be	£6	million,	which	is	below	2%	of	total	equity	attributable	to	equity	holders	of	the	
parent.	For	the	audit	of	the	financial	statements	for	the	year	ended	30	December	2013,	we	applied	a	materiality	of	£3	million,	
which	was	below	2%	of	total	equity	attributable	to	equity	holders	of	the	parent.	The	increase	in	the	materiality	results	from	the	full	
consolidation	of	The	Mall	fund	for	the	first	time	for	the	year	ended	30	December	2014,	significantly	increasing	the	net	assets	of	the	
Group. 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 5

Our application of materiality continued
As	a	result	of	the	acquisition	we	have	reconsidered	the	appropriate	basis	for	determining	materiality.	In	addition	to	equity	described	
above,	we	also	consider	Operating	Profit	(as	defined	in	note	1	to	the	Group	financial	statements)	to	be	a	critical	financial	performance	
measure	for	the	Group	on	the	basis	that	it	is	a	key	metric	used	by	management,	is	the	basis	of	the	discussion	of	financial	performance	
in	the	Strategic	Report	and	is	a	metric	used	by	analysts.	We	applied	a	lower	threshold	of	£0.9	million	for	testing	of	all	balances	
impacting	this	financial	performance	measure,	which	is	5%	of	Operating	Profit	attributable	to	equity	holders	of	the	parent.
We	agreed	with	the	Audit	Committee	that	we	would	report	to	the	Committee	all	audit	differences	in	excess	of	£120,000	(2013:	
£60,000)	as	well	as	differences	below	that	threshold	that,	in	our	view,	warranted	reporting	on	qualitative	grounds.	We	also	report	to	the	
Audit	Committee	on	disclosure	matters	that	we	identified	when	assessing	the	overall	presentation	of	the	financial	statements	
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our	Group	audit	was	scoped	by	obtaining	an	understanding	of	the	Group	and	its	environment,	including	Group-wide	controls,	and	
assessing	the	risks	of	material	misstatement	at	the	Group	and	component	levels.	
Our	Group	audit	scope	focused	primarily	on	the	audit	work	on	the	major	lines	of	business.	These	major	lines	of	business	are	The	Mall	
Limited	Partnership,	the	Germany	joint	venture	held	for	sale	at	30	December	2014	and	Snozone	Limited,	which	are	individual	IFRS	8		
segments	as	disclosed	in	note	2	to	the	Group	financial	statements.	Other	major	lines	of	business	for	scoping	purposes	include	
the	Kingfisher	Limited	Partnership,	incorporated	into	the	Other	UK	Shopping	Centre	segment,	and	Capital	&	Regional	Property	
Management	Limited,	which	is	incorporated	into	the	Group/Central	segment	in	note	2	to	the	Group	financial	statements.	The	Waterside	
Lincoln	Limited	Partnership,	formerly	incorporated	into	the	Other	Shopping	Centre	segment,	was	disposed	of	on	12	November	2014	
and	was	subject	to	our	audit	procedures	to	that	date.	Garigal	Asset	Management	GmbH,	formerly	incorporated	into	the	Group/Central	
segment	in	note	2	to	the	Group	financial	statements,	was	disposed	of	on	4	October	2014	and	was	subject	to	review	procedures	to	
that	date.
All	of	the	above	were	subject	to	a	full	scope	audit	with	the	exception	of	the	Germany	joint	venture,	Garigal	Asset	Management	GmbH	
and	the	Kingfisher	Limited	Partnership,	which	were	subject	to	specific	audit	procedures	around	significant	audit	risks	and	key	balances	
including	investment	property	and	loans	payable.	
The	businesses	subject	to	a	full	audit	or	specific	audit	procedures	account	for	97%	of	the	Group’s	net	assets	(2013:	100%),	99%	of	the	
Group’s	revenue	(2013:	100%)	and	99%	of	the	Group’s	Operating	Profit	(2013:	100%).	All	investment	properties	have	been	included	
within	the	scope	of	our	work.	They	were	also	selected	to	provide	an	appropriate	basis	for	undertaking	audit	work	to	address	the	risks	
of	material	misstatement	identified	above.	The	Germany	joint	venture	is	audited	by	a	component	auditor	which	follows	instruction	by	
the	Group	audit	team	and	is	visited	annually	by	a	senior	member	of	the	Group	audit	team.	The	German	joint	venture	accounts	for	
30%	of	Operating	Profit	and	10%	of	net	assets	in	the	year.	The	remaining	components	are	audited	by	the	Group	audit	team.	Our	audit	
work	at	each	component	was	executed	at	levels	of	materiality	applicable	to	each	individual	entity	which	were	between	3%	and	95%	of	
Group	materiality.
At	the	parent	entity	level	we	also	tested	the	consolidation	process	and	carried	out	analytical	procedures	to	confirm	our	conclusion	
that	there	were	no	significant	risks	of	material	misstatement	of	the	aggregated	financial	information	of	the	remaining	components	not	
subject	to	audit	or	audit	of	specified	account	balances.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In	our	opinion:
•	 the	part	of	the	Directors’	Remuneration	Report	to	be	audited	has	been	properly	prepared	in	accordance	with	the	Companies	Act	
2006;	and
•	 the	information	given	in	the	Strategic	Report	and	the	Directors’	Report	for	the	financial	year	for	which	the	financial	statements	are	
prepared	is	consistent	with	the	financial	statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under	the	Companies	Act	2006	we	are	required	to	report	to	you	if,	in	our	opinion:
•	 we	have	not	received	all	the	information	and	explanations	we	require	for	our	audit;	or
•	 adequate	accounting	records	have	not	been	kept	by	the	parent	company,	or	returns	adequate	for	our	audit	have	not	been	received	
from	branches	not	visited	by	us;	or 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 5

www.capreg.com Financial Statements > Independent Auditor’s Report
•	 the	parent	company	financial	statements	are	not	in	agreement	with	the	accounting	records	and	returns.
We	have	nothing	to	report	in	respect	of	these	matters.	
	
Directors’ remuneration 
Under	the	Companies	Act	2006	we	are	also	required	to	report	if	in	our	opinion	certain	disclosures	of	directors’	remuneration	have	
not	been	made	or	the	part	of	the	Directors’	Remuneration	Report	to	be	audited	is	not	in	agreement	with	the	accounting	records	and	
returns.	We	have	nothing	to	report	arising	from	these	matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under	the	Listing	Rules	we	are	also	required	to	review	the	part	of	the	Corporate	Governance	Statement	relating	to	the	Company’s	
compliance	with	ten	provisions	of	the	UK	Corporate	Governance	Code.	We	have	nothing	to	report	arising	from	our	review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report 
Under	International	Standards	on	Auditing	(UK	and	Ireland),	we	are	required	to	report	to	you	if,	in	our	opinion,	information	in	the	
annual	report	is:
•	 materially	inconsistent	with	the	information	in	the	audited	financial	statements;	or
•	 apparently	materially	incorrect	based	on,	or	materially	inconsistent	with,	our	knowledge	of	the	Group	acquired	in	the	course	of	
performing	our	audit;	or
•	 otherwise	misleading.
In	particular,	we	are	required	to	consider	whether	we	have	identified	any	inconsistencies	between	our	knowledge	acquired	during	
the	audit	and	the	directors’	statement	that	they	consider	the	annual	report	is	fair,	balanced	and	understandable	and	whether	the	
annual	report	appropriately	discloses	those	matters	that	we	communicated	to	the	Audit	Committee	which	we	consider	should	have	
been	disclosed.	We	confirm	that	we	have	not	identified	any	such	inconsistencies	or	misleading	statements.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As	explained	more	fully	in	the	Directors’	Responsibilities	Statement,	the	directors	are	responsible	for	the	preparation	of	the	financial	
statements	and	for	being	satisfied	that	they	give	a	true	and	fair	view.	Our	responsibility	is	to	audit	and	express	an	opinion	on	the	
financial	statements	in	accordance	with	applicable	law	and	International	Standards	on	Auditing	(UK	and	Ireland).	Those	standards	
require	us	to	comply	with	the	Auditing	Practices	Board’s	Ethical	Standards	for	Auditors.	We	also	comply	with	International	Standard	
on	Quality	Control	1	(UK	and	Ireland).	Our	audit	methodology	and	tools	aim	to	ensure	that	our	quality	control	procedures	are	
effective,	understood	and	applied.	Our	quality	controls	and	systems	include	our	dedicated	professional	standards	review	team	and	
independent	partner	reviews.
This	report	is	made	solely	to	the	Company’s	members,	as	a	body,	in	accordance	with	Chapter	3	of	Part	16	of	the	Companies	Act	
2006.	Our	audit	work	has	been	undertaken	so	that	we	might	state	to	the	Company’s	members	those	matters	we	are	required	to	
state	to	them	in	an	auditor’s	report	and	for	no	other	purpose.	To	the	fullest	extent	permitted	by	law,	we	do	not	accept	or	assume	
responsibility	to	anyone	other	than	the	Company	and	the	Company’s	members	as	a	body,	for	our	audit	work,	for	this	report,	or	for	
the	opinions	we	have	formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An	audit	involves	obtaining	evidence	about	the	amounts	and	disclosures	in	the	financial	statements	sufficient	to	give	reasonable	
assurance	that	the	financial	statements	are	free	from	material	misstatement,	whether	caused	by	fraud	or	error.	This	includes	an	
assessment	of:	whether	the	accounting	policies	are	appropriate	to	the	Group’s	and	the	parent	company’s	circumstances	and	
have	been	consistently	applied	and	adequately	disclosed;	the	reasonableness	of	significant	accounting	estimates	made	by	the	
directors;	and	the	overall	presentation	of	the	financial	statements.	In	addition,	we	read	all	the	financial	and	non-financial	information	
in	the	annual	report	to	identify	material	inconsistencies	with	the	audited	financial	statements	and	to	identify	any	information	that	is	
apparently	materially	incorrect	based	on,	or	materially	inconsistent	with,	the	knowledge	acquired	by	us	in	the	course	of	performing	
the	audit.	If	we	become	aware	of	any	apparent	material	misstatements	or	inconsistencies	we	consider	the	implications	for	our	
report.

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 December 2014
1 Significant accounting policies
General information
Capital	&	Regional	plc	is	a	Company	domiciled	and	incorporated	in	the	United	Kingdom	under	the	Companies	Act	2006.	The	
address	of	the	registered	office	is	52	Grosvenor	Gardens,	London,	SW1W	0AU.	The	nature	of	the	Group’s	operations	and	its	
principal	activities	are	disclosed	in	note	2a	and	in	the	Operating	and	Financial	Reviews.
Basis of accounting
The	financial	statements	comprise	the	consolidated	income	statement,	the	consolidated	statement	of	comprehensive	income,	the	
consolidated	balance	sheet,	the	consolidated	statement	of	changes	in	equity,	the	consolidated	cash	flow	statement	and	notes	1	to	
32.	They	are	prepared	on	the	historical	cost	basis	except	for	the	revaluation	of	certain	properties	and	financial	instruments	that	are	
measured	at	revalued	amounts	or	fair	values	at	the	end	of	the	reporting	year,	as	explained	in	the	accounting	policies	below.	Other	
than	as	noted	in	the	‘Accounting	developments	and	changes’	section	below,	the	accounting	policies	have	been	applied	consistently	
to	the	results,	other	gains	and	losses,	assets,	liabilities,	income	and	expenses.
Fair	value	is	the	price	that	would	be	received	to	sell	an	asset	or	paid	to	transfer	a	liability	in	an	orderly	transaction	between	market	
participants	at	the	measurement	date,	regardless	of	whether	that	price	is	directly	observable	or	estimated	using	another	valuation	
technique.	In	estimating	the	fair	value	of	an	asset	or	liability,	the	Group	takes	into	account	the	characteristics	of	the	asset	or	liability	
if	market	participants	would	take	those	characteristics	into	account	when	pricing	the	asset	or	liability	at	the	measurement	date.	
Fair	value	for	measurement	and/or	disclosure	purposes	in	these	financial	statements	is	determined	on	such	basis,	except	for	share	
based	payments	that	are	within	the	scope	of	IFRS	2,	leasing	transactions	that	are	within	the	scope	of	IAS	17,	and	measurements	
that	have	some	similarities	to	fair	value	but	are	not	fair	value,	such	as	net	realisable	value	in	IAS	2	or	value	in	use	in	IAS	36.
In	addition,	for	financial	reporting	purposes,	fair	value	measurements	are	categorised	into	Level	1,	2	or	3	based	on	the	degree	to	
which	the	inputs	to	the	fair	value	measurements	are	observable	and	the	significance	of	the	inputs	to	the	fair	value	measurement	in	
its	entirety,	which	are	described	as	follows:
•	 Level	1	inputs	are	quoted	prices	(unadjusted)	in	active	markets	for	identical	assets	or	liabilities
•	 Level	2	inputs	are	inputs	other	than	quoted	prices	included	within	Level	1,	that	are	observable	for	the	asset	or	liability,	either	
directly	(i.e.	as	prices)	or	indirectly	(i.e.	derived	from	prices)
•	 Level	3	inputs	are	unobservable	inputs	for	the	asset	or	liability.
The	financial	statements	are	presented	in	pounds	sterling	because	that	is	the	currency	of	the	primary	economic	environment	in	
which	the	Group	operates.	Foreign	operations	are	included	in	accordance	with	the	accounting	policies	set	out	below.
Statement of compliance
The	consolidated	financial	statements	have	been	prepared	in	accordance	with	International	Financial	Reporting	Standards	(IFRSs)	as	
adopted	by	the	European	Union	(EU)	and	therefore	the	Group	financial	statements	comply	with	Article	4	of	the	EU	IAS	Regulation.	
Accounting developments and changes
The	accounting	policies	are	consistent	with	those	applied	in	the	year	ended	30	December	2013,	as	amended	to	reflect	the	adoption	
of	the	new	Standards,	Amendments	to	Standards	and	Interpretations	which	are	mandatory	for	the	year	ended	30	December	2014.
The	following	accounting	standards	or	interpretations	were	adopted	for	the	year	ended	30	December	2014	but	have	not	had	a	
material	impact	on	the	Group:
•	 IAS	1	(amendment)	‘Presentation	of	Financial	Statements’

Going concern
The	Group	prepares	cash	flow	and	covenant	compliance	forecasts	to	demonstrate	that	it	has	adequate	resources	available	to	
continue	in	operation	for	the	foreseeable	future,	being	at	least	12	months	from	the	date	of	this	report.	In	these	forecasts	the	
directors	specifically	consider	anticipated	future	market	conditions	and	the	Group’s	principal	risks	and	uncertainties.	The	directors	
believe	that	the	Group	and	the	Company	have	adequate	resources	to	continue	in	operational	existence	for	the	foreseeable	future	
and	accordingly	continue	to	adopt	the	going	concern	basis	in	preparing	the	annual	report	and	financial	statements.	
Further	detail	is	contained	within	the	Financial	Review.	The	Group’s	borrowing	facilities	and	its	financial	risk	management	objectives;	
details	of	its	financial	instruments	and	hedging	activities;	and	its	exposure	to	credit	risk	and	liquidity	risks	are	provided	in	notes	17	
and	18	of	the	financial	statements.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The	preparation	of	financial	statements	requires	the	directors	to	make	judgements,	estimates	and	assumptions	that	may	affect	the	
application	of	accounting	policies	and	the	reported	amounts	of	assets	and	liabilities,	income	and	expenses.	
The	following	are	the	critical	judgements	that	the	directors	have	made	in	the	process	of	applying	the	Group’s	accounting	policies	
and	that	have	the	most	significant	effect	on	the	amounts	recognised	in	the	financial	statements:
Property valuation
Reliance	upon	the	work	undertaken	at	30	December	2014	by	independent	professional	qualified	valuers,	as	disclosed	in	note	10c,	
in	assessing	the	fair	value	of	certain	of	the	Group’s	investment	properties.	
Derivative financial instruments
Reliance	upon	the	work	undertaken	at	30	December	2014	by	independent	third	party	experts	in	assessing	the	fair	values	of	the	
Group’s	derivative	financial	instruments,	which	are	disclosed	in	notes	13	and	18f. 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 5

Lease classification
Consideration	of	the	potential	transfer	of	risks	and	rewards	of	ownership	in	accordance	with	IAS	17	Leases	for	all	properties	leased	
to	tenants.	The	directors	have	determined	that	all	such	leases	are	operating	leases.
Performance fees
Consideration	of	the	amounts	liable	and/or	receivable	under	Performance	Fee	or	other	similar	incentive	arrangements.	See	note	31	
for	further	details.
Taxation
An	assessment	of	the	likelihood	that	potential	historic	tax	liabilities	will	arise	as	well	as	the	impact	of	changes	in	recent	legislation,	
case	law	and	accounting	standards,	along	with	future	projections	for	the	Group,	in	determining	the	current	and	deferred	tax	assets,	
liabilities	and	charge	to	the	income	statement,	as	disclosed	in	note	8.
Compliance with Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) taxation regime
Immediately	after	the	year	end	the	Group	converted	to	a	group	REIT	on	31	December	2014.	As	a	result,	the	Group	will	no	longer	
pay	UK	corporation	tax	on	the	profits	and	gains	from	qualifying	rental	business	in	the	UK	provided	it	meets	certain	conditions	(these	
are	summarised	in	note	8).	A	judgement	is	therefore	required	that	the	Group	will	continue	to	meet	the	qualifying	conditions.
Basis of consolidation
The	consolidated	financial	statements	incorporate	the	financial	statements	of	the	Company	at	30	December.	Control	is	achieved	
where	the	Company	has	the	power	to	govern	the	financial	and	operating	policies	of	an	investee	entity	so	as	to	obtain	benefits	from	
its	activities.
The	Mall	Fund	has	been	consolidated	from	14	July	2014	being	the	date	upon	which	the	Group	completed	the	acquisition	of	a	
controlling	stake	(see	note	25	for	further	details).	Up	until	that	date	it	was	accounted	for	as	an	Associate.	The	results	of	subsidiaries	
acquired	or	disposed	of	during	the	year	are	included	in	the	consolidated	income	statement	from	the	effective	date	of	acquisition	
or	up	to	the	effective	date	of	disposal.	The	reporting	year	for	subsidiaries	and	affiliates	ends	on	31	December	and	their	financial	
statements	are	consolidated	from	this	date.	All	intra-group	transactions,	balances,	income	and	expenses	are	eliminated	on	
consolidation.
Business combinations
Acquisitions	of	subsidiaries	and	businesses	are	accounted	for	using	the	acquisition	method.	The	consideration	for	each	acquisition	
is	measured	at	the	aggregate	at	the	date	of	exchange	of	the	fair	values	of	assets	acquired,	liabilities	incurred	or	assumed,	and	equity	
instruments	issued	by	the	Group	in	exchange	for	control	of	the	acquiree.	Acquisition-related	costs	are	recognised	in	the	income	
statement	as	incurred.	Where	a	business	combination	is	achieved	in	stages,	the	Group’s	previously-held	interests	in	the	acquired	
entity	are	remeasured	to	fair	value	at	the	acquisition	date	(i.e.	the	date	the	Group	attains	control)	and	the	resulting	gain	or	loss,	if	any,	
is	recognised	in	the	income	statement.
If	the	initial	accounting	for	a	business	combination	is	incomplete	by	the	end	of	the	reporting	year	in	which	the	combination	occurs,	
the	Group	reports	provisional	amounts	for	the	items	for	which	the	accounting	is	incomplete.	Those	provisional	amounts	are	adjusted	
during	the	remeasurement	period	or	additional	assets	or	liabilities	are	recognised	to	reflect	new	information	obtained	about	facts	
and	circumstances	that	existed	as	of	the	acquisition	date	that,	if	known,	would	have	affected	the	amounts	recognised	as	of	that	
date.	The	measurement	period	is	the	period	from	the	date	of	acquisition	to	the	date	the	Group	obtains	complete	information	and	is	
subject	to	a	maximum	of	one	year.
Assets held for sale
Assets	held	for	sale	are	measured	at	the	lower	of	carrying	amount	and	realisable	value	with	associated	costs	of	sale	shown	
separately	as	liabilities.	Assets	are	classified	as	held	for	sale	if	their	carrying	amount	will	be	recovered	through	a	sale	transaction	
rather	than	through	continuing	use.	This	condition	is	regarded	as	met	only	when	the	sale	is	highly	probable	and	the	asset	is	available	
for	immediate	sale	in	its	present	condition.	Management	must	be	committed	to	the	sale	which	should	be	expected	to	qualify	for	
recognition	as	a	completed	sale	within	one	year	of	the	date	of	classification.
The	Group	considers	all	of	its	assets	held	for	sale	to	fall	within	‘Level	2’,	as	defined	in	note	1. 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 5

Investments in associates and joint ventures 
A	joint	venture	is	an	entity	over	which	the	Group	has	joint	control,	which	is	the	contractually	agreed	sharing	of	control	over	an	
economic	activity	which	exists	when	the	strategic	financial	and	operating	decisions	relating	to	the	activity	require	the	unanimous	
consent	of	the	parties	sharing	control.	An	associate	is	an	entity	over	which	the	Group	has	significant	influence	and	that	is	neither	
a	subsidiary	nor	an	interest	in	a	joint	venture.	Significant	influence	is	the	power	to	participate	in	the	financial	and	operating	policy	
decisions	of	the	investee	but	is	not	control	or	joint	control	over	those	policies.
In	accordance	with	IAS	28	Investments	in	Associates	and	IAS	31	Interests	in	Joint	Ventures,	associates	and	joint	ventures	are	
accounted	for	under	the	equity	method,	whereby	the	consolidated	balance	sheet	and	income	statement	incorporate	the	Group’s	
share	of	net	assets	and	profits	or	losses	after	tax.	The	profits	or	losses	include	revaluation	movements	on	investment	properties.	
Losses	of	an	associate	or	joint	venture	in	excess	of	the	Group’s	interest	in	that	associate	or	joint	venture	(which	includes	any	long-
term	interests	that,	in	substance,	form	part	of	the	Group’s	net	investment	in	the	associate	or	joint	venture)	are	recognised	only	to	the	
extent	that	the	Group	has	incurred	legal	or	constructive	obligations	or	made	payments	on	behalf	of	the	associate	or	joint	venture.
Any	excess	of	the	cost	of	acquisition	over	the	Group’s	share	of	the	net	fair	value	of	the	identifiable	assets,	liabilities	and	contingent	
liabilities	of	an	associate	recognised	at	the	date	of	acquisition	is	recognised	as	goodwill.	The	goodwill	is	included	within	the	carrying	
amount	of	the	associate	and	is	assessed	for	impairment	as	part	of	that	investment.	Any	excess	of	the	Group’s	share	of	the	net	fair	
value	of	the	identifiable	assets,	liabilities	and	contingent	liabilities	of	the	associate	over	the	cost	of	acquisition,	after	reassessment,	is	
recognised	immediately	in	the	income	statement.
The	reporting	year	for	associates	and	joint	ventures	ends	on	31	December	and	their	financial	statements	are	equity	accounted	
to	this	date.	In	accordance	with	IAS	39	Financial	Instruments:	Recognition	and	Measurement,	associates	and	joint	ventures	are	
reviewed	at	the	end	of	the	reporting	year	to	determine	whether	any	impairment	loss	should	be	recognised.
Goodwill
Goodwill	arising	in	a	business	combination	is	recognised	as	an	asset	at	the	date	that	control	is	acquired	and	is	measured	as	the	
excess	of	the	sum	of	consideration	transferred,	the	amount	of	any	non-controlling	interest	in	the	acquiree	and	the	fair	value	of	any	
equity	interest	in	the	entity	already	held	by	the	acquirer	over	the	net	of	the	acquisition	date	amounts	of	identifiable	assets	acquired	
and	liabilities	assumed.	
Goodwill	is	not	amortised	but	is	reviewed	for	impairment	at	least	annually.	The	impairment	is	calculated	on	the	value	in	use	of	the	
goodwill	and	is	recognised	immediately	in	the	income	statement	and	not	subsequently	reversed.	
Negative	goodwill	arising	on	an	acquisition	is	recognised	directly	in	the	income	statement.
Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions	in	foreign	currencies	are	translated	into	sterling	at	exchange	rates	approximating	to	the	exchange	rate	ruling	at	the	
date	of	the	transaction.	Monetary	assets	and	liabilities	denominated	in	foreign	currencies	at	the	balance	sheet	date	are	translated	
to	sterling	at	the	exchange	rate	ruling	at	that	date	and,	unless	they	relate	to	the	hedging	of	the	net	investment	in	foreign	operations,	
differences	arising	on	translation	are	recognised	in	the	income	statement.
Financial statements of foreign operations
The	assets	and	liabilities	of	foreign	operations,	including	goodwill	and	fair	value	adjustments	arising	on	consolidation,	are	translated	
into	sterling	at	the	exchange	rates	ruling	at	the	balance	sheet	date.	The	operating	income	and	expenses	of	foreign	operations	are	
translated	into	sterling	at	the	average	exchange	rates	for	the	year.	Significant	transactions,	such	as	property	sales,	are	translated	
at	the	foreign	exchange	rate	ruling	at	the	date	of	each	transaction.	The	principal	exchange	rate	used	to	translate	foreign	currency	
denominated	amounts	in	the	balance	sheet	is	the	rate	at	the	end	of	the	year:	£1	=	€1.2783	(2013:	£1	=	€1.1995).	The	principal	
exchange	rate	used	for	the	income	statement	is	the	average	rate	for	the	year:	£1	=	€1.2402	(2013:	£1	=	€1.1775).
Net investment in foreign operations
Exchange	differences	arising	from	the	translation	of	the	net	investment	in	foreign	operations	are	taken	to	the	foreign	currency	reserve	
and	the	effective	portions	of	related	foreign	currency	hedges	are	taken	to	the	net	investment	hedging	reserve.	The	net	investment	in	
foreign	operations	includes	the	equity	of	the	underlying	entities	and	the	portion	of	shareholder	loans	to	those	entities	that	is	treated	
as	equity	where	there	is	no	intention	of	repayment	in	the	foreseeable	future.	All	exchange	differences	previously	accumulated	in	
equity	are	transferred	to	the	income	statement	upon	disposal	or,	where	control	is	lost,	part-disposal	of	the	foreign	operation. 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 5

Plant and equipment
Plant	and	equipment	is	stated	at	the	lower	of	cost	or	valuation,	net	of	depreciation	and	any	provision	for	impairment.	Depreciation	
is	provided	on	all	tangible	fixed	assets,	other	than	investment	properties	and	land,	on	a	straight-line	basis	over	their	expected	useful	
lives:
•	 Leasehold	improvements	–	over	the	term	of	the	lease
•	 Fixtures	and	fittings	–	over	three	to	five	years
•	 Motor	vehicles	–	over	four	years
Property portfolio
Investment properties
Investment	properties	are	properties	owned	or	leased	under	finance	leases	which	are	held	either	for	long-term	rental	income	or	for	
capital	appreciation	or	both.	Investment	property	is	initially	recognised	at	cost	(including	directly	related	transaction	costs)	and	is	
revalued	at	the	balance	sheet	date	to	fair	value,	being	the	market	value	determined	by	professionally	qualified	external	or	director	
valuers,	with	changes	in	fair	value	being	included	in	the	income	statement.	Valuations	are	generally	carried	out	twice	a	year.	In	
accordance	with	IAS	40	Investment	Property,	no	depreciation	is	provided	in	respect	of	investment	properties.
Leasehold properties
Leasehold	properties	that	are	leased	to	tenants	under	operating	leases	are	classified	as	investment	properties	or	development	
properties,	as	appropriate,	and	included	in	the	balance	sheet	at	fair	value.
Refurbishment expenditure
Refurbishment	expenditure	in	respect	of	major	works	is	capitalised.	Renovation	and	refurbishment	expenditure	of	a	revenue	nature	
is	expensed	as	incurred.
Property transactions
Acquisitions	and	disposals	are	accounted	for	at	the	date	of	legal	completion.	Investment	properties	are	reclassified	as	held	for	sale	
once	contracts	have	been	exchanged	and	are	transferred	between	categories	at	the	estimated	market	value	on	the	transfer	date.	
Properties	held	for	sale	are	shown	at	fair	value	less	costs	of	disposal.
Trading properties
Properties	held	with	the	intention	of	disposal	are	valued	at	the	lower	of	cost	and	net	realisable	value.	Any	impairment	in	the	value	of	
trading	properties	is	shown	within	the	cost	of	sales	line	in	the	income	statement.
Leases
Leases	are	classified	as	finance	leases	whenever	the	terms	of	the	lease	transfer	substantially	all	the	risks	and	rewards	of	ownership	
to	the	lessee.	All	other	leases	are	classified	as	operating	leases.
The Group as lessor
Rental	income	from	operating	leases	is	recognised	on	a	straight-line	basis	over	the	term	of	the	relevant	lease.	Initial	direct	costs	
incurred	in	negotiating	and	arranging	an	operating	lease	are	added	to	the	carrying	amount	of	the	leased	asset	and	recognised	on	a	
straight-line	basis	over	the	lease	term.	Incentives	and	costs	associated	with	entering	into	tenant	leases	are	amortised	on	a	straight-
line	basis	over	the	term	of	the	lease.
The Group as lessee
Assets	held	under	finance	leases	are	recognised	as	assets	at	their	fair	value	or,	if	lower,	at	the	present	value	of	the	minimum	lease	
payments,	each	determined	at	the	inception	of	the	lease.	The	corresponding	liability	to	the	lessor	is	included	in	the	balance	sheet	as	
a	finance	lease	obligation.
Lease	payments	are	apportioned	between	finance	expenses	and	reduction	of	the	lease	obligation	so	as	to	achieve	a	constant	
rate	of	interest	on	the	remaining	balance	of	the	liability.	Finance	expenses	are	recognised	immediately	in	profit	or	loss,	unless	they	
are	directly	attributable	to	qualifying	assets,	in	which	case	they	are	capitalised	in	accordance	with	the	Group’s	general	policy	on	
borrowing	costs.	Contingent	rentals	are	recognised	as	expenses	in	the	years	in	which	they	are	incurred. 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 5

Leases continued
Head leases
Where	an	investment	property	is	held	under	a	head	lease,	the	head	lease	is	initially	recognised	as	an	asset	at	the	present	value	of	
the	minimum	ground	rent	payable	under	the	lease.	The	corresponding	rent	liability	to	the	leaseholder	is	included	in	the	balance	sheet	
as	a	finance	lease	obligation.
Fixed asset investments
Fixed	asset	investments	are	stated	at	cost,	together	with	subsequent	capital	contributions,	less	provisions	for	any	impairment	in	
value.
Financial instruments
Financial	assets	and	financial	liabilities	are	recognised	in	the	Group’s	balance	sheet	when	the	Group	becomes	party	to	the	
contractual	provisions	of	the	instrument.
Financial assets
Financial	assets	are	classified	into	the	following	specified	categories:	financial	assets	‘at	fair	value	through	profit	or	loss’	(FVTPL),	
‘held	to	maturity’	investments,	‘available	for	sale’	financial	assets	and	‘loans	and	receivables’.	The	classification	depends	on	the	
nature	and	purpose	of	the	financial	assets	and	is	determined	at	the	time	of	initial	recognition.
Effective interest rate method
The	effective	interest	rate	method	is	a	method	of	calculating	the	amortised	cost	of	a	debt	instrument	and	of	allocating	the	interest	
income	over	the	relevant	period.	The	effective	interest	rate	is	the	rate	that	exactly	discounts	estimated	future	cash	receipts	(including	
all	fees	and	points	paid	or	received	that	form	an	integral	part	of	the	effective	interest	rate,	transaction	costs	and	other	premiums	or	
discounts)	through	the	expected	life	of	the	debt	instrument,	or,	where	appropriate,	a	shorter	period,	to	the	net	carrying	amount	in	
initial	recognition.
Loans and receivables
Loans	and	other	receivables	that	have	fixed	or	determinable	payments	that	are	not	quoted	in	an	active	market	are	classified	as	
‘loans	and	receivables’.	Loans	and	receivables	are	measured	at	amortised	cost	using	the	effective	interest	method,	less	any	
impairment.	Interest	income	is	recognised	by	applying	the	effective	interest	rate,	except	for	short	term	receivables	when	the	
recognition	of	interest	would	be	immaterial.
Trade receivables
Trade	receivables	are	carried	at	the	original	invoice	amount	less	allowances	made	for	doubtful	accounts.	An	allowance	for	doubtful	
accounts	is	recorded	for	the	difference	between	the	carrying	value	and	the	recoverable	amount	where	there	is	objective	evidence	
that	the	Group	will	not	be	able	to	collect	all	amounts	due.	Discounts	and	similar	allowances	are	recorded	on	an	accrual	basis	
consistent	with	the	recognition	of	the	related	sales,	using	estimates	based	on	existing	contractual	obligations,	historical	trends	
and	the	Group’s	experience.	Long-term	accounts	receivable	are	discounted	to	take	into	account	the	time	value	of	money,	where	
material.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash	and	cash	equivalents	include	cash	on	hand	and	demand	deposits	and	other	short-term	highly	liquid	investments	that	are	
readily	convertible	to	a	known	amount	of	cash	and	are	subject	to	an	insignificant	risk	of	changes	in	value.	
Financial liabilities
Financial	liabilities	are	classified	as	either	financial	liabilities	‘at	FVTPL’	or	‘other	financial	liabilities’.
Borrowings
Borrowings	are	initially	measured	at	fair	value,	net	of	transaction	costs.	Borrowings	are	subsequently	measured	at	amortised	cost	
using	the	effective	interest	method,	with	interest	expense	recognised	on	an	effective	yield	basis.	In	accordance	with	IAS	39	Financial	
Instruments:	Recognition	and	Measurement,	a	substantial	modification	of	the	terms	of	an	existing	borrowing	is	accounted	for	as	an	
extinguishment	of	the	original	liability	and	the	recognition	of	a	new	liability.	Where	the	terms	of	the	modification	are	not	substantially	
different,	any	costs	paid	in	connection	with	the	modification	are	treated	as	an	adjustment	to	the	carrying	amount	of	the	liability	and	
are	amortised	over	the	remaining	life	of	the	modified	liability. 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 5

Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives	are	initially	recognised	at	fair	value	at	the	date	a	derivative	contract	is	entered	into	and	are	subsequently	remeasured	to	
their	fair	value	at	each	balance	sheet	date.	The	fair	value	of	forward	foreign	exchange	contracts	is	calculated	by	reference	to	spot	
and	forward	exchange	rates	at	the	balance	sheet	date.	The	fair	value	of	interest	rate	swaps	is	calculated	by	reference	to	appropriate	
forecasts	of	yield	curves	between	the	balance	sheet	date	and	the	maturity	of	the	instrument.	Changes	in	fair	value	are	included	
as	finance	income	or	finance	costs	in	the	income	statement,	except	for	gains	or	losses	on	the	portion	of	an	instrument	that	is	an	
effective	hedge	of	the	net	investment	in	a	foreign	operation,	which	are	recognised	in	the	net	investment	hedging	reserve.	Derivative	
financial	instruments	are	classified	as	non-current	when	they	have	a	maturity	of	more	than	twelve	months	and	are	not	intended	to	be	
settled	within	one	year.	
Trade payables 
Trade	payables	are	carried	at	fair	value,	with	any	gains	or	losses	arising	on	remeasurement	recognised	in	the	income	statement.
Taxation
Income	tax	on	the	profit	for	the	year	comprises	current	and	deferred	tax.	Current	tax	is	the	tax	payable	on	the	taxable	income	for	
the	year	and	any	adjustment	in	respect	of	previous	years.	Deferred	tax	is	provided	in	full	using	the	balance	sheet	liability	method	on	
temporary	differences	between	the	carrying	amounts	of	assets	and	liabilities	for	financial	reporting	purposes	and	the	amounts	used	
for	taxation	purposes.	Deferred	tax	is	determined	using	tax	rates	that	have	been	enacted	or	substantively	enacted	by	the	reporting	
date	and	are	expected	to	apply	when	the	asset	is	realised	or	the	liability	is	settled.
No	provision	is	made	for	temporary	differences	(i)	arising	on	the	initial	recognition	of	assets	or	liabilities,	other	than	on	a	business	
combination,	that	affect	neither	accounting	nor	taxable	profit	and	(ii)	relating	to	investments	in	subsidiaries	to	the	extent	that	they	will	
not	reverse	in	the	foreseeable	future.
Employee benefits
Pension costs
Pension	liabilities,	all	of	which	relate	to	defined	contribution	schemes,	are	charged	to	the	income	statement	as	incurred.
Share-based payments 
The	Group	has	applied	the	arrangements	of	IFRS	2	Share-based	Payment.	Equity	settled	share-based	payments	are	measured	at	
fair	value	at	the	date	of	grant.	The	fair	values	of	the	LTIP	and	the	SAYE	scheme	are	calculated	using	Monte	Carlo	simulations	or	the	
Black-Scholes	model	as	appropriate.	The	fair	values	are	dependent	on	factors	including	the	exercise	price,	expected	volatility,	period	
to	exercise	and	risk	free	interest	rate.	Market	related	performance	conditions	are	reflected	in	the	fair	values	at	the	date	of	grant	and	
are	expensed	on	a	straight-line	basis	over	the	vesting	period.	Non-market	related	performance	conditions	are	not	reflected	in	the	
fair	values	at	the	date	of	grant.	At	each	reporting	date,	the	Group	estimates	the	number	of	shares	likely	to	vest	under	non-market	
related	performance	conditions	so	that	the	cumulative	expense	will	ultimately	reflect	the	number	of	shares	that	do	vest.	Where	
awards	are	cancelled,	including	when	an	employee	ceases	to	pay	contributions	into	the	SAYE	scheme,	the	remaining	fair	value	is	
expensed	immediately.
Own shares
Own	shares	held	by	the	Group	are	shown	as	a	deduction	from	shareholders’	funds	and	included	in	other	reserves.	The	cost	of	own	
shares	is	transferred	to	retained	earnings	when	shares	in	the	underlying	incentive	schemes	vest.	The	shares	are	held	in	an	Employee	
Share	Ownership	Trust.
Revenue 
The	Group	recognises	revenue	on	an	accruals	basis,	when	the	amount	of	revenue	can	be	reliably	measured	and	it	is	probable	that	
future	economic	benefits	will	flow	to	the	Group.
Gross rental income
Gross	rental	income	is	rental	income	adjusted	for	tenant	incentives,	recognised	on	a	straight-line	basis	over	the	term	of	the	
underlying	lease.
Ancillary income
Ancillary	income	comprises	rent	and	other	income	from	short	term	tenancies	of	mobile	units,	car	park	income	and	other	sundry	
income	and	is	recognised	over	the	period	of	the	lettings	and	contracts.
Service charge
Service	charge	income	represents	recharges	of	the	running	costs	of	the	shopping	centres	made	to	tenants. 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 5

Management fees
Management	fees	are	recognised,	in	line	with	the	property	management	contracts,	in	the	year	to	which	they	relate.	They	include	
income	in	relation	to	services	provided	by	CRPM	to	associates	and	joint	ventures	for	asset	and	property	management,	project	co-
ordination,	procurement,	and	management	of	service	charges	and	directly	recoverable	expenses.	
Dividend and interest income
Dividend	income	from	investments	is	recognised	when	the	shareholders’	right	to	receive	payment	has	been	established.	Interest	
income	is	accrued	on	a	time	basis,	by	reference	to	the	principal	outstanding	and	at	the	effective	interest	rate	applicable,	which	is	the	
rate	that	exactly	discounts	estimated	future	cash	receipts	through	the	expected	life	of	the	financial	asset	to	that	asset’s	net	carrying	
amount.	
Performance fees
Performance	fees	are	recognised	as	revenue	by	the	Group	or	the	relevant	associate	or	joint	venture	when	both	the	amount	of	
performance	fee	and	the	stage	of	completion	of	the	relevant	performance	conditions	can	be	measured	reliably,	and	when	it	is	
probable	that	the	performance	fee	will	be	received.	
Provisions	for	performance	fees	payable	by	the	underlying	subsidiary,	associate	or	joint	venture	are	made	when	there	is	a	present	
obligation	to	settle	the	performance	fee,	its	amount	can	be	measured	reliably	and	it	is	probable	that	it	will	be	paid.	Further	disclosure	
on	performance	fees	is	included	in	note	31.
Finance costs
All	borrowing	costs	are	recognised	under	finance	costs	in	the	income	statement	in	the	year	in	which	they	are	incurred.	Finance	costs	
also	include	the	amortisation	of	loan	issue	costs,	any	loss	in	the	value	of	the	Group’s	wholly-owned	interest	rate	swaps	and	any	loss	
in	the	ineffective	portion	of	the	Group’s	hedge	of	its	net	investment	in	a	foreign	operation.
Operating segments
The	Group’s	results	for	the	year	from	its	Germany	segment	have	been	classified	as	Discontinued	Operations	with	the	prior	year	
comparatives	restated	following	its	reclassification	as	held	for	sale	at	24	December	2014	and	its	subsequent	disposal.	The	results	of	
Discontinued	Operations	in	the	prior	year	also	include	the	Group’s	share	of	results	from	its	Leisure	segment	consisting	of	its	interests	
in	Great	Northern	Warehouse	and	Hemel	Hempstead.	See	note	26	for	further	details.
Following	the	acquisition	of	a	controlling	stake	in	The	Mall	and	the	disposal	of	the	Group’s	interest	in	Garigal	Asset	Management	
GmbH	the	significant	majority	of	Property	Management	income	is	now	generated	intra	Group	and	as	such	it	has	been	concluded	
that	maintaining	it	as	a	distinct	operating	segment	is	no	longer	appropriate.	The	results	are	therefore	now	presented	together	with	
what	was	previously	‘Group	items’	as	‘Group/Central’.	This	reflects	the	manner	in	which	management	account	information	is	
presented	to	the	Board.	The	results	for	the	year	ended	30	December	2013	in	note	2a	have	been	restated	on	this	basis.	
As	a	result	of	the	above	changes	the	Group’s	remaining	reportable	segments	under	IFRS	8	are	The	Mall,	Other	UK	Shopping	
Centres	consisting	of	The	Waterside	Lincoln	Limited	Partnership	until	its	disposal	and	Kingfisher	Limited	Partnership	(Redditch),	
Snozone	and	Group/Central.	Group/Central	includes	management	fee	income,	Group	overheads	incurred	by	Capital	&	Regional	
Property	Management,	Capital	&	Regional	plc	and	other	subsidiaries	and	the	interest	expense	on	the	Group’s	central	borrowing	
facility.	
The	Mall	and	Other	UK	Shopping	Centres	derive	their	revenue	from	the	rental	of	investment	and	trading	properties.	The	Snozone	
and	Group/Central	segments	derive	their	revenue	from	the	operation	of	indoor	ski	slopes	and	the	management	of	property	funds	or	
schemes	respectively.	The	split	of	revenue	between	these	classifications	satisfies	the	requirement	of	IFRS	8	to	report	revenues	from	
different	products	and	services.	Depreciation	and	charges	in	respect	of	share-based	payments	represent	the	only	significant	non-
cash	expenses.
The	Group’s	interests	in	the	assets,	liabilities	and	profit	or	loss	of	its	associates	and	joint	ventures	are	proportionately	consolidated	
and	are	also	shown	on	a	see-through	basis	as	this	is	how	they	are	reported	to	the	Board	of	directors.	There	are	no	differences	
between	the	measurements	of	the	segments’	assets,	liabilities	and	profit	or	loss	as	they	are	reported	to	the	Board	of	directors	and	
their	presentation	under	the	Group’s	accounting	policies.
Inter-segment	revenue	and	expenses	represent	items	eliminated	on	consolidation	and	are	accounted	for	on	an	arm’s	length	basis.	
Management	fees	and	other	revenue	items	in	the	property	management	segment	are	earned	from	the	asset	business	segments,	
where	they	are	included	under	property	and	void	costs.	Where	these	relate	to	assets	that	are	proportionately	consolidated,	the	
costs	do	not	eliminate	against	the	income	and	have	therefore	not	been	split	out	separately	as	inter-segment	expenses. 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 5

has	been	recognised	in	respect	of	these	losses	due	to	the	unpredictability	of	future	profit	streams	and	other	reasons	which	may	
restrict	the	utilisation	of	the	losses	(2013:	£0.2	million	recognised	in	respect	of	£0.8	million	of	losses).	The	Group	has	unused	capital	
losses	of	£40.6 million	(2013:	£26.4	million)	that	are	available	for	offset	against	future	gains	but	similarly	no	deferred	tax	has	been

8e REIT conversion
Immediately	after	the	year	end	the	Group	converted	to	a	group	REIT	on	31	December	2014.	As	a	result,	the	Group	will	no	longer	
pay	UK	corporation	tax	on	the	profits	and	gains	from	qualifying	rental	business	in	the	UK	provided	it	meets	certain	conditions.	Non-
qualifying	profits	and	gains	of	the	Group	continue	to	be	subject	to	corporation	tax	as	normal.	In	order	to	achieve	and	retain	group	
REIT	status,	several	entrance	tests	had	to	be	met	and	certain	ongoing	criteria	must	be	maintained.	The	main	criteria	are	as	follows:
•	 at	the	start	of	each	accounting	year,	the	value	of	the	assets	of	the	property	rental	business	plus	cash	must	be	at	least	75%	of	the	
total	value	of	the	Group’s	assets;
•	 at	least	75%	of	the	Group’s	total	profits	must	arise	from	the	property	rental	business;	and
•	 at	least	90%	of	the	Group’s	UK	property	rental	profits	as	calculated	under	tax	rules	must	be	distributed.
The	directors	intend	that	the	Group	should	continue	as	a	group	REIT	for	the	foreseeable	future,	with	the	result	that	deferred	tax	is	no	
longer	recognised	on	temporary	differences	relating	to	the	property	rental	business.

External	valuations	at	30	December	2014	were	carried	out	on	all	of	the	gross	property	assets	detailed	in	the	table	above.	The	
Group’s	share	of	the	total	investment	properties	at	fair	value	was	£774.9	million	of	£895.7	million	(2013:	£411.6	million	of	£1,188.2	
million).	
The	valuations	were	carried	out	by	independent	qualified	professional	valuers	from	CBRE	Limited	and	Cushman	&	Wakefield	LLP	in	
accordance	with	RICS	standards.	These	valuers	are	not	connected	with	the	Group	and	their	fees	are	charged	on	a	fixed	basis	that	
is	not	dependent	on	the	outcome	of	the	valuations.	
The	valuations	performed	by	the	independent	valuers	are	reviewed	internally	by	senior	management,	this	includes	discussions	of	
the	assumptions	used	by	the	external	valuers,	as	well	as	a	review	of	the	resulting	valuations.	The	valuers’	opinion	of	fair	value	was	
primarily	derived	using	comparable	recent	market	transactions	on	arm’s	length	terms	and	using	appropriate	valuation	techniques.	
The	Group	considers	all	of	its	investment	properties	to	fall	within	‘Level	3’,	as	defined	in	note	1.	The	table	below	summarises	the	key

Mall Fund debt facility
On	30	May	2014,	the	Mall	Fund	completed	the	refinancing	of	its	CMBS	by	entering	into	a	new	five-year	secured	facility	comprising	
a	£350	million	term	loan	and	additional	£25	million	capital	expenditure	facility.	The	CMBS,	along	with	an	associated	£10.7	million	
interest	rate	swap	liability	triggered	on	repayment,	was	settled	from	a	combination	of	the	new	£350	million	term	loan	and	existing	
cash	resources.	A	further	amendment	was	agreed	on	3	November	2014	to	increase	the	facility	by	£5	million	and	to	convert	the	
undrawn	£25	million	capex	facility	to	a	term	loan.	
The	£380	million	loan,	which	was	fully	drawn	down	at	30	December	2014,	comprises	a	fixed	rate	tranche	of	£233.3	million	with	
interest	fixed	at	1.86%	plus	applicable	margin	and	a	floating	rate	tranche	based	on	3	month	LIBOR	of	£146.7	million.	The	latter	
tranche	has	been	hedged	using	interest	rate	caps	with	a	weighted	average	strike	rate	of	2.65%.	
Costs	of	£6.9	million	were	incurred	in	respect	of	the	refinancings	which	will	be	amortised	over	the	term	of	the	facility.	In	addition,	
costs	of	£0.3	million	were	incurred	which	were	charged	to	the	income	statement	of	the	Mall	Fund.
Group revolving credit facility
In	June	2014,	the	Group	agreed	an	amendment	and	restatement	of	its	existing	revolving	credit	facility	including	the	following	
amendments:
•	 The	revolving	credit	facility	was	increased	to	£50	million	(separated	into	two	tranches,	the	first	£25	million	being	‘Tranche	A’	and	
the	second	£25	million	being	‘Tranche	B’).	
•	 Tranche	B’s	initial	availability	was	dependent	on	it	being	used	for	an	acquisition	that	resulted	in	the	Group	owning	at	least	80%	of	
the	entire	issued	Units	of	the	Mall	Fund.
•	 An	arrangement	fee	of	£625,000	was	payable	on	the	drawdown	of	Tranche	B.
•	 Interest	on	Tranche	A	is	at	a	margin	of	3.2%	per	annum	above	LIBOR	and	Tranche	B	at	a	margin	of	4.2%.	A	non-utilisation	fee	of	
45%	of	the	applicable	margin	is	payable.	
•	 Any	proceeds	of	the	sale	of	any	of	the	properties	held	by	the	Group’s	German	joint	venture	or	any	sale	of	the	Waterside	Shopping	
Centre,	Lincoln	shall	be	used	to	reduce	the	facility	limit	to	a	minimum	of	£20	million	until	31	December	2015.	
•	 Tranche	A	is	available	until	31	July	2016	(but	will	be	reduced	to	£15	million	from	1	January	2016)	and	Tranche	B	until	31

17a Summary of borrowings continued
The	revised	facility	became	effective	on	14	July	2014	when	the	Group	drew	down	a	total	of	£34.6	million	(including	payment	of	the	
£625,000	arrangement	fee)	in	relation	to	its	acquisition	of	62.56%	of	units	in	the	Mall	Fund.	Following	the	disposal	of	the	Waterside	
Shopping	Centre,	Lincoln	the	Group	paid	down	proceeds	of	£14.8	million	which	reduced	the	total	facility	limit	to	£35.2	million.	This	
remained	the	facility	limit	at	30	December	2014	of	which	£23.4	million	was	drawn	at	that	date.
This	facility	is	secured	by	charges	over	the	units	the	Group	holds	in	The	Mall	carried	at	£377.2 million	at	30	December	2014	(2013:	
£100.4	million),	charges	over	certain	holdings	in	and	loans	to	the	German	joint	venture	carried	at	£38.7 million	(2013:	£39.6	million)	
and	guarantees	by	the	Company.	
On	11	February	2015,	following	completion	of	the	sale	of	the	Group’s	German	joint	venture,	the	Group	fully	repaid	the	amount	
drawn	down.	In	line	with	the	revised	terms	detailed	above	the	limit	of	the	facility	reduced	to	£20	million	as	of	that	date.	The	charges	
in	relation	to	the	German	joint	venture	were	released	on	completion.

18 Financial instruments and risk management
18a Overview
Capital risk management
The	Group	manages	its	capital	to	ensure	that	all	entities	in	the	Group	will	be	able	to	continue	as	going	concerns	while	maximising	
the	returns	to	shareholders	through	the	optimisation	of	the	debt	and	equity	balance.	The	overall	strategy	of	reducing	the	Group’s	
levels	of	balance	sheet	and	see-through	debt	remains	unchanged	from	2013.	
The	capital	structure	of	the	Group	consists	of	debt,	which	includes	the	borrowings	disclosed	in	note	17a;	cash	and	cash	equivalents	
as	disclosed	in	note	15;	and	equity	attributable	to	equity	holders	of	the	parent,	comprising	issued	share	capital,	reserves	and	
retained	earnings	as	disclosed	in	the	Statement	of	changes	in	equity.	For	the	purpose	of	calculating	gearing	ratios,	debt	is	defined	
as	long	and	short	term	borrowings	(excluding	derivatives)	excluding	unamortised	issue	costs.	Equity	includes	all	capital	and	reserves	
of	the	Group	attributable	to	equity	holders	of	the	Company.
The	Group	is	not	subject	to	externally	imposed	capital	requirements.	The	Board	reviews	the	capital	structure	and	cost	of	capital	
on	an	annual	basis	but	does	not	set	specific	targets	for	gearing	ratios.	The	risks	associated	with	each	class	of	capital	are	also	
considered	as	part	of	the	risk	reviews	presented	to	the	Audit	Committee	and	the	Board.	The	Group	has	met	its	objectives	for	
managing	capital	during	2014	by	mitigating	the	impact	of	increased	debt	draw	down	at	the	Group	and	within	The	Mall	by	the	
disposal	of	non-core	assets.

Significant accounting policies
Details	of	the	significant	accounting	policies	adopted	in	respect	of	each	class	of	financial	asset,	financial	liability	and	equity	
instrument,	including	the	criteria	for	recognition,	the	basis	of	measurement	and	the	basis	on	which	income	and	expenses	are	
recognised,	are	disclosed	in	the	accounting	policies	in	note	1.
Financial risk management objectives
Exposure	to	credit,	interest	rate	and	currency	risks	arise	in	the	normal	course	of	the	Group’s	business.	The	Group	seeks	to	minimise	
the	effect	of	these	risks	by	using	derivative	financial	instruments	to	manage	exposure	to	fluctuations	in	interest	rates	and	foreign	
currency	exchange	rates.	Such	instruments	are	not	employed	for	speculative	purposes.	The	use	of	any	derivatives	is	approved	by	
the	Board,	which	provides	guidelines	on	the	acceptable	levels	of	interest	rate	risk,	credit	risk,	foreign	exchange	risk	and	liquidity	risk,	
and	the	ranges	of	hedging	required	against	these	risks.
18b Interest rate risk
The	Group	manages	its	interest	rate	risk	through	a	combination	of	fixed	rate	loans	and	interest	rate	derivatives,	typically	interest	rate	
swaps	or	caps.	The	Group’s	objective	in	managing	its	interest	rate	risk	is	to	ensure	that	it	always	maintains	sufficient	headroom	to	
cover	interest	payments	from	anticipated	cash	flows	and	the	directors	regularly	review	the	ratio	of	fixed	to	floating	rate	debt	to	assist	
this	process.	The	Group	does	not	hedge	account	its	interest	rate	derivatives	and	states	them	at	fair	value	with	changes	in	fair	value	
included	in	the	income	statement.

18c Credit risk
The	Group’s	principal	financial	assets	are	loans	to	joint	ventures,	bank	and	cash	balances,	short	term	deposits,	trade	and	other	
receivables	and	investments.	Credit	risk,	being	the	risk	that	a	counterparty	will	default	on	its	contractual	obligations	resulting	in	
financial	loss	to	the	Group,	is	primarily	attributable	to	loans	to	joint	ventures,	and	trade	and	other	receivables,	which	are	principally	
amounts	due	from	associates	and	joint	ventures	and	from	tenants.	As	a	result	there	is	a	concentration	of	credit	risk	arising	from	the	
Group’s	exposure	to	these	associates	and	joint	ventures	but	the	Group	does	not	consider	this	risk	to	be	material	as	it	is	mitigated	by	
the	significant	influence	that	it	is	able	to	exercise	through	its	holdings	and	management	responsibilities	in	relation	to	those	associates	
and	joint	ventures.	Credit	risk	arising	from	tenants	is	mitigated	as	the	Group	monitors	credit	ratings	for	significant	tenants	and	there	
is	an	allowance	for	doubtful	receivables	that	represents	the	estimate	of	potential	losses	in	respect	of	trade	receivables.	
The	credit	risk	on	short	term	deposits	and	derivative	financial	instruments	is	limited	because	the	counterparties	are	banks	with	high	
credit	ratings	assigned	by	international	credit-rating	agencies.	The	Group	is	not	exposed	to	significant	credit	risk	on	its	other	financial	
assets.
18d Currency risk
The	Group	publishes	its	consolidated	financial	statements	in	Sterling	but	has	investments	and	loans	to	its	German	joint	venture	
portfolio	which	have	the	Euro	as	their	functional	currency.	While	these	investments	and	loans	were	reclassified	as	held	for	sale	at	the	
year	end	the	Group	remained	exposed	to	currency	risk	at	30	December	2014	as	the	proceeds	received	on	sale	were	denominated	
in	Euros.	The	Group	therefore	maintained	its	policy	of	hedging	the	currency	risk	due	to	exchange	rate	movements.	
Net investment hedge
At	30	December	2014	the	Group	used	a	forward	foreign	exchange	contract	to	hedge	the	expected	proceeds	due	from	the	sale	of	
the	German	joint	venture.	The	contract	was	for	€50	million	(2013:	€35	million)	at	a	fixed	exchange	rate	of	1.2721 (2013:	1.19254)	
which	hedged	94%	(2013:	65%)	of	the	Group’s	German	investment	until	27	February	2015	(2013:	65%	until	31	December	2014).	
Hedge	accounting	has	not	been	applied	on	the	forward	contract	maturing	on	27	February	2015	but	was	applied	on	the	contract	
the	Group	had	in	place	for	€35	million	which	matured	on	31	December	2014.	In	respect	of	this	only	the	spot	element	of	the	contract	
was	designated	as	the	hedging	instrument,	determined	as	the	undiscounted	difference	between	the	spot	rate	on	the	trade	date	and	
the	spot	rate	on	the	revaluation	date	applied	to	the	notional.	The	unhedged	forward	element	of	the	fair	value	is	determined	as	the	
total	fair	value	less	the	spot	element.	Changes	in	the	forward	element	of	the	fair	value	are	reported	through	the	income	statement	as	
finance	income	or	finance	costs.	During	the	year,	this	change	in	the	unhedged	element	of	the	fair	value	was	a	gain	of	£0.3m	(2013:	
£nil).	During	the	year,	the	ineffective	portion	of	the	hedge	resulted	in	a	credit	of	£0.2	million	(2013:	charge	of	£0.5	million)	to	the	
income	statement.	Both	of	these	amounts	have	been	classified	as	discontinued	operations	as	they	relate	to	the	Group’s	investment	
in	Germany. 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 5

Sensitivity analysis
The	following	table	shows	what	the	Group’s	sensitivity	to	a	10%	strengthening	or	weakening	in	Sterling	against	the	Euro	would	have	
been	at	30	December	2014.	To	calculate	the	impact	on	the	income	statement	for	the	year	the	average	exchange	rate	has	been	
decreased	or	increased	by	10%.	The	translational	effect	on	equity	is	limited	due	to	the	Euro	hedging	in	place.	The	effect	on	equity	is	
calculated	by	decreasing	or	increasing	the	closing	exchange	rate	with	an	adjustment	for	the	movement	in	the	currency	hedge.	It	is	
assumed	that	the	net	investment	hedge	will	be	100%	effective.

18e Liquidity risk
Liquidity	risk	reflects	the	risk	that	the	Group	will	have	insufficient	resources	to	meet	its	financial	liabilities	as	they	fall	due.	The	day-
to-day	operations	of	the	Group	are	largely	funded	through	the	items	included	in	the	breakdown	of	Operating	Profit	included	in	note	
2a.	The	majority	of	income	within	Operating	Profit	is	received	quarterly,	since	the	inflows	and	outflows	from	net	rental	income	and	
net	interest	payable	generally	coincide	with	English	quarter	days,	and	property	management	fees	are	billed	quarterly.	As	a	result,	
the	Group	normally	has	sufficient	funds	to	cover	recurring	administrative	expenses	which	occur	throughout	the	year.	Liquidity	risk	
therefore	arises	principally	from	the	need	to	make	payments	for	non-recurring	items,	such	as	tax	payments	and	the	close	out	of	
derivative	financial	instruments.	
The	Group’s	objective	in	managing	liquidity	risk	is	to	ensure	that	it	has	sufficient	funds	to	meet	all	its	potential	liabilities	as	they	fall	
due,	both	in	normal	market	conditions	and	when	considering	negative	projections	against	expected	outcomes,	so	as	to	avoid	
the	risk	of	incurring	contractual	penalties	or	damaging	the	Group’s	reputation.	The	Group’s	treasury	department	maintains	a	
rolling	eighteen	month	forecast	of	anticipated	recurring	and	non-recurring	cash	flows	under	different	scenarios.	This	is	compared	
to	expected	cash	balances	and	amounts	available	for	drawdown	on	the	Group’s	core	revolving	credit	facility	to	ensure	that	any	
potential	shortfalls	in	funding	are	identified	and	managed.	The	Group’s	primary	means	of	managing	liquidity	risk	is	the	core	revolving	
credit	facility,	expiring	in	July	2016,	which	had	£11.8	million	fully	available	at	30	December	2014	as	disclosed	in	note	17c.	
The	following	table	shows	the	maturity	analysis	of	non-derivative	financial	assets/(liabilities)	at	the	balance	sheet	date	and,	where	
applicable,	their	effective	interest	rates.

difference	between	the	nominal	value	and	the	amount	paid	of	£6.4	million	has	been	transferred	to	retained	earnings.	The	Deferred	
shares	carried	neither	voting	nor	dividend	rights.
20 Share-based payments
The	Group’s	share-based	payments	comprise	the	SAYE	scheme	and	the	2008	LTIP .	Full	details	of	the	schemes	are	disclosed	in	the	
Directors’	remuneration	report.	In	accordance	with	IFRS	2,	the	fair	value	of	equity-settled	share-based	payments	to	employees	is	
determined	at	the	date	of	grant,	calculated	using	either	a	Black-Scholes	option	pricing	model	or	a	Monte	Carlo	simulation.

25 Acquisition of units in the Mall Unit Trust and Capital Raise
On	20	June	2014	the	Group	announced	it	had	entered	into	conditional	agreements	to	acquire	62.56%	of	units	in	the	Mall	Fund	
for	an	initial	gross	cash	consideration	of	£213.1	million	(‘the	Acquisition’)	to	be	funded	by	available	cash	and	debt	funding	and	an	
associated	Firm	Placing	and	Placing	and	Open	Offer	(the	‘Capital	Raise’)	to	raise	gross	proceeds	of	£165	million	by	the	issue	of	
351,063,830	shares	at	47	pence	per	New	Ordinary	Share.	The	Group	expects	to	recover	£0.7	million	of	£7.4	million	that	was	paid	
into	escrow	and	therefore	the	expected	final	consideration	is	£212.4	million.	Shareholder	approval	was	obtained	at	the	General	
Meeting	held	on	9	July	2014	and	the	shares	were	admitted	to	listing	and	the	Acquisition	completed	on	14	July	2014.	
On	completion	of	the	Acquisition	the	Group	owned	91.82%	of	the	Mall	Fund.	At	30	December	2014	following	subsequent	
transactions,	summarised	in	the	Subsequent acquisitions of minority units	section	below,	the	Group	owned	100%.
Details of the Acquisition
Under	the	terms	of	the	Acquisition,	which	constituted	a	reverse	takeover	under	the	Listing	Rules,	the	Group	acquired:
•	 490,300,237	Units	from	Aviva	Life	&	Pensions	UK	and	other	related	holdings	(‘Aviva’),	representing	52.04%	of	the	Mall	Fund,	for	
a	consideration	of	£177.2	million.
•	 99,069,410	units	from	Karoo	Investment	Fund	(‘Karoo’),	representing	10.52%	of	the	Mall	Fund,	for	an	expected	consideration	of	
£35.1	million,	subject	to	final	escrow	adjustment.
•	 The	remaining	50%	of	The	Mall	(General	Partner)	Limited	that	it	did	not	already	own	from	Norwich	Union	(Mall	GP)	for	£77,712.
The	Units	were	acquired	via	Capital	&	Regional	(Europe	Holding	5)	Limited	and	the	interest	in	The	Mall	(General	Partner)	Limited	via	
Capital	&	Regional	(Mall	GP)	Limited,	both	100%	owned	subsidiaries	of	Capital	&	Regional	plc.	The	consideration	paid	was	based	
on	the	Mall	Fund	NAV	per	unit	at	31	March	2014	adjusted	for	interest	rate	swap	liabilities	and	estimated	performance	fees	and	
represented	a	6.7%	Net	Initial	Yield	on	the	underlying	properties.	
The	liability	to	pay	the	performance	fee	was	triggered	on	the	redemption	offer	being	made	to	all	remaining	unit	holders	in	September	
2014	(see	Subsequent acquisitions of minority units	section	below).	The	total	amount	payable	was	£11.8	million	(excl.	VAT),	to	be	
split	equally	between	Aviva	Investor	Global	Services,	the	Fund	Manager,	and	Capital	&	Regional	Property	Management	Limited	
(‘CRPM’),	the	Property	and	Asset	Manager.	The	performance	fee	was	accrued	in	the	Mall	Fund	financial	statements	at	30	December	
2014.	The	entries	relating	to	CRPM	have	been	eliminated	on	consolidation	in	the	Group	financial	statements	for	year	ended	30	
December	2014.	
In	addition	to	the	cash	consideration	payable	Aviva	and	Karoo	will	receive	their	pro-rata	share	of	the	Mall	Fund’s	income	for	
the	period	from	1	April	2014	to	13	July	2014,	being	the	date	immediately	prior	to	completion.	This	will	be	paid	to	them	upon	
distributions	being	made	by	the	Mall	Unit	Trust	at	such	time	as	the	Mall	Unit	Trust	resolves	to	pay	such	distributions.	At	30	
December	2014	an	accrual	of	£3.0	million	has	been	recognised	in	respect	of	this	amount.
Strategic rationale
The	Directors	believe	that	the	Acquisition	marked	a	significant	step	towards	completing	the	Group’s	strategic	objective	of	focusing	
on	its	core	UK	shopping	centre	business	and	positioning	itself	as	the	leading	dominant	community	shopping	centre	owner	in	the	
UK.	The	Board	believes	the	Acquisition	provides	the	Group	with:
•	 control	of	the	underlying	assets	in	its	core	investment,	the	Mall	Fund;
•	 the	ability	to	generate	compelling	returns	from	the	strong	cash	generating	ability	of	its	shopping	centres	and	offer	shareholders	a	
highly	attractive	dividend	yield	relative	to	the	sector;
•	 the	opportunity	to	further	leverage	its	core	strengths	of	managing	or	owning	interests	in	dominant	UK	community	shopping	
centres;
•	 the	ability	to	facilitate	the	delivery	of	attractive	value	and	asset	management	opportunities;
•	 a	more	efficient	capital	structure;	and
•	 a	strong	platform	that	has	enabled	the	Group	to	convert	to	a	REIT	effective	31	December	2014. 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 5

For the year ended 30 December 2014
25 Acquisition of units in the Mall Unit Trust and Capital Raise continued
Capital Raise and funding of the Acquisition
The	gross	proceeds	from	the	Capital	Raise	were	£165	million	(see	note	19).	Total	transaction	costs	were	£7.4	million	of	which	£4.3	
million	specifically	related	to	the	Capital	Raise	and	have	been	deducted	from	Share	Premium.	The	remaining	£3.1	million	has	been	
charged	to	the	income	statement.	
In	addition	to	the	net	proceeds	of	the	Capital	Raise	the	Group	made	a	drawdown	on	its	amended	and	restated	revolving	credit	
facility	of	£34.6	million	(see	note	17a	for	further	details)	and	utilised	existing	cash	resources	for	the	balance	of	funding	required.
Accounting for the Acquisition
Following	the	completion	of	the	Acquisition,	the	Group	owned	91.82%	of	the	Mall	Fund	and	held	three	of	the	six	director	seats	of	
The	Mall	(General	Partner)	Limited.	In	addition	through	the	Group’s	100%	ownership	of	The	Mall	(General	Partner)	Limited	it	was	
(and	is)	able	to	appoint	and	remove	the	independent	directors,	giving	it	the	ability	to	appoint	a	majority	of	The	Mall	(General	Partner)	
Limited’s	Board	and	hence	exercise	control	over	the	Mall	Fund.	The	Group	therefore	consolidated	the	operations	of	The	Mall	from	
14	July	2014.	Prior	to	this	date	the	Group	equity	accounted	for	its	interest	in	the	Mall	Fund	as	an	Associate.
To	determine	the	assets	and	liabilities	acquired	at	the	date	of	completion	the	Group	have	used	the	30	June	2014	balance	sheet	with	
an	adjustment	made	to	deferred	income	to	reflect	the	pro	rata	profits	for	the	period	to	14	July	2014,	the	date	of	the	Acquisition.	This	
is	on	the	basis	that	the	valuation	and	other	balance	sheet	captions	would	not	be	expected	to	significantly	change	during	such	a	
short	period	of	time.	The	following	provides	a	breakdown	of	the	asset	and	liabilities	acquired:

Accounting for the Acquisition continued
The	negative	Goodwill	arises	due	to	the	valuation	driven	increase	in	net	asset	value	of	The	Mall	Fund	at	30	June	2014	compared	to		
31	March	2014,	as	the	acquisition	price	was	calculated	with	reference	to	the	latter.
Subsequent acquisitions of minority interests
In	October	2014	the	Mall	Fund	completed	a	redemption	of	the	units	of	eight	of	the	nine	remaining	unit	holders.	Under	the	terms	of	
this	redemption	the	Fund	acquired	and	then	cancelled	the	outstanding	units	at	a	total	cash	cost	of	£28.2	million.	This	had	the	effect	
of	increasing	the	Group’s	effective	shareholding	in	The	Mall	from	91.82%	to	99.45%.
On	1	December	2014	Capital	&	Regional	(Europe	Holding	5)	Limited,	a	100%	subsidiary	of	Capital	&	Regional	plc,	acquired	the	units	
held	by	the	sole	remaining	minority	unit	holder	for	cash	consideration	of	£2.1	million.
The	impact	of	these	transactions	has	been	reflected	as	a	movement	in	the	statement	of	changes	in	equity.
Following	these	transactions	the	Group	owned	100%	of	The	Mall	Fund	from	1	December	2014.	Subsequent	to	this	date	the	two	
independent	directors	of	The	Mall	(General	Partner)	Limited	resigned	leaving	the	three	Capital	&	Regional	directors	and	the	Chairman	
as	the	four	serving	directors	at	30	December	2014.

The	following	table	summarises	the	amounts	credited	or	charged	to	the	income	statement	in	respect	of	the	acquisitions	of	Mall

accounting	period,	the	Group’s	revenues	for	the	year	would	have	been	£80.8	million	and	profit	before	tax	would	have	been	£89.7

26 Discontinued Operations
German joint venture
On	24	December	2014,	the	Group	announced	the	conditional	exchange	of	contracts	for	the	sale	of	its	50:50	German	joint	venture	
with	a	real	estate	fund	managed	by	Ares	Management,	LP	to	clients	and	funds	under	management	of	Rockspring	Property	
Investment	Managers.	Under	the	terms	of	the	transaction	the	Group	will	retain	for	approximately	five	years	a	5.1%	minority	stake	in	
each	of	the	five	German	portfolios.	
Considering	the	sale	to	be	highly	probable	at	24	December	2014	management	reclassified	the	balances	related	to	the	German	joint	
venture	from	receivables	from	joint	ventures	(£14.2	million)	and	interests	in	joint	ventures	(£27.3	million)	to	assets	held	for	sale	(£39.5	
million),	liabilities	in	respect	of	assets	held	for	sale	(£(0.8)	million)	and	fixed	asset	investments	(£2.7	million	-	in	respect	of	the	minority	
stakes	retained).	The	reclassifications	were	made	at	carrying	value	being	the	lower	of	carrying	amount	and	expected	fair	value	less	
costs	to	sell.
The	transaction	completed	on	10	February	2015.	The	net	proceeds	received	were	€54.6	million,	this	equated	after	costs	to		
£42.1	million	(after	all	costs	and	including	the	benefit	of	the	Group’s	Forward	Contract	which	hedged	€50	million	at	1.2721)	and	
is	expected	to	result	in	a	profit	on	disposal	of	approximately	£0.6	million	to	be	recognised	in	the	year	ending	30	December	2015	
subject	to	any	final	adjustments	arising	out	of	the	completion	accounts	and	before	the	impact	of	hedging	and	foreign	exchange	
reserves	reclassifications.	On	completion,	and	included	within	the	proceeds,	the	Group	entered	into	a	long-term	loan	payable	of	
€3.5	million	(£2.7	million	at	year	end	exchange	rate	of	1.2783)	repayable	after	five	years.	After	completion	a	distribution	of	€1.5	
million	was	made	in	respect	of	the	retained	minority	stakes	(reducing	this	to	approximately	€2.2	million),	this	was	used	to	reduce	the	
outstanding	amount	of	the	loan	to	€2.0	million.
Given	Germany	was	previously	treated	as	a	separate	operating	segment	its	results	have	been	reclassified	as	discontinued	
operations	in	2014	and	the	2013	results	similarly	restated. 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 5

A Accounting policies
Although	the	Group	consolidated	financial	statements	are	prepared	under	IFRS,	the	Company	financial	statements	for	Capital	&	
Regional	plc	presented	in	this	section	are	prepared	under	UK	GAAP .	The	main	accounting	policies	have	been	applied	consistently	in	
the	current	year	and	the	preceding	year.
Investments,	amounts	owed	by	subsidiaries	and	amounts	owed	by	associates	and	joint	ventures	are	stated	at	cost	less	provision	
for	impairment.	Where	there	is	an	indication	that	an	investment	is	impaired,	an	impairment	review	is	carried	out	by	comparing	the	
carrying	value	of	the	investment	against	its	recoverable	amount,	which	is	the	higher	of	its	estimated	value	in	use	and	fair	value.	This	
review	involves	accounting	judgements	about	the	future	cash	flows	from	the	underlying	associates	and	joint	ventures	and,	in	the	
case	of	CRPM,	estimated	asset	management	fee	income	less	estimated	fixed	and	variable	expenses.
Transactions	in	foreign	currencies	are	translated	into	Sterling	at	exchange	rates	approximating	to	the	exchange	rate	ruling	at	the	
date	of	the	transaction.	Monetary	assets	and	liabilities	denominated	in	foreign	currencies	at	the	balance	sheet	date	are	translated	to	
Sterling	at	the	exchange	rate	ruling	at	that	date	and	differences	arising	on	translation	are	recognised	in	the	income	statement.
The	Company’s	related	party	transactions	are	described	in	note	31	to	the	Group	financial	statements.	Except	for	the	Directors,	the

divided	by	the	weighted	average	number	of	shares	in	issue	
during	the	year	excluding	own	shares	held.
