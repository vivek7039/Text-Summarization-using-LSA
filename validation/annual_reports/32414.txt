A GLANCE
Accsys’ operations
Our business consists of the following:
Distribution network and market
The market for Accoya and Tricoya has been estimated as in excess of 2.6 million cubic meters 
annually. Last year we sold 39,790 cubic meters of Accoya and Medite sold 5,806 cubic meters of 
Tricoya panels, representing year growth for the year of 18% and 31% respectively.
61 Accoya distributor, supply and agency agreements in place covering most of Europe, Australia, 
Canada, Chile, China, India, Israel, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, South Africa, parts of the 
Middle-East and South-East Asia and the USA.
Accoya solid wood and Tricoya wood elements, 
which is the feedstock for Tricoya panels, are 
manufactured through the Company’s proprietary 
acetylation wood modification process. These solid 
wood and wood element products exhibit superior 
dimensional stability, durability and other important 
benefits compared with alternative natural, treated 
and modified woods as well as more resource 
intensive man-made materials and panels. 
The Company’s technologies and brands are 
internationally protected by strict confidentiality, 
granted patents, patent applications and trademarks 
as well as being supported by strong sustainability 
certifications. Many have been technically validated 
at full commercial production level and long term 
use, and others are in pilot-scale or are subject to 
independent validation by experts. Our products have 
been certified for use by various building regulations 
around the world.

Our Products
Accoya is the world-leading high 
performance sustainable wood.  
It is stable, durable, resists rot, 
is harder and stronger. It is 
guaranteed for 50 years for use 
above ground and 25 years in 
ground or freshwater; in summary 
its performance is remarkable. 
Accoya has properties that match 
or exceed those of the best tropical 
hardwoods, yet is manufactured from 
sustainable FSC
®
 certified wood. It is the 
only Cradle to Cradle (‘C2C’) certified 
structural building material which has 
achieved the Gold Level Certification 
and Platinum level for Material Health. 
C2C is a design philosophy developed 
by William McDonough and Michael 
Braungart, inspired by the circular 
economy concept.
C2C certification now also results in 
additional credits for leading green 
building certification systems such 
as LEED and BREEAM with Accoya 
specified in many LEED and BREEAM 
projects around the world.
In 2015 Google adopted C2C Material 
Health as one of the certification 
schemes for Portico, Google’s 
healthy building material assessment 
software. Accoya has been certified 
at the highest, Platinum level for C2C 
Material Health and it is now one of 
the most highly rated products in 
Google’s Portico.
Accoya is the material of choice for 
a wide range of demanding outdoor 
applications, from windows and doors, 
decking to cladding, bridges to exterior 
structures and applications that are 
presently only feasible with non–
sustainable or man-made materials.
 www.accoya.com
Tricoya wood elements are used 
in the manufacturing of Tricoya 
panel products. Tricoya is opening 
new markets where wood based 
panels would never have been 
considered before.
Tricoya panels demonstrate 
significantly enhanced durability and 
exceptional dimensional stability which 
allow Tricoya panels to be used in a 
wide variety of applications such as 
window components and door skins, 
façade cladding, wet interiors and 
much much more.
The raw wood material that is used 
for Tricoya production is sourced from 
FSC® certified forests. Production 
will be extremely resource-efficient 
using chips from locally grown pine, 
including the parts of trees which are 
not used to make any other wood-
based product and would otherwise 
be sent to waste streams.
Tricoya is also guaranteed for 50 years 
above ground and 25 years in ground 
or freshwater; its performance and 
properties are outstanding.

OUR 
INVESTMENT 
PROPOSITION
Our products provide a solution 
to an increasing problem facing 
the substantial building materials 
industry. They are natural building 
materials with low maintenance 
and consistent qualities with at 
least the performance properties 
of the highest performing, non-
sustainable man-made materials. 
In addition, they benefit from 
all positive attributes of wood 
(sustainability, strength, beauty) 
without the downfalls (poor 
durability and stability).
As a result, our estimates, based 
upon expert advice and detailed 
market studies, are that in excess of 
2.6 million cubic meters per annum 
of Accoya® and Tricoya® can be 
sold. This would be a small fraction 
of the global solid wood industry. 
This represents a long-term and 
substantial growth opportunity, 
noting last year we sold 39,790 
cubic meters of Accoya.
By significantly enhancing the 
durability and dimensional stability 
of fast growing, abundantly 
available FSC® certified wood 
species, our products provide 
compelling environmental 
advantages over scarce slow 
growing hardwoods, woods 
treated with toxic chemicals, and 
non-renewable carbon-intensive 
materials such as plastics, steel  
and concrete. 
We have obtained numerous 
certifications and accreditations 
including Accoya being Cradle to 
Cradle Gold certified. 
Proprietary and protected 
technologies which chemically 
modify wood through a proprietary 
process. The resulting products 
benefit from exceptional 
dimensional stability, durability  
and many other qualities.
Our products are first in class and 
leading the revolution of modified 
woods in a building industry which 
is starting to recognise and adopt to 
the significant long term benefits of 
such materials.

ARCHITECT CHOOSES 
MEDITE TRICOYA 
EXTREME FOR FLOATING 
HOUSE AND OFFICE-ARK
 
First discovered during an exhibition in London, designer, 
Julius Taminiau, has created a floating house equipped 
with office space using Medite Tricoya Extreme.
The boat covers 100 square metres and consists of two floors 
with the rooftop being half filled with solar panels. 
The floating house idea had to fulfil two key objectives that the 
architect had in mind: ingenuity and sustainability.
The budget for this project was tight and therefore Julius decided 
to rationalise the design and make it as clever as possible. The 
solution was found in a design with a fixed grid basis on the size 
of panel material. The sizes of the rooms, cladding, windows and 
other materials had to match precisely and be well proportioned. 
This reduced the amount of waste material, avoiding unnecessary 
impact on the environment while also reducing costs.
The lay-out of the Medite Tricoya facades follows a tatami grid 
system and is applied in a fish-scale pattern. By emulating 
nature’s time-tested pattern, the architect underlines the 
secondary key principle of sustainability, which played such  
an important role in the design.
As the facade of the floating house will be continuously exposed 
to wet and damp conditions the durable Medite Tricoya Extreme 
was the ideal material to be used for the facades.
The floating house and office were built by Oranje Arkenbouw 
in Hardenber, the Netherlands and Medite Tricoya Extreme was 
supplied by RET in Utrecht.  OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 07

“This has been a transformational year 
for the Group. We have received great 
support from existing and new industry 
and financial partners, including our 
shareholders to increase our manufacturing 
capacity to meet demand from the growing 
markets for Accoya
®
 and Tricoya

.” ACCSYS TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 08
CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
A transformational year
This has been a transformational year for Accsys, with 
capacity expansion agreed for both Accoya® and Tricoya®, 
a total of €82m of new financing secured and a continued 
growth in demand for our products. Partnerships and 
commercial terms with BP, Medite and Rhodia Acetow 
(formerly Solvay Acetow) also endorse Accsys’ patented 
Accoya and Tricoya technology and our prospects for 
the future.
The expanded Group and the Accsys team are now very 
well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that 
we have been nurturing since the Company’s inception. 
I have confidence that the market opportunity remains 
substantial and conclude that the additional capacity, new 
financing and partnerships have put us in a strong position 
to exploit this in the most efficient way possible for the 
benefit of our shareholders.
As a small company the increased workload of negotiating 
and finalising the Tricoya Consortium and expanding our 
Accoya facility in Arnhem fell on a small management 
team. At the same time, our employees were being tasked 
with maximising the output from our existing facilities. They 
were all unwavering in their determination to deliver the 
best result for Accsys. My colleagues and I on the Board 
wish to thank all our employees for the diligence and 
commitment they have shown throughout the year.
Sales growth
10 years have passed since our existing Accoya 
manufacturing facility in Arnhem started operations.  
Since then we have carried out many improvements to  
our process which enabled us to increase capacity from 
the same two chemical reactors. As a result this year, 
we sold 39,790 cubic meters of Accoya, an 18% increase 
compared to last year, and 60% more than was even 
thought possible 10 years ago. Sales by Medite of Tricoya 
panels increased by 32% to 5,806 cubic meters last year.
Sales volumes in the second half of the financial year 
grew by 31% compared to the same period last year. This 
increase was possible following the resolution of the supply 
chain bottleneck issues in the first half of the year which we 
had highlighted in November.
We continue to believe the total market for Accoya and 
Tricoya is in excess of 2.6 million cubic meters per annum, 
based upon detailed market assessments. This figure still 
represents a small fraction of the overall solid wood and 
wood panel industries. 
Additional manufacturing capacity
In March we formed the Tricoya Consortium, with 
agreements to build, operate and fund a new Tricoya 
chip acetylation plant in Hull. This includes €68m of 
comprehensive financing arrangements including debt  
and equity from BP, Medite, BGF and Volantis and debt

from RBS. In addition, these transformational agreements  
have recognised a pre-funding valuation of the Tricoya 
business of €35m with Accsys retaining a 74.6% interest  
in the Tricoya licensing business and a 46% interest in the 
new Tricoya plant.
The plant will have an initial design capacity of 30,000 
metric tonnes and is expected to be operational in the first 
half of 2019. Medite has signed an off-take agreement to 
purchase a minimum of 20% of the capacity in the first 
year, rising to a minimum of 40% after the fourth year 
of commercial production. The plant is expected to be 
EBITDA positive operating at 40% capacity. 
During the year we have also made significant progress 
with the expansion of our Accoya plant in Arnhem, from its 
current capacity of approximately 40,000 cubic meters to 
60,000 cubic meters per annum in the first of a two part 
expansion, with a further 20,000 cubic meters to follow.
The sale and leaseback of the land in Arnhem has been 
completed. Detailed engineering work has progressed and 
continues on site, with the third reactor itself having been 
delivered to site on 8 June 2017. We continue to expect the 
construction to be complete by the end of the calendar 
year 2017, with the benefit of the additional capacity and 
resulting sales growth expected in the financial year ending 
March 2019. 
The fourth reactor will be added at a later date to meet 
demand, increasing capacity to 80,000 cubic meters, 
with the potential to generate in excess of €120m of 
Accoya revenue and Accoya manufacturing EBITDA in 
excess of €30m.
Financial Results
Revenue for the year ended 31 March 2017 increased by 7% 
to €56.5m (2016: €52.8m). Within this total, Accoya wood 
revenue increased by 17% to €50.7m (2016: €43.5m) as a 
result of an 18% increase in sales volume, while licence and 
licensing related income decreased from €5.3m to €1.9m  
as expected, following the receipt of higher one-off fees 
in the prior year, including those from our Accoya licensee 
Rhodia Acetow.
Gross profit margin decreased from 34% to 25% for a 
number of reasons including one-off licensing income in 
the previous year, together with the full year impact of 
discounted prices to Rhodia Acetow, a higher proportion  
of sales to Medite in respect of Tricoya (also at a lower 
sales price) and a small increase in raw material prices. 
Other operating costs (excluding exceptional items) 
remained consistent at €18.5m.
The above resulted in a €3.8m decrease in underlying 
Group EBITDA to €1.2m loss (2016: EBITDA profit of 
€2.4m). Underlying EBITDA improved from €1.6m loss in 
the first half of the year to €0.4m profit in the second half 
as a result of higher licensing income and sales volumes. 
Balance sheet
The increase in the cash balance to €41.2m at 31 March 
2017 (2016: €8.2m) reflects the first part of the funding 
received in respect of the Tricoya Consortium, including 
€18.6m proceeds of Loan Notes issued to BGF and 
Volantis and net €18.3m received in respect of equity in 
the Tricoya subsidiary companies issued to the investors 
in the Tricoya Consortium. 
During the period €2m was drawn down under the Rhodia 
Acetow loan facility and €4.2m was received in respect 
of the sale of the land in Arnhem. €6.2m was invested in 
property plant and equipment including both the Tricoya 
project and Arnhem expansion. The balance was principally 
attributable to the €1.1m EBITDA loss in the period and a 
€1.5m increase in working capital. 
The net cash balance was €20.1 million (2016: €8.2 million). 
The balance excludes €12.4m net proceeds of the Firm 
Placing and Open Offer which was completed after the 
year-end in April 2017. 
Outlook
I believe we have now reached a solid platform for future 
growth, both in respect of our products and intellectual 
property but also in respect of our business model, 
reflecting our ambition to retain a direct interest in 
manufacturing as we continue to grow to maximise returns 
for our shareholders.
By building on our achievements so far we are now well 
positioned to focus on bringing the new manufacturing 
capacity on-line and growing sales and demand for our 
products globally. 
The Firm Placing and Open Offer, which was launched 
successfully and completed in April, with the Open Offer 
having been four times oversubscribed has also put the 
Group in a firm financial position. I am confident that as we 
continue to invest in growth, and as we benefit from the 
additional manufacturing capacity, we will become cash-
flow generative. 
The new financial year has started well, with growth in 
Accoya sales being comparable to growth seen in the 
second half of last year. Sales growth will be temporarily 
restricted for the year as a whole until the new capacity 
becomes available in early 2018 calendar year. Demand for 
Accoya continues to increase and we expect sales to grow 
further thereafter.

OUR 
MARKET
The superior qualities that our technology brings are driving customers to choose  
our materials over established wood and non-wood products giving enormous scope  
to increase our penetration of this vast global market.
Our technology
Accoya® is based upon our proprietary wood 
acetylation technology.
The physical properties of any material are 
determined by its chemical structure. Wood contains 
an abundance of chemical groups called 'free 
hydroxyls'. Free hydroxyl groups absorb and release 
water according to changes in the climatic conditions 
to which the wood is exposed. This is the main reason 
why wood shrinks and swells. It is also believed that 
the digestion of wood by enzymes initiates at the free 
hydroxyl sites – which is one of the principal reasons 
why wood is prone to decay. 
Acetylation effectively changes the free hydroxyls 
within the wood into acetyl groups, which already 
naturally exist in wood at lower levels. This is done by 
reacting the wood with acetic anhydride, which comes 
from acetic acid (commonly known as vinegar when 
in its dilute form). When the free hydroxyl group is 
transformed to an acetyl group, boosting the acetyl 
level, the ability of the wood to absorb water is greatly 
reduced, rendering the wood more dimensionally 
stable and, because it is no longer digestible, 
extremely durable.

  OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 13
Market 
We believe the potential market for Accoya 
and Tricoya® is in excess of 2.6 million cubic 
meters annually.
Last year we sold 39,790 cubic meters of Accoya, 
however the total global solid wood market is 
understood to exceed 400 million cubic meters 
annually and we believe sales in excess of 1 million 
cubic meters annually are ultimately achievable. While 
it may take some time for Accoya to reach its full 
market potential, we are confident that continued 
strong sales growth can be generated. 
Accoya captures the market share in those 
applications which require rot, insect and water 
resistance, i.e. primarily outdoor products. The 
Group is focused on the higher-value end of these 
applications, where the dual qualities of durability 
and dimensional stability offered by Accoya are most 
highly valued.
The majority of our Accoya sales is to a network of 
timber distributors which in turn supply a variety of 
industries, principally for joinery (windows and doors) 
and for decking and cladding. As we expand, we 
expect that new opportunities will also be developed 
as we become able to meet the demands of larger 
scale manufacturers and also as we continue to 
develop our product and its applications.
Tricoya panels’ enhanced performance and moisture 
resistance makes them particularly suited to external 
applications including facades and cladding, soffits 
and eaves, exterior joinery, wet interiors, door 
skins, flooring, signage and marine uses. Tricoya 
displaces alternative more expensive or less easily 
handled products and opens up major new market 
opportunities in the construction sector. 
The global market for Tricoya panel products is 
estimated in excess of 1.6 million cubic meters and 
up to approximately 4.5 million cubic meters per 
annum. This would equate to around 1% of global 
MDF manufacturing capacity. Tricoya panels 
were introduced to the market by Medite in 2012, 
manufactured using chipped Accoya as a production 
solution in the period before the dedicated wood 
chip acetylation plant is built. Sales have increased 
significantly each year since, and total panel sales to 
date exceed 17,200m

OUR  
BUSINESS MODEL
 
 Investment in R&D, People and Partnerships
   
 SUSTAINABILITY
Accoya
®
 and Tricoya
®
 are high performance building solutions which are environmentally friendly over their  
full life cycle. They are made from abundantly available, fast growing, sustainable, renewable resources with 
durability and dimensional stability exceeding the best performing tropical and temperate hardwoods and 
manufactured wood and non-wood panels.
Intellectual property, expertise and innovation
Our IP is protected on different levels and is exploited in 
different ways. We have developed families of patents 
relating to our products and processes which provide 
robust protection and enable us to market to third parties. 
Equally important is know-how and trade secrets covering 
our process, raw materials, equipment and products which 
provide commercial protection and value generation as well 
as a basis for on-going innovation.
Branding
Our brands Accoya
 
wood and Tricoya
 
are registered 
trademarks in over 50 countries worldwide.
Strong branding and trademark protection is vital and has 
enabled our products to generate a significant presence 
in a relatively short time in what is otherwise a fragmented 
market place. We portray that our products are high 
performance, class leading and sustainable while offering 
value for money when considering performance benefits  
and the product lifecycle.
Business partners
Third parties have contributed to our success and help us 
meet our long term strategic targets.
Particular importance is placed upon those which help 
develop our technology, products and their place in the 
market including equipment manufacturers, wood suppliers, 
the acetyls industry, testing and certification bodies as well as 
wood coating,
 
adhesives and other system supply specialists. 
We will continue to work with others to ensure we develop 
larger scale manufacturing capacity.
Our people
Our people are key to our success, with high staff retention 
and a commitment to the future of the Company.
Our focus on R&D, innovation and developing long-
term growth market opportunities to exploit our first 
mover advantage is dependent on our employees. Value 
is generated from know-how; from working with wood 
products, understanding our brand on a global basis, to 
optimising the acetylation process. We develop, motivate and 
retain a committed team with necessary skills to help us meet 
our objectives.
Our wood processing technology is a platform 
with application for use on different solid woods 
and multiple different panel products.
We believe wood acetylation is applicable to 
multiple wood products and species and that we 
have established a platform technology that can 
be developed to generate additional products and 
uses. Different species of wood will enable Accoya 
to be used for new purposes while opening up 
greater supply chain opportunities. Our Tricoya 
process also has the potential to be used for 
particle board manufacture.

OUTCOME
Manufacturing
Accsys’ Accoya plant has been improved and had capacity increased 
through constant process improvements. This has demonstrated our 
process works on an industrial scale and has confirmed the commercial 
viability of Accoya and Tricoya.
The plant returns will be further improved as capacity is improved and 
expanded. In addition it is a centre for carrying out commercial level R&D 
and for evaluating further improvements to our processes.
Working with third parties
Working with third parties provides the greatest prospect for taking 
advantage of a substantial global market opportunity.
Manufacturing our products provides the greatest opportunity 
for generating profit given the value added via our process, 
and manufacturing directly ourselves offers significant long term 
rewards. We will continue to work with appropriate third parties in  
order to achieve our objective of expanding the production footprint 
globally, in particular where such parties have resources or technologies 
which complement our own.
Our ambition to retain a direct interest in manufacturing whilst fully 
exploiting the value of our IP is characterised by our relationship with 
Rhodia Acetow in Europe and in respect of Tricoya, where the new 
consortium builds upon a broader level of experience and capabilities 
in the acetyls and panel industries.
Increasing revenue and returns 
enable continued investment in R&D, 
people and partnerships in order to 
take advantage of the substantial 
opportunity which we believe exists. ACCSYS TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 16

Introduction
I am very pleased to report upon what has been a truly 
transformational year for Accsys which I believe has put 
us in an excellent position to continue to grow and take 
advantage of our unique assets.
The new Tricoya Consortium agreed on 29 March 2017, which 
will lead to the Group’s second commercial acetylation plant, 
marks a major step forward in our objective of establishing 
acetylated wood as the leading modified wood technology in 
the building materials sector.
Our focus on safety remains our top priority and during the 
year we commenced an extensive new safety awareness 
programme involving all of our employees. 
I would like to thank all of our staff for their hard work and 
continued dedication, which has helped make last year a 
truly transformational year. I would also like to welcome 
Martin Robinson, who joined our Senior Management Team 
in April 2017 as Head of Group Operations. I believe his 
wealth of experience from a career at BP will be invaluable 
during our next period of growth.

 sales growth
Total Accoya sales volume for the year ended March 2017 
increased by 18% to 39,790 cubic meters (2016: 33,847 
cubic meters) and total Accoya revenue increased by 17% 
to €50.7m (2016: €43.4m). The smaller increase in revenue 
compared to volume was attributable to the full year 
impact of sales to Rhodia Acetow (formerly Solvay Acetow) 
which are at a discount, reflecting Rhodia Acetow’s 
marketing and sales commitment and responsibility for 
their region. Excluding sales to Medite for Tricoya
®
, sales 
volumes increased by 18% to 31,532 cubic meters 
(2016: 26,789 cubic meters).
The overall increase in sales volume in the year reflects 
the continued increase in demand for our products. 
The strength of demand has reconfirmed the need for 
additional manufacturing capacity and until the additional 
capacity becomes available early next calendar year, we 
are operating at or near capacity utilisation. As a result 
we are seeking to manage demand and our customers’ 
expectations during this challenging period, during which 
we have seen an increase in forward orders. 
The increase in sales, particularly in the second half of the 
year which saw an increase of 31% compared to the same 
period the year before, continues to be very encouraging. 
We expect growth to be effected by the timing of the 
commissioning of the third reactor. We are increasingly 
focused on the longer term market and new opportunities 
expected to result from the increased capacity. We 
also expect to benefit from potential customers gaining 
greater confidence of Accoya’s enduring position in the 
market place.

26,775 2015 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 21
The overall increase in sales is largely due to repeat 
business driven by the joinery industry’s need for 
high performance material, by greater acceptance 
of Accoya in our target markets as well as resulting 
from the direct activities undertaken by our sales and 
marketing teams where our resources are relatively 
limited compared to the overall market opportunity.
UK and Ireland remains our largest region, with sales 
volumes increasing by 24% to 12,021 cubic meters, 
excluding sales to Medite for Tricoya. All of this 
growth has been driven through existing distributors.
 
Over the last few years we have developed a 
successful model of working with these distributors 
to develop marketing campaigns together with 
indirect sales methods such as architect briefings 
and a detailed and on-going campaign to target and 
inform the fragmented joinery market. This success 
has led us to estimate Accoya now represents 
approximately 12% of the UK wooden window market. 
Demand was unaffected by the strengthening of the 
Euro against sterling following the Brexit vote, noting 
also that the weakening of sterling also impacted all 
timber imports. 
We sold 8,531 cubic meters to Rhodia Acetow in the 
financial year, following Rhodia Acetow assuming 
responsibility for their exclusive region in January 
2016. This represented a 17% increase compared to 
sales to customers in the equivalent region in the 
previous year. The increase masks that sales in their 
region decreased immediately following the transition 
and therefore I am very pleased that the transition has 
progressed well since with the deployment of Rhodia 
Acetow’s sales team and I look forward to further 
future growth. As a reminder, Rhodia Acetow agreed 
a five year, 76,000 cubic meter off-take agreement 
effective from January 2016, with the annual minimum 
volumes increasing each calendar year and in total 
representing approximately €100m of Accoya. 
Sales in the Americas increased by 38% to 3,846 cubic 
meters. North America in particular represents the 
largest potential market for Accoya, and I am pleased 
that the changes made to the sales team over the last 
two years has resulted in an increase in momentum 
ahead of the new manufacturing capacity becoming 
available. We will continue to focus on this region 
applying where possible the same successful sales and 
marketing techniques that we have developed in the 
UK market.
 
Sales to the Benelux area increased 10% to 3,682 
cubic meters, however sales in the Netherlands were 
disappointing, recording a decrease compared to the 
prior year. As a result, we have reviewed our approach 
to the Netherlands and have made changes to the 
sales team, launched a new marketing campaign 
and commenced a new approach to the key housing 
association market. As a result, I am confident that 
we will be in a good position to take advantage of the 
additional Accoya manufacturing capacity when it 
becomes available. 
Sales to the Asia-Pacific region decreased by 16% to 
2,812 cubic meters. Within this, sales to customers 
within Diamond Wood’s exclusive region decreased 
by 31% and sales outside of this, including to Japan, 
Australia, New Zealand and India decreased by 7%, 
reflecting several larger projects in the previous 
year, noting that we continue to believe this region 
has the potential for substantial sales growth in the 
longer term.
Sales to customers elsewhere, including Eastern 
Europe and the Middle East remain relatively small 
at this time, however we continue to develop 
relationships with distributors so as to increase 
awareness of Accoya generally, ahead of additional 
capacity becoming available and with a belief that 
many of these regions also represent excellent longer 
term markets. 
Accoya sold to Medite for the manufacture of Medite 
Tricoya increased by 17% to €7.8m (2016: €6.6m). The 
margin for this material continues to be below that 
achieved for the majority of Accoya we sell, reflecting 
our investment in the Tricoya project and that the 
current manufacturing process is in place only until 
the first dedicated Tricoya plant is operational. We 
continue to expect volumes sold to Medite for the 
manufacture of Tricoya panels to increase marginally 
in the new financial year, given temporary capacity 
limitations in Arnhem, noting that sales by Medite 
of Tricoya panels increased by 31% to 5,806 cubic 
meters in the year to 31 March 2017. 
We have 61 Accoya distributor, supply and agency 
agreements in place covering most of Europe, 
Australia, Canada, Chile, China, India, Israel, Mexico, 
Morocco, New Zealand, South Africa, parts of South-
East Asia and Middle-East and the USA.
“ THE OVERALL INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME IN THE YEAR REFLECTS  
THE CONTINUED INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS“ ACCSYS TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 22
Accoya
®
 pricing and margin
The marginally smaller increase in Accoya revenue 
(17%) compared to volume (18%) reflects a full year 
of sales to Rhodia Acetow, who receive a discount 
as a result of its obligations under the committed 
off-take agreement and to reflect the sales and 
marketing expenditure that it incurs directly. This 
was partly off-set by a small increase in prices to UK 
customers earlier in the year. A similar price increase 
to the majority of remaining customers is being 
implemented in the first half of the new financial year.
The Accoya gross margin, excluding licencing income, 
decreased from 27% to 23% as a result of full year 
impact of the Rhodia Acetow discount, the volume of 
lower margin material sold to Medite and the higher 
cost of raw wood. Part of this higher raw wood cost 
was due to an increase in prices from New Zealand 
suppliers and part was attributable to short term 
changes to the product mix used in production 
resulting from supply chain issues, but which enabled 
us to maintain production volumes. 
Expansion of Accoya manufacturing plant
I am very pleased by the progress made in the year 
in respect of our project to expand the production 
capacity of the Arnhem plant from the current levels 
of approximately 40,000 cubic meters per annum 
to 80,000 cubic meters in a two-stage expansion 
programme. We expect to invest approximately €22m 
towards the capital costs of the first stage, which 
includes the installation of a third reactor, increasing 
the capacity to 60,000 cubic meters, together with 
the back-bone infrastructure for a fourth reactor.
Work has progressed well in respect of the first 
stage of the expansion which comprises two key 
phases: the first, which involved the reconfiguring of 
chemical infrastructure stations, has been completed. 
Significant work has also been completed in respect 
of detailed engineering and ground works, and all 
key items of equipment have been ordered. The third 
reactor itself was delivered on 8 June 2017 enabling 
the remainder of the chemical construction work 
to progress. Detailed engineering is now underway 
by the Engineering, Procurement and Construction 
contractor Engie Fabricom with the construction due 
to be completed by the end of 2017 calendar year, 
ahead of a period of commissioning. 
During the year we also completed the sale and 
leaseback of the remaining freehold land in Arnhem 
to Bruil, the same group to which we sold land and 
buildings in 2011. Bruil in turn, have made excellent 
progress in the construction of a significant new 
warehouse and office facilities which will be adjacent 
to the chemical plant and are due to be completed 
in the same timeframe. These facilities, which will 
improve and contribute to better logistics and should 
improve productivity, will be leased to Accsys once 
the expansion is complete. 
The fourth reactor is expected to be added at a 
later date, as demand requires. As this will use the 
same back-bone infrastructure as is currently being 
constructed for the third reactor, it is expected to 
be added at relatively low cost, funded from internal 
resources. 
Tricoya
 
Consortium
Introduction
I was delighted that we announced in March 2017 
the completion of agreements in respect of the 
construction, operation and financing of the world’s 
first dedicated Tricoya® wood chip acetylation plant, 
to be located in Hull. Under the new agreements, 
Accsys owns 74.6% of Tricoya Technologies Limited 
which in turn owns 62% of the Hull plant. 
We have established the Tricoya Consortium to exploit 
Tricoya globally and to fund, build and operate the 
Hull plant. This is expected to have an initial capacity 
of 30,000 metric tonnes of acetylated Tricoya chips 
per annum, enough to produce approximately 40,000 
cubic meters of Tricoya panels. 
Sales of Tricoya to date have been relatively small 
scale for market development and based upon 
Accoya manufactured in Arnhem. The new plant 
will produce acetylated wood chips as feedstock 
for Tricoya panels which will be approximately 35% 
cheaper than the current market seeding production 
from Arnhem.
The total funding requirements for the Tricoya 
project are expected to be approximately €68m. 
Pre-construction engineering work was completed 
in 2016, land clearance of the plot at the Saltend 
Chemicals Park is expected to be shortly completed 
and detailed engineering work has commenced. The 
plant is expected to be completed in early 2019.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S 
REPORT CONTINUED
“ THE HULL PLANT IS EXPECTED TO 
REACH EBITDA BREAKEVEN AT 
APPROXIMATELY 40% OF ITS CAPACITY 
AND TO TAKE APPROXIMATELY FOUR 
YEARS TO REACH FULL CAPACITY 
FOLLOWING COMPLETION." OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23
The Hull plant is expected to reach EBITDA breakeven 
at approximately 40% of its capacity and to take 
approximately four years to reach full capacity 
following completion. The designs and the plot  
allow for expansion at a later date.
Tricoya Consortium structure
The Tricoya Consortium members and funding is 
set out below.
The investment into the Tricoya Consortium has been 
split between two entities, Tricoya Technologies 
Limited (‘TTL ’) and Tricoya Ventures UK Limited 
(‘TVUK’). TVUK will own and operate the Hull plant 
and TTL will continue to exploit all Tricoya related 
intellectual property and benefit from any future 
Tricoya related revenues outside of the Hull plant.
a)  BP has been a key supplier of acetic anhydride, 
the key chemical raw material for acetylation, 
for a number of years. Under the Consortium 
arrangements, they will be the sole supplier to 
the Hull plant from its adjacent acetic anhydride 
production facility under a minimum six year 
supply agreement. 
  BP will invest a total of €20.3m, with BP Chemicals 
investing €13.7m into TVUK aligning its interest 
with the plant it is supplying. BP Ventures, BP’s 
venture capital arm, has invested €6.6m into TTL 
to benefit from the long term Tricoya opportunity. 
b)  Medite, part of the Coillte group, has been working 
with Accsys on Tricoya since 2009 and has been 
successfully selling Tricoya panels since 2012. Sales 
to date exceed 17,200 cubic meters.
  Medite has agreed an off-take agreement which 
includes a minimum obligation to purchase 20% of 
the plant capacity in the first year of production, 
ramping up to 40% after the fourth year of 
production. 
  Medite will invest €11m of equity into the Tricoya 
Consortium, with €7m having been invested 
into TTL in the year and €4m to be invested 
in total into TVUK, aligning its interests with 
the manufacturing and longer term success of 
Tricoya. 
c)  Accsys has contributed all of the Tricoya 
intellectual property and work undertaken 
previously, which has been attributed a pre-money 
value of €35m under the Tricoya Consortium 
arrangements. 
  In addition, Accsys has contributed €18.4m of 
equity into TTL, which was achieved by issuance 
of €18.9m of Loan Notes to the Business  
Growth Fund and Volantis, details of which  
are set out below.
  Together the pre-money value and cash 
investment has resulted in Accsys retaining a 
74.6% equity interest in TTL and therefore Accsys 
has continued to control and fully consolidate TTL, 
and in turn TVUK.
d)  Business Growth Fund (‘BGF’) and Volantis have 
invested a total of €22m as financial investors.
 
  BGF and Volantis have in aggregate subscribed 
for a total of €18.9m of Loan Notes in Accsys 
Technologies PLC (the ‘Loan Notes’). In  
turn, €18.4m of the proceeds, after fees, has  
been invested by Accsys as equity into TTL,  
as described above. The Loan Notes are  
unsecured and with no interest repayments  
due until January 2019.
  In addition BGF and Volantis have invested a total 
of €3.2m directly as equity into TTL.
 
As part of the 
overall financing package (which has been divided 
65%/35% between BGF and Volantis respectively), 
BGF and Volantis have also been granted options 
over 14% of the issued share capital of Accsys.
In addition, the Tricoya Consortium has agreed a six 
year, €17.2m (€15m net) finance facility with The Royal 
Bank of Scotland (‘RBS’). Interest payments due 
under the facility are rolled up until the Hull plant is 
expected to be cash-flow generative.
Global exploitation 
TTL has granted TVUK a sub-licence to 
manufacture Tricoya at the Hull plant and sell the 
same on an exclusive basis in the UK and non-
exclusive basis in certain other countries (the 
‘Production Licence’), but only when customers 
have also first entered into a licence agreement 
with TTL for the use of Tricoya in the production 
and marketing of panels (the ‘User Licence’). 
TTL will therefore receive up-front licence fees and 
ongoing royalties from TVUK under the Production 
Licence as well as royalties under the User Licence 
from third party customers buying Tricoya chips 
from TVUK. 
TTL is expected to agree additional licence 
agreements in the future elsewhere in the world to 
exploit the market which is believed to be in excess of 
1.6 million cubic meters per annum.  ACCSYS TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 24
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S 
REPORT CONTINUED
“ THE NEW FINANCIAL YEAR HAS 
STARTED WELL, WITH ACCOYA
®
 SALES 
GROWTH COMPARABLE TO THE SECOND 
HALF OF THE LAST FINANCIAL YEAR“
Intellectual Property 
We continue to focus on and invest heavily in the 
generation and protection of intellectual property 
relating to the innovation associated with our 
acetylation processes and products to ensure 
ongoing differentiation and competitive advantage 
in the market place. Whilst each new innovation is 
carefully considered, patenting and/or maintaining 
valuable know-how as a trade secret remains 
the typical route through which our innovation 
is protected. 
Accsys has an extensive and growing patent 
portfolio with over 60 granted patents in various 
countries throughout the world and over 170 
pending patent applications across more than 20 
patent families covering all major markets, with 
particular emphasis having recently been placed on 
extending the geographic spread of the Tricoya® 
patent portfolio. Significant R&D resources are 
employed to maximise the scope of our patent 
rights to not only cover the products we and our 
distributors and licensees sell, and the processes by 
which these products are made, but also to prevent 
competitors from commercialising similar products 
and processes.
Management of Company know-how remains an 
essential element of safeguarding our innovation, 
with confidentiality protocols in place to prevent 
unauthorised access to such know-how and to 
place strict contractual obligations on third parties 
collaborating with Accsys. Increasing Company-
wide awareness of the importance of protecting 
and controlling our know-how is a key initiative 
with particular focus on minimising risks when 
collaborating with third parties.
Our well established trademark portfolio continues 
to grow geographically and covers the key distinctive 
brands Accoya, Tricoya and the Trimarque Device 
under which products are marketed, alongside the 
corporate Accsys brand, including transliterations 
in Dutch, Arabic, Chinese and Japanese. All of our 
key brands have now been registered in over 50 
countries, and have become valuable household 
names in the timber and panel industries.
Accsys continues to maintain an active watch on the 
commercial and IP activity of third parties to monitor 
and take actions if its IP rights are being infringed, 
to identify potentially valuable third party IP which 
could be exploited via a strategic alliance, in-licence 
or purchase of third party IP and to obtain an early 
insight into third party IP which could potentially 
hinder our proposed commercial activity.
Both the patent and trademark portfolios, together 
with other protected IP, including material under 
copyright and domain names, continue to be 
regularly reviewed to ensure alignment with the 
Company objectives and to confirm obligations to 
licensees are being fulfilled. 
Careful IP management, effected via our qualified in-
house IP manager working in close conjunction with 
our technology, engineering, product development, 
marketing and commercial groups, and supported 
where appropriate by external patent and trademark 
attorneys, ensures our IP portfolio is not only 
maintained and protected, but is grown in a cost 
effective manner, adding value to our manufacturing 
and licensing businesses.  
Outlook
The creation of the Tricoya Consortium and 
expansion of the plant in the Netherlands are both 
substantial and hugely exciting projects for Accsys. 
In total, they will enable the Accsys Group to grow 
significantly over the next few years to meet the 
increasing demand for Tricoya and Accoya, which 
we continue to believe, having undertaken detailed 
market assessments, is in excess of 2.6 million cubic 
meters per annum.
The new financial year has started well, with Accoya 
sales growth comparable to the second half of 
the last financial year, although growth will be 
temporarily constrained as the year progresses now 
that we will be operating at or near our capacity. 
Our immediate focus is therefore on ensuring the 
expansion in Arnhem is completed and in this 
respect, we continue to expect the construction 
to be completed by the end of 2017 calendar year. 
Following a period of commissioning, we expect 
the full benefit of the expansion to be obtained in 
the financial year ending March 2019, with demand 
expected to result in further sales growth.

Manufactured by S.Taylor and Son, Accoya 
was chosen because the joinery company 
had previously specified Accoya to the 
same client who were delighted with its 
appearance and performance. Accoya was 
used for all the framing, doors and fascia, 
plus, Medite Tricoya Extreme was selected 
for the pilasters. Accoya and Medite Tricoya 
Extreme were also selected for their long 
lasting durability and stability, which is ideal 
for the Yorkshire weather. Since creating 
this orangery and circulating photos of the 
finished project, S.Taylor and Son have taken 
orders for two more orangeries and have 
several others in the pipeline.
OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25 ACCSYS TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 26
FOCUS STORY – 
ACCOYA 10 YEARS ON
We were introducing Accoya into a very traditional 
market at a particularly tricky time – a business 
environment where the world was close to financial 
catastrophe and where the construction industry, which 
ultimately provides the demand for our product, was in 
meltdown.
The world’s first Accoya project is now over 10 years old 
and Accoya’s decade of durability has been marked with 
a successful review of the home of architectural designer 
Gordon Atiken, located near Glenrothes in Fife, Scotland.
During the decade, Scotland has experienced a lot of harsh 
weather conditions ranging from rain, sleet and snow and 
even some piercing sunshine, with the north façade being 
particularly exposed. However in the last 10 years, Gordon 
has only maintained the cladding once by cleaning with 
a mild soapy water solution, restoring it to an ‘as new’ 
appearance, a truly remarkable testimony to Accoya’s now 
proven properties.
Following this, we started to supply Accoya for the first 
heavy traffic road-bridge in Sneek, the Netherlands. 
The designers, builders and governmental bodies were 
convinced about Accoya's extraordinary performance and 
they selected it to make this specially designed wooden 
bridge. Another bridge followed and together they were 
the only wooden bridges with such a span for heavy traffic 
use in the world.
This year we celebrate the 10th anniversary of Accoya wood being produced commercially

Demand for Accoya has significantly grown since with 
the addition of new distributors. By working closely 
with our distributors, direct customers and joinery 
companies we are now seeing consumers specifying 
Accoya too.
 
Accoya is repeatedly ordered for a wide variety of 
applications from cladding and decking to windows 
and doors. In the UK, Accoya has seen a positive 
acceptance with joineries, with a market share today 
estimated at 12% of the wooden window market.
North America is currently our fastest growing 
market for Accoya with increased specifications and 
manufacturers adoption of Accoya as the material  
of choice.
The years of testing by the Group before 2007 made 
the start-up of commercial production successful.
 
The worldwide wood industry, particularly in Europe, 
was watching very closely but since then Accoya 
has become the benchmark for wood modification 
globally. Today, even natural wood species are 
benchmarked against Accoya on performance.

Accoya revenue includes €7.8m of sales to Medite for the 
manufacture of Tricoya

, a 18% increase (2016: €6.6m). 
Licence income decreased from €2.8m to €1.6m, where the 
higher revenue in 2016 reflected the new agreements with 
our Accoya licensee Rhodia Acetow in the prior period. 
Other revenue of €4.3m (2016: €6.5m) included €0.3m 
relating to the Sales & Marketing agreement with Rhodia 
Acetow, which was agreed at the same time as the 76,000 
cubic meter off-take agreement. The remainder is largely 
attributable to sales of acetic acid, a by-product from 
the acetylation process. The prior year included €1.3m in 
respect of the expired Global Marketing agreement with 
Rhodia Acetow, with a further €0.9m of income recorded 
in respect of monies received attributable to the Tricoya 
project, neither of which was repeated in the current 
period, as expected.
Gross margin
Gross profit margin reduced from 34% to 25%, as a result 
of lower licence and other revenue as set out above, and an 
increase in cost of sales. The Accoya gross manufacturing 
margin decreased from 27% to 23% as a result of full year 
impact of the Rhodia Acetow discount, the volume of lower 
margin material sold to Medite and the higher cost of raw 
wood. Part of this higher raw wood cost was due to an 
increase in prices from New Zealand suppliers and part was 
attributable to short term changes to the product mix used 
in production resulting from supply chain issues but which 
enabled us to maintain production volumes.

Following the additional capacity from the third 
reactor becoming available but in advance of the 
Hull plant being completed, our percentage gross 
margin will depend on our customer sales mix. 
We continue to expect a gross margin from the 
manufacture of Accoya of 30% to be achievable 
as we benefit from the additional manufacturing 
capacity and improved sales mix.
Other operating costs
Other operating costs (excluding exceptional 
items) reduced by 1% to €18.3m (2016: €18.5m). The 
reduction in operating costs is largely due to foreign 
exchange movements, with a €0.3m decrease in staff 
costs and a further €0.4m decrease in other operating 
costs attributable to foreign exchange resulting from 
the weakening of sterling following the Brexit vote 
in June 2016. This is off-set by increased office and 
facility costs of €0.5m due to the head office move to 
London and increasing costs for our expanding plant 
in Arnhem. In addition, payroll, intellectual property 
(‘IP’) and legal costs increased as a result of higher 
activity levels, including increased Tricoya related 
IP costs in the period. Headcount increased to an 
average of 124 (2016: 121), with staff costs excluding 
the impact of foreign exchange, increasing by 3% to 
€11.3m. This included a share based payment charge 
of €0.9m (2016: €1.0m). 
Exceptional items
An exceptional gain of €0.6m arose on the sale of the 
land in Arnhem for €4.2m, which had a book value 
of €3.6m. The sale to Bruil was subject to a lease 
arrangement. See note 5. 
An exceptional expense of €0.5m also recorded 
in the period, relates to advisory fees for business 
development activities as the Group pursued a one-
off long-term opportunity.
Loss from operations
The loss from operations increased to €3.8m (2016: 
loss of €0.3m) due to the reduction in gross margin 
described above, offset by the decrease in operating 
costs, as explained above. Excluding exceptional 
items, the loss from operations increased to €3.9m 
(2016: €0.3m).
Finance income
Finance income of €2,000 (2016: €10,000) represents 
interest receivable on bank deposits. 
Finance expense
The finance expense of €0.6m (2016: €0.2m) 
includes the interest element arising on the payments 
attributable to the sale and leaseback of part of the 
Group’s land and buildings in Arnhem, together with 
finance charges arising on the London office fit-out 
lease. The balance also includes interest and other 
finance charges relating to the Loan Notes issued in 
the period to Business Growth Fund and Volantis, 
relating to the Tricoya project (€0.3m) (see note 29). 
This also includes any finance charges payable in 
respect of the Group’s working capital facilities.
Research & Development expenditure
€1.8m was incurred on research and development 
activities in the period (2016: €2.0m). €0.2m (2016: 
€0.1m) has been capitalised as an intangible asset (see 
note 16).
Taxation
The net tax charge of €0.7m (2016: €0.4m) primarily 
represents a tax charge arising from manufacturing 
offset by R&D tax credits of €0.2m (2016: €0.2m) 
attributable to activities carried out in the current year.
Dividends
No final dividend is proposed in 2017 (2016 final 
dividend: €Nil). The Board deems it prudent for the 
Company to maintain as strong a balance sheet as 
possible during the current phase of the Company’s 
growth strategy.
 
Earnings per share
Basic and diluted loss per share was €0.05 (2016 basic 
and diluted loss per share was €0.01).  ACCSYS TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 30
Balance sheet
Intangible assets
Intangible asset additions of €0.4m (2016: €1.5m) 
predominantly relate to capitalised internal 
development costs for both Accoya
®
 and Tricoya
®
 
related activities. The prior period included €1.0m 
relating to the Front End Engineering Design package 
for the construction of the world’s first Tricoya plant. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment balance increased 
by €1.4m to €21.7m (2016: increase of €2.8m). The 
increase was due to additions of €4.1m relating to 
the on-going project to expand the Arnhem Accoya 
plant through the addition of the third reactor, 
including €0.6m relating to capitalised internal staff 
costs. A further €1m is attributable to new finance 
lease arrangement (see note 28). €1.4m relates to the 
construction of the Tricoya plant in Hull and €0.5m 
relates to technology improvements and significant 
maintenance items at the Arnhem plant. 
This is off-set by €3.6m relating to the disposal of 
the land in Arnhem to Bruil for proceeds of €4.2m, 
which resulted in an exceptional gain of €0.6m. Bruil 
has also agreed to construct and lease a significant 
new warehouse and office facility which is expected 
to be completed in the new financial year. The total 
depreciation charge in the year of €2.1m relates 
predominantly to the existing Arnhem plant.
Available for sale investments
Accsys Technologies PLC has previously purchased 
a total of 21,666,734 unlisted ordinary shares in 
Diamond Wood China Limited. The historical cost 
of the unlisted shares held at 31 March 2017 is €10m 
(2016: €10m). However, a provision for the impairment 
of the entire balance of €10m continues to be 
recorded as at 31 March 2017 (see note 18). 
Inventory 
The Group had total inventory balances of €11.8m 
(2016: €8.3m). Finished goods consisting of Accoya 
represented €5.3m (2016: €5.8m) and raw materials 
and work in progress, primarily consisting of 
unprocessed lumber, being €6.5m (2016: €2.5m). 
The increase is attributable to the planned increase 
in inventory in light of the bottleneck issues reported 
in the first half of the year, together with the planned 
increase in sales in the new financial year. 
Cash and cash equivalents
The Group had cash of €41.2m at 31 March 2017 (2016: 
€8.2m). The increase in the year is mainly due to 
€19.8m net proceeds from the issue of Loan Notes 
and borrowings (see note 29), €18.3m net proceeds 
from issue of share capital in Tricoya Technologies 
Limited and Tricoya Ventures UK Limited to non-
controlling interests (see note 9) and €4.2m proceeds 
from the sale and leaseback of land in Arnhem as part 
of our plant expansion project.

 CHOSEN 
FOR THE 
RENOVATION 
OF 30 DUTCH 
HOUSING 
ASSOCIATION 
PROPERTIES IN 
AMSTERDAM
The Conrad is a street in the centre of 
Amsterdam which has recently undergone 
a monumental renovation of 30 housing 
association properties. Accoya was selected 
to renovate the windows and doors for each 
of the houses. Known for their high quality 
urban renovation work, Wesselink were 
tasked with carrying out this project.
Accoya was chosen because it is a low 
maintenance material which also offers 
excellent stability.
   ACCSYS TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 32
€0.3m of cash out-flow was attributable to cash-flows 
from operating activities before changes in working 
capital (excluding exceptional items) (2016: €3.5m 
in-flow), as a result of the increase in operating loss to 
€3.9m (excluding exceptional items). 
€0.5m of cash-outflow was attributable to changes 
in working capital (2016: €3.0m out-flow), including 
€3.3m increase in inventories, €2.9m increase 
in trade and other receivables off-set by €5.7m 
increase in trade and other payables. 
€2.6m out-flow in respect of investing activities  
(2016: €4.0m), included €0.4m in respect of 
capitalised development costs (2016: €0.4m) and 
€4.7m in respect of tangible fixed assets (2016: 
€2.6m) including in respect of the expansion of  
plant in Arnhem and initial work for the plant in  
Hull, off-set by €4.2m proceeds from the sale of  
the land in Arnhem.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables have increased to €7.6m 
(2016: €5.6m). Within this, prepayments increased 
from €0.7m to €3.3m, in part due to costs being 
incurred in respect of the Company’s Firm Placing and 
Open Offer which completed in April 2017.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables increased to €12.5m 
(2016: €8.1m). Included within this, trade payables 
increased to €6.6m (2016: €4.7m), due to an increase 
in expenditure on tangible fixed assets for both the 
Accoya
®
 plant in Arnhem, and the Tricoya
®
 plant in 
Hull. In addition accruals increased from €2.1m to 
€4.7m due in part to the costs associated with the 
Company’s capital raise.
Finance lease creditor
The Group has previously entered into a sale and 
leaseback agreement for part of the Arnhem land 
and buildings. The first phase resulted in proceeds 
of €2.2m which has been accounted for as a finance 
lease. At 31 March 2017 there are €1.9m of payments 
committed to over the remaining life of the lease 
(2016: €2.0m) (see note 28). The second part of the 
previous sale and leaseback of the land in Arnhem 
was completed in February 2013 and accounted for  
as an operating lease.
The sale of the remaining plot of land completed 
in August 2016 and under the agreement with the 
purchaser, Bruil, they will construct and then lease 
to Accsys new warehouse and office facilities. The 
construction is not expected to complete until later 
in the new financial year and therefore no lease 
has been recognised in the period.
 
A further lease 
agreement with Bruil was entered into in the period 
relating directly to infrastructure work associated 
with the expansion of the chemical plant. This has 
been accounted for as a finance lease, with a new 
asset and liability of €0.9m being recognised as at 
31 March 2017.
Long Term Borrowing
Amounts payable under loan agreements increased to 
€20.1m (2016: €nil). The Group has entered into loan 
arrangements during the period:
  A €17.2m project finance facility with the Royal 
Bank of Scotland Plc was entered into but 
remained undrawn as at 31 March 2017. The facility 
has been agreed at the Tricoya Consortium level 
and is secured upon the Tricoya plant, with the 
proceeds to be applied to the construction of the 
Tricoya plant and working capital.
  €18.1m net proceeds were received in respect of 
Loan Notes issued by Accsys Technologies PLC 
to Business Growth Fund (‘BGF’) and Volantis. 
The loan notes are unsecured, with interest of 
7-9% payable after two years. The net proceeds 
have been applied by the Group within the Tricoya 
Consortium, enabling Accsys to retain a 74.6% 
interest in TTL.
  €2.0m was drawn down in the period under the 
Rhodia Acetow loan facility, which was entered 
into in the previous period. The loan facility is 
secured upon the Arnhem plant, with interest of 
7.5%, expected to be payable after the expected 
start-up of the third reactor. A further €7.5m of 
the facility remains available and is expected to  
be utilised to fund the remaining cost of the 
third reactor.

REVIEW CONTINUED OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 33
Non-controlling interests
Part of the agreements relating to the formation of the 
Tricoya Consortium on 29 March 2017 included equity 
investment by the consortium members. During 
the period a total of €19.1m of equity was issued by 
TTL and TVUK to BP, Medite, BGF and Volantis. (see 
CEO’s report for further details). This has resulted in 
an increase in the non-controlling interest of €12.6m 
as at 31 March 2017 (2016: €0.1m). The difference 
between the cash received and non-controlling 
interest recorded arises from the Tricoya Consortium 
agreements recognising Accsys’s contribution of IP 
and historical development work, with an implied  
pre-funding valuation of €35m.
 
Capital structure
Details of the issued share capital, together with 
the details of the movements in the Company’s 
issued share capital in the year are included in note 
24. The Company has one class of ordinary shares 
which carry no right to fixed income. Each share 
carries the right to one vote at general meetings of 
the Company. Details of non-controlling interests 
associated with TTL and TVUK are summarised 
above and set out in note 9.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a 
holding nor on the transfer of the Company’s shares, 
which are both governed by the general provisions of 
the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. 
The Directors are not aware of any agreements 
between holders of the Company’s shares that may 
result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or  
on voting rights.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 
15. No person has any special rights of control over 
the Company’s share capital and all issued shares are 
fully paid.
Going concern
The financial statements are prepared on a going 
concern basis, which assumes that the Group will 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future, and at least 12 months from the date these 
financial statements are approved.
As part of the Group’s going concern review, the 
Directors have reviewed the Group’s trading forecasts 
and working capital requirements for the foreseeable 
future, including taking into account the proceeds 
from the Firm Placing and Open offer which was 
successfully completed on 23 April 2017. These 
forecasts indicate that, in order to continue as a going 
concern, the Group is dependent on the achievement 
of certain operating performance measures relating 
to the production and sales of Accoya wood from the 
plant in Arnhem and the collection of ongoing working 
capital items in line with internally agreed budgets.
 
The Directors have considered the internally agreed 
budgets and performance measures and believe that 
appropriate controls and procedures are in place or 
will be in place to make sure that these are met. The 
Directors believe, while some uncertainty inherently 
remains in achieving the budget, in particular in 
relation to market conditions outside of the Group’s 
control, that there are a sufficient number of 
alternative actions and measures that can be taken 
in order to achieve the Group’s medium and long 
term objectives.
Therefore, the Directors believe that the going 
concern basis is the most appropriate on which  
to prepare the financial statements.

Our Corporate Vision
A focus on corporate and social responsibility lies 
at the very core of our business. Our technologies 
not only enable us to manufacture wood products 
that offer ‘best in class’ durability, dimensional 
stability and a wide spectrum of other performance 
and environmental advantages over alternative 
environmentally threatened or compromised 
products, but also provide attractive opportunities 
for our employees, distributors, licensees and other 
stakeholders. We want to ensure that our business 
is not only a commercial success, but also run in 
a responsible fashion as we continue to advance 
technologies for a better world. 
Accsys has already developed and is commercially 
producing Accoya
®
, solid acetylated wood. We have 
developed the process for the production of Tricoya
®
, 
acetylated wood elements used for the production 
of panel products. We are committed to increase the 
use of these products globally through sales from 
our manufacturing facility, and on a substantially 
larger scale by licensing our technologies to other 
companies so that they too can manufacture 
these products. 
Accsys aims to reduce the use of environmentally 
unfriendly building materials and products by the 
utilisation of our propriety technology and the 
introduction of our products around the world. The 
planet continues to consume endangered materials 
like tropical hardwood and non-renewable, high 
emitting building materials such as plastics, concrete 
and metals at an alarming rate. Our acetylated wood 
products offer alternative, sustainable new materials 
that resolve many of the environmental limitations 
that commonly used building materials have, whilst 
not compromising on performance. In fact, Accoya is 
the only building product perfectly fitting in the bio-
cycle of the circular economy while having the same 
performance as typical building products such as 
plastics and metals which cannot be renewed and  
are from the techo-cycle. 
Accsys is also committed to continuing R&D 
concerning our products (applications and new wood 
species) and processes. This ongoing development 
is designed to increase the use, applicability and 
improve the efficiency and environmental benefits 
which in turn will benefit many of our stakeholders.
Our products and the environment 
The main environmental benefit of our Accoya and 
Tricoya acetylated wood products is their use as 
a substitute for other environmentally damaging 
products including chemically treated woods that 
use toxic preservatives, unsustainably sourced 
tropical timbers and materials produced from energy 
intensive or non- renewable resources such as metals 
(for example, steel and aluminium) and plastics  
(such as PVC).
Carbon footprint
During their growth, trees convert carbon dioxide 
(CO
2
) through photosynthesis into cellulose and 
lignin, and emit oxygen in the process. As a result, 
during their lifespan trees act as carbon sinks, as 
CO
2
 is captured from the atmosphere and makes up 
approximately half of the dry weight stored in the 
wood of the tree. The carbon is stored in the living

tree, but will also remain stored once the tree is felled 
and the wood of the tree is used for products such as 
Accoya and Tricoya. As a consequence, CO
2
 is locked 
out of the natural carbon cycle during the lifespan 
of the wood or wood product. Through decay or 
incineration, the carbon will eventually be released 
again into the atmosphere in the form of CO
2
. 
In producing Accoya wood, we improve this carbon 
capture mechanism in two ways. Firstly by using fast 
growing softwood species, such as radiata pine, as 
input for our acetylation process. Per hectare, more 
cubic metres of radiata pine can be grown (20–28m
3
/
ha/year) compared to slower growing wood species 
such as teak (6m
3
/ha/ year) or even most bamboo 
(10m
3
/ha/year). Consequently, a larger amount of 
carbon is sequestered compared to slow growing 
wood species.
Secondly, through the acetylation process the 
dimensional stability and durability (durability class 1 
according to EN standard 350-1) of a wood species 
are improved considerably, lengthening the product 
lifespan. Thus Accoya wood is able to act as a longer 
term carbon sink that needs less additional care, as 
compared to other woods. These unique properties 
allow us to guarantee Accoya wood for 50 years 
above ground and 25 years below ground (please see 
our Certificates of Warranty for full details).

 WOOD 
RESTORES HISTORIC 
WINDOWS IN MINNESOTA 
STATE CAPITOL
 
The majestic State Capitol building in St. Paul, 
Minnesota was in a state of deterioration: on the 
outside the regal marble exterior design, completed 
in 1905, was crumbling.
The state embarked on a $272 million, four-phase restoration plan 
in 2013, with tasks including replacing plumbing and electrical 
systems, boosting energy efficiency, improving access, replacing 
the roof and repairing all of the crumbling stone.
Another major part of the project was restoring the building’s 
original wood windows, which had been covered over with 
aluminium windows 30 years ago. The aging units – 242 in total 
– had seriously suffered from fogging, failing glass, air leakage, 
and broken balances that rendered them inoperable. Window 
replacement manufacturer Re-View, was selected to restore the 
windows and bring the Capitol building back to life. 
Re-View removed the aluminium replacements, revealing the 
original wood window frames, which were then restored using 
restoration epoxies and replicated Accoya wood parts. Re-view 
used an original complete wood window that still remained in the 
building as the basis for the designs and to help replicate all the 
new sashes with Accoya wood. Re-view chose Accoya due to its 
durability and 50 year guarantee.
Since some of the individual double-hung windows are about  
2 meters (6 feet) wide by 4 meters (13 feet) tall, the sashes weigh 
in excess of 115 kilograms (250 pounds). This resulted in the  
Re-view team engineering a system of weights and pulleys to 
make the massive windows easy to open. Many of the Accoya 
installed windows were tested for air and water infiltration by  
an independent testing agency and it was determined that 
they were twice as tight as the published ratings for modern 
replacement windows.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
for the year ended 31 March 2017
The Directors present their report together with the 
audited consolidated financial statements for the year 
ended 31 March 2017.
Results and dividends
The consolidated statement of comprehensive income  
for the year is set out on page 70, and shows the loss for 
the year.
The Directors do not recommend the proposal of a final 
dividend in respect of the current year, consistent with the 
prior year.
Principal activities and review of the business
The principal activities of the Group are the production and 
sale of Accoya
®
 solid wood and Tricoya
®
 wood elements, 
technology and product development as well as the 
licensing of technology for the production and sale of 
Accoya and Tricoya via the Company’s subsidiaries, Titan 
Wood Limited, Titan Wood B.V., Titan Wood Technology 
B.V., Titan Wood Inc., Tricoya Technologies Limited and 
Tricoya Ventures UK Limited (collectively the ‘Group’). 
Manufactured through the Group’s proprietary acetylation 
processes, these products exhibit superior dimensional 
stability and durability compared with alternative natural, 
treated and modified woods as well as more resource 
intensive man-made materials. A review of the business is 
set out in the Chairman’s statement on page 08 and the 
Chief Executive’s report on page 20. Accsys Technologies 
PLC is incorporated in the United Kingdom.
Business model and Strategy
The Business model and Strategy section, from page 14,  
sets out the Company’s strategy, business model and key 
performance indicators.
Financial instruments
Details of the use of financial instruments by the Company 
and its subsidiary undertakings are set out in Note 31 of the 
financial statements.
Share issues 
On 4 July 2016, a total of 673,355 of ¤0.05 Ordinary shares 
were issued to an Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’). 
On 15 August 2016, a total of 63,909 of ¤0.05 Ordinary 
shares were issued and released to employees together 
with 63,909 of ¤0.05 Ordinary shares issued to an 
employee trust on 14 August 2015.
On 9 February 2017, a total of 16,302 of ¤0.05 Ordinary 
shares were issued and released to employees together 
with 16,302 of ¤0.05 Ordinary shares issued to an 
employee trust on 26 January 2016.
A further 20,323,986 ¤0.05 Ordinary shares were 
issued after the year end, on 24 April 2017, following the 
Company successfully completing a Firm Placing and 
Open Offer, raising ¤14m (before fees).
Principal risks and uncertainties
The business, financial condition or results of operations 
of the Group could be adversely affected by any of the 
risks set out below. The Group’s systems of control and 
protection are designed to help manage and control risks to 
an appropriate level rather than to eliminate them.
The Directors consider that the principal risks to achieving 
the Group’s objectives are those set out below.
(a) Economic and market conditions
 The Group’s operations comprise the manufacture of 
Accoya wood and Tricoya wood elements, technology 
and product development and licensing the technology to 
manufacture and sell Accoya and Tricoya wood elements 
to third parties. The cost and availability of key inputs 
affects the profitability of the Group’s own manufacturing 
whilst also impacting the potential profitability of third 
parties interested in licensing the Group’s technology. The 
price of key inputs and security of supply are managed by 
the Group, partly through the development of long term 
contractual supply agreements.
An element of the Group’s strategy for growth envisages 
the Group selling new or existing products and services 
into other countries or into new markets. However, there 
can be no assurance that the Group will successfully 
execute this strategy for growth. The development of a 
mass market for a new product or process is affected by 
many factors, many of which are beyond the control of 
the Group, including the emergence of newer and more 
competitive products or processes and the future price of 
raw materials. If a mass market fails to develop or develops 
more slowly than anticipated, the Group may fail to achieve 
sustainable profitability. 
(b) Regulatory, legislative and reputational risks
 The Group’s operations are subject to extensive regulatory 
requirements, particularly in relation to its manufacturing 
operations and employment policies. Changes in laws and 
regulations and their enforcement may adversely impact 
the Group’s operations in terms of costs, changes to 
business practices and restrictions on activities which could 
damage the Group’s reputation and brand.
(c) Employees
The Group’s success depends on its ability to continue 
to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified 
employees. The highly qualified employees required by 
the Group in various capacities are sometimes in short 
supply in the labour market. There are risks associated 
with operating a chemical plant and accordingly the 
health and safety of our staff is made a priority. We 
continuously seek improvements to exceed industry 
expectations by challenging our methods, improving  
our reporting and continuing to learn. OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 45
(d) Intellectual property
The Group’s strategy of exploiting its technology via manufacturing, partnerships and licensing depends upon 
maintaining effective protection of its intellectual properties worldwide. Protection is afforded by a combination 
of trademarks, patents, confidentiality agreements and the structuring of legal contracts relating to key licensing, 
engineering and supply arrangements. Unauthorised use of the Group’s intellectual property may adversely impact its 
ability to exploit the technology and lead to additional expenditure to enforce legal rights. The wide geographical spread 
of our products increases this risk due to the increasingly varied and complex laws and regulations in which we seek to 
protect the Group’s intellectual property.
Further details of how risks and uncertainties relate to our strategy and performance in the year are shown on page 16.
Greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions
The table below represents all the emission sources required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013 for our manufacturing facility in Arnhem, the Netherlands. 
Notes:
–  We have reported on all the emission sources required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors' 
Reports) Regulations 2013 for our manufacturing facility in Arnhem, the Netherlands.
– Due to unavailability of data, GHG emissions related to our offices and staff travel are not included in the figures above.
–  Emissions have been calculated following the GHG Protocol - Corporate Accounting and Reporting (revised edition) using the 
following databases: IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment Report 
and Eco-Invent v3.3.
–  Note that following Environmental Reporting Guidelines of Defra (2013), carbon offsets may be accounted for separately as a 
‘NET’ figure, while the original electricity consumption figures should be presented as a ‘GROSS’ figure.
–  Following the same (Defra 2013) guidelines, the emissions associated with our supply chain (inputs and outputs) are not 
included in the figures above, for readers that are interested in the supply chain related figures we refer to our publicly 
available carbon footprint report: http://www.accoya.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Verco-Cradle-to-gate-carbon-
footprint-update-2012.pdf and Environmental Product Declaration (EN 15804): https://www.accoya.com/wp-content/
uploads/2015/06/NEPD-376-262-EN-Accsys-Technologies-Accoya-Wood.pdf. 
–  For 2014, following Environmental Reporting Guidelines of Defra (2013), carbon offsets due to e.g. purchase of Renewable 
Energy Credits may be accounted for separately as a ‘NET’ figure, while the original electricity consumption figures are 
presented as a ‘GROSS’ figure.
–  In the current and prior year, Accsys has offset its CO
2
 emissions mainly through investing in verified carbon offset projects 
instead of through Renewable Energy Credits (see external carbon offsets) resulting in an amended presentation as 
recommended under the Defra guidelines.
Further details concerning the environmental impact of our products as a whole are detailed in the Sustainability 
Report, including an assessment of the overall life cycle of Accoya.

Patrick Shanley 
Directors’ indemnities
The Company maintains directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance which gives appropriate cover for legal action 
brought against its Directors.
Employment policies
The Group operates an equal opportunities policy 
from recruitment and selection, through training and 
development, appraisal and promotion to retirement. 
It is our policy to promote an environment free from 
discrimination, harassment and victimisation, where 
everyone will receive equal treatment regardless of 
gender, colour, ethnic or national origin, disability, age, 
marital status or sexual orientation. All decisions relating to 
employment practises will be objective, free from bias and 
based solely upon work criteria and individual merit.
17% of employees in the period were female. 10% of the 
senior management team were female and one of the 
Board of Directors was female. 
Health and safety
Health and safety is the priority at all levels of the Group, 
in particular taking into account the chemical industry 
in which Accsys operates. Group companies have a 
responsibility to ensure that all reasonable precautions 
are taken to provide and maintain working conditions for 
employees and visitors alike, which are safe, healthy and in 
compliance with statutory requirements and appropriate 
codes of practice.
The avoidance of occupational accidents and illnesses is 
given a high priority. Detailed policies and procedures are 
in place to minimise risks and ensure appropriate action is 
understood in the event of an incident. A dedicated health 
and safety officer is retained at the Group’s manufacturing 
facilities in Arnhem and Hull.

By order of the Board
Angus Dodwell  
Company Secretary
19 June 2017  ACCSYS TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 48
I am pleased to present our 2017 Remuneration Report in 
which we have summarised the Company’s remuneration 
policy, described how the policy was implemented in the 
year to 31 March 2017 and how it will be implemented in the 
year ending March 2018 and over the following years.
Year ended 31 March 2017 – Performance and Pay
The year ended 31 March 2017 was a transformational year 
for Accsys, as set out in the Chairman’s statement at the 
beginning of this Annual Report. This included the entry 
into the Tricoya Consortium to build, operate and finance 
the world’s first dedicated wood chip acetylation plant, 
significant progress with the expansion of the Accoya
®
 
plant in Arnhem, together with continued sales growth. 
Remuneration policy considerations for 2017
Last year the Accsys Board undertook a review of 
executive remuneration, using an independent adviser, to 
ensure it reflected market and shareholder expectations. 
One year on, the Board believes the changes made last 
year continue to be appropriate and that the remuneration 
structure and mechanisms should continue. 
The purpose of last year’s review was to put the Company 
on a clear journey to a more conventional remuneration 
framework with the clear focus on continuing to improve 
financial performance.
In particular the changes we made last year to introduce 
more structure to the Annual Bonus opportunity continue 
to provide the Committee with necessary measures to 
incentivise and reward management at a time when the 
Group is undergoing significant growth and change.
In summary, the key features and how these have been 
reflected in the year are set out below, noting that these 
have remained within the approved Remuneration Policy:
• The salaries of Paul Clegg, Chief Executive Officer, 
Hans Pauli, Executive Director, Corporate Development 
and William Rudge, Finance Director other than a 1.5% 
increase applied earlier in the year for all staff, have 
remained unchanged. 
• The annual bonus opportunity was moved to a more 
formal policy, however it has continued to be satisfied 
through a mix of cash and shares: 
 − Absent extraordinary exceptional circumstances, the 
bonus opportunity will operate within a normal cap 
of 100% of salary for each Executive Director (the 
formal cap in the shareholder approved policy of up 
to 200% of salary remains although we would not 
envisage exceeding 100% other than in extraordinary 
exceptional cases). 
 − The awards are anticipated to be wholly satisfied in 
cash following the year-end although the option to 
substitute shares will be retained.
 − Formal claw-back provisions permit recoupment within 
3 years for an act of gross misconduct or if an error in 
the calculation/underlying assumptions is found.
 − For the awards made in summer 2016 in respect of 
performance for the year ended 31 March 2016, the 
bonus was determined by suitably challenging EBITDA 
targets subject to limited Committee discretion to 
adjust for changes in corporate strategy. 
 − For the awards to be made in summer 2017 in 
respect of performance for the year ended 31 
March 2017, the bonus has again been determined 
by suitably challenging targets which included a 
combination of EBITDA, sales growth and progress 
in respect of the Arnhem expansion. In addition, 
the Executive Directors were also eligible for an 
extraordinary exceptional bonus award of up to a 
further 50% of the basic salary, dependent upon 
the successful completion of the Tricoya
®
 project 
within the financial year. Following the Company’s 
announcement of the completion of the project 
on 29 March 2017, this was awarded in full. The 
annual bonus remains subject to limited Committee 
discretion to make adjustments.
• For the Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’), it is intended 
to continue the award structure introduced last year: 
 − Annual awards will be made, the first such award 
having been made in the summer of 2016, with a 
further award to be made in summer 2017, and each 
subsequent year.
 − The award to the CEO will be over shares worth 100% 
of his then prevailing salary and over shares worth  
50% of salary for other Executive Directors.
 − Awards are subject to a 3 year performance period 
(i.e. year end March 2019) and a further 2 year 
holding period.
REMUNERATION REPORT OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 49
 − A malus/claw-back provision was introduced. 
 − Consistent with awards made in summer 2016, 50% 
of the 2017 awards will be subject to a relative TSR 
condition with 25% of that part vesting at median 
and 100% at upper quartile. The precise comparator 
group remains to be finalised but the comparator 
group selected in for the 2016 award was constituent 
companies of the FTSE AIM All Share Index (excluding 
the Resource and Financial Services Sectors).
 − The other 50% will be subject to an EBITDA per share 
target. EBITDA has been selected over the more 
common EPS given the Company’s current focus on 
EBITDA growth. 
Format of the report and context of our policy
The Remuneration Report is prepared under the UK regime 
for the reporting of executive pay which was first adopted 
in 2014 as a result of our quote on AIM in the UK, our cross-
listing on NYSE Euronext in the Netherlands and our UK 
incorporated status which means that we come within the 
definition of a ‘quoted company’ in the UK Companies Act. 
Accordingly, and exceptionally amongst AIM companies, 
we are therefore legally required to comply with regime 
for the reporting and approval of directors’ remuneration 
by UK quoted companies, including a binding vote on the 
directors’ remuneration policy. The policy as set out in the 
2015 Annual Report and Accounts was approved by our 
shareholders at the AGM held on 17 September 2015 and 
reflected an amendment to the section concerning Non-
executive pay.
We have remained committed to pay at appropriate, 
but not excessive, levels and to reflect market practice 
amongst AIM companies.
Over the following pages we have set out:
• Details of the implementation of our reward policy for 
the year ended 31 March 2017, within the Remuneration 
Report.
• The Group’s forward-looking Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy which was approved by shareholders at our 2015 
AGM and is therefore binding. All payments made to 
directors from that time have been consistent with 
this policy.
Our policy, as set out in this report, focuses on our actual 
approach to pay which we believe is in our shareholders’ 
best interests. It includes the required formal caps (which 
we have set at higher levels than we envisage needing and 
which are not in any way an aspiration) but also retains 
appropriate, but limited, flexibility to address changing 
circumstances in the 3-year period in which it is planned to 
operate the policy.
Yours sincerely

3  During the period, 1,704,691 of LTIPs awarded to Executive Directors in 2013 vested with a further 1,175,309 forfeited as a result of 
not all performance targets having been met. The value included in the table represents the market value of the vested shares only 
at the date of vesting. No LTIPs vested in the prior year. None of the vested LTIPs have been exercised. See below for further details.
4  The total figures have also been presented in Pounds Sterling in order to help provide a more relevant comparison between the two 
years as the majority of Directors’ remuneration, including 100% of the CEO’s and FD’s remuneration is denominated in Sterling.
5  Sue Farr was appointed chairman of the Remuneration Committee on 19 November 2015 replacing Nick Meyer.

office from Windsor to London
7 Paul Clegg received cash in lieu of pension from 1 April 2016
REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 51
Bonuses awarded in the form of cash and shares were determined by the Committee having taken into account of a 
broad range of financial and operational performance measures and also taking into account a degree of discretion, 
reflecting the longer term and strategic objectives of the Company. Given the competitive nature of the Company’s 
sector these performance measures have been considered to be commercially sensitive and that comparable AIM 
companies are not subject to equivalent disclosure obligations and accordingly are not disclosed.
Pension entitlements relate to Company contributions to personal pension schemes. The Company does not operate  
any defined benefit pension scheme.

Element C – This element was to vest in full if the share price is at or above ¤1.30 at the end of the performance period. 
This was not met and nil awards vested.
2016 LTIP Award performance conditions
The LTIP plan rules were amended in November 2015 such that awards made in summer 2016 are subject to a 3 year 
performance period (i.e. year end March 2019) and a further 2 year holding period. In addition, awards are also subject to 
malus/claw-back provisions.
Element A (Share price element)
In relation to 50% of award, the performance target will be achieved in relation to:
• 25% for this Element if the share price growth is greater than the median of the comparator group; and
• 100% for this Element if the share price growth is greater than the upper quartile of the comparator group with 
straight-line vesting between these points.
Element B (EBITDA element)
In relation to 50% of award, the performance target will be achieved in relation to:
• 25% for this Element if EBITDA is greater than or equal to ¤0.06 per Share;
• 50% for this Element if EBITDA is greater than or equal to ¤0.08 Share; and
• 100% for this Element if EBITDA is greater than or equal to ¤0.10 Share with straight-line vesting between 
these points.
The comparator group for the purposes of Element A is the constituent companies of the FTSE AIM All Share Index 
(excluding the Resource and Financial Services Sectors) as determined by the Remuneration Committee.

Share Bonus Award – Employee Benefit Trust
On 15 July 2016 in connection with employee remuneration and incentivisation arrangements for the period from 1 April 
2015 to 31 March 2016, 673,355 ¤0.05 new ordinary shares were issued to an Employee Benefit Trust. The beneficiaries of 
these shares included the Executive Directors as set out below, with the awards reflecting the share element awarded as 
part of the overall annual bonus, as set out above.
€0.05 Ordinary Shares
Paul Clegg 75,842
Hans Pauli 52,250
William Rudge 42,576
Such new ordinary shares shall vest if the Directors remain in employment with the Company at the vesting date, being  
1 July 2017 (subject to certain other provisions including regulatory requirements, good-leaver, take-over and nomination 
and remuneration committee discretion provisions). The above shares correspond to the total figure of ¤130,000 
disclosed in the remuneration table for the year ended 31 March 2017 in respect of the share bonus.
Employee Share Participation Plan
Details of the Employee Share Participation Plan (the ‘Plan’) are set out in Note 15. During the year, none of the Directors 
participated in the Plan.
Relative importance of spend on pay
During the year ended 31 March 2017, the total pay for all Group employees increased by 4.5% to ¤8,783,000  
(2016: ¤8,403,000). This compared to a total of nil (2016: ¤nil) in respect of dividends and share buybacks.
Consideration of matters relating to directors’ remuneration
The Nominations and Remuneration Committee consisted of Sue Farr (Chairman), Patrick Shanley, Nick Meyer  
and Sean Christie. All Non- executive directors (including the Chairman on appointment) are considered  
to be independent.
The Committee’s adviser is FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP which was appointed by the Committee in 2011 and which 
the Committee is satisfied remains independent and objective. It provided ¤14,000 (2016: ¤31,000) of services to the 
Committee or the Company more generally during the financial year.

As no formal cap or maximum bonus existed before 2015, no figure has been disclosed setting out this percentage.
2017 is the first financial year in which any share options have vested and therefore no figure has been reported in respect 
of the change compared to the previous financial year. Excluding the vested LTIP, the CEO’s total salary, taxable benefits 
and annual bonus decreased by 30% in the period compared to the prior year (2016 increase: 16%) in Euros, as a result 
of a lower annual bonus. This equated to an 18% decrease in Pounds sterling, being the currency the CEO’s salary is 
denominated in. Excluding Directors, the average Group salary, benefits and bonus increased by 3% (2016: 7%).
Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company’s performance for the past eight years on the London Stock Exchange AIM 
compared with the performance of the FTSE AIM All Share index. The FTSE AIM All Share index has been selected 
for this comparison as it is a broad based index which the Directors believe most closely reflects the performance of 
companies with similar characteristics as the Company’s. A logarithmic scale has been used in order to more clearly set 
out the performance of Accsys’ shares in more recent periods.

Part B: Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy as set out in this section of the Remuneration Report is effective for all payments 
made to Directors from 17 September 2015, being the date of the AGM in which it was approved, and is available on 
the Company’s website within the Annual Report and Accounts. The policy has remained as approved at the 2015 
AGM. To assist the reader, the footnotes have been updated to explain how the policy is expected to be implemented.
Remuneration policy
The Company’s remuneration policy has been designed to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors of the calibre 
required to deliver the business strategy. Individual remuneration packages are structured to align rewards with the 
performance of the Company and the interests of shareholders. The main principles are to:
• ensure that salaries are set at a market competitive level by benchmarking against appropriate  
external comparators,
• support high performance culture by rewarding upper quartile performance with upper quartile reward,
• maintain an appropriate balance between fixed and performance related pay,
• align long-term rewards with shareholders; and
• ensure that the overall package reflects market practice and takes account of remuneration elsewhere in the Group.
Policy Table
Element and purpose Policy and operation Maximum Performance measures
Base salary
This is the core 
element of pay and 
reflects the individual’s 
role and position within 
the Group with some 
adjustment to reflect 
their capability and 
contribution.
Base salaries are reviewed against 
suitable external comparators, 
although the Committee does not 
strictly follow data but uses it as a 
reference point in considering, in 
its judgment, the appropriate level 
of salary having regard to other 
relevant factors including corporate 
and individual performance and any 
changes in an individual’s role and 
responsibilities.
Base salary is paid monthly in cash.
In the normal course of events, the 
executive directors’ salaries would 
not normally be increased by more 
than the average awarded to staff 
generally and, in any event, no 
increase from current salary levels 
would be made that would take an 
executive directors’ salary above a 
limit of ¤400,000 p.a.

Benefits
To provide benefits 
valued by recipient.
Provide market competitive 
benefits in kind. Details of the 
benefits provided are set out in 
the section above. The Committee 
reserves discretion to introduce 
new benefits where it concludes 
that it is in the interests of Accsys 
to do so, having regard to the 
particular circumstances and to 
market practice.
Where appropriate, the Company 
will meet certain costs relating to 
Executive Director relocations.
It is not possible to prescribe the 
likely change in the cost of insured 
benefits or the cost of some of the 
other reported benefits year-to-
year, but the provision of benefits 
will operate within an annual limit of 
20% of an Executive Director’s base 
salary (plus a further 100% in the 
case of relocations).
The Committee will monitor the 
costs in practice and ensure that 
the overall costs do not increase 
by more than the Committee 
considers to be appropriate in all 
the circumstances.

Pension
To provide retirement 
benefits and remain

Accsys contributes to personal

N/A
Annual Bonus Plan
To motivate employees 
and incentivise delivery 
of annual performance 
targets.
Annual bonus levels and the 
appropriateness of measures are 
reviewed annually to ensure they 
continue to support the strategy.
Annual bonus is delivered primarily 
in shares although the Committee 
proposes to pay annual bonuses 
substantially or entirely in cash 
once the business sustains a 
constant and steady level of 
working capital to support the 
Company’s growth strategy.
Shares awarded as bonus vest  
one year after the date of award.
Share awards attract dividends, 
should the Company award 
any dividends.
To date, the annual bonus has 
operated on an uncapped ad hoc 
basis without a formal cap although 
the Committee has, in practice, 
remained within 120%.
To comply with the legislation, a 
cap of 200% of base salary p.a. has 
been introduced but it should be 
particularly noted that this is not 
an aspiration.
The performance 
measures applied 
may be financial or 
non-financial and 
corporate, divisional 
or individual and in 
such proportions 
as the Committee 
considers appropriate.
Attaining the 
threshold level 
of performance 
produces a nil

The Committee 
retains discretion to 
adjust performance 
measures and 
targets during the 
year to take account 
of events outside 
of management 
control which were 
unforeseen when the 
measures and targets 
were originally set. ACCSYS TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 58
Element and purpose Policy and operation Maximum Performance measures
Long-Term Incentives
To motivate and 
incentivise delivery of 
sustained performance 
over the long-term, 
and to promote 
alignment with 
shareholders’ interests, 
the Group operates the 
Accsys Technologies 
2013 Long-Term 
Incentive Plan.
Awards under the LTIP may be 
granted as nil-cost options.
Given the current absence of 
distributable reserves, it may not be 
possible to allot shares as fully paid 
so the Company reserves the right 
to require participants to pay par 
value and, in turn, allot further shares 
at par value which will generate a 
gain equal to the par value on shares 
subject to the award.
Malus provisions apply to 
unvested awards on the discovery 
of deficient performance, or 
alternatively, award cash bonuses 
to the equivalent amount.
Clawback of vested awards apply 
in the event of mis-booking of 
reserves, misstatement of earnings, 
censure by a regulatory authority 
or any other serious damage to 
Company reputation.
Three types of awards can be 
granted:
• Retention based awards, 
not subject to performance 
conditions but subject to 
continued employment for  
3 years
• Performance based awards, 
subject to performance 
conditions
• Exceptional multiplier awards, 
subject to performance 
conditions which require the 
creation of significant value for 
shareholders
The LTIP allows for the grant of 
awards over up to 10% of issued 
share capital over a 10 year period 
(including outstanding awards 
under all other share plans but 
excluding shares issued in respect 
of annual bonus arrangements, 
any options or awards which have 
lapsed and any awards to be 
satisfied by shares purchased by an 
employees’ shares trust).
The Company will apply an internal 
limit such that no Executive Director 
will receive an award under the LTIP 
of more than 300% of base salary in 
any given financial year. In practice, 
the Company had not envisaged 
and continues not to envisage 
awards at even this level.
The Committee expressly reserves 
discretion to make such awards as  
it considers appropriate within 
these limits.
The Committee may 
set such performance 
conditions on LTIP 
awards as it considers 
appropriate (whether 
financial or non- 
financial and whether 
corporate, divisional 
or individual).
Once set, 
performance 
measures and 
targets will generally 
remain unaltered 
unless events 
occur which, in the 
Committee’s opinion, 
make it appropriate 
to substitute, 
vary or waive 
the performance 
conditions in such 
manner as the 
Committee thinks 
fit. Performance 
periods may be over 
such periods as the 
Committee selects  
at grant.
No less than 25% 
of awards vest for 
attaining the threshold 
level of performance 
conditions.
Employee Share Participation Plan
To encourage 
share ownership by 
employees, thereby 
allowing them to 
share in the long-term 
success of the Group 
and align their interests 
with those of the 
shareholders.
Executive Directors are able to 
participate in all-employee share 
plans on the same terms as other 
Group employees.
The Employee Share Participation 
Plan allows for individuals to 
subscribe for shares on two 
occasions during the year up to a 
limit of ¤5,000 per annum.
On each occasion a 1:1 match for 
shares subscribed is offered subject 
to still being employed by the 
Company after one year.
Consistent with 
normal practice, such 
awards are not subject 
to performance 
conditions.

Notes to the policy table
1. Annual bonus performance measures for year ended March 2018
As set out in Part 1, it is intended to operate the annual bonus plan more formally as in the prior year.
• Absent extraordinary exceptional circumstances, the bonus opportunity will operate within a normal cap of 100% of salary for each 
Executive Director (the formal cap in the shareholder approved policy of up to 200% of salary remains although we would not 
envisage exceeding 100% other than in extraordinary exceptional cases).
• The awards are anticipated to be wholly satisfied in cash following the year-end although the option to substitute shares will be retained.
• Formal claw-back provisions exist which permits recoupment within 3 years for an act of gross misconduct or if an error in the 
calculation/underlying assumptions is found.
For the awards to be made in summer 2017 in respect of performance for the year ended 31 March 2017, the bonus has been determined 
by suitably challenging targets which included a combination of EBITDA, sales growth and progress in respect of the Arnhem expansion. 
In addition, the Executive Directors were also eligible for an extraordinary exceptional bonus award of up to a further 50% of the 
basic salary, dependent upon the successful completion of the Tricoya project within the financial year. Following the Company’s 
announcement of the completion of the project on 29 March 2017, this was awarded in full. The annual bonus remains subject to limited 
Committee discretion to make adjustments.
2. Performance conditions for LTIP awards in the year ending March 2018
It is expected that LTIP awards will be made in the summer of 2017 for the reasons set out in the section ‘Remuneration policy 
considerations for 2017’. It is expected that:
• The award to the CEO will be over shares worth 100% of his then prevailing salary and over shares worth 50% of salary for other 
Executive Directors.
• Awards will be subject to a three year performance period (i.e. year end March 2020) and a further 2 year holding period.
• A malus/claw-back provisions will apply.
• 50% of the first awards will be subject to a relative TSR condition with 25% of that part vesting at median and 100% at upper quartile. 
The precise comparator group remains to be finalised but is likely to be a variant of the constituents of FTSE AIM companies.
• The other 50% will be subject to an EBITDA per share target. EBITDA has been selected over the more common EPS given the 
Company focus on EBITDA growth.
3. Differences between the policy on remuneration for Directors from the policy on remuneration of other employees
Where Accsys’ pay policy for Directors differs to its pay policies for groups of employees, this reflects the appropriate market rate 
position for the relevant roles.
4. Stating maximum amounts for the remuneration policy
UK regulations and related investor guidance encourages companies to disclose a cap within which each element of Remuneration 
Policy will operate. Where maximum amounts for elements of remuneration have been set within the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, 
these will operate simply as caps and are not indicative of any aspiration. ACCSYS TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 60
Notes to the policy table continued
5. Travel and hospitality
While the Committee does not consider it to form part of benefits in the normal usage of that term, it has been advised that corporate 
hospitality (whether paid for by the Company or another) and business travel for directors (and exceptionally their families) may 
technically come within the applicable rules and so the Committee expressly reserves the right for the Committee to authorise such 
activities within its agreed policies.
6. Employee Share Participation plan
While the directors have participated in the Employee Share Participation plan in previous years, and it has remained part of the formal 
policy, in practice the Directors do not participate in the plan. The plan was not open for subscription during the year ended March 2017.

The Company’s recruitment remuneration policy aims to give the Committee sufficient flexibility to secure the 
appointment and promotion of high-calibre executives to strengthen the management team and secure the skill sets to 
deliver our strategic aims. However, as an external recruitment has not taken place for a considerable period of time, the 
preparation of this policy is challenging as it provides for an event which has not been the Company’s practice.
In terms of the principles for setting a package 
for a new Executive Director, the starting point 
for the Committee will be to apply the general 
policy for Executive Directors as set out above 
and structure a package in accordance with 
that policy.
Consistent with the new UK regulations, the 
caps contained within the policy for fixed pay 
do not apply to new recruits, although the 
Committee would not envisage exceeding 
these caps in practice.
The annual bonus and long-term incentive 
compensation arrangements will operate 
(including the maximum award levels) as 
detailed in the general policy in relation to any 
newly appointed Executive Director. For an 
internal appointment, any variable pay element 
awarded in respect of the prior role may either 
continue on its original terms or be adjusted to 
reflect the new appointment as appropriate.
For external and internal appointments, the 
Committee may agree that the Company 
will meet certain relocation expenses as it 
considers appropriate.
For external candidates, it may be necessary to make additional 
awards in connection with the recruitment to buy-out awards forfeited 
by the individual on leaving a previous employer.
For the avoidance of doubt, buy-out awards are not subject to a formal 
cap. Any recruitment-related awards which are not buy-outs will be 
subject to the limits for incentive pay as stated in the general policy.
For any buy-outs the Company will not pay more than is, in the view of 
the Committee, necessary and will in all cases seek, in the first instance, 
to deliver any such awards under the terms of the existing incentive pay 
structure. It may, however, be necessary in some cases to make buy-out 
awards on terms that are more bespoke than the existing annual and 
equity-based pay structures. Details of any recruitment-related awards 
will be appropriately disclosed.
All buy-outs, whether under the annual bonus plan, LTIP or otherwise, 
will take account of the service obligations and performance 
requirements for any remuneration relinquished by the individual 
when leaving a previous employer. The Committee will seek to make 
buy-outs subject to what are, in its opinion, comparable requirements 
in respect of, service and performance. However, the Committee may 
choose to relax this requirement in certain cases (such as where the 
service and/or performance requirements are materially completed), 
and where the Committee considers it to be in the interests of 
shareholders, or where such factors are, in the view of the Committee, 
reflected in some other way, such as a significant discount to the face 
value of the awards forfeited.
A new Non-Executive Director would be recruited on the terms explained above in respect of the main policy for such 
Directors.
REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 61
Potential rewards under different scenarios
The charts below show the potential pay-out under the proposed arrangements for each Executive Director under 
different scenarios.
Notes:
1 Fixed pay out reflects basic salaries, benefits in kind and pension allowances in place at the start of the year ending 31 March 2018.
2  The threshold pay-out levels are based upon the actual performance against the targets as measured based upon the results 
for the year ended 31 March 2017 giving rise to 100% award. The maximum is based on a payment of 150%, being the maximum 
target, including a 50% extraordinary exceptional bonus award dependent upon the successful completion of the Tricoya 
project (noting the policy allows for a 200% cap which remains in place in exceptional circumstances rather than representing 
a realistic estimate).
3  The graphs above reflects that none of the options previously granted under the LTIP plan in the year ended 31 March 2017 are 
expected to vest (in whole or in part) or become exercisable in the year ended 31 March 2018. New options are expected to be 
granted in the year ended 31 March 2018 as set out in the introduction to the Remuneration Report.
Directors’ service contracts
The Company’s general approach on recruiting a new Executive Director would be to follow the terms of the contracts of 
Mr Pauli and Mr Rudge. However, it is difficult to be definitive regarding a currently unforeseen event and the Company 
reserves the right to introduce a longer initial notice period (of up to 2 years) reducing over time.
Executive Director service contracts, which do not contain expiry dates, provide that compensation provisions for 
termination without notice will only extend to salary, certain fixed benefits and pension. In the case of William Rudge and 
Hans Pauli such sums may be paid in instalments and cease if the individual finds an alternative role.
Following a change of control, if the Company terminates Paul Clegg’s employment in breach of or in accordance with 
the terms of his service contract or if Paul Clegg terminates the employment in response to a fundamental breach of 
contract by the Company or in accordance with the terms of his service contract, then he will be entitled to a termination 
payment comprising 12 months base pay and benefits, plus an amount in respect of bonus of at least the level of 
the average of historic bonus levels (or a higher discretionary amount awarded in respect of Company and personal 
performance in the financial year of termination), unpaid expenses and the value of accrued holiday entitlement.

Termination policy summary
In practice, the facts surrounding any termination do not always fit neatly into defined categories for good or bad leavers. 
Therefore, it is appropriate for the Committee to consider the suitable treatment on a termination having regard to all of 
the relevant facts and circumstances available at that time. This policy applies both to any negotiations linked to notice 
periods on a termination and any treatment which the Committee may choose to apply under the discretions available 
to it under the terms of the annual bonus and LTIP plans. The potential treatments on termination under these plans are 
summarised below.
Incentives Good leaver Bad leaver Exceptional events 
If a leaver is deemed to be a ‘good leaver’;  
i.e. leaving through redundancy, retirement,  
ill health, disability or death, sale of part  
of the Group or otherwise at the discretion  
of the Remuneration Committee
If a leaver is deemed to 
be a ‘bad leaver’; typically 
voluntary resignation or 
leaving for disciplinary 
reasons
For example change in control or  
winding up of the Company
Annual 
bonus
Pro-rated bonus. Pro-rating to  
reflect only the period worked. 
Performance metrics determined  
by the Remuneration Committee.
Annual bonus awarded in shares,  
but still held in the Employee Benefit  
Trust for a year, will fully vest.
No awards made. Either the annual bonus will continue 
for the year or there will be a pro-
rated bonus.
Performance metrics determined by 
the Remuneration Committee.
LTIP Will receive a pro-rated award subject  
to the application of the performance 
conditions at the normal 
measurement date.
All awards will normally 
lapse.
Awards vest after taking into 
account both the application of the 
performance conditions at the date 
of the event and the period of time 
served (other than in the respect of 
retention based awards).
The Company has power to enter into settlement agreements with Executives and to pay compensation to settle potential 
legal claims. In addition, and consistent with market practice, in the event of termination of an Executive Director, the 
Company may pay a contribution towards the individual’s legal fees and fees for outplacement services as part of a 
negotiated settlement. Any such fees would be disclosed as part of the detail of termination arrangements. For the 
avoidance of doubt, the policy does not include an explicit cap on the cost of termination payments.
Non-Executive Directors’ contracts
The Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, have letters of appointment which set out their duties and 
responsibilities. Appointment is for a fixed term of three years, terminable by three months’ notice on either side.

Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
As explained in the general policy section of the Remuneration policy, the Committee takes into account Group-wide  
pay and employment conditions. The Committee reviews the average Group-wide base salary increase and bonus costs 
and is responsible for all discretionary and all-employee share arrangements.
Consistent with normal practice, the Committee did not consult with employees in preparing the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy.
Consideration of shareholders’ views
Each year the Committee takes into account the approval levels of remuneration related matters at our annual general 
meeting in determining that the current Directors’ remuneration policy remains appropriate for the Company.
REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 63
The Committee seeks to build an active and productive 
dialogue with investors on developments in the 
remuneration aspects of corporate governance generally 
and any changes to the Company’s executive pay 
arrangements in particular.
Details of the Company’s corporate governance 
arrangements are set out below. The Board of Directors 
acknowledges the importance of the Principles set out 
in The UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council. Neither the 2010 or 2012 
UK Corporate Governance Code are compulsory for AIM 
listed or Euronext listed companies. The Board has applied 
the principles as far as practicable and appropriate for a 
relatively small public company.
The Board of Directors
During the period the Board comprised a Non-executive 
Chairman, three Non-executive Directors and three 
Executive Directors.
The Board meets regularly and is responsible for strategy, 
performance, approval of major capital projects and the 
framework of internal controls. To enable the Board to 
discharge its duties, all Directors receive appropriate and 
timely information. Briefing papers are distributed to all 
Directors in advance of Board meetings. All Directors 
have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary. The appointment and removal of the Company 
Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole. In addition, 
procedures are in place to enable the Directors to obtain 
independent professional advice in the furtherance of their 
duties, if necessary, at the Company’s expense.
During the year, all serving Directors attended the 
quarterly Board meetings that were held. In addition to the 
scheduled meetings there is frequent contact between all 
the Directors in connection with the Company’s business 
including Audit and Nomination and Remuneration 
committee meetings which are held as required, but as a 
minimum twice per annum.
Directors are subject to re-election by the shareholders 
at Annual General Meetings. The Articles of Association 
provide that Directors will be subject to re-election at the 
first opportunity after their appointment and the Board 
submit to re-election at intervals of three years.
Day to day operating decisions are made by the Senior 
Management Team of which the Chief Executive Officer, 
the Executive Director, Corporate Development and 
Finance Director are members.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consisted of Sean Christie 
(Chairman), Patrick Shanley, Nick Meyer and Sue Farr. 
The Audit Committee meets at least twice a year and is 
responsible for monitoring compliance with accounting and 
legal requirements and for reviewing the annual and interim 
financial statements prior to their submission for approval 
by the Board. The Committee also discusses the scope of 
the audit and its findings and considers the appointment 
and fees of the external auditors. The Audit Committee 
continues to believe that it is not currently appropriate 
for the Company to maintain a dedicated internal audit 
function due to its size.
The Audit Committee considers the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditors on an annual basis, 
with particular regard to non- audit services. The non-
audit fees are considered by the Board not to affect the 
independence or objectivity of the auditors. The Audit 
Committee monitors such costs in the context of the audit 
fee for the period, ensuring that the value of non-audit 
service does not increase to a level where it could affect 
the auditors’ objectivity and independence. The Board also 
receives an annual confirmation of independence from the 
auditors.
Nominations & Remuneration Committee
The Nominations and Remuneration Committee consists 
of Sue Farr (Chairman), Patrick Shanley, Sean Christie 
and Nick Meyer. The Committee’s role is to consider and 
approve the nomination of Directors and the remuneration 
and benefits of the Executive Directors, including the 
award of share options and bonus share awards. In framing 
the Company’s remuneration policy, the Nominations & 
Remuneration Committee has given full consideration to 
Section D of The UK Corporate Governance Code.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ACCSYS TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 64
Internal Financial Control
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Company’s system of internal financial control and places 
importance on maintaining a strong control environment. The key procedures which the Directors have established with a 
view to providing effective internal financial control are as follows:
• The Company’s organisational structure has clear lines of responsibility;
• The Company prepares a comprehensive annual budget that is approved by the Board. Monthly results are reported 
against the budget and variances are closely monitored by the Directors; and
• The Board is responsible for identifying the major business risks faced by the Company and for determining  
the appropriate courses of action to manage those risks.
The Directors recognise, however, that such a system of internal financial control can only provide reasonable,  
not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Relations with shareholders
Communications with shareholders are given high priority.
There is regular dialogue with shareholders including presentations after the Company’s preliminary announcement of 
the year-end results and six monthly results. The Board uses the Annual General Meeting to communicate with investors 
and welcomes their participation. The Chairman aims to ensure that the Directors are available at Annual General 
Meetings to answer questions.
Directors’ attendance record
The attendance of individual Directors at meetings of the Board and its committees in the year under review was

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 65
Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual 
report, the directors’ remuneration report and the  
financial statements in accordance with applicable  
law and regulations.
English company law requires the directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. Under that law 
the directors have prepared the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union, and 
the parent company financial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and 
applicable law). Under company law the directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss 
of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; and
• provide additional disclosures when compliance 
with the specific requirements of IFRS as adopted 
by the European Union and the applicable UK 
Accounting Standards is insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the financial position and 
financial performance.
In preparing both the Group and the Company financial 
statements, suitable accounting policies have been used 
and applied consistently, and reasonable and prudent 
judgements and estimates have been made. Applicable 
accounting standards have been followed. The financial 
statements have been prepared on the going concern basis 
as disclosed in the Statutory Information section of the 
Directors’ Report and Business Review.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements and the directors’ remuneration 
report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in 
the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are 
listed on pages 40 to 41 of this annual report, confirm that:
• to the best of their knowledge, the consolidated financial 
statements, which have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit of the Group;
• to the best of their knowledge, the strategic report 
includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the 
Group, together with a description of principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces; and
• they consider the annual report, taken as a whole, to 
be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy.

Report on the Group financial statements 
Our opinion
In our opinion, Accsys Technologies PLC’s Group 
financial statements (the ‘financial statements’):
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of its loss and cash 
flows for the year then ended;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union; and
•  have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements (the ‘Annual Report’), 
comprise:
•  the consolidated statement of financial position as 
at 31 March 2017;
•  the consolidated statement of other comprehensive 
income for the year then ended;
•  the consolidated statement of cash flow for the year 
then ended;
•  the consolidated statement of changes in equity for 
the year then ended; and
•  the notes to the financial statements, which include 
a summary of significant accounting policies and 
other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union, and applicable law.
In applying the financial reporting framework, 
the directors have made a number of subjective 
judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they 
have made assumptions and considered future events.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the 
course of the audit:
•  the information given in the Strategic Report and 
the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which 
the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and
•  the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have 
been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding 
of the group and its environment obtained in the 
course of the audit, we are required to report if we have 
identified any material misstatements in the Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Report. We have nothing to 
report in this respect.
Other matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received 
all the information and explanations we require for our 
audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of 
directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility.

Responsibilities for the financial statements  
and the audit 
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 65, the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared 
for and only for the Company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this 
report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK 
& Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of:
•  whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed;
•  the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and
• the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing 
the directors’ judgements against available evidence, 
forming our own judgements, and evaluating the 
disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and 
other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider 
necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw 
conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing 
the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or 
a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course 
of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we 
consider the implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent Company 
financial statements of Accsys Technologies PLC for 
the year ended 31 March 2017 and on the information in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as 
having been audited.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOW 
for the year ended 31 March 2017 ACCSYS TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 74
1. Accounting Policies
Basis of accounting
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention (except for certain 
financial instruments and equity investments which are measured at fair value), in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board as endorsed by the 
European Union, interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) and with those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies preparing their financial statements under adopted IFRS.
Going Concern
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future, and at least 12 months from the date these financial statements are 
approved.
As part of the Group’s going concern review, the Directors have reviewed the Group’s trading forecasts and 
working capital requirements for the foreseeable future, including taking into account the proceeds from the Firm 
Placing and Open offer which was successfully completed on 23 April 2017. These forecasts indicate that, in order 
to continue as a going concern, the Group is dependent on the achievement of certain operating performance 
measures relating to the production and sales of Accoya
®
 wood from the plant in Arnhem and the collection of 
ongoing working capital items in line with internally agreed budgets.
The Directors have considered the internally agreed budgets and performance measures and believe that 
appropriate controls and procedures are in place or will be in place to make sure that these are met. The Directors 
believe that while some uncertainty inherently remains in achieving the budget, in particular in relation to market 
conditions outside of the Group’s control, that there are a sufficient number of alternative actions and measures 
that can be taken in order to achieve the Group’s medium and long term objectives.
Therefore the Directors believe that the going concern basis is the most appropriate on which to prepare the 
financial statements.
Changes in accounting policies
No new accounting standards, amendments or interpretations have been adopted in the period which have any 
impact on these financial statements.
Exceptional Items
Exceptional items are events or transactions that fall outside the ordinary activities of the Group and which by 
virtue of their size or incidence, have been separately disclosed in order to improve a reader’s understanding of the 
financial statements. These include items relating to the restructuring of a significant part of the Group, impairment 
losses (or the reversal of previously recorded exceptional impairments), expenditure relating to the integration 
and implementation of significant acquisitions and other one-off events or transactions. See note 5 for details of 
exceptional items.
Business combinations
Where the Company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of 
another entity or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary. The consolidated 
financial statements present the results of the Group as if they formed a single entity. Inter-company transactions 
and balances between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method. 
In the consolidated statement of financial position, the acquirer’s identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent 
liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are 
included in the consolidated income statement from the date on which control is obtained.
As allowed under IFRS 1, some business combinations effected prior to transition to IFRS, were accounted for using 
the merger method of accounting. Under this method, assets and liabilities are included in the consolidation at their 
book values, not fair values, and any differences between the cost of investment and net assets acquired were taken 
to the merger reserve. The majority of the merger reserve arose from a corporate restructuring in the year ended 
31 March 2006 which introduced Accsys Technologies PLC as the new holding company.
Further details concerning the Tricoya Consortium are included in note 9.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ending 31 March 2017 75 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it 
is probable that the economic benefit will flow to the Group and that the revenue can be reliably measured. The 
following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised.
Manufacturing revenue
Revenue is recognised in respect of the sale of goods when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the 
goods have been passed to the buyer, the timing of which is dependent on the particular shipment terms. When 
a customer provides untreated wood to be processed by the Group in order to produce Accoya
®
, revenue 
is recognised when the Group’s obligations under the relevant customer contract have been substantially 
completed, which is before the finished Accoya
®
 has been collected by the customer. Manufacturing revenue 
includes the sale of Accoya
®
 wood and other revenue, principally relating to the sale of acetic acid.
Licensing fees and Marketing income
Licence fee and marketing income is recognised over the period of the relevant agreements according to the 
specific terms of each agreement or the quantities and/or values of the licensed product sold. The accounting 
policy for the recognition of licence fees is based upon an assessment of the work required before the licence 
is signed and subsequently during the design, construction and commissioning of the licensees’ plant, with 
an appropriate proportion of the fee recognised upon signing and the balance recognised as the project 
progresses to completion. Marketing revenue when the company acts as principal is recognised based on the 
actual work completed in the period. The amount of any cash or billings received but not recognised as income 
is included in the financial statements as deferred income and shown as a liability.
Finance income
Interest accrues using the effective interest method, i.e. the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts 
through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
Finance expense
Finance expenses include the fees, interest and other finance charges associated with the Group’s loan notes and 
credit facilities, which are expensed over the period that the Group has access to the loans and facilities.
Foreign exchange gains or losses on the loan notes are included within finance expenses.
Interest on the £16.25 million unsecured fixed rate loan notes issued to Business Growth Fund (‘BGF’) and Volantis on 
29 March 2017 has been expensed. Interest on the €2 million term loan drawn down from Solvay Acetow GmBH (now 
known as Rhodia Acetow GmBH) on 29 December 2016, to part-finance capital expenditure at the Arnhem plant, has 
been capitalised as it is directly attributable to the expansion.
Finance expenses also include an allocation of finance charges in respect of the sale and leaseback of the Arnhem 
land and buildings, and the lease of London Office fit out and furniture, accounted for as a finance lease. The total 
finance charge (calculated as the difference between the total minimum lease payments and the liability at the 
inception of the lease) is allocated over the life of the lease using the sum-of-digits method.
Share based payments
The Company awards nil cost options to acquire shares of the Company to certain Directors and employees. The 
Company also awards bonuses to certain Directors and employees in the form of the award of deferred shares of 
the Company.
The fair value of options, deferred shares and matching shares granted are recognised as an employee expense 
with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and is charged to the statement of 
comprehensive income over the vesting period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the 
options or shares.
The fair value of share options granted is measured using a modified Black Scholes model, taking into account 
the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted 
to reflect the actual number of share options that vest only where vesting is dependent upon the satisfaction of 
service and non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to 
vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is 
based on the number of options which eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of 
the options granted. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition.
Dividends
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are recognised when 
paid. Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
for the year ending 31 March 2017
ACCSYS TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 76
1. Accounting Policies continued
Pensions
The Group contributes to certain defined contribution pension and employee benefit schemes on behalf of its 
employees. These costs are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on an accruals basis.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date together with any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Current tax includes the expected impact of claims submitted by the Group to tax authorities in respect of 
enhanced tax relief for expenditure on research and development.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for 
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are 
not provided for:
• the initial recognition of goodwill,
•  the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a 
business combination, and
•  differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be 
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which it operates (the functional currency). For the purposes of the consolidated financial 
statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in Euro, which is the functional 
currency of the parent Company, and the presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s 
functional currencies are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each 
balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated 
at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign 
operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are 
translated at the average monthly exchange rates prevailing in the month in which the transaction took place. 
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income, finance expense and the 
foreign currency translation reserve.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be 
received and the Group will comply with the attached conditions. When the grant relates to an expense item, it 
is recognised as income over the period necessary to match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs that it is 
intended to compensate. Where the grant relates to an asset they are credited to a deferred income account and 
released to the statement of comprehensive income over the expected useful life of the relevant asset on a straight 
line basis.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking is the difference between the fair value of the 
consideration paid and the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. It is capitalised, and is 
subject to annual impairment reviews by the Directors. Any impairment arising is charged to the statement of 
comprehensive income. Where the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is greater than the 
fair value of consideration paid, the resulting amount is treated as a gain on a bargain purchase and has been 
recognised in the income statement. 77 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Other intangible assets
Intellectual property rights, including patents, which cover a portfolio of novel processes and products, are shown 
in the financial statements at cost less accumulated amortisation and any amounts by which the carrying value 
is assessed during an annual review to have been impaired. At present, the useful economic life of the intellectual 
property is considered to be 20 years.
Internal development costs are incurred as part of the Group’s activities including new processes, process 
improvements, identifying new species and improving the Group’s existing products. Research costs are expensed 
as incurred. Development costs are capitalised when all of the criteria set out in IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ 
(including criteria concerning technical feasibility, ability and intention to use or sell, ability to generate future 
economic benefits, ability to complete the development and ability to reliably measure the expenditure) have 
been met. These internal development costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful economic life, 
between 10 and 20 years.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment charged. Cost 
includes the original purchase price of the asset as well as costs of bringing the asset to the working condition and 
location of its intended use. Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual 
value of each asset, except freehold land, over its expected useful life on a straight line basis, as follows:
Plant and machinery  These assets comprise pilot plants and production facilities. These facilities are 
depreciated from the date they become available for use at rates applicable to the 
asset lives expected for each class of asset, with rates between 5% and 20%.
Office equipment  Between 20% and 50%.
Leased land and buildings  Land held under a finance lease is depreciated over the life of the lease.
Freehold land Freehold land is not depreciated.
Impairment of non–financial assets
The carrying amount of the non-current non-financial assets of the Group is compared to the recoverable amount 
of the assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value may not be recoverable, 
or in the case of goodwill, annually. The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and the fair value less cost 
to sell. In assessing the value in use, the expected future cash flows from the assets are determined by applying a 
discount rate to the anticipated pre-tax future cash flows. An impairment charge is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets’ recoverable amount. The revised 
carrying amounts are amortised or depreciated in line with Group accounting policies. A previously recognised 
impairment loss, other than on goodwill, is reversed if the recoverable amount increases as a result of a reversal of the 
conditions that originally resulted in the impairment. This reversal is recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income and is limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no 
impairment loss been recognised in prior years. Assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows (cash generating units) for purposes of assessing impairment.
Leases
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-
line basis over the lease term.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present 
value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to 
the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between 
finance expenses and reduction of lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability.
Inventories
Raw materials, which consist of unprocessed timber and chemicals used in manufacturing operations are valued at 
the lower of cost and net realisable value. The basis on which cost is derived is a first-in, first-out basis.
Finished goods, comprising processed timber, are stated at the lower of weighted average cost of production or 
net realisable value. Costs include direct materials, direct labour costs and production overheads (excluding the 
depreciation/depletion of relevant property and plant and equipment) absorbed at an appropriate level of capacity 
utilisation. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all expected costs to completion and 
costs to be incurred in selling and distribution. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
for the year ending 31 March 2017
ACCSYS TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 78
1. Accounting Policies continued
Financial assets
Financial assets are classified as cash and cash equivalents, available for sale investments and loans and 
receivables, depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired. When financial assets are recognised 
initially, they are measured at fair value plus, in the case of investments not at fair value, through profit or loss 
directly attributable transaction costs.
Except where a reliable fair value cannot be obtained, unlisted shares held by the Group are classified as available 
for sale investments and are stated at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised 
directly in equity, with the exception of impairment losses which are recognised directly in profit or loss. Where an 
investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the 
profit or loss in the year. Where it is not possible to obtain a reliable fair value, these investments are held at cost 
less provision for impairment.
Loans and receivables, which comprise non-derivative financial assets with fixed and determinable payments 
that are not quoted on an active market are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are 
directly attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
Trade and other receivables
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an 
active market. They arise principally from the provision of goods and services to customers. Trade receivables 
are initially recognised at fair value less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts. A provision for impairment 
is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect debts. Bad debts are written 
off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-
term deposits, including liquidity funds, with an original maturity of three months or less. For the purpose of the 
statement of consolidated cash flow, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined 
above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities
Trade payables and other financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Loans and other borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of amounts received net of transaction 
costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Share capital
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the 
definition of a financial liability. The Group’s shares are classified as equity instruments.
Segmental Reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief executive. 
The chief executive is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, 
has been identified as steering the committee that makes strategic decisions.
2. Accounting estimates and judgements
In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, management has to make judgements on how to apply the 
Group’s accounting policies and make estimates about the future. The critical judgements that have been made in 
arriving at the amounts recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the key sources of estimation and 
uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
in the next financial year are discussed below:
Revenue recognition
The Group has considered the criteria for the recognition of fee income from licensees over the period of 
the agreement and is satisfied that the recognition of such revenue is appropriate. The recognition of fees 
is based upon an assessment of the work required before the licence is signed and subsequently during the 
construction and commissioning of the licensees’ plant, with an appropriate proportion of the fee recognised 
upon signing and the balance recognised as the project progresses to completion. The Group also considers the 
recoverability of amounts before recognising them as income. 79 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Goodwill
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting 
policy stated above. The recoverable amounts of cash–generating units have been determined based on value 
in use calculations. These calculations require the use of judgements in relation to discount rates and future 
forecasts (See note 16). The recoverability of these balances is dependent upon the level of future licence 
fees and manufacturing revenues. While the scope and timing of the production facilities to be built under the 
Group’s existing and future agreements remains uncertain, the Directors remain confident that revenue from own 
manufacturing, existing licensees, new licence or consortium agreements will be generated, demonstrating the 
recoverability of these balances.
Intellectual property rights and property, plant and equipment
The Group tests the carrying amount of the intellectual property rights and property, plant and equipment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value may not be recoverable. These 
calculations require the use of estimates in respect of future cash–flows from the assets by applying a discount 
rate to the anticipated pre–tax future cash–flows. The Group also reviews the estimated useful lives at the end of 
each annual reporting period (See note 16 & 17). The price of the Accoya wood and the raw materials and other 
inputs vary according to market conditions outside of the Group’s control. Should the price of the raw materials 
increase greater than the sales price or in a way which no longer makes Accoya competitive, then the carrying 
value of the property, plant and equipment or IPR may be in doubt and become impaired. The Directors consider 
that the current market and best estimates of future prices mean that this risk is limited.
Inventories
The Group reviews the net realisable value of, and demand for, its inventory on a monthly basis to provide 
assurance that recorded inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value after taking into 
account the age and condition of inventory.
Available for sale investments
The Group has an investment in unlisted equity shares carried at nil value. The investment is valued at cost less 
any impairment as a reliable fair value cannot be obtained since there is no active market for the shares and 
there is currently uncertainty around the future funding of the business. The Group makes appropriate enquiries 
and considers all of the information available to it in order to assess whether any impairment has occurred  
(See note 18).

Note in respect of restatement of segmental reporting note: In the previous year the results had been allocated between 
Manufacturing, R&D and Administation/Business Development segments. Following the formation of the Tricoya Consortium, 
results have been allocated to reflect the business more appropriately. As a result €1.9m of Accoya related licence and other 
revenue previously included in the Licensing, Management and Business Development segment has been included the Accoya 
segment (2016: €4.3m). In addition all Accoya specific costs previously included in the Licensing, Management and Business 
Development segment including €3.5m of Sales & Marketing, Information Technology and Intellectual Property costs have been 
allocated to the Accoya segment (2016: €3.4m). 81 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Corporate
Corporate costs are those costs not directly attributable to Accoya, Tricoya or Research and Development activities. 
This includes management and the Group’s corporate and general administration costs including the head office in 
London. Headcount = 15 (2016: 14)
Accoya
Revenue includes the sale of Accoya, licence income and other revenue, principally relating to the sale of acetic acid

Note: allocation of operating costs includes representing of 2016 numbers in line with the updated segmental analysis as per note 3.
During the period, €525,000 (2016: €420,000) of development costs were capitalised and included in intangible 
fixed assets, including €462,000 (2016: €282,000) which were capitalised within Tricoya Technologies Limited 
(‘TTL’). In addition €637,000 of internal costs have been capitalised and are included within tangible fixed assets in 
relation to the expansion of our plant in Arnhem, Netherlands (2016: €367,000).
Other operating costs largely relate to costs associated with the Group’s manufacturing office in the Netherlands, 
excluding research & development costs.
Administration costs also include the costs associated with the Group’s head office in London, the US office in 
Dallas together with business development and management costs. Exceptional costs in the current year are set 
out in note 5.
5. Exceptional items
Agreements were reached in August 2016 for the sale and leaseback for the land in Arnhem, resulting in proceeds 
of €4.2m received in the period and a gain of €0.6m as a result of the book value of the land being lower. Under the 
arrangements, the landlord has agreed to construct a new warehouse and office building which will be connected 
to the Group’s existing manufacturing site. This building will be built by the landlord and leased to the Group over 
a 20 year period with further option to renew. The landlord is the same landlord that the Group sold land and 
buildings to in 2011 and 2012 associated with the existing manufacturing plant.
The above exceptional gain was partly offset by €0.5m of costs incurred in the period in relation to advisory fees 
for business development activities as the Group pursued a one-off long-term opportunity. 83 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

9. Tricoya Technologies Limited
Tricoya Technologies Limited (‘TTL’) was incorporated in order to develop and exploit the Group’s Tricoya
®
 
technology for use within the worldwide panel products market, which is estimated to be worth more than €60 
billion annually.
On 29 March 2017 the Group announced the entry into and successful completion of its agreements for the 
financing, construction and operation of the world’s first Tricoya wood elements acetylation plant in Hull with its 
TTL consortium investors, being BP, Medite, BGF and Volantis.
The Hull plant will have an initial production capacity of 30,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) (sufficient to manufacture 
40,000 cubic meters of panels) and scope to expand. Approximately 40% of the plant’s output is expected to be 
sold or paid for under an off-take agreement with Medite; cash flow break-even is at approximately 40% production 
capacity. The plant is expected to cost approximately €61m, with a further approximately €15m required for 
continued market seeding, marketing, IP development and engineering functions to cash break-even.
Structurally, Accsys, BP Ventures, Medite, BGF and Volantis have invested into TTL. TTL has then invested, 
alongside BP Chemicals and Medite, in Tricoya Ventures UK Limited (‘TVUK’), a special purpose subsidiary of TTL 
that will construct, own and operate the Hull Plant.
BP will invest a total of €20.3 million in the Tricoya Project. BP Ventures, BP’s venture capital arm, invested 
€6.6 million as equity into TTL by 31 March 2017 to benefit from the long-term opportunity that the Tricoya 
Consortium believes exists in respect of exploiting Tricoya globally. BP Chemicals will contribute up to €13.7 
million as equity in TVUK, aligning its interest with the plant it is supplying. €2.3 million of the €13.7 million TVUK 
equity funding had been received by 31 March 2017, with the remaining €11.4 million to be invested during the 
construction of the Hull plant.
Medite’s investment in the Tricoya Project will be €11 million, with €7 million invested as equity into TTL and up to 
€4 million as equity into TVUK, thereby aligning its interest in both the manufacturing and the longer term global 
success of Tricoya. At 31 March 2017 all €7 million of TTL equity funding and €0.9 million of the TVUK equity 
funding had been received, with the remaining €3.1 million to be invested during the construction of the Hull plant.
TTL will invest €28.5 million in TVUK, having invested €5.2m in March 2017 and committed to contribute a further 
€23.3m during construction of the Hull plant. 85 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In October 2012 the Group contributed all of its Tricoya intellectual property and historical development into TTL 
by way of exclusive licence, with rights for TTL to exploit the same on a global basis.
The Group agreed and funded a further €18.4 million of cash investment in March 2017 by way of equity 
subscription in TTL, resulting in a total equity interest of 74.6%. This equity subscription is funded by the Group’s 
issue of Loan Notes to BGF and Volantis.
The Group is expected to increase its total equity interest in TTL to 75.9% over the next two years as a result of the 
continued supply by the Group of lower priced Accoya
®
 to Medite to enable continued market development ahead 
of the completion of the Hull Plant.
BGF and Volantis have invested an aggregate of £19 million as financial investors into both the Group and TTL. BGF 
and Volantis have agreed to invest on similar terms but are investing separately, with BGF accounting for 65% of 
the £19 million total.
In addition, TVUK has entered a six-year €17.2 million (€15 million net) finance facility agreement with The Royal 
Bank of Scotland Plc in respect of the construction and operation of the Hull Plant.
The Group has consolidated the results of both TTL and TVUK (TTL Group) as subsidiaries, as it exercises the power 
to govern the entities, as required by IFRS 10 guidance. The non-controlling interests in both entities has been 
recognised in these Group financial statements.
The TTL Group consists of Tricoya Technologies Limited and its subsidiary, Tricoya Ventures UK Limited. The TTL

15. Share based payments
The Group operates a number of share schemes which give rise to a share based payment charge. The Group 
operates a Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) in order to reward members of the senior management team and the 
executive directors. As part of the award of nil costs options under the LTIP in 2013, the recipients relinquished 
all share options that they held which had been awarded under the 2005 and 2008 Share Option plans. Other 
employees continue to hold options awarded under these earlier schemes.
In addition, the Group operated an Employee Share Participation Plan, which was available to all employees, and 
also made awards under the Employee Benefit Trust. Details of all these schemes are given below.

Of the total number of options outstanding at the end of the year, 183,532 (2016: 183,532) had vested and were 
exercisable at the end of the year. No options were exercised in the current year (2016: 20,000).
Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
In 2013, the Group established a Long Term Incentive Plan, the participants of which are key members of the Senior 
Management Team, including Executive Directors. The establishment of the LTIP was approved by the shareholders 
at the AGM in September 2013.
A prerequisite of participation in the LTIP in 2013 was for the beneficiaries to agree to the cancellation of their entire 
outstanding share options, providing the Company with a 5% reduction in the level of dilution to make the new 
awards. A cancellation was agreed as the most appropriate action as it would focus the management team on the 
new LTIP and not on historical awards or arrangements.
 LTIP overview
Under the LTIP, awards can be granted on a discretionary basis to key members of the management team. 
In 2013, an initial ‘one off’ grant was made in order to focus the management team on the growth of the 
Company over the next three years. Awards were granted in the form of nil–cost options and consist of the 
following ‘elements’:
Element Objective Description
A Retention based 
award to lock-in 
executives who 
have contributed to 
the turnaround
In consideration to agreeing to the cancellation of the participant’s existing 
options, a proportion of the new share awards were to vest on continuity of 
employment over the next three years.
To ensure there is no value shift to the participants via the cancellation, this 
element required an additional three years of services from the participant and 
were to be forfeited if the share price at the end of the performance period was 
below €0.65.
B Performance based 
share award
This element aligned the participant to the future success of the Company 
by linking the level of vesting to EBITDA and share price growth against the 
constituents of the MSCI Europe Index (or another other broad based European 
index as deemed appropriate by the Remuneration Committee).
C Exceptional 
performance 
multiplier
This element ensured that if significant value was created for shareholders 
then participants would be entitled to receive an appropriate proportion of this 
value. 89 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Awards made in June 2016 and LTIP Award performance conditions
Following the vesting of the LTIPs awarded in September 2013, a further award was made to members of the 
Senior Management Team, including Executive Directors. A total of 1,070,255 nil cost options were awarded.
The LTIP plan rules were amended in November 2015 such that awards made in summer 2016 are subject to a 3 
year performance period (i.e. year end March 2019) and a further 2 year holding period. In addition, awards are 
also subject to malus/ claw–back provisions. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

Once vested these options may be exercised until 20 November 2017. At 31 March 2016, 48,444 (2015: 48,444) 
of these options were outstanding at an exercise price of €12.90.
Options granted on 18 June 2008 vest to one third of the options granted upon achievement of each of  
the following:
• Announcement of audited Annual Accoya
®
 wood sales revenue exceeds €20 million in financial year
• Announcement of audited annual Group distributable earnings exceeding €15 million

options were outstanding at an exercise price of €9.90.
Options granted on 8 December 2008 vest to one third of the options granted upon achievement of each of 
the following:
• Announcement of audited Annual Accoya
®
 wood sales revenue exceeds €20 million in financial year
• Announcement of audited annual Group distributable earnings exceeding €15 million
•  Announcement of audited Cumulative €75 million gross licence revenue recognised under Group 
accounting policies
Once vested these options may be exercised until 8 December 2018. At 31 March 2016, 37,110 (2015: 37,110) of these 
options were outstanding at an exercise price of €4.85. 91 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Options granted on 27 July 2010 were partially exchanged in the period for new awards issued under the LTIP. 30% of 
the options vest on achievement of median TSR. Once vested, these options may be exercised until 27 July 2020. Full 
vesting of the options granted occurs upon achievement of upper quartile TSR measured over the three year period. 
At 31 March 2016, 164,321 (2015: 164,321) of these options were outstanding at an exercise price of €1.20.
Options granted on 1 August 2011 were partially exchanged in the period for new awards issued under the 
LTIP. 30% of the options vest on achievement of median TSR. Full vesting of the options granted occurs upon 
achievement of upper quartile TSR measured over the three year period. Once vested, these options may be 
exercised until 1 August 2021. At 31 March 2016, 140,000 (2015: 160,000) of these options were outstanding at an 
exercise price of €0.50.
TSR is measured on a relative basis compared to the FTSE Small Cap index over a three year period from grant 
date. Unless discretion is exercised by the Nomination & Remuneration Committee, all options are forfeit following 
an option holder’s termination of contract.
The fair value of share options granted under the 2005 and 2008 Share Option Schemes during the previous years 
was calculated based on a modified Black-Scholes model assuming inputs shown below for more recent awards:
Grant date August 2011 July 2010
Share price at grant date (€) 0.50 1.70
Exercise price (€) 0.50 1.70
Expected life (years) 3 3
Contractual life (years) 10 10
Risk free rate 1.54% 2.30%
Expected volatility 85% 60%
Expected dividend yield 0% 0%
Fair value of option €0.200 €0.532
The figures in the table and notes above have been adjusted to reflect the 5 for 1 share consolidation which 
became effective on 12 September 2014. Volatility was estimated by reference to the historic volatility since 
October 2005 when the Company’s shares were listed on AIM. The resulting fair value is expensed over the 
vesting period of the options on the assumption that a proportion of options will lapse over the service period 
as employees leave the Group.
Employee Benefit Trust – Share bonus award
Following a share issue on 4 July 2016 as part of the annual bonus, in connection with the employee remuneration 
and incentivisation arrangements for the period from 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016, 679,435 (2016: 951,295) new 
Ordinary shares were held by an Employee Benefit Trust, the beneficiaries of which are primarily the Executive 
Directors and Senior Managers. Such new Ordinary shares vest if the employees remain in employment with the 
Company at the vesting date, being 1 July 2017 (subject to certain other provisions including regulations, good-
leaver, take-over and nomination and remuneration committee discretion provisions). As at 31 March 2017, the 
Employment Benefit Trust was consolidated by the Company and the 679,435 shares are recorded as Own Shares 
within equity. During the period, 938,449 Ordinary shares awarded in the prior year vested.
Employee Share Participation Plan
During the prior year, the Company operated the Employee Share Participation Plan (the ‘Plan’). The Plan 
was intended to promote the long term growth and profitability of Accsys by providing employees with an 
opportunity to acquire an ownership interest in new ordinary shares (‘Shares’) in the Company as an additional 
benefit of employment.
Under the terms of the Plan, the Company issues these Shares to a trust for the benefit of the subscribing 
employees. The Shares are released to employees after one year, together with an additional Share on a 1 for 1 
matched basis provided the employee has remained in the employment of Accsys at that point in time (subject 
to good leaver provisions). The Plan is in line with industry approved employee share plans and was open for 
subscription by employees twice in the year following release of annual and half yearly financial results. The 
maximum amount available for subscription by any employee is €5,000 per annum.
During the year ended 31 March 2017 the plan was not open for subscription. However during the year, 1 for 1 
Matching shares were awarded in respect of subscriptions that were made in the previous year as a result of all 
participants continuing to remain in employment at the point of vesting. 63,909 Matching shares were issued to 
employees in July 2016 and 16,302 shares were issued in January 2017. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

The carrying value of internal development costs, intellectual property rights and goodwill on consolidation are 
considered part of a single cash generating unit which incorporates the manufacturing and licensing operations 
given the manufacturing reliance on IP of the Group. The recoverable amount of internal development costs, 
intellectual property rights and goodwill relating to this operation is determined based on a value in use calculation 
which uses cash flow projections based on board approved financial budgets. Cash flows have been projected 
for a period of 6 years plus assumptions concerning a terminal value and based on a pre-tax discount rate of 13% 
per annum (2016: 20%). The key assumption used in the value in use calculations is the level of future licence fees 
and manufacturing revenues estimated by management over the budget period. These have been based on past 
experience and expected future revenues. The Directors have considered whether a reasonably possible change in 
assumptions may result in an impairment. An impairment would arise if the Group failed to secure future licence or 
licence related income and if the total volume of forecast Accoya and Tricoya manufactured is lower than projected 
sales in future years. 93 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Accsys Technologies PLC has previously purchased a total of 21,666,734 unlisted ordinary shares in Diamond Wood 
China. On 23 December 2016, Cleantech Building Materials PLC acquired Diamond Wood China. After the year-end, 
on 19 April 2017 Cleantech Building Materials acquired the 21,666,734 shares previously owned by the Company 
and in return the Company has been issued with 520,001 shares in Cleantech Building Materials PLC, a listed 
company trading on the Nasdaq First North market in Copenhagen.
The carrying value of the investment is carried at cost less any provision for impairment, rather than at its fair value, 
as there was no active market for these shares as at 31 March 2017, and there is significant uncertainty over the 
future of Diamond Wood, and as such a reliable fair value cannot be calculated.
The historical cost of the listed shares held at 31 March 2017 is €10m (2016: €10m). However, a provision for the 
impairment of the entire balance of €10m continues to be recorded as at 31 March 2017.
19. Deferred Taxation
The Group has a deferred tax asset of €nil (2016: €nil) relating to trading losses brought forward.
The Group also has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of €24.0m (2016: €23.2m) which is largely in respect of 
trading losses of the UK subsidiaries. The deferred tax asset has not been recognised due to the uncertainty of 
the timing of future expected profits of the related legal entities which is dependent on the profits attributable to 
licensing and future manufacturing income.

the inventories sold in the period which had previously been written down to net realisable value. 95 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Prepayments increased as at 31 March 2017 to €3.3m, due in large part to costs associated with the Company’s

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables is approximately equal to their fair 
value. The majority of trade and other receivables is denominated in Euros, with €637,000 of the trade and other 
receivables denominated in US Dollars (2016: €380,000).

The closing balance of the capital redemption reserve represents the amounts transferred from share capital on 
redemption of deferred shares in a previous period. The movement in the current period reflects obligations ceasing 
from the investment by BP Ventures into Tricoya Technologies Limited upon the finalisation of the full consortium.
The merger reserve arose prior to transition to IFRS when merger accounting was adopted.
The other reserve represents the amounts received for subsidiary share capital from non-controlling interests (see 
note 26).
26. Transactions with non–controlling interests

The majority of commitments under operating leases relate to the Group’s offices in the UK, The Netherlands and 
U.S.A. and land in The Netherlands which is adjacent to our plant.
During the period the Group entered agreements which are expected to result in new lease agreements 
commencing in the year ended 31 March 2018. This includes a lease relating to the land at the Tricoya plant Saltend 
site in Hull and a lease over land in Arnhem, following the sale to Bruil in the period. This lease agreement also 
includes substantial new warehouse and office facilities which are currently being constructed by Bruil. The building 
element will be accounted for as a finance lease – see note 28.
28. Commitments under finance leases
Agreements were reached in August 2011 for the sale and leaseback of the land and buildings in Arnhem for a total 
of €4m. €2.2m was received in 2011 with the remaining amount received in the following year, but accounted for as 
an operating lease.
In addition, during the prior period agreements were entered into for the lease of office fit-out and furniture for the 
London head office for a total of €0.4m.
In addition, in the current period agreements were entered into for the sale of the remaining plot of land completed 
in August 2016. Under the agreement with the purchaser, Bruil, they will construct and then lease to Accsys new 
warehouse and office facilities. The construction is not expected to complete until later in the new financial year 
and therefore no lease has been recognised in the period. A further lease agreement with Bruil was entered into 
in the period relating directly to infrastructure work associated with the expansion of the chemical plant. This has 
been accounted for as a finance lease, with a new asset and liability of €1.0m being recognised as at 31 March 2017.
These transactions have resulted in a finance lease creditor of €3.1m as at 31 March 2017.

Loan Notes:
On 29 March 2017 the Group issued £16.25 million (€18.38 million) of unsecured fixed rate loan notes, due 2021. 
£10.48 million of Loan Notes in principal were issued to Business Growth Fund (‘BGF’), with £5.77 million in 
principal issued to Volantis. The BGF loan notes are subject to a 7% fixed interest rate for the duration of their term 
and the Volantis loan notes are subject to a 7% fixed interest rate until 31 December 2018, with the interest rate 
fixed at 9% thereafter. Interest is rolled up until 31 December 2018 on both loans, with further roll up of interest on 
the Volantis loan until six–monthly redemption payments of both loans commence on 31 December 2021 and end 
on 30 June 2023.
BGF is an investment company that provides long–term equity funding to growing UK companies to enable them 
to execute their strategic plans. Volantis is a global asset management firm specialising in alternative investment 
strategies and is owned by Lombard Odier.
Rhodia Acetow Facility:
On 29 December 2016 the Group drew down €2 million of its €9.5 million term loan facility with Rhodia Acetow 
GmBH (formerly known as Solvay Acetow GmBH). The facility is to be used to design, procure and build an 
extension to the capacity of the Arnhem Plant, with a new reactor for the manufacture of Accoya at a design 
capacity of approximately 20,000m3. This facility is secured against existing Arnhem chemical plant and 
associated assets and is subject to interest at 7.5% per annum. At 31 March 2017, the Group had €2m (2016: 
€nil) borrowed under this facility. Interest is rolled up until quarterly repayment of the loan commences on 
29 December 2018.
Tricoya facility:
On 29 March 2017 the Company’s subsidiary (Tricoya Ventures UK Limited) entered into a six–year €17.2 million 
(€15 million net) finance facility agreement with the Royal Bank of Scotland Plc in respect of the construction 
and operation of the Hull Plant. The facility is secured by fixed and floating charges over all assets of Tricoya 
Ventures UK Limited. At 31 March 2017, the Group had €nil (2016: €nil) borrowed under the facility which will be 
drawn down, as required, once the funds provided by shareholders have been fully utilised. Facility repayments 
will commence 12 months after practical completion of the Hull Plant. Interest will accrue at Euribor plus a 
margin, with the margin ranging from 325 to 475 basis points.
Trade receivable and inventory facilities:
Trade receivables facility
In August 2016 the Group amended its working capital facility with ABN Commercial Finance, initially agreed 
in 2011. The facility is now a €3.0m credit facility secured upon the receivables and inventory of the Accoya 
manufacturing business.
Inventories facility
In August 2016 the Group amended its credit facility agreement with ABN AMRO Bank N.V., which had been 
initially agreed in 2013. The facility is a contingent liability facility enabling the Group to issue bank guarantees in 
order to support the working capital and other operational commitments of the Group with a limit of €1.5m.
Both facilities are subject to interest at 2% above the ABN AMRO base rate of 3.5% as at 31 March 2017 (2016: 
3.6%). At 31 March 2017, the Group had €nil (2016: €nil) borrowed under both of the facilities. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

30. Equity options
On 2 February 2016 the Company’s subsidiary, Tricoya Technologies Limited, issued Warrants to subscribe for up 
to 175,000 of its Series A Preference Shares in favour of BP Ventures Limited (100,000) and Titan Wood Limited 
(75,000) at a price of €2.00 per Warrant Share during the ‘Exercise Period’, which started on 2 February 2016 and 
runs to the earlier of either (i) 2 February 2021; (ii) the date of an Exit; and (iii) exercise of the Option.
On 29 March 2017, the Company announced the formation of the Tricoya Consortium and as part of this, funding 
was agreed with BGF and Volantis (see note 29). In addition to the issue of the Loan Notes the Company granted 
options over Ordinary Shares of the Company to BGF and Volantis exercisable at a price of £0.62 per Ordinary 
Share at any time until 31 December 2026 (the ‘Options’).
5,838,954 Options were issued to BGF and 3,217,383 Options were issued to Volantis. In addition, the Company 
agreed to use its reasonable endeavours to obtain shareholder authority at the subsequent General Meeting to grant 
to BGF a further option in respect of 2,610,218 Ordinary Shares and to grant to Volantis a further option in respect of 
1,438,284 Ordinary Shares (the ‘Additional Options’).
The necessary resolutions were passed at the General Meeting held on 21 April 2017 and accordingly the Additional 
Options are expected to be converted to Options, such that in total 13,104,839 Options will exist (with 8,449,172 
attributable to BGF and 4,655,667 attributable to Volantis). This represents 11.8% of the enlarged issued share 
capital of the Company, following the Firm Placing and Open offer having been completed in April 2017.
In addition, following the issue of Ordinary Shares by the Company resulting from the Firm Placing and Open offer 
the exercise price was adjusted to £0.5971 per Ordinary Share.
31. Financial instruments 
Finance lease
Agreements were reached in August 2016 for the sale and leaseback for the land in Arnhem resulting in proceeds 
of €4.2m received in the period. A resulting gain of €635,000 was recognised as a result of the book value of 
the land being lower than the sale price. Under the arrangements, the landlord has agreed to construct a new 
warehouse and office building which will be connected to Accsys’ existing manufacturing site. This building  
will be built by the landlord and leased to Accsys over a 20 year period with further option to renew. The  
landlord is the same landlord that Accsys sold land and buildings to in 2011 and 2012 associated with the  
existing manufacturing plant.
Finance lease creditors of: €1,869,000 as at 31 March 2017 (2016: €1,977,000) relates to the sale and leaseback of 
land and buildings in Arnhem in 2011 and 2012 over 15 year lease terms and €255,000 as at 31 March 2017 (2016: 
€325,000) relates to a lease of the London head office.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while 
maximising the return to shareholders.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to owners of the 
parent Company, comprising share capital, reserves and accumulated losses.
The Board reviews the capital structure on a regular basis. As part of that review, the Board considers the cost of 
capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. Based on the review, the Group will balance its overall 
capital structure through new share issues and the raising of debt if required.
No final dividend is proposed in 2017 (2016: €nil). The Board deems it prudent for the Company to protect as 
strong a statement of financial position as possible during the current phase of the Company’s growth strategy. 101 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

rating of AA).
All assets and liabilities mature within one year except for the finance leases, for which details are given in note 28 
and loans, for which details are given in note 29.
Trade payables are payable on various terms, typically not longer than 30 days.
Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and 
interest rates.
Financial risk management objectives
The Group’s treasury policy is structured to ensure that adequate financial resources are available for the 
development of its business whilst managing its currency, interest rate, counterparty credit and liquidity risks.  
The Group’s treasury strategy and policy are developed centrally and approved by the Board.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group’s functional currency is the Euro with the majority of operating costs and balances denominated in 
Euros. An increasing proportion of costs will be incurred in pounds sterling as the Group’s activities associated 
with the Tricoya plant in Hull increase, although future revenues will be in Euros or other currencies. The group’s 
Loan Notes, which were issued to fund these UK based operations, are denominated in pounds sterling. A smaller 
proportion of expenditure is incurred in US dollars and pounds sterling. In addition some raw materials, while 
priced in Euros, are sourced from countries which are not within the Eurozone. The Group monitors any potential 
underlying exposure to other exchange rates. The Group does not currently enter into any hedging arrangements, 
although will continue to monitor appropriateness of doing so.
Interest rate risk management
The Group’s borrowings are limited to fixed rate loans with BGF, Volantis and Rhodia Acetow, together with the 
sale and leaseback of the Arnhem land and buildings, and the lease of the office fit out and furniture in London. 
The interest rate in respect of the unused loan facility agreed with RBS Bank is variable, based on Euribor plus a 
variable margin. Therefore the Group is not significantly exposed to interest rate risk in relation to financial liabilities. 
Surplus funds are invested in short term interest rate deposits to reduce exposure to changes in interest rates. The 
Group does not currently enter into any hedging arrangements, although will review the need to do so in respect of 
the variable interest rate loan facility with RBS Bank. ACCSYS TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 102
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
for the year ending 31 March 2017
31. Financial instruments continued
Credit risk management
The Group is exposed to credit risk due to its trade receivables due from customers and cash deposits with 
financial institutions. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to their carrying amount recognised at 
the balance sheet date.
The Group ensures that sales are made to customers with an appropriate credit history to reduce the risk where 
this is considered necessary. The Directors consider the trade receivables at year end to be of good credit quality 
including those that are past due (see note 22). The Group is not exposed to any significant credit risk exposure 
in respect of any single counterparty or any group of counterparties with similar characteristics other than the 
balances which are provided for as described in note 22.
The Group has credit risk from financial institutions. Cash deposits are placed with a group of financial institutions 
with suitable credit ratings in order to manage credit risk with any one financial institution.
Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has built an appropriate liquidity 
risk management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long term funding and 
liquidity management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and 
banking facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profile  
of financial assets and liabilities.
Fair value of financial instruments
In the opinion of the Directors, there is no material difference between the book value and the fair value of all 
financial assets and financial liabilities.

33. Post Balance Sheet Events
On 29 March 2017, Accsys announced the details of a proposed Firm Placing and Open Offer to raise proceeds of 
up to approximately €14,023,550 (before expenses) through the issue of 17,400,000 Firm Placing Shares and up to 
2,923,986 Open Offer Shares, at the Offer Price of €0.69 per New Ordinary Share.
The Open Offer closed for acceptances on 20 April 2017. Accsys received valid acceptances under the Open 
Offer and its Excess Application Facility in respect of 12,965,475 New Ordinary Shares, representing an over-
subscription in excess of four times the 2,923,986 New Ordinary Shares available under the Open Offer and Excess 
Application Facility. As applications under the Excess Application Facility could not be satisfied in full, such New 
Ordinary Shares available were allocated in such manner as the Directors determined, in their absolute discretion in 
accordance with the terms set out in the Prospectus.
The gross proceeds raised under the Open Offer were therefore the maximum amount of €2.0m. Accordingly, the 
aggregate amount raised pursuant to the Firm Placing and Open Offer was €14.0m before expenses, being €12.3m 
net of expenses. 103 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
to the members of Accsys Technologies PLC 
Report on the parent company financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion the Accsys Technologies PLC’s 
parent company financial statements (the ‘financial 
statements’):
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the parent 
company’s affairs as at 31 March 2017;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice; and
•  have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements (the ‘Annual Report’) 
comprise:
• the Company balance sheet as at 31 March 2017;
•  the notes to the Company financial statements, 
which include a summary of significant accounting 
policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented 
elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the 
notes to the financial statements. These are cross-
referenced from the financial statements and are 
identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation of the financial statements 
is United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising 
FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’, and 
applicable law (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
In applying the financial reporting framework, 
the Directors have made a number of subjective 
judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they 
have made assumptions and considered future events.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the 
course of the audit:
•  the information given in the Strategic Report and 
the Directors’ Report for the financial year for 
which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements; and
•  the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have 
been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding 
of the parent company and its environment obtained 
in the course of the audit, we are required to report if 
we have identified any material misstatements in the 
Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report. We have 
nothing to report in this respect.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the 
course of the audit:
•  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Other matters on which we are required 
to report by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information and 
explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion:
•  we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit; or
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept 
by the parent company, or returns adequate for our 
audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or
•  the financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited  
are not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of 
directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility.
Responsibilities for the financial statements 
and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 65, the directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared 
for and only for the Company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this 
report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. ACCSYS TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 104
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK 
and Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of:
•  whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed;
•  the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and
•  the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing 
the directors’ judgements against available evidence, 
forming our own judgements, and evaluating the 
disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and 
other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider 
necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw 
conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing 
the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or 
a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course 
of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we 
consider the implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial 
statements of Accsys Technologies PLC for the year 
ended 31 March 2017.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ending 31 March 2017
1. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These 
policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of Accsys Technologies PLC (‘the Company’) have been prepared in accordance 
with Financial Reporting Standard 101, ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101) for the year ended 31 March 2017. 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation 
of land and buildings and derivative financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or 
loss, and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires the use of certain critical accounting 
estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company’s 
accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions 
and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in note 3 of the Group financial statements.
The following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have been applied in the preparation of these financial 
statements, in accordance with FRS 101:
•  The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 101, and has not disclosed information required 
by the standard as the consolidated financial statements, in which the Company is included, provide 
equivalent disclosures for the Group under IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments: disclosures’.
•  The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 101 and not disclosed related party 
transactions with wholly owned subsidiary undertakings.
•  The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 101 and the requirements of IAS 7 
to not disclose a Statement of Cash Flows.
As permitted under section 408 of the Act the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account 
for the year. The loss for the financial year was €1,268,000 (2016: loss of €970,000). The results of the parent 
Company are disclosed in the reserves reconciliation in note 12.
Going concern
After making enquiries, and taking into account the proceeds from the Firm Placing and Open offer which was 
successfully completed on 23 April 2017, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least the next 12 months. For this reason, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in the financial statements.
Investments
Except where a reliable fair value cannot be obtained, unlisted shares held by the Group are stated at historical 
cost less any provision for impairment. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly 
in equity, with the exception of impairment losses which are recognised directly in the profit or loss. Where 
investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the 
profit or loss in the year. Where it is not possible to obtain a reliable fair value, these investments are held at cost 
less provision for impairment.
Share based payments
When the parent entity grants options over equity instruments directly to the employees of a subsidiary 
undertaking, then in the parent company financial statements the effect of the share based payment is capitalised 
as part of the investment in the subsidiary as a capital contribution, with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using a modified Black Scholes model, taking into account the 
terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted 
to reflect the actual number of share options that vest only where vesting is dependent upon the satisfaction of 
service and non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to 
vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is 
based on the number of options which eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of 
the options granted. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is provided in full in respect of taxation deferred by timing differences between the treatment 
of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes except for deferred tax assets which are only recognised to 
the extent that the Company anticipates making sufficient taxable profits in the future to absorb the reversal of the 
underlying timing differences. Deferred tax balances are not discounted. 107 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Dividends
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are recognised when 
paid. Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment charged. Cost 
includes the original purchase price of the asset as well as costs of bringing the asset to the working condition and 
location of its intended use. Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual 
value of each asset, except freehold land, over its expected useful life on a straight line basis, as follows:
Office equipment: Between 20% and 50%
Financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities
Trade payables and other financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
2. Profit and loss account
A loss of €1,268,000 (2016: loss of €970,000) is dealt with in the Company financial statements of Accsys 
Technologies PLC. The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under section 408 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and not presented a profit and loss account for the Company. Fees payable to the 
Company’s auditors for the audit of the Company’s annual financial statements was €65,000 (2016: €74,000).  
Fees payable to the Company’s auditors for the audit of the Company’s subsidiaries was €112,000 (2016: €106,000) 
and fees payable for other services were €110,000 (2016: €134,000).
The information disclosed in the Group’s consolidated financial statements under IFRS2 ‘Share-based payment’ 
is within note 15, providing further information regarding the Company’s equity settled share based payment 
arrangements.
3. Employees
The Company had no employees other than Executive Directors (2017: 3 and 2016: 3) during the current or prior 
year. Non-executive Directors received emoluments in respect of their services to the Company of €242,000 (2016: 
€280,000). Details have been included in the Remuneration Report. The Company did not operate any pension 
schemes during the current or preceding year.

Accsys Technologies PLC has previously purchased a total of 21,666,734 unlisted ordinary shares in Diamond 
Wood China. On 23 December 2016, Cleantech Building Materials PLC acquired Diamond Wood China. On 
19 April 2017 Cleantech Building Materials acquired the 21,666,734 shares previously owned by the Company 
and in return the Company has been issued with 520,001 shares in Cleantech Building Materials PLC, a listed 
company trading on the Nasdaq First North market in Copenhagen.
The carrying value of the investment is carried at cost less any provision for impairment, rather than at its fair value, 
as there was no active market for these shares as at 31 March 2017, and there is significant uncertainty over the 
future of Diamond Wood, and as such a reliable fair value cannot be calculated. 109 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Amounts owed by Group undertakings 150,480 130,426
Prepayments and accrued income 1,410 186
151,890 130,612
The balance of amounts owed by Group undertakings increased in the period largely as a result of the proceeds 
of the Loan Notes from BGF and Volantis which were invested by way of intercompany loans to the Company’s 
immediate subsidiary, Titan Wood Limited, which invested the net proceeds in Tricoya Technologies Limited. See 
note 9 of the Group financial statements.
The amounts owed by Group undertakings are payable on demand, however the Company has indicated it has no 
intention of demanding payment within the next twelve months. The Directors have considered the recoverability 
of the balances, taking into account the net assets as well as the long term expected performance of the 
subsidiaries and do not consider that any impairment is currently required. However, a degree of risk remains over 
the carrying value given the relative uncertainty of the future results.

15. Deferred taxation
The Company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of €1.2m (2016: €1.1m) which is largely in respect of trading 
losses. The deferred tax asset has not been recognised due to the uncertainty of the timing of future expected 
profits of the fellow subsidiary (in which the Company is in the same tax group) attributable to licensing activities.
16. Post Balance Sheet Events
On 29 March 2017, Accsys announced the details of a proposed Firm Placing and Open Offer to raise proceeds of 
up to approximately €14,023,550 (before expenses) through the issue of 17,400,000 Firm Placing Shares and up to 
2,923,986 Open Offer Shares, at the Offer Price of €0.69 per New Ordinary Share.
The Open Offer closed for acceptances on 20 April 2017. Accsys received valid acceptances under the Open 
Offer and its Excess Application Facility in respect of 12,965,475 New Ordinary Shares, representing an over-
subscription in excess of four times the 2,923,986 New Ordinary Shares available under the Open Offer and Excess 
Application Facility. As applications under the Excess Application Facility could not be satisfied in full, such New 
Ordinary Shares available were allocated in such manner as the Directors determined, in their absolute discretion in 
accordance with the terms set out in the Prospectus.
The gross proceeds raised under the Open Offer were therefore the maximum amount of €2.0m. Accordingly, the 
aggregate amount raised pursuant to the Firm Placing and Open Offer was €14.0m before expenses, being €12.3m 
net of expenses. ACCSYS TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 112
