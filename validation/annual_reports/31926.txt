A large and varied market
The UK building market is worth over £60bn. It covers both public and private sector 
work and includes a range of sectors including commercial, defence, education and 
health. Kier has a strong record across all areas, with leading positions in the 
health and education sectors and growing positions in new markets, such as 
aviation and biotech. With its regional office network, Kier is able to act as a local 
builder with local knowledge, anywhere across the country. Additional complementary 
opportunities exist in the facilities management sector.
Growing from strength
Even in areas where Kier is strong, there 
are opportunities to grow. For example in 
the health sector, where Kier is already 
the UK’s largest builder, we increased our 
penetration of the private healthcare 
market during the year by securing one of 
the four positions on the £500m Private 
Investment Construction (PIC) healthcare 
framework and commencing the 
development of a number of new private 
hospital developments.

6 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 Broadmoor Hospital, Berkshire 
Client benefit
The £242m Broadmoor Hospital redevelopment will transform the 150-year-old 
high security mental health hospital into a modern, fit-for-purpose environment 
with accommodation for 210 patients. Construction commenced in early 2014,  
and includes a two-storey main entrance building, three patient ward blocks, a 
three-storey central multi-function building, an energy centre and a new distribution 
road. Special consideration had to be given to the build given patients remained 
on site throughout the redevelopment. The construction utilises Kier’s bespoke 
off-site modular fabrication system, significantly reducing the project timetable. 
Commenting on the development, Vivenne Mowatt, Redevelopment Programme 
Director for Broadmoor, said: “Kier took the time and made a real effort to get 
to know the local community and address any community issues – that really 
made a difference.”

  Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 7 The UK Government has acknowledged that investment in 
infrastructure is critical to supporting economic prosperity 
for a growing population.
Significant infrastructure opportunities
The UK National Infrastructure and Construction Pipeline 
has £502bn of projects across sectors where Kier is strong, 
including road, rail, power, gas, water and telecoms. £201bn of 
this is beyond 2020/21, providing longevity as well as scale to 
the pipeline.
Market positions in key sectors
Kier has a leading market position combined with a track 
record in each of the major sectors covered by the National 
Infrastructure and Construction Pipeline. This now includes the 
telecoms and utilities market, following the acquisition of 
McNicholas which also significantly strengthened our position 
in the power and gas utilities markets. We already have a 
strong track record in power stations and have been working 
on Hinkley Point C since 2012.
In the transport sector, Kier is the leading provider of 
maintenance services for Highways England’s strategic road 
network, and has a leading position in the local authority 
highways market. Kier also has a strong track record in the major 
rail sector, for example Crossrail, and has recently with our joint 
venture partners, been awarded £1.5bn of contracts on HS2.

Economic benefit
The successful use of rapid set repair concrete on the M6 Rushall Canal and 
North East Spur viaducts enabled critical structural repairs to be completed within 
24 hours over a 56-hour weekend programme. Consequently, an eight week 
programme was reduced to five weekends. The use of this latest innovation 
created a faster programme, minimising traffic delays and reducing the risk to the 
workforce and general public.

  Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 9 The UK continues to experience a housing shortage.  
Kier has a range of house building and maintenance services 
which can address this need.
Turn to pages 20-21  
for more information
A structural shortage of housing
There is a persistent shortage of new housing in the UK, with 
supply consistently falling short of the annual requirement, 
estimated at a minimum of 210,000. This is likely to worsen 
as the UK population expands. Despite UK Government 
initiatives to help people buy houses, the demand for new 
affordable houses will continue, as will the need to maintain 
the existing social housing stock of 4.1m homes. 
All aspects of affordable housing
Kier is a leading provider of affordable housing, with 
capabilities across the value chain – from investing in land 
and development to maintaining stock for housing 
associations and local authorities. Kier combines the 
commerciality of a private, open-market developer with an 
understanding of the needs of local authorities and housing 
providers and the dynamics and pressures of the public 
sector. As such, it is able to adapt and create multi-tenure 
developments and models appropriate to differing 
client requirements.

Chairman’s statement
Good progress 
has been 
made against 
our Vision 
2020 strategy
I am honoured and delighted to be the 
newly appointed Chairman of Kier.
Group revenue
1, 2
 for the year ended 30 June 2017 increased by 
5% to £4.27bn (2016: £4.08bn) and underlying operating profit
1
 
increased by 3% to £146m (2016: £141m). Underlying profit 
before tax
1
at £126m (2016: £116m) represented a 8% increase. 
Reported profit before tax of £26m (2016: a loss of £35m) 
includes non-underlying items, predominantly relating to the 
disposal of Mouchel Consulting and the portfolio simplification 
programme. The underlying basic earnings per share
1
 from 
continuing operations of 106.8 pence (2016: 99.5 pence) has 
increased by 7%. The Group’s net debt
4
 at 30 June 2017 was 
£110m (2016: £99m), at the lower end of expectations, 
following strong working capital management during the year. 
This performance has maintained a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 
less than 1x, in line with our Vision 2020 target.
After the year end, the Group completed its acquisition of 
McNicholas Limited, which strengthens the Group’s presence in 
the utilities and infrastructure services market. This acquisition 
builds on Kier’s strategy to maintain its leading positions in 
chosen markets. It is a highly complementary addition to our 
current utilities business and enhances our presence in the power, 
rail and telecoms markets.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a full year dividend for the year ended 
30 June 2017 of 67.5 pence per share (2016: 64.5 pence per 
share), up 5%, reflecting the Board’s confidence in the Group’s 
prospects and intention to increase dividend cover towards 2x by 
2020. Subject to shareholder approval, the final dividend will be 
paid on 1 December 2017 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 29 September 2017. As an alternative to 
the cash dividend, shareholders will be offered the option to 
participate in a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP).
The macro environment
UK Government policy continues to support investment in upgrading 
the UK’s infrastructure, driving economic growth both nationally and 
regionally. The devolution of funding and decision-making, both 
locally and regionally, is now starting to gather pace with the 
establishment of mayoral authorities and increased collaboration 
between local authorities. Despite the uncertainties of Brexit, we 
have a strong position in a number of key sectors and our breadth 
of capabilities positions us well to address our clients’ needs.

On 30 August 2017, Phil White CBE stepped down from the Board 
as Chairman. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Phil for 
his contribution to the Group over the past ten years in which he 
has overseen the growth and change within the Company. I know 
many Kier employees have benefited from his counsel. Personally, 
I would like to thank Phil for his support during my induction and 
transition into my new role, which I took up on 1 September 2017. 
I look forward to working with the Board on the Group’s next stage 
of development.
Results
I am pleased to present the results for the year ended 
30 June 2017. This year was an important one for Kier as we 
continued to make good progress against our strategy, Vision 
2020. Over the last five years, Kier has tripled in size resulting 
in significant change in the business as new processes and 
systems are put in place and its portfolio of capabilities has 
changed. This year, we have substantially completed our two-year 
portfolio simplification programme focused on streamlining and 
simplifying the Group’s operations, allowing investment in the core 
businesses for the future. The strength of Kier lies in its teams 
and their ability to provide clients with a depth and breadth of 
capabilities across a number of specialist fields positioning us 
as the ideal partner to collaborate with.
12 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 Outlook
Kier has successfully grown its reputation as a company that can 
consistently deliver. Its success in the marketplace to date has 
shown it is trusted by its clients and supply chain.
Our underlying performance for the year was good. Having 
simplified our portfolio, the Group is more focused and able to 
pursue growth ambitions in our three core markets; building, 
infrastructure and housing, which now represent 90% of the 
Group’s revenue and profit. We continue to invest in the business 
to improve our operational efficiency, providing a robust platform 
on which to take advantage of the strong long-term fundamentals 
in these core markets. 
Our Construction and Services order books of £9.5bn, together 
with our c.£2bn property development and residential pipelines, 
provide good long-term visibility of our future work. This visibility, 
coupled with our healthy balance sheet, provides us with 
confidence in achieving our Vision 2020 strategic targets.
Philip Cox CBE
Chairman
20 September 2017
Corporate governance
Kier remains committed to the highest standards of corporate 
governance. The Board and its committees play a key role in 
guiding the company and setting the tone for how the business 
operates. I believe it is of paramount importance that we have the 
right skills set on the Board to steer the Group strategy for the 
long term. The Board is also supportive of the Group’s ongoing 
focus on effective risk management, corporate responsibility and 
the value our operations bring to regional economic growth.
On 1 July 2016, Constance Baroudel joined the Board and 
became the Chair of the Remuneration Committee, replacing 
Amanda Mellor who left the Board after last year’s annual general 
meeting. Constance brings significant financial experience and a 
detailed understanding of strategy in light of her present role at 
First Group.
Full details of our corporate governance can be found on pages 
58 to 104.
Our people
The safety and, very importantly, the wellbeing of our people 
remain a priority and I am pleased to report that during this year 
we once again reduced our accident incidence rate (AIR) and rolled 
out campaigns to employees to raise awareness of good health 
and wellbeing.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank our employees who 
are so committed to making Kier the company it is. Since joining, 
I have already felt the pride and professionalism that our teams 
display in their delivery to our clients.

Chief Executive’s strategic review
We have 
strengthened 
our positions 
in our core 
markets
In 2017, we made good progress 
operating in our core markets: building, 
infrastructure and housing. The two-year 
portfolio simplification programme has 
enabled the Group to strengthen its 
market-leading positions, laying robust 
foundations which improve our efficiency 
and provide a platform for growth.
How would you summarise Kier’s performance 
in 2017?
From a strategic perspective, 2017 was a good year for 
Kier. We continued to simplify and streamline the Group, 
which enabled us to focus on our key clients and chosen 
markets and position ourselves for the future. Operationally, our 
core businesses continued to grow their market positions, 
especially the building and highways businesses.
Financially, 2017 also confirmed the strength of our underlying 
business. We saw organic growth in revenue and operating profit 
across the Group, and achieved a net debt position which was at 
the lower end of market forecasts. At year end, our Construction 
and Services order book was approximately £9.5bn including the 
McNicholas order book, which secures around 90% of our work for 
2018. Our Residential housing business performed well, and our 
Property division pipeline expanded to around £1.4bn, which 
will provide excellent development opportunities over the next 
ten years. 
Overall, our performance in 2017 provided further validation of our 
core market verticals – building, infrastructure and housing – we 
have chosen to pursue. These positions now firmly underpin the 
future direction of the Group and support our proposition of Invest, 
Build and Maintain. I believe we have the ability to be the UK 
market leader in these markets, and to exploit cross-selling 
opportunities between our businesses to the benefit of our clients.
What has the portfolio simplification programme 
involved and what are the implications for the 
business?
We’ve been engaged in the process of portfolio 
simplification since 2015. It has involved closing 
operations in territories where new business prospects 
have significantly declined, and selling businesses that were not 
aligned with the strategic direction of the Group, and/or did not 
deliver our minimum ROCE hurdle of 15%. For example, during 
2017 we closed down our operations in the Caribbean and in 
Hong Kong, and completed the sales of Mouchel Consulting 
and Biogen.

14 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 These activities were challenging and, in this respect, it was a 
busy year, as we undertook these changes while keeping our core 
businesses on track. Importantly, our core operations not only 
traded well but managed to gain market share and deepen client 
relationships. We also maintained the strength of the Group with 
a positive cash performance and a well-controlled pension deficit, 
creating a robust year end balance sheet. The financial impact 
of the portfolio simplification programme, together with certain 
other non-underlying items on the Group’s 2017 results,  
was a non-underlying charge of £75m (see page 54 for more 
information). The programme also generated net cash of £67m, 
the significant majority of which was invested in the Property and 
Residential divisions.
With the portfolio simplification programme now substantially 
complete, I believe we have emerged from this period a more 
agile, efficient and focused organisation with a growth trajectory 
ahead of us.
Given the scale of the exceptional charges in the 
2017 results, how has this impacted on your risk 
appetite, particularly when operating overseas?
In simple terms, it’ s important to know your clients and 
your supply chain, and have your best people available who 
understand the risks, the nature of the contract and its 
terms and conditions. The Group continues to operate overseas in 
the Middle East and Australia. While geography and local knowledge 
are critical, the principles of risk management still apply. I’m very 
mindful that one poorly performing project can impact on our 
profitability and importantly our reputation. The Caribbean 
operations have demonstrated how significant losses can be 
incurred and over the past three years we have implemented a 
very rigorous and disciplined bidding process. This, in addition to 
our review of procedures during project delivery, will underpin 
consistent operating margins and further strengthen our 
client relationships. With a broad portfolio, we are able to mitigate 
the challenges which can arise from the contracting environment.
How was the Group’s safety performance in 
2017 and how will you continue to improve 
your safety ethos?
Safety continues to be a key priority. During 2017, we 
broadened our approach to incorporate the health and 
wellbeing of our employees. We achieved an accident 
incidence rate (AIR) of 130, an improvement of 38% compared 
to 2016 and well below the average industry benchmark of 480.
Our performance in 2017 was the culmination of recent efforts to 
enhance our safety record. Our goal is to reduce our AIR to zero by 
2020, and as we continue to bring this rate down the challenge 
will be how to eliminate minor slips, trips, falls and similar 
incidents. To this end, we are exploring innovative new ways of 
communicating safety messages and engaging our employees and 
suppliers. We encourage them to share good ideas and improve 
our safety culture across all projects and contracts.
In 2017, we increased the number of Visible Leadership Tours to 
help refocus attention on safety. We also increased the coverage 
of our safety training and behavioural change initiatives across 
the Group. Ultimately, safety comes down to attitude. We run our 
sites in line with a set of core principles we refer to as the ‘Five 
Basics’ (see page 32 for more information). These principles are 
designed to promote awareness, accountability and rigour, and to 
discourage people from taking risks and shortcuts in their 
day-to-day work. 
The recent increase in fines for health and safety incidents, 
following the introduction of new sentencing guidelines in 2016, 
was a key consideration this year. In light of the new requirements, 
in 2017, we recorded a provision of £8m in this year’s results to 
cover potentially increased fines for historic safety incidents. 
However, while we support the intention and principle of the 
regime, we are mindful that the fines levied to date by the Health 
and Safety Executive have been wide ranging in value. We will 
therefore continue to monitor the situation carefully.
What sets Kier apart from the  
competition?
There are very few UK competitors who can match the 
breadth and scale of services we offer. Invest, Build and 
Maintain is at the heart of our business and demonstrates 
the range of services and operational flexibility we have within the 
Group. Indeed, we can take on any asset or project and meet a 
client’s funding, development, construction and maintenance 
requirements. We can do this either as a single activity or as a 
combination of these activities, whether it’s a property 
development, a new school, road construction or a facilities 
maintenance package.
Today, we encourage different businesses within the Group to 
pursue business development opportunities together. From 
customer research carried out during 2017, we know that our 
clients value collaborative partnerships that support their 
objectives. It’s not a one-size-fits-all approach. It’s about offering 
core expertise reinforced by the wider scale of the Group. Our 
unique strength is that we can offer add-on capabilities, either 
from the outset or as projects evolve, which in turn increases the 
depth of our client relationships. Currently c.30% of our revenue is 
generated from clients that work with two or more businesses in 
the Group, a trend we aim to increase.
Our strategy is focused on organic growth. We seek 
complementary merger and acquisition opportunities which will 
expand our offering and we invest in the development of the 
enlarged business. For example, Kier has a relationship with 
Highways England which was enhanced with the Mouchel 
acquisition. McNicholas, acquired in July 2017, further enhances 
our presence in power, rail and telecoms, making us a top three 
player in the UK utilities sector. Most importantly, Kier is a 
company with a good track record of delivery and is trusted by our 
clients and partners. This has played a major role in our ability to 
deliver day-in day-out.
What about Brexit and the current political 
uncertainty in the UK – how will these 
developments affect the business?
We derive strength not only from the scale of our business, 
but from the nature of the work we undertake. Firstly, we 
specialise in markets that are key focus areas for the 
UK Government, such as housing and infrastructure, where 
investment in new build or maintenance is likely to continue for 
some time. Secondly, in our Services division especially, we deliver 
essential every-day services. These services – for example school 
and hospital extensions, road network maintenance – are required 
all year round, regardless of the prevailing political agenda. This 
means we can maintain operational stability and pursue growth. 
Even with major projects that require government intervention and 
approval, our position is somewhat protected.

Strategic Report
Chief Executive’s strategic review continued
For example, if there were delays in major capital works due to 
Brexit, funds are likely to be redeployed into other areas – such as 
power distribution and utilities – where our core infrastructure 
businesses operate. The recent awards of the £1.5bn HS2 
projects to the CEK joint venture, in which we have a one-third 
share, shows the political commitment to infrastructure 
investment. There has been lots of discussion about the 
availability of labour and skills. To date, we have experienced no 
material change in the supply of labour. However, we are 
monitoring this situation particularly within the supply chain.
How would you define the Kier  
company culture?
At Kier, our people really live our values – Collaborative, 
Enthusiastic and Forward-thinking. This should come as no 
surprise, because our people chose these values based 
on the qualities that matter most to them. When I’m out in the 
business, I’m really pleased to see the pride our people take in 
their work, and in the legacy that we continue to build.
We work hard to maintain an open and inclusive culture where 
everyone feels welcome and can be themselves. Indeed, new 
joiners often comment on how open and welcoming Kier is. This is 
something we are keen to build on. We want to encourage people 
of all ages and backgrounds to join us, thrive and progress. Our 
Balanced Business Network and recently launched Shaping Your 
World campaign, are great examples of how we are raising our 
profile among wider groups of potential recruits.
As we grow, we want to retain the best aspects of our culture while 
evolving it to reflect the changes in our business. When we 
consider mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures, we think 
carefully about cultural fit and combination, and whether a new 
business can strengthen or enhance what we have. It’s also 
important that we keep listening to our colleagues to understand 
their experiences of working at Kier. We want our people to feel 
confident that we will take action to improve things where we can. 
Our culture is hugely important to us, and is a key factor in 
attracting and retaining the people we need to drive the business 
forward. And, of course, our people are at the heart of this culture 
and make Kier what it is today. Dating back to the 1980s, our 
history is one of employee ownership, and over the years this has 
created an environment in which every individual takes a deep and 
genuine interest in the performance of the company.

  Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 17 Strategic Report
Chief Executive’s strategic review continued
How, in these uncertain times, do you ensure you 
have the right flow of people into the business?
We know that homegrown skills and labour will be critical 
in the years ahead, which is why we’re fully committed to 
making our company and our sector as attractive as 
possible. To this end, in September 2017 we launched Shaping 
Your World, which informs pupils aged 11-15 about careers in 
construction and the wider built environment. As part of this 
campaign, we have created the ‘Kier 1% pledge’ which commits 
that over 200 Kier employees will visit schools as our 
ambassadors to talk about the diverse career paths on offer 
across the Group, from quantity surveying to civil engineering. 
This activity will also help to recruit older students for our 
apprenticeship programmes and graduate schemes.
As a member of the 5% Club, we also ensure that 5% of our 
workforce is made up of apprentices and graduates. We have a 
strong track record of providing dedicated and tailored 
development to our existing employees, giving them the career 
support and guidance they require. 
Personally, what highlights or events stood out 
for you during 2017?
Throughout the year, we demonstrated that we can grow 
both organically and through acquisition. The substantial 
completion of the portfolio simplification programme was a 
significant achievement, as it enables us to move forward with 
clear focus and direction. We have invested in systems and 
infrastructure such as a new finance shared service centre in 
Manchester which creates important back-office support enabling 
the business to deliver and grow. The performance of our highways 
business also underscored the viability of our model.
What were the major corporate responsibility 
highlights of 2017?
I’m pleased to report that we made good progress in 
several non-financial areas. We made real progress in 
terms of diversity, or what we call ‘creating a more 
balanced business’. This year, for the first time, Kier employees 
participated with industry colleagues in Pride London, marching 
under the banner of ‘#buildingequality’. We also continued to 
extend opportunities to people who may find it more challenging to 
enter employment. These efforts include initiatives for ex-
offenders, school leavers from disadvantaged backgrounds, 
former service personnel and workplace returnees. We are also 
proud to support the Government-backed Apprentice Diversity 
Network initiative. During the year, we focused on activities which 
help our people, our teams and the communities in which we 
operate. Highlights included the Kier Awards, held for the first time 
at a national level, to recognise outstanding examples of 
employees living the Kier values. 
We also held our second corporate responsibility (CR) forum for 
shareholders, during which we articulated our CR commitments 
and activities, including our environmental achievements, safety 
performance and social value initiatives. By communicating our 
efforts in this way, we have successfully engaged investors and 
demonstrated our commitment to value creation beyond the 
bottom line. The increase in our Business in the Community (BITC) 
score from 87% to 91% is a clear demonstration of the progress 
we have made.
We remain focused on delivering our Vision 2020 strategy – continuing to develop the 
business remains a priority.

18 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 The end of June saw the tragic events at Grenfell Tower. We have 
been reviewing the use of cladding and projects undertaken in the 
building business and on clients’ estates where Kier provides 
either maintenance or facilities management services. The 
construction of high-rise residential tower blocks is not a core 
activity of Kier, but the discussion relating to cladding has 
extended to other types of developments and therefore 
we continue to work with clients to address their challenges.
What are your priorities for the new financial 
year?
We remain committed to delivering on our Vision 2020 
strategy, and achieving our financial and non-financial 
goals. I am particularly focused on improving the quality of 
our products and services while increasing our efficiency. I believe 
that by looking at new ways to share ideas and solve problems, 
we can develop Group-wide solutions which will provide further 
growth opportunities. 
In the coming year, we will establish a new £1m innovation seed 
fund for our teams to help make this a reality. Our newly-created 
Innovation team and the #forwardthinking@Kier plan will be critical 
to this process, as we embrace the technological developments 
that are occurring across the Group and in the marketplace. 
Consequently, we have updated one of our strategic priorities to 
reflect this focus – embracing innovation and technology across 
our business. However, as well as new investment, we continue to 
look at ways to transfer technology already used in other markets 
to our businesses such as virtual and augmented reality. We are 
looking at new ways that technology can help our clients deliver, 
for example, smart recycling where data collection can help 
councils understand the behaviours of their customers and 
intelligent technology in homes and offices which provides data 
that helps you understand the wear and tear of living and working 
in buildings.
What’s the outlook for the business, and what 
are your immediate priorities?
Following the portfolio simplification programme, we are in 
a strong position to pursue our growth strategy with a 
focus on organic growth. Within this strategy, we have set 
ourselves the goal of increasing our operating profits, on average, 
by 10% every year, and in 2017 we saw ongoing improvement in 
the quality of our earnings and margins. 
Looking ahead, we will focus on operating as efficiently as 
possible. In 2017, we invested £40m in our back-of-house 
capabilities to ensure we can optimise our performance and 
successfully assimilate all future acquisitions. The continued 
roll-out of our £70m back-office system investment, and the 
integration of our customer relationship management system, will 
provide a robust platform from which we can further streamline 
processes and drive innovation through the business. These 
investments will stand us in good stead as we move forward. 
I believe the general outlook for the business is positive, with a 
strong order book, healthy balance sheet, and buoyant core 
markets supported by government policy. 
We are now ready to take the next step on our journey, and I look 
to the future with confidence.

Our markets
Aligned to fundamentals
Demographics driving key Kier sectors
UK Government spending on schools, hospitals, rail and road 
capacity, and housing are all fundamentally based on changing 
demographics. As well as the overall UK population growing,  
in the 10 years to 2024 the number of people over 75 years old 
will increase by 35% and the number of school-age children, 
aged 5 to 15, will increase by 13%. Whilst the consequent need 
for increasing capacity in our infrastructure (including social 
infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals) will persist 
regardless of changes in Government policy, Kier’s ability to 
invest in, build and maintain assets means that it will be able 
to adjust its offer to reflect changes in Government priorities.
There is cross-party support for UK infrastructure spend,  
both to create this capacity and as a fiscal stimulus. Whilst we  
have seen some delays in decision-making, as in the case of 
Hinkley Point, the award of HS2 contracts and the recent 
announcement of the Government’s support for Crossrail 2  
has shown that infrastructure is a priority area. Kier’s business 
portfolio and capabilities cover most areas of the National 
Infrastructure and Construction Pipeline, which includes power 
and gas networks, nuclear power stations, HS2, broadband 
and transport infrastructure.
Continued demand for new affordable housing
There is a structural shortage of housing in the UK that shows 
no sign of abating. The lowest annual estimate of new homes 
required is 210,000, but estimates vary up to 300,000. 
Demand continues to be strong, with the private development 
market maintaining sales rates at expected levels. Although 
certain parts of the house buying market, such as the secondary 
housing market, have slowed, demand in our core market sectors, 
such as mixed tenure, has been resilient and we reasonably 
expect this to continue.

Technology is central to many sectors and to modern living, and is 
increasingly impacting built environment-related markets. We are 
actively pursuing and investing in market opportunities created by 
technological change. For example, the shift in the retail sector 
towards online shopping opens up opportunities to invest in and 
build distribution centres. Similarly, our acquisition of McNicholas 
places Kier at the heart of the need to extend the UK’s broadband 
network to support the digital economy.

Strong market positions
We have strong market positions in each of our building, 
infrastructure and housing verticals, and market leading positions 
in several key market sectors, such as highways maintenance, 
utilities and health and education construction. These strong 
positions and the associated customer relationships provide 
resilience to market changes, and enabled us to grow faster than 
the market. In 2017 we achieved a 5% organic growth compared 
to c.1% market growth. Our capability in property and residential 
development supports the efficient capital recycling aspects of our 
business model and increases our ability to invest in the long-term 
sustainability of the business. 
With increased focus on innovation, Kier is also looking at ways 
of using technology directly to improve operational efficiency and 
develop customer-centric offerings. 
Pressure on Government finances
The UK Government’s financial position has improved – public 
sector net borrowing in 2016/17 was £46bn (2.4% of GDP), 
compared to £136bn (8.6% of GDP) in 2011. Nevertheless 
Government budgets remain under pressure, with tension in public 
policy between those who advocate continued austerity and those 
arguing for stimulus. If austerity continues to the same extent, 
it provides Kier with continued opportunities to invest and work 
innovatively with customers to deliver their goals in financially 
constrained circumstances. If, by contrast, public spending 
restrictions are relaxed, it is likely that the extra spending will be 
on social and transport infrastructure.
Brexit uncertainty will persist
Brexit remains a source of uncertainty in the UK and has a 
potentially distorting effect on the UK’s political and economic 
cycles. Given the delay in the start of the UK/EU negotiations, it 
remains too early to assess the effects, although we continue to 
monitor developments closely. It is likely that the UK will see a 
period of change and uncertainty that will go beyond the 
scheduled exit date of March 2019. Despite any change to 
political priorities, Kier will continue to focus on businesses 
aligned with market fundamentals. Kier’s ability to ride the current 
uncertainty is supported by its market positions.

across our business
Turn to page 19  
for more information
Our strategy in action
With ‘forward thinking’ being one of Kier’s values, the 
Group is always looking at ways to be innovative or 
provide fresh thinking in its projects. The Group’s 
recently launched innovation plan sets out ways to 
engage, capture, reward and share ideas across the 
Group. Innovation showcases have taken place 
throughout the year across the Group showcasing latest 
technology and thinking, how technology can improve 
productivity and where tried and tested innovation from 
other markets and countries can be used within our 
business. One example, Robocut, a robotic lawn mower 
to cut across verges adjacent to roadways across the 
UK, reduces the exposure of colleagues to dangerous 
situations; reducing the risk of accidents and 
saving lives.
Innovation
What we did in 2017
 › Extended innovation into one of the Vision 2020 six 
strategic priorities.
 › Appointed a Group Innovation Director to facilitate 
delivery, ensuring key platforms are rolled out.
 › Established a Group-wide innovation forum.
 › Launched our innovation plan: #forwardthinking@Kier.
Future commitments
 › Launch the Kier Accelerator Fund to encourage new 
ideas/investment.
 › Ensure that every division has access to an ideas 
sharing platform.
 › Establish a clear digital strategy for all businesses 
to be supported by information management 
strategy and digital life-skills programme.
 › Create new ways to use data to drive efficiency and

Corporate responsibility
Operating a safe and 
sustainable business
Operating a safe and sustainable business is one of the six strategic priorities 
we identified in Vision 2020. We deliver this through our strategy for sustainable 
business – Responsible Business, Positive Outcomes – developed in consultation 
with a range of stakeholders.
This strategic report comes midway through the timeline for Vision 
2020, Kier’s plan for growth. Operating a safe and sustainable 
business is a key priority identified in Vision 2020 (see page 22 
for more information). We will deliver this through our strategy for 
sustainable business, Responsible Business, Positive Outcomes 
(RBPO), which was developed in consultation with a range of 
stakeholders including clients, shareholders and employees. 
RBPO is not only a strategic priority in its own right but enables 
the delivery of several important objectives. For example, improved 
safety and environmental performance helps us to reduce harm, 
function more efficiently and reduce our operating costs, cultivating 
a diverse workforce supports innovative thinking, and our community 
projects help us to attract and retain high-calibre people. Many 
sustainability strategies focus heavily on compliance and improved 
efficiency. While these areas will always be important, there is 
an increasing emphasis on social value in public procurement 
contracts. Consequently, we have designed our RBPO strategy 
so that it adds to our competitive advantage, helping us win new 
work and create added value. During the year, we revised some 
targets in RBPO as a result of early achievement of some of  
our original objectives and structural changes in the Group.  
(For more information see our Corporate Responsibility Report  
at www.kier.co.uk).
Understanding what is material to our stakeholders
Engagement
Stakeholder engagement
We started to create our strategy for a 
sustainable business, RBPO, back in 
2014. This was aligned to the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines on 
materiality assessment. 
Our initial review included customers, 
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) 
and employees and resulted in the 
creation of a draft strategy that supported 
Vision 2020. It is aligned with our 
corporate values, and creates value for 
our shareholders and wider society.
Stakeholders and shareholders
Consultation with customers, NGOs and 
employees was carried out in March 
2015 and then with major institutional 
shareholders in September. Their 
feedback helped us to refine the strategy 
and recognise the most material issues. 
Broad consensus on the 20 performance 
areas of RBPO was achieved, with 
recognition that business ethics, 
safety, health and wellbeing, and 
customer experience were the three 
most important factors.
Continuing engagement
During 2016 we introduced the RBPO 
strategy to our employees through a 
series of face-to-face briefings across  
our operations. We then began 
implementation. In 2017 we tested  
the strategy again with institutional 
shareholders. 
We plan to revisit clients and shareholders 
during the coming financial year and 
engage the views of external experts 
such as Business in the Community.

In an independent assessment of our RBPO strategy by 
Business in the Community, our score improved from 87% 
to 91% year-on-year.
RBPO has four themes that directly support Vision 2020, each 
with five performance areas (see table opposite). In this Annual 
Report we provide commentary principally on three areas 
recognised as most material by our stakeholders (business 
ethics, safety, health and wellbeing, and customer experience), 
and those we are required to disclose by the reporting 
environment we operate in. Areas not covered in this report are 
fully disclosed on the Kier website and in our Corporate 
Responsibility Report available at www.kier.co.uk.
30 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 Business ethics
As part of our aim to drive greater transparency on non-financial 
reporting, we regularly engage with a broad range of stakeholders. 
This has allowed us to identify which areas of non-financial 
performance are of importance to them. Business ethics  
was one of the top three priorities identified, notably by 
institutional shareholders.
At Kier we want to create a culture that doesn’t treat compliance 
as a box-ticking exercise, but something that is essential to any 
‘good’ business. This is illustrated by the approach we took last 
year to simplify and then roll-out our Code of Conduct. A copy of 
the code was provided to all employees and Kier is now delivering 
supplementary relevant training. Employee engagement is 
essential for a responsible and sustainable business which is 
why we continue to encourage our staff to report concerns and 
have a confidential whistle-blowing helpline.
Good governance – how we manage our business
Kier has several committees and specialist topic groups that work 
across the business to support Vision 2020 and RBPO. The work 
of the Board Committees is covered on pages 70 to 83.
The Risk Management and Audit Committee recognises that 
sustainable business is a significant non-financial risk, and this is 
discussed on page 74. The Remuneration Committee reviews the 
reward and remuneration for senior executive teams which 
incorporates non-financial performance measures (for more 
information see pages 82 to 101).
The Corporate Responsibility Leadership Group meets quarterly 
to review progress of RBPO and set policy for Kier. Each business 
has a dedicated Corporate Responsibility Business Partner. 
Kier’s specialist topic groups, which work across the 
business, include:
 › Balanced Business Network which works on equality 
and diversity;
 › Social value and impact;
 › ‘30 by 30’ which looks at energy and carbon;
 › Human rights, which includes modern slavery; and
 › Business ethics, responsible for the publication of the Code 
of Conduct.

Corporate responsibility continued
Safety, health and wellbeing
Safety is a major priority for Kier, which is why we have set a 
Vision 2020 target to achieve a zero AIR. We continue to make 
good progress towards this goal. In 2017, the Group AIR reduced 
to 130 compared to 211 and 319 in 2016 and 2015 respectively. 
This is less than half the industry average figure published by the 
Health and Safety Executive and a 38% improvement year-on-year.
There are many contributory factors for this performance but three 
particular initiatives in the year have helped drive success:
 › We have introduced new safety, health and environment 
management processes which focuses on the basics.
 › A Visible Leadership programme which is designed to 
encourage directors and senior managers to make regular visits 
to operational projects and sites. They are an important driver 
of safety. Against a target of 3,600 visits, we undertook 5,861 
visits in the year, a 23% increase on last year.
 › Behavioural change programmes developed for each business 
create a new culture and encourage everyone to take 
responsibility for safety.
Customer experience
Customer satisfaction scores improved to 91%. This is ahead of 
the target Kier set for Vision 2020.
We maintain high satisfaction rates because we work to understand 
customers’ requirements and align delivery to what they want. 
We also involve customers in the process of setting and agreeing 
our strategy for sustainable business. This continuing engagement 
has highlighted the importance of the Social Value Act and the 
Procurement Reform (Scotland) Act in raising the profile of social 
impact in public sector procurement. The expectation of public 
sector clients on suppliers to deliver positive impacts in the 
communities in which we operate has increased markedly. In the 
last few years we have been working to understand how the flow of 
revenue through contracts that Kier is delivering can be focused to 
deliver the greatest benefit to communities. Examples include 
targeting more locally-based supply chain partners, local training, 
apprenticeship programmes and working with organisations 
dedicated to providing employment opportunities to those who 
find it difficult to access the world of work. 
At Kier we operate a number of work access programmes 
directly including:
 › Nordis: a social enterprise that makes road signs. Based in 
Northamptonshire, it provides meaningful employment for 
people with disabilities.
 › Making Ground: a work placement programme for ex-offenders. 
Through this scheme numerous ex-offenders have been 
offered placements that have subsequently resulted in 
full-time employment.
We are also exploring how we can provide direct support to 
our clients through the use or creation of social enterprises, 
such as S-Skills.
Safety – the five basics
Five basic points that help reduce accidents and boost safety:
1. Induction – for every worker.
2. Risk assessments – for every task.
3. Safe systems of work/method statement – for every 
medium and high risk task.
4. Point of work risk assessments – the last chance to 
re-assess.
5. Competence – our license to operate.
S-Skills on Surrey Highways
S-Skills is an innovative partnership between Surrey County 
Council and Kier. Formed as a social enterprise, S-Skills 
enables people not in education, employment or training 
(NEETs), or with special educational needs, to carry out basic 
highway works in the community. This partnership achieves 
positive outcomes by:
 › Reducing dependency culture within communities.
 › Balancing regional skills supply and demand.
 › Meeting Surrey County Council’s pledge on apprentices.
 › Addressing highway management skills and ageing 
workforce issues.
 › Creating a skilled, work-ready generation to build tomorrow’s 
infrastructure.
 › Each year, the S-Skills Social Enterprise will generate a 
social value of £420,000 through enhanced skills, economic 
returns and positive outcomes on health and wellbeing for 
wider society.

Recognising our responsibilities
Our stakeholders have worked with us to identify material issues 
that help define us as a responsible and sustainable business in 
the communities where we operate. As well as reporting on these 
in the preceding pages, there are certain items we are required to 
disclose as a consequence of the legal framework which we 
operate within. We cover these areas below.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Kier achieved its 2020 target of a 10% reduction in carbon 
emissions per £m revenue ahead of plan in 2015. This year we 
launched ‘30 by 30’, which sets a new target to reduce our energy 
consumption by 30% by 2030. We project that this will also result 
in a 39% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. To deliver this 
plan, we have identified a number of actions we can take, some of 
which will rely on greater collaboration with our supply chain 
partners. For example, we have been working with a number of our 
partners over the course of the year to identify and bring forward 
new and efficient solutions for site based plant, accommodation 
and generators. This drive for greater efficiency supports our plan 
for improved profitability and a more efficient business.

Our dataset covers 94% of Kier’s operations by revenue, excluding 
Scope 1 fugitive emissions and joint ventures/joint operations 
where we are not in financial control. Reporting follows the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors Report) Regulations 2013, is in line with ISAE 3410, 
and uses conversion factors published by DEFRA.
Human rights
During the year, we launched a programme of training and 
awareness for employees responsible for procurement of 
construction materials and products. We also undertook business 
audits against performance measures established in our modern 
slavery statement last year. No issues were identified on audit and 
we will expand this approach over time so that, by 2020, we 
expect 90% of our preferred material suppliers to have been 
through this audit process. Our confidential whistle-blowing line 
also allows for any concerns to be raised directly.
Diversity
The future success of Kier depends on our ability to recruit and 
retain the best talent. We operate in sectors where there is strong 
competition for skilled workers and which are likely to be disrupted 
by new technology. A balanced business, which makes the most of 
the diversity of talent and experience available to us, will ensure 
we have the agility and resilience to continue to innovate and grow 
our business. As part of Vision 2020 we set a goal to improve the 
diversity of our graduates, apprentices and trainees to reflect the 
mix in the communities in which we operate. 
In the last year we have undertaken a number of 
initiatives including:
 › Establishing the Balanced Business Network to champion and 
promote diversity and inclusion in Kier, with Claudio Veritiero 
becoming the Board champion.
 › LGBTQ+ network launched.
 › Demonstrated our commitment to creating a more diverse and 
inclusive workforce by joining peers from the construction 
industry at the Pride London and Manchester events supporting 
#buildingequality.
 › Run a regular series of diversity events to promote and 
encourage networking and awareness of the benefits of more 
diverse employees.
 › Established training on relevant skills such as how to identify 
and eliminate unconscious bias in recruitment.
 › Participated in UK wide research into what drives the career 
choices made by men and women.
 › Launched an enhanced family friendly policy.

Risk overview
Managing risk to protect  
and grow our business
Effective risk management remains critical to our success. We have continued to review our approach to risk management in 2017, 
taking into account the need to balance risk and opportunity. Kier manages risk, both ours and our clients’, as a natural part of our 
business operations.
Our risk management framework is aligned with Vision 2020. A summary of the key elements of the framework is below.
Board
The Board has overall responsibility 
for Kier-wide risk management and sets 
the Group’s risk appetite.
Risk Review Committee
The Risk Review Committee 
reviews risks arising during 
tenders for new contracts.
Investment Committee
The Investment Committee 
reviews risks relating to 
investment decisions taken by 
the Group.
Standing orders
Standing orders set out 
delegated authorities within 
which the Group, divisions and 
business units operate.
Group-wide committees
Other Group-wide committees 
ensure that key business risks 
are managed appropriately.
Risk Management and  
Audit Committee (RMAC)
The Board has delegated responsibility for the 
oversight of the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems to the RMAC.
Senior management
Management within the business are 
responsible for the management of risk 
whether financial or non-financial in their 
respective businesses.
A bespoke risk portal has been developed and implemented 
within Kier. Risks are recorded alongside risk mitigations and 
controls, and a quarterly heatmap is produced for each business 
unit. The combined risk data for all business units is reviewed 
quarterly by the Group risk function. Significant risk issues that 
emerge throughout the year are escalated via the Group risk 
function to the ExCo and the RMAC.
The RMAC meets quarterly and reviews risk matters and the 
Internal Audit Plan.
The Head of Risk and Internal Audit briefs RMAC on risk 
management issues, the principal risks, and the compliance with 
the elements of the UK Corporate Governance Code relating 
to risk.
The Internal Audit function provides independent assurance to 
the RMAC. 
Risk identification
During 2017, we have identified, analysed and monitored the principal risks which management believes would significantly threaten our business model, 
future performance, reputation, solvency and liquidity. Effective risk identification is fundamental to our risk management process and is performed 
through a top-down and bottom-up process to form a balanced and holistic view of risks as they arise or evolve.
Top down 
Board
The Board and RMAC have agreed a division of responsibilities with 
respect to the management of risk. The Board conducts a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, and its risk appetite, 
and the RMAC oversees the Group’s systems of risk management and 
internal controls.
Executive Committee (ExCo)
Risk identification and management is central to the decisions taken by 
the ExCo.
Group risk function
Reviews heatmaps and registers on a quarterly basis.
Bottom up
Business unit/divisions
Risk identification is built into routine processes and supported 
by an annual risk review which is refreshed regularly within each 
business unit. Emerging risks are reviewed and added as part of a 
continuous improvement process. These are also reviewed by divisional 
risk champions.
Group risk function
Challenges assumptions and prioritisation, supports business units in 
aggregating their risks and reviews risk registers and heatmaps on a 
quarterly basis.
Risk oversight
Risk recording and review
34 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 Risk appetite
Balancing risk appetite with our strategic aims
The Board assesses its risk appetite annually. In 2017, the Board undertook a detailed review of its appetite for risk set against each 
of Kier’s strategic priorities. Risk appetite was mapped against a sliding scale from ‘risk-averse’ to ‘risk-neutral’ to ‘risk-tolerant’ and this 
informed the development of thresholds to quantify acceptable upper and lower levels of risk for each strategic priority.
Risk framework
Kier’s risk management framework evolves to support the delivery of our strategic aims and ISO 31000. A summary of the framework is 
shown below:
Framework for  
managing risk 
(PLAN)
Kier’s processes identify, analyse, 
evaluate and treat risks.
Continuous 
improvement 
(ACT)
Kier’s risk processes are regularly 
reviewed by management.
There is a focus on lessons learned 
within the business units and 
divisions, prompting collaboration 
on risk management across 
the businesses.
Monitoring and review
(CHECK)
Internal audit provides independent 
assurance to check that processes, 
controls and policies are operating 
effectively. This service is co-sourced 
to KPMG who undertook 15 internal 
audits during the last 12 months.
Implementing risk  
management 
(DO)
Risk identification is performed on 
both a top-down and bottom-up basis 
and recorded in a bespoke in-house risk 
portal. This information is distributed 
in the form of risk registers and risk 
heatmaps to guide activity and 
decision-making.
Mandate and commitment
The Board sets a clear mandate for risk management which is designed to ensure that risk is managed rigorously by 
the business.

principal risks
Key areas of risk focus for 2018
We review our risk management framework and internal controls to ensure they remain effective and support the Group’s 
continued growth.
The principal areas of focus for 2018 are:
 › continued assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties from both a bottom-up and top-down perspective, deepening our 
analysis to create a unified view of both sets of risks;
 › support of business units to embed the use of the risk portal and sharing of best practice across the Group;
 › continued development of Kier’s risk culture;
 › further development of risk communication processes within business divisions and to the Board; and 
 › continued appropriate focus on risk throughout all levels of management within the Group.
Strategic Report
Risk overview continued
36 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 Principal risks and 
uncertainties
The following section sets out the Board’s assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties (PRUs) that may impact the delivery of 
our six strategic priorities, their movement during the year and the relevant controls and mitigations in place. The Board considers these 
to be the most significant risks facing Kier. Not all risks facing our organisation are listed and risks are not listed in any order of priority.
Recognising the impact of our principal risks
At Kier, we know that risk is an inherent part of doing business, and as such our approach to risk management promotes a deep 
understanding and consideration of risk and places it at the centre of our decision-making processes. 
1. Health and safety
Major health and safety incident
Description Key mitigations/controls
The Group’s activities are inherently complex and 
potentially hazardous and require the continuous 
monitoring and management of health, safety and 
environmental risks. The Board has assessed that this 
risk remains high but unchanged from last year. Failure 
to meet safety standards and/or ineffective 
management of safety requirements could result in 
the following:
 › injury/death to employees, members of the public or 
third parties;
 › reduced ability to bid for and win work;
 › reputational damage;
 › financial penalties arising from fines, claims, legal 
action, project delays; and
 › failure to meet investor expectations.
 › Updated Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) management system 
aligned to the needs of the operational businesses under a 
framework of Group governance.
 › Behavioural change programme focusing on operational safety.
 › Robust major incident response protocols.
 › Visible leadership programme designed to promote a ‘safety-first’ 
culture.
 › Revised accident investigation protocols to ensure robust 
investigation and implementation of lessons learnt.

  Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 37 2. Sustainability
Breadth of sustainability requirements
Description Key mitigations/controls
With the increasing importance of sustainability and 
social value in clients’ evaluation of contract awards, 
and the emergence of greater stakeholder awareness, 
progressive legislation, and enforcement activity, this 
risk is included as a new PRU.
If the Group were unable to meet its sustainability 
requirements, the following risks may occur:
 › non-compliance with legislation;
 › bid exclusion;
 › reputational damage;
 › failure to meet customer expectations;
 › significant financial penalties/loss of contracts; and
 › significant failure to meet investor expectations.
 › The Group’s commitment to sustainability is articulated within a 
strategy for a sustainable business, Responsible Business, Positive 
Outcomes (RBPO). 
 › The Group operates a management structure including Board 
committees, and a Corporate Responsibility Leadership Group 
(CRLG) which meets quarterly. Between them they review the 
progress with identified, and emerging, issues across the areas 
covered by our strategy for a sustainable business.
 › Membership of the CRLG is drawn from our Group services 
functions, together with representatives from the operating 
businesses. It is responsible for assessing sustainability risk and 
setting appropriate policies and direction for Kier.
 › The Group has recognised that delivering strong performance across 
the non-financial focus areas covered by RBPO helps to create value 
for our business, our investors, our clients and wider society. For 
example, improving safety and wellbeing leads to less lost time 
through injury or illness; improved environmental performance can 
reduce waste of energy and materials, leading to cost savings; and 
choosing the right subcontractors and supplier partners can lead to 
an economic boost for the community in which we are operating.
 › The Group delivers business-wide training programmes to ensure 
its employees are competent and qualified. We operate a 
programme of audits to review our contracts and measure 
performance against expectations, assessing and reporting on 
recommendations for improvement.
3. Funding
Availability of funding
Description Key mitigations/controls
The Group has a variety of funding needs met by 
external sources. We have clear metrics to measure 
volatility and sensitivity in the key indicators of funding 
risk and have recently undertaken a review which has 
strengthened our ability to manage this risk. The Board 
assesses this PRU as unchanged from last year. If this 
funding were not available or curtailed there is a risk 
that we could experience:
 › failure of business or one stream of the business;
 › smaller gains or margins;
 › failure to achieve profit expectations;
 › loss of investor confidence; and 
 › reduced cash generation due to reduced volume 
growth.
 › The Group’s Investment Committee, chaired by the Group Financial 
Controller, is responsible for approving capital investment and 
optimising the allocation of capital.
 › Cash forecasting and working capital management remain key 
performance indicators for the business, with their ability to generate 
positive cash flow demonstrated in the year.
 › The core borrowing facility was recently renegotiated, extending 
tenure and liquidity. The Group has access to committed funding 
that substantially exceeds both peak borrowing and projected 
funding requirements over the next three years. The average tenure 
of committed funding exceeds four years.
 › Availability of bonding capacity is essential to the Group’s ability to 
win work. Kier has strong, long-term relationships with the providers 
of this service and has a dedicated in-house team to monitor 
headroom and advise on bond terms and conditions.
 › The Property division uses a number of joint ventures to manage 
risk and enhance returns. Joint venture partners are carefully 
selected to mitigate operational risk within projects. By entering 
into joint ventures, the Group can ensure that the Property division 
is not over-exposed to any one sector, geographical location or 
individual development.

38 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 4. Market and sector performance
Market downturn impacts customer expenditure 
Description Key mitigations/controls
The Group’s strategy depends on the economic 
performance of the UK, in particular, and the markets 
and sectors in which it operates. Kier has a breadth of 
capabilities and operates across a number of diverse 
market sectors. The Board has extended this PRU 
(previously ‘the market’) to reflect the importance of 
our sector decision-making and performance, as well as 
the general performance of the economies in which 
we operate.
Reduced economic activity and expenditure in public, 
regulated and private sectors would likely result in 
lower growth or lower revenue for the Group.
Further, investment allocation across the market 
sectors in which the Group operates is of clear 
importance; if the Group were to invest too heavily in 
the wrong sector, the following risks would occur:
 › failure of business or one stream of the business; 
 › reputational impact of inappropriate selections; and
 › failure to meet financial expectations.
 › The Group regularly evaluates future market performance including 
the impact of macro-economic factors (e.g. population growth, 
austerity) and the associated market risk of specific events 
(e.g. Brexit) together with its strategy in those markets.
 › The Group’s strategy is aligned to three core market segments 
(buildings, infrastructure and housing) which are underpinned by 
solid long-term fundamentals and where the Group is able to 
establish a leading market position. The Group’s operating structure 
is largely aligned to these three segments.
 › The Group regularly reviews its business portfolio, which has 
resulted in exit from market sectors and disposals (e.g. Caribbean, 
Mouchel Consulting and Biogen). The Group carries out monthly and 
quarterly reviews of its secured workload and prospective pipeline, 
and forecasts its overhead levels as a percentage of future work in 
order to maintain an appropriate ratio of overhead costs to revenue.
 › The Group has well-established sector sales capability in key areas, 
and during the year invested in a new customer relationship 
management system to improve pipeline visibility.
5. Operating model
Operating model inefficiency
Description Key mitigations/controls
To build and sustain long-term confidence we must 
maintain and evolve our operating model to maximise 
growth and minimise risk. The Board has assessed this 
as a new PRU.
Failure to maintain operating model efficiency could 
result in the following risks:
 › failure of business or one stream of the business;
 › failure to deliver required growth and profitability;
 › failure to remain competitive; and 
 › failure to meet investor expectations.
 › We maintain a disciplined focus on honing the portfolio by divesting 
non-core businesses and making acquisitions in line with strategy.
 › The Group measures its component businesses against a series of 
balanced score-cards throughout the year.
 › As a key part of our control processes, we challenge our business 
units’ performance and amend plans on a quarterly basis to ensure 
that we are on track to meet investor expectations.
 › We constantly strive to anticipate changes within our business 
environment and customer requirements as well as implementing 
efficiencies where appropriate. The recent enterprise resource 
planning (ERP) implementation and opening of our finance shared 
services centre are prime examples of this.
 › We have made ongoing investment in systems to improve our 
efficiency and management information for example, strengthening 
back-office systems through the roll-out of Oracle ERP and shared 
services. These improvements also enable integrated trading/
cross-selling and scalability of front-line systems in services 
businesses, creating operational efficiencies and enhancing 
competitiveness in certain sectors.
 › We have implemented a programme of enhanced customer 
engagement to work as closely as possible with our customers, 
particularly where the business environment is changing, so we can 
continue to support them as their priorities evolve.

6. Contract management
Ineffective contract management
Description Key mitigations/controls
Kier recognises that effective contract management is 
at the heart of its business model and is critical to 
ongoing success and growth. The Board has assessed 
that given the potential impact of this risk and current 
external factors, this risk has risen in significance since 
last year and remains an important focus for the Group.
The Group has a number of large and complex 
contracts in play at any given time. Dependent on the 
nature, location and duration of the work and the 
legal framework of the contract, there is a risk that 
ineffective contract management and lack of ownership 
could result in:
 › failure of the business or one stream of the 
business;
 › financial impact of failure to deliver on contracts;
 › reputational damage;
 › subcontractor performance impact;
 › wastage of resources; and
 › poor management information, reporting, contract 
data and transparency.
 › The Group maintains a strong focus on longer-term service 
contracts. Potential risks are mitigated, controlled and managed 
through the Group’s operating structure, procedures and standing 
orders. Enhanced emphasis and focus on pre-contract controls has 
improved the quality of the Group’s portfolio of contracts. 
 › Monthly operational and financial contract reviews are held at both 
business unit and business stream levels. These reviews are 
supplemented by a formal quarterly review process, which operates 
across all divisions of the Group and is attended by ExCo members.
 › The operational and commercial functions manage subcontractor 
performance and relationships across all contracts.
 › In further mitigation of this risk, the Group’s commercial training 
programme for all front line staff has progressed positively. This 
programme is designed to ensure a consistent approach to the 
management of contract risks across the Group. There has also 
been a focus on upgrading key financial controls across the Group. 
These improvements have had a positive impact on identifying 
potentially under-performing contracts.
7. Customers
Loss of a key customer relationship
Description Key mitigations/controls
Kier recognises the need to engage effectively with 
customers and strives to deliver a tailored service that 
exceeds expectations. Given the importance of 
customer satisfaction, the Board has identified this as 
a new PRU.
If we fail to deliver a differentiated customer experience 
which focuses on proactive relationship management, 
the following could occur:
 › failure of the business or one stream of the 
business;
 › reputational damage; and
 › loss of a key customer or decline in customer loyalty.
 › Customer satisfaction surveys are undertaken alongside 
independent customer surveys designed to better understand clients 
needs and expectations.
 › Each business unit/stream has a dedicated business development 
team which participates in a quarterly review of clients across the 
UK through eight regional client forums.
 › We have developed key client plans and relationship mapping 
through the allocation of key account managers to each key client.
 › Regular reviews are scheduled at management meetings covering 
customer relations and the future pipeline of opportunities supported 
by the Group’s new CRM system. Senior leaders across the Group 
support key client relationships through regular 1:1 meetings.

40 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 8. People
Availability and retention of the right people
Description Key mitigations/controls
Our people remain a key pillar of our business. 
Ensuring the right people are in the right roles is 
critical to our future success and growth. The 
Board has assessed that the level of risk in this 
area is the same as last year. We need to 
attract and retain the right talent to enable 
achievement of our strategic aims. Failure to do 
this risks our delivery and growth as follows:
 › failure to meet a specific business need or 
contract requirement;
 › reputation damage, both corporate brand and 
employment brand;
 › loss of project specialisms;
 › over-reliance on key staff; and
 › loss of key skills.
 › Focus on reduction of voluntary turnover of employees, in particular new hire 
turnover, through better hiring for fit, improved induction and on-boarding, 
and employee engagement initiatives.
 › Launch of market-benchmarked reward and benefits offer.
 › Strategic workforce plan implemented to provide insight on forecast skills 
needs and headcount and insight on skills and retention hot spots or 
systemic issues to target.
 › Employer brand embedded in talent attraction and reflected in internal 
employer value offer.
 › Talent fast-track programme in place to retain and progress key talent at 
all levels.
 › Balanced Business strategy agreed with the ExCo to drive inclusion 
and diversity.
 › Targeted action taken to improve the diversity mix and inclusive work 
climate (including internal target-setting).
9. Innovation
Insufficient innovation to maintain market position
Description Key mitigations/controls
We operate in an increasingly dynamic and 
changing environment. To counter the risks 
associated with this and, most importantly, to 
exploit the opportunities it presents, we must 
embrace innovation and capitalise on 
technology advancements to ensure we 
maintain our market position.
Given the depth and pace of change in this 
arena this risk/opportunity has increased in 
focus and importance from last year and is now 
listed as a PRU. Failure to manage this risk 
could result in:
 › loss of new and current business to 
competitors;
 › new market entrants lead the way on 
innovation to our detriment;
 › loss of staff due to lack of innovation or 
failure to act on ideas;
 › innovation costs not being managed 
effectively; and
 › negative internal and external publicity.
 › The delivery of the Group’s services already incorporates innovation and 
technology at a number of levels, whether through the built environment it is 
delivering (e.g. smart motorways, energy-efficient buildings) or the way in 
which it delivers its services (e.g. BIM, digital technology, predictive data, 
new construction methods).
 › Given the heightened importance of this area, the Group has revised one of 
its strategic objectives in the year (Embracing innovation and technology 
across our business) and launched its #forwardthinking@kier plan. This has 
included the appointment of a Group Innovation Director and the launch of a 
Group-wide Innovation Forum.
As part of its plans to further promote innovation and technology, the Group will:
 › ensure that employees in every business have access to online innovation 
and idea-sharing platforms;
 › establish a clear digital strategy supported by an information management 
strategy and digital life skills programme;
 › launch a £1m pa seed fund (the Kier Accelerator) to encourage new ideas/
investment; Increase the rotation of candidates across its graduate/early career 
programme to further increase vibrancy of thinking and seeding of ideas; 
 › increased external marketing activity to position our existing innovation; and
 › align leadership and development programmes to include a clear focus on 
innovation and technology.

Additional macro-economic risks
Brexit
The UK’s departure from the EU (‘Brexit’), will impact Kier in a 
number of ways. Although these risks are yet to be fully 
understood and quantified, we are mindful of the many areas of 
potential risk and uncertainty, including issues around the free 
movement of people, delays in major infrastructure investment 
and trade restrictions.
We are actively monitoring the UK Government’s position on the 
various matters for negotiation and the potential impact these 
may have on Kier, and will act accordingly through various working 
parties and task forces. In last year’s Annual Report, we referred 
to the risk of a significant decline in the property market following 
the EU referendum result. Instead, greater volatility materialised in 
this market providing a number of opportunities post the Brexit 
vote for our Property division. Our largely non-speculative approach 
to property investment provides mitigation against market 
volatility. We will continue to monitor changes in the property 
market and respond accordingly.

 was £182m (2016: £169m), generating an

 of £25.8m (2016: £21.4m), reflecting 
the usual second half timing of transactions. This good result was 
achieved with average capital invested of £113m, peaking at 
£145m, through continued support of co-investors and funders 
and utilising the Group’s cash flow.
The division, with over 80% of its activity taking place outside 
London and a focus on modest value schemes, achieved a ROCE 
of 23%, well ahead of our 15% target. It continues to have a 
healthy development pipeline of opportunities in excess of 
£1.4bn, providing 10 years of development scheme visibility.
Immediately after the Brexit vote, £60m was invested in new 
developments, taking advantage of market opportunities during 
the first quarter. This investment underpinned an average capital
4
 
employed in the 2017 financial year of £113m. Twenty 
development schemes were sold during the year. The division also 
continues to offer its specialist skills as part of a wider Group 
offer to many of our clients who are seeking to maximise the 
return from their property assets through estate rationalisation.
The Property division has a diversified national portfolio of 
multi-sector, high-quality projects. In the industrial sector, following 
the launch in 2017 of the Logistics City brand, the first successful 
disposals were achieved with the Logistics City Thurrock scheme 
which was sold in May 2017 following pre-lets. Logistics City 
Frimley was forward funded and sold in June 2017. Occupier 
interest has remained robust and lettings were progressed within 
our Trade City portfolio, with Thurrock 55% let or under offer, 
Oxford over 46% let or under offer and Winsford 100% let or under 
offer, with future opportunities in Basingstoke, Reading and 
Andover secured. Construction of the 72,000 sq ft Trade City 
Watford was completed and lettings are progressing well with 47% 
either secured or under offer to date.
In the office development sector, the 100,000 sq ft office in 
Sovereign Square, Leeds, built by the Construction division, was 
completed in October 2016 having been pre-let and forward sold. 
Speculative investment in the London market is very limited, with 
the development of the 60,000 sq ft office in Hammersmith, in 
joint venture with Investec, completed in March 2017. In London, 
58 Victoria Embankment, the 46,500 sq ft office development in 
which Kier held a 16% equity stake, was completed in October 
2016 having been presold to a charity. During the year the 42,000 
sq ft office in Foley Street, London was forward funded, and sold 
with construction being undertaken by the Construction division.
Following the Brexit referendum, the business took advantage of 
market opportunities and strengthened its future pipeline with the 
acquisition of six office schemes in Basingstoke, Glasgow, Leeds 
and Newcastle and two developments in Manchester. All of these 
schemes are in key city centre locations and either have existing 
tenants or present good regional opportunities in this market 
sector. One of the office developments in central Manchester was 
forward sold in November 2016 once further tenants had been 
secured. In September 2017, the office development in Newcastle 
was 50% sold of after securing further income and 
increasing value.

In the retail and mixed-use sector, which remains buoyant, 
phase 2 of the leisure scheme in Walsall was fully let before 
construction commenced in January 2017 and a 45,000 sq ft 
pre-let retail scheme in Wakefield was forward sold with 
construction commencing in May 2016 and completing in 
August 2017. Further opportunities have been secured in Hemel 
Hempstead, Thornton-Cleveleys and Durham for retail schemes.
The £400m Watford Health Campus project continued to make 
good progress with the completion of infrastructure works in 
October 2016 and the completion of the first commercial scheme, 
a 72,000 sq ft Trade City with strong occupier demand. Planning 
was secured 95 units of the first residential scheme with 
construction due to commence later in 2017.
Construction commenced in Southampton on the 413-bed student 
accommodation scheme, with construction due to complete in 
August 2018. In September 2016, financial close was reached to 
design, build, finance and maintain the £25m Ayr Academy in 
South Ayrshire and the £41m William McIlvanney Campus 
in Kilmarnock.
The Group’s investment portfolio holds seven schemes; two at 
preferred bidder stage, two in construction and three in operation. 
The committed equity investment stands at £26.8m 
(2016: £29.5m) of which £22.4m (2016: £14.7m) has been 
invested to date. The directors’ valuation of the investment 
portfolio is £32m (2016: £41m).
In April, we sold our joint venture interest in Biogen, the renewable 
energy business. This resulted in a loss on sale of £7.6m and a 
cash inflow of £10m.
Watford Riverwell is a joint venture development by Kier with 
Watford Borough Council.
With an expansion into student accommodation, the 264-room 
student development in Glasgow was fully let for the 2017/18 
academic year.
Property outlook 
As local authorities continue to face fiscal challenges, the division 
is seeing increased local authority client interest in the division’s 
property investment and development capabilities. The Property 
division is a top three trader developer in the UK, and will 
undertake further regional expansion this year into Birmingham 
and the West Midlands. This market position, supported by 
ongoing investor interest, continues to drive good rental yields and 
the regional property market remains robust. With a development 
pipeline of £1.4bn, providing 10 years of scheme visibility, coupled 
with the Group’s strong cash flow, it is anticipated that Group capital 
investment will peak at £175m in the year ahead and reach an 
average of £200m in 2020 and that ROCE will exceed 15%.

The Residential division’s activities are increasingly focused on 
mixed tenure development, with two-thirds of its activity working 
with local authorities, housing associations and other clients. All 
of the division’s activity is outside London. The regional profile of 
the business provides a stable environment for mixed tenure 
affordable house building with demand exceeding supply.
Following the sale of the land to the Cross Keys Homes joint 
venture on 23 March 2017, revenues
1
 were up 6% to £376m 
(2016: £353m) and on a like-for-like basis revenues were up by 
5%, a strong performance. The total number of unit completions 
increased to 2,200, up 3%, generating an increase in operating 
margin to 6.1% (2016: 5.8%). Underlying operating profit
2
 of 
£22.8m (2016: £20.3m), up 12%, was achieved as our mixed 
tenure activity matures as capital is recycled to service growth and 
as the private housing business builds on new land which 
replaces the older, more expensive land. Following completion of 
the Cross Keys Homes joint venture on 23 March 2017, the 
business received a capital sum of £64m which improved the 
division’s ROCE to 11% (2016: 9%). The rebalancing of the legacy 
Kier land bank continues.
Mixed tenure
With continuing budgetary challenges in local authorities, yet 
increased demand for housing, the business is seeing high levels 
of interest in funding solutions and joint ventures. Revenue in the 
mixed tenure business increased 8% to £202m with an average 
invested capital of £39m. The mixed tenure business achieved 
approximately 1,450 completions (2016: 1,400) in the year. 
The business continues to look at opportunities nationally and 
has successfully worked with local authorities to optimise the 
value of their land assets. It has extended its geographical 
reach into new areas such as south Wales and increased its 
focus on the south-west. The launch of joint ventures such as 
New Communities Partnership and Northern Ventures in 2016 
has generated significant interest and discussion with local 
authority partners as they seek new ways to extract value from 
their land assets. Northern Ventures activity is increasing with 
three new schemes in Stokesley, Easingwold and Driffield, 
delivering around 700 units with Together Housing Association.

At the end of July 2017, Kier Living successfully secured a place 
on all five of the regional panels of the Homes and Communities 
Agency’s (HCA) new £8bn Delivery Partner Panel 3 (DPP3) which 
provides public sector organisations with a quick and efficient way 
to build new homes. The new DPP3 framework will run for four 
years and has doubled in value as the HCA takes responsibility for 
an increasing number of mixed-use and multi-tenure schemes and 
welcomes more client bodies as users of its framework. Kier 
Living is one of a small number of house builders that has been 
successful on all five of the regional panels.
Private
The private housing market remains robust with the sale of new 
homes continuing to outperform the second hand market. 
Consumer demand and confidence remain good, supported by 
Help to Buy which continues to underpin new home sales and 
accounts for approximately half of all Kier private sales. Average 
sales prices were £240k and the business is currently 
approximately 60% forward sold for FY18.
On 23 March 2017, the Cross Keys Homes joint venture was 
announced. This joint venture is successfully buying schemes, 
accelerating our strategy to recycle the capital invested in the Kier 
private land bank to drive the future growth of the Group and 
improve overall ROCE. There were 748 private sale completions 
(2016: 750) in the year. The business continues to rationalise its 
land bank and reinvest in mixed tenure opportunities or return 
capital to the Group. The land bank mix continues to improve with 
approximately 40% of completions on land bought before 2008 
and the remainder on newer land. The land bank has reduced to 
2,794 speculative units (2016: 3,279) and sales were completed 
at a rate of 0.7 units per trading site per week. 
Residential outlook
With a continued imbalance in the UK supply and demand of 
housing, good availability of mortgages and low interest rates, the 
division is well positioned to pursue growth, particularly through 
the demand for mixed tenure housing. We continue to execute our 
strategy to grow the mixed tenure business whilst maintaining the 
scale of the private business at 700 – 800 units per annum. 
Through the use of joint ventures, the division continues to offer 
clients capital efficient solutions which are of increasing interest. 
The division is also focused on extending its presence into the 
M3/M4 corridor enabling it to work more closely with the housing 
maintenance business, providing combined services to private and 
affordable housing providers.
We will continue to grow our mixed tenure business and work 
towards our Vision 2020 goal of 15% ROCE.

 were maintained around 2.0% (2016: 2.0%) and the 
working capital performance was good. The current order book of 
£4.2bn for secured and probable work, excluding framework 
awards, represents more than 90% of forecast revenue for the 
2018 financial year, on increasing volumes. 
UK building
The building market was buoyant during the year assisted by the 
re-emergence of a number of major public sector projects. Our 
success on frameworks and our selective approach to new work, 
focusing on risk management and client relationships, has seen 
the business deliver another strong and consistent performance. 
The division benefited from continued demand particularly in the 
biotech, science and student accommodation markets. Wales and 
the south-east and, specifically the Cambridge market, have been 
particularly encouraging.
In the private health sector, we secured one of four positions on 
the £500m Private Investment Construction (PIC) healthcare 
framework and were appointed preferred trader for £75m of new 
private hospital developments.
With greater budgetary challenges, there is an increasing trend for 
public sector clients to procure capital building works through 
frameworks. Positions on the following frameworks were secured 
in the second half:
 › a position on the £6bn LHC Schools and Community Buildings 
frameworks;
 › a place on the £1bn+ Notting Hill Housing framework; and
 › a place on all five lots of the £700m Cambridge County 
Council framework.
In addition Kier is shortlisted for inclusion on the 
following frameworks:
 › £8bn Education and Skills Funding Agency Construction 
framework; and
 › the national and regional integrated healthcare supply chain 
NHS Building for Wales National and Regional frameworks.
Kier has maintained and grown its presence in the health and 
education sectors. In the health sector, our position on the 
Department of Health ProCure21+ and ProCure22 frameworks has 
resulted in the award of £109m of work in the year. In the 
education sector, over £200m worth of projects have been 
awarded or are at preferred bidder status. Kier has a turnover of 
over £600m in the education sector and expects further growth in 
the tertiary education sector.

framework where Kier is the sole provider for projects up to £4m 
throughout the UK. Kier is also one of six framework partners 
currently bidding for the first phase of the construction of three 
prisons worth c£400m.
Major contract awards in the year also included the £57m 
University of Sheffield award and the £53m Hoxton Hotel 
in London.
Infrastructure
Kier continued to work on civil engineering projects across a 
broad range of sectors including highways, rail, ports and coastal, 
aviation, energy, water and utilities and nuclear, delivering a steady 
revenue performance. The division is seeing a particular increase 
in transport opportunities with the HS2 joint venture award worth 
a combined £1.5bn, which will deliver revenue from 2018, and 
three new Smart motorway projects covering design and survey 
work on the M20 and M23 and an additional project on the M6 as 
part of the Collaborative Delivery framework for Highways England. 
Other new awards in the year included a £38m contract on 
the A13.
Work is ongoing at Hinkley Point C and the Farringdon Crossrail 
project this financial year and the Mersey Gateway project, 
despite some challenges, is expected to achieve the initial 
completion milestone with the toll road crossing opening shortly. 
Given the higher risk profile of some infrastructure contracts, 
the business is focused on improving margins by winning high 
quality work with repeat key clients, whilst continuing to focus 
on risk management, contract terms and conditions and 
cash performance.
International
In our international construction business, focus is on the 
continued delivery and development of the business in the 
Middle East. Despite the sustained low oil price, UK Export 
Finance (UKEF) continues to attract clients and we are 
experiencing a steady number of schemes coming to market. 
During the year, three new contracts totalling around £400m 
were secured using UKEF including two staff accommodation 
projects and the new, multi-purpose, 20,000-seat Dubai Arena. 
The process to settle the final accounts on the two MTR contracts 
in Hong Kong has been agreed and we expect the practical 
completion of the Caribbean project in the next few weeks. 
The closure of the Caribbean and Hong Kong businesses has 
resulted in non-underlying charges of £86m.
In addition, the sale of Mouchel Consulting in October 2016 
generated a profit on sale of £40m in the 2017 financial year.
Construction outlook
The Construction division continues to perform well. With its 
established framework positions and selective approach, it is able 
to take advantage of a broad range of public and private sector 
opportunities. Our strength in the education and health markets 
positions us for growth in these markets, particularly the tertiary 
education market. 
The division’s short-term future performance is underpinned by the 
UK building business while the infrastructure business provides 
good medium-term prospects. Significant framework success 
provides access to a £14bn addressable market. The Middle East 
business provides some diversity to the cycle of the UK economy. 
The division has a well balanced workload, split equally between 
private and public sector clients. The performance of the three 
businesses, particularly UK building, have pushed the revenue of 
the overall division above £2bn this year, and more importantly, 
have delivered a good 2% operating margin, keeping the division 
on track for its Vision 2020 target. With an order book of £4.2bn, 
the division has more than 90% of forecast revenue secured 
for FY18.

pipeline remains good, particularly in highways. More than 90% of 
targeted revenue for 2018 is secured; moreover, the order book 
does not include potential contract extensions, which, if included, 
would add more than £2.5bn, and provide visibility of workload 
beyond 2020.
Approximately 60% of the division’s capabilities relate to the 
provision of infrastructure services in the highways and utilities 
sectors. Together with the Group’s capabilities in construction, 
Kier is one of the UK’s leading infrastructure businesses with an 
annual revenue of approximately £1.5bn.
Infrastructure services – Highways maintenance 
The Group maintained its position as the UK’s leading provider 
of strategic maintenance and management. Revenues increased 
significantly in the second half, reflecting Highways England’s 
phasing of works. Moving forward, Highways England is focused 
on reducing the historic peaks and troughs of spending, providing 
greater predictability across the year. We expect the current level of 
spending to continue with funding for Road Investment Strategy 1 
remaining positive. During the year, the following Highways England 
contracts were mobilised:
 › a 15-year, £140m repair and maintenance contract for Area 13 
covering Cumbria; 
 › a two-year, £50m maintenance services contract for Areas 6 
and 8 covering East Anglia and the East of England; and
 › a five-year, £40m design service contract for Areas 1 and 2. 
The local authority market remains active albeit with budget 
pressures, which is resulting in new opportunities and clients 
looking at new ways to deliver services. The devolution of funding 
and decision-making, both locally and regionally, is now starting to 
gather pace with the establishment of Regional Transport Bodies, 
mayoral authorities and increased collaboration between 
authorities. New local authority awards mobilised in the 
period were;
 › a one-year, £40m extension to the Lincolnshire local authority 
contract; 
 › a two-year, £27m extension to the Harrow Highways contract; and
 › a five-year, £270m extension to the Suffolk Highways contract.
In the local authority market, we have visibility of the order book 
beyond 2020 and there is a steady pipeline of projects that 
provide good opportunity for growth.
In Australia, continued population growth is resulting in increased 
demand for road projects including Smart Motorway projects. 
Beyond the Group’s highways joint venture in Australia, the 
highways design centre in Sydney continues to be awarded 
highways design contracts by third parties, reflecting their 
increased profile in this market.

Infrastructure services – Utilities
The utilities business focuses on four sectors: water, power, 
gas and telecoms. In the water sector, new contracts totalling 
£43m were awarded in the year, including a two-year Severn Trent 
Water AMS extension.
The business continues to invest in alliances, enabling our teams 
to work more closely with our clients on improving 
customer delivery.
Clients in the water sector are already preparing for the AMP7 
bidding cycle which takes place in 2020. Yorkshire Water, Severn 
Trent Water and Welsh Water are all coming to market early and 
preliminary discussions are ongoing with these clients. It is 
anticipated that the OfWat regulatory framework for AMP7 will be 
more challenging than AMP6, with more stretching targets and a 
focus on resilience, customer service, affordability and innovation. 
In the power market, new contracts totalling £53m were awarded 
by SGN. With the completion of the National Grid Gas Distribution 
separation and the growing demand for power and gas, other 
opportunities will arise in this market. 
On 12 July 2017 we acquired McNicholas, a leading player in the 
multi-utilities market, making Kier a top three player in the utilities 
sector. McNicholas is an established UK engineering services 
provider in the telecommunications, gas, power, water, renewable 
energy and rail sectors and has a client base which includes Virgin 
Media, Network Rail and UK Power Networks. The acquisition 
builds on Kier’s strategy to accelerate growth and hold leading 
positions in its chosen markets. 
Infrastructure services outlook 
We expect that Highways England maintenance activity levels will 
continue as part of the strategic highways funding commitment to 
2020 through the current RIS. We continue to work with Highways 
England as they look at their future operating model and look 
forward to participating in the Routes to Market and £8bn 
framework procurement initiatives which will provide significant 
future opportunity for the Group. 
The utilities market presents significant opportunity. With the UK 
population growth expected to increase, the demand for services 
is increasing across a broad range of markets including water, 
energy and telecoms. The acquisition of McNicholas extends the 
Group’s presence in this marketplace, increasing our capabilities 
as well as giving increased sector and geographic presence.
Kier continues to build on its position as a key supplier to 
Highways England.

to review how housing associations manage their portfolios. 
With the anticipated merger of housing associations, Kier is one 
of a select few service providers with the capacity to deliver

During the year and since year end, a number of contracts have 
been awarded including the five-year £100m Powys joint award 
with the Workplace Services business, and a range of planned 
maintenance contracts with Sheffield City Council. 
Property services – Workplace Services
Workplace Services has established itself as a provider of 
end-to-end workplace solutions, spanning hard facilities 
management, soft facilities management, design and asset 
management and wider business services. The business has 
continued to grow in both the public and private sectors, 
particularly in the arts and heritage sectors.
New awards in the period totalling c£40m included: 
 › a two-year contract with the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue 
Service providing hard FM;
 › estates transformation design work with MOPAC;
 › a three-year hard FM contract with NHS Business Services 
Authority; and 
 › a one-year total FM contract with Sensor City Liverpool, part of 
the John Moores University complex.
Successful mobilisations took place on the Powys joint award 
involving Housing Maintenance. In addition, following the award of 
the Capital City College Group contract earlier this year, an 
extension is under discussion for a further five City and City and 
Islington college sites with other additional opportunities ongoing 
with the London Borough of Camden and Careers Wales.
Kier has also successfully secured places on a number of 
frameworks including the two-year £2.8bn Crown Commercial 
Services Project Management and Full Design Team Services 
frameworks, available to the whole of the public sector, for the 
provision of multi-disciplinary professional consultancy services.

Strategic Report
Divisional review continued
50 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 The housing maintenance sector is undergoing significant change. Kier is one of few in the market with the capacity to deliver large

Property Services outlook
With cost being a major driver for clients, our Property Services 
teams are working closely with them to transform their data 
collection and interpretation of that data to deliver appropriate 
solutions. Investment in our front-of-house systems has enabled 
our teams to interact seamlessly with our clients’ systems and we 
continue to look at smarter ways of working together. The 
introduction of universal credit will give the Housing Maintenance 
business greater opportunities as landlords seek new ways of 
managing their portfolios. 
Following the Grenfell Tower disaster, there has been a shift in 
spending priorities by social landlords with the reallocation of 
funds into fire risk assessment and prevention. The Property 
Services business are involved in ongoing compliance and health 
and safety to support a number of local authorities as they 
undertake assessments of their property portfolios.
Environmental Services
The operational performance of the Environmental Services 
business remains challenging. In the year, a £11.1m exceptional 
charge was taken for the East Sussex waste contract which was 
terminated, and for the early termination of another waste contract 
in 2019, for which terms have been agreed, further reducing the 
Group’s exposure to recyclate pricing.
Services outlook
The Services division, which accounts for approximately 50% of 
the Group’s profits, is performing well. It is focused on providing 
essential, day-to-day routine services to clients and communities. 
Against a backdrop of financial pressures for our clients, there are 
opportunities to discuss future procurement models, as well as 
look at opportunities arising from the new mayoral authorities, 
which will result in greater regional budgetary control and 
increased collaboration between authorities. Having secured more 
than £1bn of new work in the year, the Services division now has 
an order book of £5.3bn

divisions reporting organic growth. 
Within the Property division, revenue
1
 of £182m (2016: £169m) 
represents 8% growth on the prior year. The division continues 
to move to more capital efficient funding structures where funding 
and equity from third-party investors can be used to enhance 
returns and balance the risk within the portfolio. As a consequence, 
increased joint venture revenue of £117m (2016: £71m) 
represented 64% of the division’ s turnover. The average investment 
in joint ventures increased by 14% to £123m (2016: £108m) and 
the Group’s concentration in property investment outside London 
continued, with over 80% of turnover coming from outside the M25.
The Residential division saw total revenues
1
 increase by 6% to 
£376m (2016: £353m). For the first time this included a 
significant contribution from joint ventures of £28m (2016: nil), 
driven predominantly by the Group’s investment in the joint venture 
with Cross Keys Homes in March 2017. This investment allows 
sharing of expertise and risk between the partners as well as 
the introduction of third-party financing which enhances the return 
on capital. Total units completed increased by 3% to 2,200 of 
which two-thirds were generated from mixed tenure businesses 
where the division operates in partnership with local authorities, 
registered providers and other clients.
The net cash generated from these actions coupled with prudent 
capital management and targeted investment supports further 
organic growth, particularly through the Property and Residential 
divisions. This allows the Group to continue to enhance its 
systems and operational capability. The improving order book, 
increased capacity for investment and stable balance sheet 
demonstrate the strength of the Group’s business model and its 
ability to generate value across the economic cycle.
The reduction in non-underlying charges and a strong underlying 
performance have resulted in a statutory profit before tax of 
£25.8m (2016: loss of £34.9m) being reported.
Accounting policies and segmental reporting
The Group’s annual consolidated financial statements are 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU (‘IFRSs’). There have been no 
significant changes to the accounting policies adopted by the 
Group during the year ended 30 June 2017.
The Group is working closely with its advisors to assess the 
potential impacts of IFRS15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers’ and IFRS16 ‘Leases’, including the consideration of 
transition method. IFRS15 will impact on a number of judgemental 
areas currently accounted for under IAS11 ‘Construction 
Contracts’ and IAS18 ‘Revenue’. The Group is not currently 
contemplating early adoption and therefore the first accounts 
prepared under IFRS15 will be those for the year ended 
30 June 2019. The main impact of IFRS16 will be to move the 
Group’s larger, longer term operating leases, primarily on property, 
onto the balance sheet, with a consequential increase in 
non-current assets and finance lease obligations. Operating lease 
charges included in administrative expenses will be replaced by 
depreciation and interest costs. No decision has yet been made 
on the timing of adoption of IFRS16.

(2016: 23%)

ROCE 11%
(2016: 9%)
In Construction, which comprises our UK building, infrastructure 
and international construction operations, there was a 
6% increase in revenue
1
 to £2,019m (2016: £1,901m) driven 
by our strong presence on frameworks in our UK building 
business. Both the infrastructure and international businesses 
saw a modest decline in volumes in the year, the former following 
delays in major public infrastructure procurement and the latter 
after the decision to concentrate this business in the Middle East 
and close the Caribbean and Hong Kong businesses.
The Services division comprises infrastructure services (highways 
and utilities), property services (housing, facilities management 
and related services) and environmental services businesses. 
After a slow first half of the year, the division experienced an 
increase in volumes in the second half, delivering a 2% increase in 
full-year revenue
1
 to £1,688m (2016: £1,656m). The core of the 
division is the highways maintenance business where revenues 
increased by 5% to £780m (2016: £743m) highlighting its strong 
client relationships. The highways business also includes the 
revenue arising from the Group’s Australian operations of £123m 
(2016: £108m).
Group underlying operating profit
2
 of £145.6m (2016: £141.1m) 
represents 3% organic growth from the prior year. This is after 
charging £7.2m (2016: £2.4m) of interest and tax from joint 
ventures, as the Group increasingly operates with third-party 
funding models in both the Property and Residential divisions.
Recognising that the dynamics of the Group’s investing divisions 
(Property and Residential) and contracting divisions (Construction 
and Services) are markedly different, the primary key performance 
indicators used for measuring performance are return on average 
capital employed (ROCE) in the investing businesses and 
operating margin in the contracting businesses.
Underlying operating profit
2
 for the Property division of £25.8m 
represents a 21% increase from the prior year. Strong investor 
demand in the second half of the year compensated for a 
market dip in the first half of the year, immediately after the 
EU referendum. A strong ROCE of 23% reflects the robust trading 
and capital efficient models used and remains well in excess of 
the Group’s hurdle rate of 15%.
Within the Residential division the ongoing improvement in the 
quality of the land bank and strength of the UK housing market 
have seen margins
2
 improve to 6.1% (2016: 5.8%) despite higher 
volumes from mixed tenure operations.
This, combined with the increased volumes, has driven a 12% 
rise in underlying operating profit
2
 to £22.8m (2016: £20.3m).  
The increased mixed tenure offering and the investment in our 
joint venture with Cross Keys Homes has seen the average capital 
required to generate these returns reduce to £199m (2016: £231m) 
and consequently ROCE increase to 11% (2016: 9%).
The underlying operating profit
2
 from the Construction division  
of £39.8m (2016: £38.9m) represents an increase of 2%,  
with operating margins stable at 2.0% (2016: 2.0%). As with 
divisional volumes, the profitability was underpinned by the  
UK building business, particularly its strengthening position  
in numerous frameworks.
The Services division delivered an increase in underlying operating 
profit
2
 to £87.0m (2016: £86.1m) with consistent operating 
margins of 5.2% (2016: 5.2%), in line with the Group’s long-term 
margin expectations. This reflects a blended average across the 
division’s infrastructure and property services activities.
Corporate costs
2
 of £29.8m (2016: £25.6m) include £3m of 
charges arising from the creation of the Group’s finance shared 
service centre in Manchester, consolidating activities from a 
number of locations across the country. This centre has been 
integral to the roll-out of the Group’s Enterprise Resource 
Planning (ERP) project which now encompasses 70% of all 
Group transactions on a single platform. The balance of Group 
overheads remains broadly in line with the prior year.

  Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 53 Net underlying finance costs
2
 of £19.5m (2016: £24.7m) are 
21% lower than the prior year reflecting the use of more efficient 
corporate funding streams including the Group’s Schuldschein 
facility entered into at the end of the 2016 financial year. In 
addition, the reduction in interest charge associated with the 
Group’s pension scheme to £2.0m (2016: £5.6m) reflects the 
continuing contraction in bond yields. Finally, and as noted in the 
operating profit position, the interest payable has benefited from 
the capital funding models employed, particularly in Property with 
£6.5m (2016: £2.2m) charged within operating profit rather than 
interest in continuing operations.

The tax charge
2
 for the period of £21.9m (2016: £20.9m) 
represents an effective tax rate of 17.4% (2016: 18.0%). This rate 
is 2% lower than the headline rate of corporation tax and is driven 
by the use of historic losses on which deferred tax had not been 
provided for and the reduction in the future corporation tax rate 
to 17%.
Underlying earnings per share
2
 of 106.8 pence represents a 7% 
increase on the prior period (2016: 99.5 pence). The average 
number of shares in issue increased to 96.5m (2016: 95.2m) 
predominantly as a result of the 1.0m scrip shares issued in 
November 2016. During the year the scrip alternative to a cash 
dividend has been replaced by the option to participate in a 
Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP).
Non-underlying items
The Group has materially simplified its operating activities over the 
last two years following the acquisition of the Mouchel Group. 
The portfolio simplification, changes in laws and regulations and 
the sustained low level of commodity prices have resulted in a 
number of non-underlying charges in the year:
Caribbean: the closure of the Caribbean business following the 
agreement of the final account with a client on a 
challenging project;
Hong Kong: the closure of the Hong Kong business and the 
agreement of the process to settle the final accounts;
Mouchel Consulting: the sale of Mouchel Consulting in October 2016;
Biogen: the sale of Kier’s joint venture interest in Biogen, the 
renewable energy business, in April 2017;
Housing joint venture: the establishment of the Cross Keys Homes 
joint venture in March 2017, which released cash for reinvestment 
in new opportunities across the Group and enables our private 
house building business to deliver a significantly improved return 
on capital;
HSE sentencing guidelines: a provision relating to a potential 
increase in fines for historic health and safety incidents following 
the introduction of new sentencing guidelines;
Environmental contract curtailment: the effects of reduced 
recyclate income and the curtailment of the East Sussex 
environmental contract four years earlier than its stated 
termination date.
The earnings and cash impact of these transactions are outlined 
in the table below. The overall net impact of these is a charge of 
£75m in the year and the generation of £67m of cash.
During the year the Group also recognised a non-cash 
amortisation charge of £22.3m (2016: £21.5m) and finance 
charges of £2.9m (2016: £2.8m). The amortisation charge 
primarily relates to the contract rights from acquired businesses, 
in particular Mouchel and May Gurney.

Cash performance
The Group’s capital structure comprises of a number of sources of 
funding, mainly long-term in nature, and operates under two 
key disciplines.
Firstly, that year end net debt (including finance leases) will be 
less than earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and 
amortisation (EBITDA).
Secondly, that peak net debt will be less than the Group’s 
combined investment in property and residential assets.
The first of these disciplines recognises that an efficient capital 
structure for a Group with investment businesses will include an 
element of debt. The second recognises that the Construction and 
Services divisions in particular are seasonal in nature but they 
should remain materially cash positive as standalone divisions 
and must maintain strict working capital management.
At year end, the net debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.7 (2016: 0.7) and 
the level of peak net debt in February 2017 was 85% of the value 
of property and residential assets. Both positions remain well 
within our two key disciplines.

Average debt
1
 for the year of £320m was £40m higher than the 
prior year following planned investment in the first half of the year, 
particularly in Property. With the investment in property and 
residential assets being concentrated in the first and third quarters 
of the year, and receipts from non-underlying disposals in the 
second and fourth quarters, this investment had a disproportionate 
impact on the Group’s net debt position during the year.
54 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 The overall net debt
1
 position of the Group increased from £99m 
at June 2016 to £110m at June 2017. This £11m net outflow 
was materially lower than anticipated, reflecting strong operational 
cash conversion within the Construction and Services divisions 
and capital efficiency in Property and Residential, notably the 
conclusion of the Cross Keys Homes joint venture, offsetting the 
increased investment in property assets.
In reviewing operating cash conversion, the Group generated 
£164m (2016: £181m) from operating activities and joint 
ventures before movements in working capital. This represents an 
operating cash conversion of 113% (2016: 121%) for the year, a 
more normal return than that reported in the prior year.
During the year our working capital disciplines were 
maintained, with a small inflow of £4m being recorded. The billing 
cycle and revenue conversion remain major areas of focus with 
debtor and WIP days moving to 16 days (2016: 16 days) and 44 
days (2016: 50 days) respectively. The Group’s investment in 
property and residential assets held within joint ventures and 
inventories resulted in a cash outflow in the year of £76m, with this 
discretionary investment supporting growth in the medium term. 
In addition to this, the Group invested a total of £44m in 
operational IT systems including the ERP platform and front-end 
management systems for the utilities, housing maintenance and 
facilities management businesses. The Group also invested £16m 
(2016: £14m) in property, plant and equipment and had a net 
cash outflow on finance leases of £12m (2016: £14m).
Cash dividends of £50m (2016: £50m) were paid in 2017, in line 
with the prior year due to the high uptake of the scrip 
dividend. Amounts paid to the Group’s pension schemes 
increased to £31m from £25m in line with the previously agreed 
deficit recovery plans while cash interest of £17m was lower than 
the prior year reflecting the cheaper sources of funding available 
to the Group.
A net cash inflow in respect of the non-underlying transactions of 
the Group of £67m was generated in the year. This included net 
proceeds of £59m from the sale of Mouchel Consulting in October 
2016 and £10m from the sale of the Group’s interest in the 
Biogen renewable energy business. In addition to the above, the 
Group’s joint venture with Cross Keys Homes generated £64m in 
the final quarter of the year. These non-underlying gains more than 
mitigated the cash outflows from the closures of our operations in 
Hong Kong (£11m) and the Caribbean (£43m).
In conclusion, the Group has substantially completed the 
simplification programme and, in doing so, has released cash 
from non-core assets and activities allowing investment in our 
future growth businesses. The Group advances into 2018 with a 
strong balance sheet and focused operations whilst maintaining 
its strict risk management disciplines.

  Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 55 Acquisition of McNicholas
On 12 July 2017 the Group concluded its acquisition of the 
McNicholas Group for a cash consideration of £13.4m. The net 
liabilities of the business totalled £33.0m at acquisition date 
including a net debt position of £8.0m. A further £14.0m of 
deferred contingent consideration is payable, should the business 
achieve its earn-out targets in the 2018 and 2019 financial years.
The McNicholas Group has defined benefit pension schemes that 
are closed to future accrual, with a deficit recognised on the 
opening balance sheet of £11.3m. The structure of the acquisition 
and anticipated returns are expected to, as a minimum, achieve 
the Group’s overall capital hurdle requirement of a 15% return 
on capital.

The order book of £8.9bn increased by 5%, adjusting for the sale 
of Mouchel Consulting. Growth was driven by strong pipeline 
conversion in both Construction and Services, particularly in 
regional building and highway services, providing visibility of 
over 90% of revenues for the coming year. The acquisition of 
McNicholas on 12 July 2017 produces a combined order book 
of £9.5bn.
Pensions
The Group concluded its triennial valuation of the Kier Group 
and Mouchel Group pension schemes with the trustees in 
August 2017. These valuations were based on a reference date 
of 31 March 2016 and represent the first valuations undertaken 
as an enlarged Group following the Mouchel acquisition in 
June 2015. I am pleased to report that the Group’s covenant 
was assessed as having improved by the trustee’s independent 
advisors and moved to a ‘Tending to Strong’ rating under 
guidelines issued by the pension regulator.
Deficit contributions under the new plan will be reduced to £21m 
per annum in 2018, 2019 and 2020. This has been achieved by 
deferring recovery plan contributions by a total of £23m over the 
three year period with the deferred payment (including interest) 
being made in the 2021 financial year. Thereafter, the pension 
contributions will gradually increase. While the total deficit 
contributions will be maintained, the net preset value of the 
commitment will be lower due to the phasing of payments.
Cash contributions to the schemes under the existing deficit 
recovery plans totalled £31m (2016: £25m) in the year.
In parallel to the triennial valuations, the total Group deficit under 
the IAS19 accounting standard has reduced to £70.2m 
(2016: £72.0m) after accounting for deferred taxation. The Group 
continues to benefit from hedging against bond yields and inflation 
within the pension schemes’ asset portfolios, and this combined 
with a strong equity performance has seen total assets increase 
by £76m to £1,637m (2016: £1,561m) representing 95% 
(2016: 95%) of total obligations.
The overall liabilities of the pension schemes have increased by 
£73m in the year to £1,721m (2016: £1,648m), driven by the 
continuing compression of bond yields and an increase in future 
RPI and CPI inflation.
Treasury facilities and policies
As noted above, the Group operates its treasury and working 
capital management processes under strict year end and peak net 
debt disciplines. Actual facility usage is monitored on a daily basis, 
with non-treasury cash, primarily within joint venture accounts, 
consolidated weekly. Rolling capital forecasts are maintained on 
a three-month, 12-month and 36-month basis and reviewed in 
conjunction with weekly working capital and cash reviews with 
treasury, finance and operational leadership.
In July 2017, the Group concluded a review of its existing 
Revolving Credit Facility (RCF). The Group extended its facilities for 
an additional two years to 2022 under improved terms and 
expanded its lending group to include additional members within 
the overarching RCF agreement. The revised profile of the Group’s 
committed facilities is outlined below, with 89% (2016: 24%) 
repayable after 2021.

The Group has £14.3m (2016: £26.3m) of finance lease 
obligations on the balance sheet at 30 June 2017. The overall 
reduction was predominantly driven by environmental services 
contracts exited in the year.
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash and liquid 
investments. The Group, largely through its PFI and property joint 
ventures, enters into derivative transactions (principally interest 
rate swaps) to manage interest rate risks arising from its 
operations and its sources of finance. The US dollar denominated 
USPP loan notes have been hedged with fixed cross-currency 
swaps at inception to mitigate the foreign exchange risk. 
The Group does not enter into speculative transactions.
There are minor foreign currency risks arising from our operations. 
The Group has a limited number of international operations in 
different currencies. Currency exposure to international assets is 
hedged through inter-company balances and borrowings, so that 
assets denominated in foreign currencies are matched, as far as 
possible, by liabilities. Where there may be further exposure to 
currency fluctuations, forward exchange contracts are completed 
to buy and sell foreign currency.

Dividend policy
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 45.0 pence per share 
on the 97m shares in issue at 30 June 2017. Combined with the 
interim dividend of 22.5 pence for shares in issue at February 
2017, the total dividend declared this year of 67.5 pence 
(2016: 64.5 pence) represents a 5% increase on prior year.
Going concern
The Chief Executive’s strategic review highlights the activities of 
the Group and those factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and financial position. These have been carefully 
considered by the Board in relation to the Group’s ability to 
operate within its current and foreseeable resources.
The Group has significant financial resources, committed banking 
facilities, long-term contracts and long order books. For these 
reasons, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the Group’s 2017 financial statements. The full going 
concern statement is set out on page 62. A summary of the work 
undertaken by management and the Risk Management and Audit 
Committee (RMAC) to support this statement is set out on 
page 75.
Viability statement
The Board has assessed the viability of the Group over a three-
year period ending 30 June 2020, as it is required to do under the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. The Board’s statement is set out

As the new Chairman, what is your view on the 
role of governance?
Good governance is essential to the way in which our 
business operates on a day-to-day basis; one of the key 
responsibilities of the Board is to oversee the continuous 
development of the Group’s governance structure so as to support 
the effective delivery of its strategy.
In this part of the Annual Report, we describe governance at 
Kier, the principal activities of the Board and its committees 
throughout the year and how Kier has complied with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (April 2016 edition) (the Code).
What role does the Board play in setting the 
culture of the Group?
We play an important role in setting the Group’s culture 
and, in my initial months at Kier, it is clear that the Board 
demonstrates the Group’s core values – forward-thinking, 
collaborative and enthusiastic. Throughout the year, the Board has 
worked well, managing the Group’s growth closely and its progress 
against Vision 2020, in light of some challenging market 
conditions. It is also important for us to be visible within the 
business and, during the year, members of the Board have visited 
a number of the Group’s sites, providing an opportunity to hear 
employees’ views on a range of matters. As part of my induction, 
I have also visited a number of sites and have found this a very 
useful way of developing my understanding of the business.
Have there been any changes to the Board 
during the year?
The principal focus of the Nomination Committee was 
to identify a successor to Phil White as Chairman. The 
process undertaken by the Committee is summarised on 
page 71. I am delighted to have been appointed to the role and 
look forward to working with the Board over the years to come. 
The only other change to the Board during the year was the 
appointment of Constance Baroudel as Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee following the 2016 AGM when Amanda Mellor, the 
previous Chair, did not stand for re-election.
The 2017 Board evaluation was externally-
facilitated – what issues did it identify?
The 2017 Board evaluation confirmed that the Board is 
effective, with a strong mix of skills. The evaluation also 
provided a number of areas for us to focus on in 2018, 
including ensuring that time is set aside to continue to review 
progress against the Group’s strategy and to oversee the 
continued review of the Group’s risk management framework. 
It also confirmed that the Board has made good progress with 
respect to the action plan which was agreed following the 2016 
Board evaluation process. Further details are set out on pages 68 
and 69.
The Board is accountable for the Group’s 
management of risk. How has the Board 
discharged its responsibilities?
During the year, the Board assessed the principal risks 
and uncertainties facing the Group, together with its 
appetite with respect to each of these risks. In light of 
these assessments, the Board, via the Risk Management and 
Audit Committee (the RMAC), reviewed the effectiveness of the 
Group’s systems of risk management and internal control. Further 
details of how the Group manages risk are set out on pages 34 to 
36 (inclusive). Please also see page 62 for the statements which, 
under the Code, the Board is required to provide with respect to 
the management of risk and other matters.
Are there material changes to Kier’s 
remuneration policy this year?
During the summer of 2017, Constance Baroudel led the 
consultation with shareholders with respect to a new 
remuneration policy, which is set out on pages 86 to 93 
(inclusive) and is subject to approval by shareholders at the 
forthcoming AGM. We were grateful to shareholders for the level 
of engagement and their positive feedback. Shareholders will note 
that, following the consultation, the Remuneration Committee 
decided that there was no need to make significant changes to 
the policy which was approved at the 2014 AGM.
What engagement with shareholders has the 
Board had during the year?
We remain committed to regular and active dialogue 
with our shareholders. During the year, and in addition 
to Constance’s meetings with shareholders, our Senior 
Independent Director, Justin Atkinson, and Phil White met major 
shareholders to understand their views on a range of issues 
(including the Chairman’s succession and risk management). 
A number of other investor relations events took place during 
the year, details of which are provided on page 81. 
As the new Chairman, I have written to a number of major 
shareholders to offer a meeting to introduce myself. I also 
look forward to meeting shareholders at the AGM on  
17 November 2017.

Explanation of non-compliance with the Code
Kier complies with all provisions of the Code other than Code 
provision B.2.3, which requires Non-Executive Directors to be 
appointed for specified terms. Although Adam Walker and

for a specified term.
However, each Non-Executive Director’s letter of appointment 
contains a notice period of one month (either way) and his/her 
appointment is subject to annual re-election and to statutory 
provisions relating to the removal of directors. The Company’s 
current policy is that all Directors, including the Non-Executive 
Directors, are subject to annual re-election at the Company’s AGM 
and that, in the future, all Non-Executive Directors (other than the 
Chairman) will be appointed for an initial three-year term.

During the 2017 financial year, the Company continued to apply the main principles of the Code, as follows: 
D. Remuneration
D1 Levels and elements  
of remuneration The 
Remuneration Committee 
sets levels of remuneration 
which are designed to 
promote the long-term 
success of the Group and 
structures remuneration 
so as to link it to both 
corporate and individual 
performance, thereby 
aligning management’s 
interests with those 
of shareholders.
D2 Development of 
remuneration policy  
and packages Details  
of the activities of the 
Remuneration Committee 
can be found in the 
Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 82 to 101 
(inclusive).
E. Relations with 
shareholders
E1 Shareholder engagement 
and dialogue The Board 
takes an active role in 
engaging with shareholders. 
The Board particularly 
values opportunities to 
meet with shareholders and 
the Chairman ensures that 
the Board is kept informed 
about shareholders’ views. 
Please see ‘Relations with 
shareholders’ on page 81. 
E2 Constructive use of the 
AGM The AGM provides the 
Board with an important 
opportunity to meet with 
shareholders, who are 
invited to meet the Board 
following the formal 
business of the meeting.
C. Accountability
C1 Financial and business 
reporting The Board has 
established arrangements to 
ensure that reports and other 
information published by 
the Group are fair, balanced 
and understandable. The 
Strategic Report, set out on 
pages 1 to 57 (inclusive), 
provides information about 
the performance of the 
Group, the business model, 
the Group’s strategy and the 
risks and uncertainties 
relating to the Group’s 
future prospects.
C2 Risk management and 
internal control systems 
The Board sets the Group’s 
risk appetite and, via the 
RMAC, monitors and annually 
reviews the effectiveness 
of the Group’s systems of 
risk management and 
internal control. 
C3 Role and responsibilities 
of the Risk Management and 
Audit Committee The Board 
has delegated a number of 
responsibilities to the RMAC.

RMAC are summarised in the 
Risk Management and Audit 
Committee report on pages 
73 to 78 (inclusive).
A. Leadership

the year (with other meetings 
being held during the year to 
discuss specific matters). 
There is a clear schedule of 
matters reserved for the Board 
(please see page 64 for a 
summary), together with 
delegated authorities which are 
used throughout the Group.
A2 A clear division of 
responsibilities The roles of the 
Chairman and Chief Executive

leadership and effectiveness of 
the Board. The Chief Executive 
is responsible for leading the 
day-to-day management of the 
Group within the strategy set 
by the Board.
A3 Role of the Chairman The 
Chairman sets the agendas for 
Board meetings, manages the 
meetings (in conjunction with 
the Company Secretary) and 
facilitates open and 
constructive dialogue 
during them.
A4 Role of the Non-Executive 
Directors The Chairman 
promotes an open and 
constructive environment in 
the boardroom and actively 
invites the Non-Executive 
Directors’ views. The  
Non-Executive Directors 
provide objective, rigorous 
and constructive challenge 
to management and hold 
meetings at which the 
Executive Directors are 
not present.
B. Effectiveness
B1 The Board’s composition 
The Nomination Committee is 
responsible for regularly 
reviewing the composition of 
the Board. In recommending 
appointments to the Board, the 
Nomination Committee 
considers the range of skills, 
knowledge and experience 
required, taking into account 
the benefits of diversity on the 
Board, including gender.
B2 Board appointments  
The appointment of new 
Directors is led by the 
Nomination Committee. 
Further details of the 
activities of the Nomination 
Committee can be found 
on pages 70 and 71.
B3 Time commitments  
On appointment, Directors 
are notified of the time 
commitment expected from 
them which, in practice, goes 
beyond that set out in their 
letter of appointment. External 
directorships, which may affect 
existing time commitments, 
must be agreed with 
the Chairman.
B4 Induction, training and 
development All Directors 
receive an induction on joining 
the Board. Training is made 
available to members of the 
Board in accordance with their 
requirements. Please see

support The Chairman, in 
conjunction with the Company 
Secretary, ensures that all 
Board members receive 
accurate and timely information.

year, the Board undertook

Highlights
 › Completion of Constance Baroudel’s induction
 › Good progress made in relation to Philip Cox’s induction
 › Completion of action plan following the 2016 Board 
evaluation
Information and support
The Board is provided with regular and timely information on the 
Group’s operational and financial performance, together with 
reports on trading, health and safety, performance against the 
Group’s strategy and other matters.
The Company Secretary is the secretary to the Board and each of 
its committees. Prior to each Board or Committee meeting, the 
Company Secretary ensures that the relevant papers are made 
available, via a secure electronic portal, sufficiently in advance of 
the meeting. All Directors have access to the services of the 
Company Secretary and may take independent professional advice 
at the expense of the Company.
Time commitment
The Executive Directors may serve on other boards of directors, 
provided that they can demonstrate that any such appointment 
will not interfere with their time commitment to the Company. 
The Nomination Committee remains satisfied that all  
Non-Executive Directors have sufficient time to meet their 
commitments to the Company. Philip Cox’s other commitments 
were disclosed to the Board before his appointment as 
Chairman Designate.
The major commitments of the Directors are outlined on pages 66 
and 67.
Re-election of Directors
As it is the first AGM since his appointment, a resolution will be 
proposed to elect Philip Cox as a Director at the AGM on 
17 November 2017. All other Directors will offer themselves for 
re-election at the AGM.
The Board considers that each of the Non-Executive Directors is 
independent. In March 2018, Nick Winser will have served as a 
Director for nine years, having been appointed in March 2009. The 
Board remains satisfied that Nick continues to be independent in 
character and judgement and that there are no relationships or 
circumstances which are likely to affect his ability to exercise 
independent judgement or to act in the best interests of the 
Company. The Board also considers that Nick continues to play an 
important role as the Chairman of the SHE Committee and that 
his experience will support the transition to the new Chairman. 
The Board therefore considers it appropriate to propose Nick for 
re-election at the AGM.
Ongoing training and development
A programme of courses is made available to the Directors, who 
are encouraged to attend courses which they consider to be of 
relevance to their roles.
The training which was made available to the Board during the 
year included seminars or presentations relating to:
 › board effectiveness › corporate governance 
 › corporate reporting › cyber security
 › risk management › the EU Market Abuse Regulation.
Director induction
All Directors undertake a full, formal and tailored induction 
programme on joining the Board. By way of example, a summary 
of the induction undertaken by Constance Baroudel (who was 
appointed to the Board with effect from 1 July 2016) is as follows:

Nomination Committee report
Dear shareholder
Following Phil White’s retirement as the Chair of the Committee, 
I am pleased to present the Nomination Committee report, which 
provides a summary of the Committee’s activities during 2017.
Committee performance evaluation
2017 – progress against 2016 evaluation
The 2016 Board evaluation identified:
 › a need for regular reviews of the Executive Director succession 
plan; and
 › the commencement of the Chairman’s succession process
as being the two key areas of focus for the Committee in the 2017 
financial year. The 2017 Board evaluation process confirmed that 
the Committee had made good progress with respect to the 
Executive Director succession plan and the Committee oversaw 
the appointment of a new Chairman during the year.
2018 – principal areas of focus
Following the 2017 Board evaluation, the Committee’s principal 
areas of focus for the 2018 financial year include:
 › clarifying the Committee’s immediate priorities, following the 
appointment of a new Chairman; and
 › reviewing the skills, knowledge, experience and diversity of 
the Board.
Diversity
As a board, we recognise the benefits of diversity. Diversity of 
skills, background, knowledge, experience and gender, amongst a 
number of other factors, are and will continue to be taken into 
consideration when new appointments to the Board are made. 
All Board appointments are and will continue to be made on merit.
The Committee notes the recommendations in the five-year review 
of Lord Davies’ Report (October 2015) and the Hampton-Alexander 
Review (November 2016), one of which is that there should be a 
minimum representation of women on FTSE350 company boards 
of 33% by 2020. The size of the Board in recent years, amongst 
other factors, has made this challenging to achieve. Gender 
diversity will, however, remain an important consideration when 
reviewing the Board’s future composition.
“ The Nomination Committee has a vital role in ensuring 
that the Board has the right mix of skills and 
experience to deliver the Group’ s strategy – and for 
identifying tomorrow’ s leaders.”

Chairman’s succession 
The process for identifying and appointing a successor to Phil White as Chairman was led by the Senior Independent Director, Justin 
Atkinson. The Committee appointed Korn Ferry (which has no other connection with the Company) to assist it in the process. Phil White 
did not attend any of the Committee’s meetings at which the process was discussed and was not involved in the selection or 
appointment of his successor. 
The key elements of the role profile for the new Chairman included: 
 › strong experience of overseeing the implementation of strategy;
 › a familiarity with tight margin business environments and the associated risks; and
 › an ability to manage multiple stakeholders effectively.
A summary of the process is as follows:
Executive Director succession planning
As a committee, we are keen to ensure that a strong pipeline of future senior management has been identified, from which future Board 
appointments can be made. In particular, our focus is on ensuring that the Board has the right mix of skills and experience both to lead 
a business which has changed significantly in recent years and also to oversee the delivery of the Group’s strategy.
During the year, the Committee has worked closely with the Group HR Director and the Group Head of Talent and Organisational 
Development to identify a pipeline of potential future Board members. A summary of some of the key elements of the approach 
adopted, and discussed with the Committee, is as follows:

Highlights
 › Successful establishment of a single finance shared

 › Good progress with respect to the Group’s new ERP system
 › Systems of risk management and internal controls assessed 
as being effective
For further information on how we manage risk, please turn to  
pages 34 to 36 (inclusive).
Systems of risk management and internal control
General
The Board is responsible for the Group’s systems of risk 
management and internal control, including those established to 
identify, manage and monitor risk. These systems are designed to 
mitigate, but cannot completely eliminate, the risks faced by the 
Group. The Board has delegated responsibility for overseeing the 
implementation of these systems to the RMAC.
The Group Head of Risk and Internal Audit, who has direct access 
to the RMAC and its Chair, reports to the RMAC on strategic risk 
issues and oversees the Group’s risk management framework. 
Working with the Group Head of Risk and Internal Audit, 
management is responsible for the identification and evaluation of 
the risks that apply to the Group’s business and operations, 
together with the design and implementation of controls which are 
designed to manage those risks. A summary of how the Group 
identifies and manages risk is set out on pages 34 to 36 
(inclusive). 
During the 2018 financial year, the Board and the RMAC will 
continue to oversee the review of the Group’s risk management 
framework, which is summarised on pages 34 and 35.
To support this framework, the Group has a ‘whistleblowing’ 
helpline which enables employees to raise concerns in 
confidence. Further information about the helpline is set out 
under ‘Systems of risk management and internal control – 
Whistleblowing arrangements’ in the Risk Management and 
Audit Committee report on page 74.
Effectiveness review
The Code requires that the Board conducts an annual review of 
the Group’s systems of risk management and internal control. 
The steps taken by the RMAC, on behalf of the Board, in reviewing 
these systems are described under ‘Systems of risk management 
and internal control – Effectiveness review’ in the Risk 
Management and Audit Committee report on page 74.
Financial reporting
The Group has clear policies and procedures to ensure the 
conformity, reliability and accuracy of financial reporting, including 
the process for preparing the Group’s interim and annual financial 
statements. 
The Group’s financial reporting policies and procedures cover 
financial planning and reporting, preparation of financial 
information and the monitoring and control of capital expenditure.
The Group’s financial statements preparation process includes 
reviews at business unit, divisional and Group levels.
By way of example, a summary of the process for signing-off the 
2017 financial statements is:
During the year, the Board oversaw:
 › the establishment of the FSSC, based in Manchester; and
 › significant progress with respect to the implementation of the 
Group’s new ERP system.
Both the FSSC and the new ERP system have delivered 
significant improvements to the Group’s financial 
reporting processes.
Assessment of principal risks
During the year, the Board conducted a review of the Group’s 
principal risks and uncertainties, together with its appetite with 
respect to each such risk. A summary of the review process is 
as follows:
The Board’s statement relating to its assessment of the Group’s 
principal risks and uncertainties is set out on page 62.
Board statements
The Board delegated the responsibility for conducting the work 
required for it to provide the ‘fair, balanced and understandable’, 
‘going concern’ and ‘viability’ statements to the RMAC. Further 
details of the work carried out by the RMAC in support of these 
statements is set out in the Risk Management and Audit 
Committee report on pages 74 and 75. In conducting this work, 
the RMAC acts on behalf of the Board and its activities remain the 
responsibility of the Board.

The 2016 Board evaluation identified the following as key areas of 
focus for the Committee in the 2017 financial year:
 › continuing to review the Group’ s risk management framework; and
 › agreeing the respective roles of the Board and the Committee 
with respect to the management of risk.
Following the appointment of a new Group Head of Risk and Internal 
Audit, good progress was made with respect to the review of the 
risk management framework, which will remain a principal area of 
focus for the Committee in 2018. The Board and Committee agreed 
their respective roles in relation to the management of risk.
2018 – principal areas of focus
The Committee will focus on:
 › ensuring that the Group’s systems of risk management and 
internal control continue to support the Group’s growth; and 
 › challenging PwC to continue to audit the Group’s financial 
statements robustly.

General
Information on how the Group manages risk, including 
a description of the principal aspects of the Group’s systems of 
risk management and internal control, is set out on pages

Effectiveness review
The Code requires the Board, at least annually, to conduct a 
review of the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of risk 
management and internal control. The Board’s statement about 
this review is set out on page 62.
At its meeting in September 2017, the Committee reviewed 
management’s assessment of the key elements of these systems 
and confirmed their overall effectiveness. In forming its 
conclusion, the Committee noted, in particular, that:
 › during the year, KPMG conducted a number of internal audits 
and worked with management to ensure that actions were 
closed-out appropriately. Please see page 77 for examples;
 › the FSSC had been set up during the year, introducing common 
systems and procedures across the Group; 
 › management continued to review the Group’ s key financial controls 
to ensure that they supported the Group’ s continued growth; and
 › good progress continued to be made in relation to the transition 
to the Group’s new ERP system.
Whistleblowing arrangements
The Group makes available an externally-hosted ‘whistleblowing’ 
helpline, which employees can call, in confidence, if they have any 
concerns about improprieties in financial reporting or other 
matters. Any such concerns are then investigated.
During the year, the Committee oversaw management’s 
appointment of a new helpline provider, Safecall. To accompany 
this appointment, management implemented a programme 
to raise awareness of the helpline throughout the Group. 
At each Committee meeting during the year, the Committee 
reviewed reports which provided details of the issues reported 
to the helpline and how management had investigated them. 
No material issues were reported to the helpline or via other 
means during the year.
Board statements
Introduction
Under the Code, the Board is required to provide a number of 
statements, as set out on page 62. The Committee’s work to 
support the Board’s statement with respect to the Group’s 
systems of risk management and internal control is described 
above under ‘Systems of risk management and internal control 
– Effectiveness review.’ The Committee’s work with respect to the 
‘fair, balanced and understandable’, ‘going concern’ and ‘viability’ 
statements is described below.
Fair, balanced and understandable review
The work undertaken by management and the Committee to 
support the Board’s statement included:
 › setting up a committee of senior individuals within the Group to 
draft the Annual Report;

Principal activities – 2017 financial year
The following matters were considered during the Committee 
meetings which took place during the year:
74 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017  › requesting that certain key contributors to sections of the 
Annual Report (for example, Managing Directors and Finance 
Directors of business units) sign a declaration confirming the 
accuracy of the information provided;
 › arranging for FutureValue (a corporate reporting consultancy) to 
review the Annual Report and for Mercer, the Company’s 
remuneration consultants, to review the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report;
 › circulating drafts of the Annual Report to PwC, the Committee 
and the Board for review; and
 › discussing material disclosure items at a meeting of the 
Committee held in September 2017.
The Committee discussed the ‘fair, balanced and understandable’ 
statement at its meeting in September 2017 and, having done so, 
recommended that the Board provide it in the form set out on 
page 62.
Going concern
The principal aspects of the review process conducted by the 
Committee and management to support the Board’s 
statement were:
 › reviewing the Group’s available sources of funding and, in 
particular, testing the covenants and assessing the available 
headroom using a range of assumptions;
 › reviewing the short, medium and long-term cash flow forecasts 
in various material downside scenarios;
 › assessing the level of available bonding facilities, which are 
considered necessary to support the Group’s ability to tender 
and deliver future growth; and
 › assessing the Group’s current and forecast activities, 
including its long-term contracts and order books, and those 
factors considered likely to affect its future performance and 
financial position.
The Committee discussed the going concern statement at its 
meeting in September 2017 and, having done so, recommended 
that the Board provide it in the form set out on page 62.
Viability statement
The Directors have chosen to consider the prospects of the Group 
over a three-year period ending 30 June 2020, as they consider it 
to be a period over which they are able to forecast the Group’s 
performance with reasonable certainty.
In particular:
 › a number of programmes relating to the Group’s key 
construction projects, which are important factors in an 
assessment of the Group’s performance, operate over a 
three-year period;
 › the visibility of the Group’s secured work and bidding 
opportunities can reasonably be assessed over a three-year 
period; and
 › the KPIs contained in Vision 2020 cover a three-year period 
ending 30 June 2020.
The Committee’s assessment included a review of the potential 
impact of severe but plausible scenarios that could threaten the 
viability of the Group and the effectiveness of the potential 
mitigations that management believes would be available. These 
scenarios included a significant downturn in the property market, 
followed by a similar effect on the UK construction market, and a 
decline in the UK infrastructure market. The Committee discussed 
the viability statement at its meeting in September 2017 and, 
having done so, recommended that the Board provide it in the 
form set out on page 62.
2017 financial reporting
The audit
At its meetings in June and September 2017, the Committee discussed the 2017 audit process. The following is a summary of the key 
issues discussed by the Committee and PwC at these meetings:
During the audit, I met PwC’s lead audit partner to discuss the process. Following the conclusion of the September meeting, the Committee 
met PwC without management being present: no significant issues, other than those discussed at the Committee meeting, were raised.

Significant issues and  
accounting judgements Action undertaken by the RMAC/Board
Valuation of land and 
properties
The Group holds inventory within the Residential and Property divisions, primarily comprising land held 
for development, for which construction has not started, and work-in-progress. The carrying value of the 
inventory is based on the Group’s current estimates of the sales prices and building costs.
Inventory in these divisions is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value (i.e. the forecast 
selling price, less the remaining costs to build and sell). An assessment of the net realisable value was 
carried out as at 30 June 2017 and requires management to estimate forecast selling prices and build 
costs, which may require significant judgement.
One of the key elements of the systems of risk management and internal control within these divisions 
is the development appraisals prepared by management, using a number of internal and external 
reference points. Accordingly, PwC challenged these appraisals in a number of ways, including: (in 
Residential) reviewing management’s expected build costs and challenging forecast sales prices and (in 
Property) reconciling the development appraisals to the work-in-progress summary, interviewing those 
responsible for each development and, where applicable, obtaining independent evidence to support the 
rental and yield rates adopted in the appraisal. PwC’s conclusion, following these steps, is set out in the 
independent auditor’s report on page 106.
Accounting for 
long-term contracts 
– including profit 
recognition, work-in-
progress and 
provisioning
The Group has significant long-term contracts in the Construction and Services divisions, in particular. 
Profit is recognised according to the stage of completion of the contract. The assessment of profit 
requires the exercise of judgement when preparing estimates of the forecast costs and revenues of a 
contract. A number of factors are relevant to this assessment, including, in particular, the expected 
recovery of costs.
During the year, the Board reviewed and considered management’s latest assessment of the forecast 
costs of, and revenues from, certain long-term contracts, particularly those in the Infrastructure and 
International businesses – for example, the Group’s projects for MTR in Hong Kong and in St. Kitts. 
The Committee identified accounting for long-term contracts as one of the principal matters for review 
by PwC in the 2017 audit. As part of its work, PwC reviewed the forecast ‘end life’ positions, challenging 
the judgements applied by management (in particular, the key assumptions on which they are based), 
and reviewed correspondence and contracts to assess whether these support the judgements. The 
Committee discussed management’s assessment of such contracts with PwC and management when 
considering the interim and year-end financial statements at its meetings in March and September 
2017, respectively. PwC’s conclusion is set out in the independent auditor’s report on page 107. During 
the year, the Board also obtained advice from the Company’s corporate brokers with respect to such 
long-term contracts. 
Accounting for 
adjustments to 
underlying profit
Management has separately disclosed certain non-underlying items, in addition to presenting the 
underlying results of the Group. Details of those items are set out in note 4 to the consolidated financial 
statements. The Committee identified the accounting treatment of non-underlying items as one of the 
principal matters for review by PwC in the 2017 audit. PwC challenged management as to the 
appropriateness of the classification of each item, focusing on those items which PwC considered to be 
more judgemental in nature than others (which included the contract loss elements of the Caribbean 
and Hong Kong exit costs). PwC’s conclusion as to the presentation of the non-underlying items is set 
out in the independent auditor’s report on page 108. During the year, the Board also obtained advice 
from the Company’s corporate brokers with respect to such non-underlying items.
Significant issues and other accounting judgements
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of management’s judgements, assumptions and estimates in preparing 
the financial statements. Following discussions with management and PwC, the Committee also determined that the significant issues 
and other accounting judgements relating to the 2017 financial statements are as shown in the table below.
76 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 Before each audit, KPMG agreed the scope of review, timetable and resources required with management. KPMG also provided regular 
updates to management and members of the Committee on the status of ongoing audits. 
Internal audit function effectiveness
To assess the effectiveness of the internal audit function, members of the Committee and senior management completed a detailed 
questionnaire addressing various aspects of both the internal audit function and KPMG’s performance. The feedback was then reviewed 
by the Committee at its meeting in December 2016. During the year, a new Group Head of Risk and Internal Audit was appointed, to 
work alongside and manage KPMG with respect to the delivery of the internal audit plan.
The Committee concluded that, overall, the internal audit function was operating effectively. A summary of the results of the review is 
as follows:
Internal audits – 2018 financial year
At its June 2017 meeting, the Committee approved the 2018 internal audit plan. Examples of audits planned for the 2018 financial 
year include: 
Internal audit
Internal audits – 2017 financial year
During the year, the Committee monitored progress against the 2017 internal audit plan, which was approved by the Committee at its 
June 2016 meeting. Results from each follow-up audit were discussed by the Committee, together with actions taken by management. 
KPMG (the co-sourced internal auditor) completed 15 internal audits during the year. Examples of these audits include:
Strengths
 › Dedicated and focused team
 › Good understanding of the business
 › Clear audit reports, challenging the business to manage 
risk effectively
Future areas of focus
 › Continue to ensure effective communication of material 
issues to the Committee
 › Ensure appropriate engagement with the businesses
 › Continue to close-out identified issues promptly
External audit
General
The Committee is responsible for overseeing the relationship with the external auditor, its effectiveness and the audit process, by:
 › approving the annual audit plan;
 › monitoring the external audit process;
 › making recommendations to the Board in relation to the auditor’s appointment, re-appointment and removal;
 › approving its remuneration and terms of engagement;
 › reviewing and monitoring its independence and objectivity; and
 › developing and implementing a non-audit services policy.
External auditor effectiveness
During the year, the Committee conducted an evaluation of PwC’s performance (with respect to the 2016 audit). A questionnaire was 
issued to key stakeholders, including members of the Committee and those involved in the 2016 audit. Feedback from the evaluation 
was discussed by the Committee at its meeting in December 2016 and was subsequently provided to PwC so that it could be taken into 
account when planning the 2017 audit.

Fees Approval required
Up to £10,000 The Finance Director may authorise fees on individual assignments (not exceeding £50,000 in any 
financial year).
Above £10,000 Must be approved in advance by the Committee. The Chair of the Committee may provide urgent approval 
(subject to the subsequent reporting of the approval to the Committee).
Non-audit fees incurred during the year were £85,000, which is approximately 7% of the 2017 audit fee of £1,266,000. The non-audit 
fees related to sustainability reporting assurance (£50,000) and the 2017 interim financial statements review (£35,000). The 
Committee concluded that PwC’s independence and objectivity was not compromised by it providing these services and that, as a result 
of its knowledge of the Group and its financial statements, it was in the Group’s interests to engage PwC to do so. 
PwC first audited the Group’s financial statements in the 2015 financial year. The lead audit partner since that date has been Jonathan 
Hook. PwC requires the lead audit partner to change after five years. As part of the 2017 audit, PwC confirmed that it was independent 
within the meaning of applicable regulatory and professional requirements. Taking this into account, and having considered the steps 
taken by PwC to preserve its independence, the Committee concluded that PwC continues to demonstrate appropriate 
independence and objectivity.
Conclusion
I will be available to answer any questions about the Committee, our work and how we operate at the AGM on 17 November 2017.
Adam Walker
Chair of the Risk Management and Audit Committee
20 September 2017
The Committee will formally assess PwC’ s performance in relation to the 2017 audit during the 2018 financial year. However, the Committee 
discussed its preliminary views at its meeting in September 2017 and concluded that, overall, it remained satisfied with PwC’ s performance. 
PwC has indicated its willingness to continue in office and the Committee has recommended PwC’ s re-appointment to the Board. A resolution to 
re-appoint PwC as the external auditor will therefore be proposed at the 2017 AGM. 
External auditor independence and non-audit services
During the year, PwC provided certain non-audit services to the Group. The Committee monitors the level and scope of these services to 
ensure that the associated fees are not of a level that would affect PwC’s independence and objectivity.
In March 2017, the Committee approved a revised non-audit services policy, which reflects the FRC’s revised Ethical Standards for 
Auditors. The policy provides that the Committee expects that the level of non-audit fees in any one financial year will not exceed 15% of 
the audit fee payable in relation to the previous year. 
The limits of authority within the policy are:
The Committee concluded that, overall, PwC had operated effectively and had provided an appropriate level of challenge during the 2016 audit. 
A summary of the results of the review is as follows:
Strengths
 › The audit plan was thorough and detailed, focusing on the 
key issues
 › Collaborative, but challenging, approach taken by the audit 
team when engaging with the business
 › Significant technical awareness and expertise evident 
throughout the audit team
Future areas of focus
 › Refreshing communication protocols so as to expedite the 
audit process
 › So far as possible, maintaining continuity of audit team 
members
 › Ensuring a depth of industry-specific knowledge across the

78 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 Safety, Health and Environment Committee report
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present the Safety, Health and Environment 
Committee report, which provides a summary of the Committee’s 
activities during the 2017 financial year.
The Group operates on several hundred sites at any one time, 
both throughout the UK and internationally; the Group’s projects 
can be complex and are not without risk. As a Committee, we 
oversee the continuous improvement of the management of 
safety, health and environment (SHE) risks in the workplace.
I am therefore pleased to be able to report, overall, a strong 
SHE performance in 2017, with a significant reduction in the 
Group’s reportable accident incidence rate (AIR) by 38%, as 
compared to the prior year, and good progress with respect to 
reducing the Group’s energy use. Please see page 22 for details 
of progress made against the Group’s strategic priority to operate 
a safe and sustainable business. 
Committee composition and meeting attendance
The names of the members of the Committee are set out above. 
The Chief Executive, the Executive Director – Construction and 
Infrastructure Services, the Executive Director – Developments, 
Property and Business Services and the Group SHE Director are 
expected to attend meetings, unless they are notified to the contrary.
The secretary of the Committee is the Company Secretary 
(Hugh Raven).
The Committee met formally four times during the year; details of 
attendance at these meetings are set out on page 65.
Committee performance evaluation
2017 – progress against 2016 evaluation
The 2016 Board evaluation identified:
 › an increased focus on environmental matters;
 › an increased focus on health and wellbeing; and
 › the need to maximise the benefit of the visible leadership tours
as some of the key areas of focus for the Committee in the 2017 
financial year. The 2017 Board evaluation process confirmed that 
good progress had been made in each of these areas and that, 
overall, the Committee’s performance had been effective during 
the year.
2018 – principal areas of focus
Following the 2017 evaluation, the Committee’s principal areas of 
focus for the 2018 financial year include:
 › maintaining a focus on key strategic issues, whilst challenging 
management with respect to operational issues; and
 › ensuring sufficient time is set aside to consider environmental 
and health and wellbeing matters.
“ The health and safety of all those who visit and work at 
the Group’ s sites, together with the protection of the 
environment, are key priorities for Kier.”

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
  Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 79 Principal activities – 2017 financial year
A summary of the safety, health and environment matters 
considered by the Committee during the year is as follows:
Safety
Key incident reviews
At each meeting during the year, the Committee reviewed key 
safety incidents and received presentations on certain of those 
incidents from senior management. In addition, the Committee 
monitored the close-out of all actions arising from such incidents 
and challenged management to ensure the effective 
communication of any learning points across the Group.
Regulatory investigations
From time to time, the Health and Safety Executive (the HSE) will 
conduct investigations into incidents which occur on the Group’s 
sites. Some of these investigations may result in court 
proceedings being taken against the Group and, as a committee, 
we work with management to ensure that its approach to the 
conduct of these proceedings is appropriate. During the year, the 
Committee oversaw the management of the prosecution brought 
against the BFK joint venture site following a fatality at the 
Farringdon section of the Crossrail project in March 2014 and two 
other incidents at the Bond Street section in January 2015, which 
resulted in a fine of £1.065m for the joint venture. In addition, the 
Committee also monitored management’ s approach to the HSE’s 
investigation into a fatality which took place in May 2014 at Lidgate 
and the court proceedings relating to a trench collapse at a site in 
Holbeach (which occurred in March 2012), which resulted in a 
£1.5m fine in December 2016.
SHE strategy
During the year, the Committee reviewed progress against the Group’ s 
SHE strategic business plan. Performance is measured against an 
agreed set of KPIs, which are designed to support the Group’s 
strategic priority of operating a safe and sustainable business. 
I am pleased to report that, overall, significant progress was made 
against these targets. See page 22 for further information.
SHE campaigns
A series of campaigns relating to topical SHE matters were run 
across the Group throughout the year. The Committee challenged 
management on the effectiveness of these campaigns, 
which included:
 › a focus on the prevention of slips, trips and falls;
 › a reduction in the number of buried services strikes; and
 › a focus on key site safety matters, including identifying hazards, 
working around plant and promoting appropriate safety 
behaviours.
Innovation
The Board, and its committees, supports management’s focus 
on innovation throughout the business. The Committee has 
challenged management to focus on the use of innovation to 
manage the safety risks relevant to the Group. During the year, 
the Committee oversaw:
 › the launch of a central, Group-wide portal as a hub for safety 
risk management documents and advice; and
 › the development of the ‘Engage to Change’ App, which provides 
employees with an efficient way to give feedback on SHE 
practices within the Group.
Visible leadership tours
All members of the Committee are required to conduct ‘visible 
leadership tours’ across the Group’s sites during the year  
and to report on those visits at subsequent meetings. The 
Committee also monitored visits which were undertaken by senior 
management throughout the year. The tours are well-received by 
the business, informative for management and have a measurable 
positive effect on the Group’s safety statistics.
Health and wellbeing
During the year, the Committee continued to monitor the Group’s 
health and wellbeing programme, which aims to raise awareness 
of common health issues. The programme included a focus on 
mental health, blood pressure, heart awareness and diabetes and 
the use of a ‘health kiosk’ (which tested staff on core health 
issues and visited various offices and sites around the country).
The Committee also oversaw management’s strategic review of 
the provision of occupational health (OH) services within the 
Group, which resulted in the transfer of the provision of OH 
services to an external provider.
Environmental matters
The Group’s environmental performance is measured against a set 
of KPIs, including with respect to carbon emissions, water usage 
and waste management. During the year, the Committee reviewed 
the Group’s performance against these KPIs and was pleased to 
note that good progress was being made. The Committee also 
reviewed the statistics relating to the reporting of environmental 
incidents (for example, effluent leakages or spillages and noise or 
dust pollution) and challenged management to take appropriate 
action following such incidents. During the year, the Committee 
approved the ‘Kier Energy Strategy – 30 by 30’, which aims to 
reduce the Group’s energy usage by 30% by 2030. Further details 
can be found on pages 30 to 33 (inclusive).
Conclusion
I will be available to answer any questions you may have about the 
Committee, our work and how we operate at the AGM on 
17 November 2017.

  Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 81 Directors’ Remuneration Report
Annual statement of the Chair of the  
Remuneration Committee
Dear shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for 2017. 
This Directors’ Remuneration Report is divided into three 
principal sections: 
 › this annual statement, which provides the context for the 
Committee’s decisions during the year and summarises the 
key points from the remainder of the report;
 › the new remuneration policy; and
 › the annual report on remuneration, which provides details of 
remuneration paid to the Board during the 2017 financial year.
Approach to remuneration at Kier
Our remuneration policy aims to:
 › incentivise and reward the delivery of strategy and performance: 
over two-thirds of the Executive Directors’ maximum 
remuneration opportunity is variable and relates to the Group’s 
performance against its strategic objectives (as set out on 
pages 22 to 29 (inclusive));
 › align Executive Directors’ interests with those of shareholders: 
approximately half of the Executive Directors’ maximum 
remuneration opportunity is satisfied in shares and the Executive 
Directors are encouraged to build up shareholdings in the 
Company of at least two years’ base salary over a period of up 
to five years, promoting a culture of long-term stewardship; and
 › attract and retain talent: the Committee considers practices 
in comparable businesses so as to ensure that remuneration 
at Kier remains competitive, enabling it to attract and retain 
talented individuals, but without paying more than is necessary.
Remuneration framework
There are three elements to the framework for the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration:
 › fixed element: comprises base salary, taxable benefits 
(private health insurance and a company car or car allowance) 
and a pension;
 › short-term element: an annual bonus, which incentivises and 
rewards the delivery of a balanced selection of financial and 
non-financial targets in a financial year, with payments being 
satisfied in cash (2/3), which will now be subject to clawback, 
and shares (1/3), which are deferred for three years; and 
 › long-term element: the LTIP incentivises financial performance 
over a three-year period, promoting long-term sustainable value 
creation for shareholders. Vested shares will now be subject to 
a two-year holding period.
New remuneration policy
The Committee consulted with major shareholders in relation to 
the proposed new remuneration policy, which is set out on pages 
86 to 93 (inclusive). The policy is subject to shareholder approval 
every three years and, therefore, will be voted on at the Annual 
General Meeting on 17 November 2017. The Committee 
considers that the current remuneration policy has served Kier 
well over the last three years; shareholders will, therefore, note 
that the changes to the existing policy are generally of an 
evolutionary nature, with the Committee having taken into account 
recent developments in corporate governance and best practice. 
The changes to the 2014 policy are set out in the future policy 
table on pages 86 to 89 (inclusive).
Implementation of the new remuneration policy in 2018
Details of the implementation of the new policy in 2018 are set out 
in ‘Remuneration at a glance’ on page 84. The Committee 
consulted with shareholders with respect to both the new policy and 
its implementation in 2018. A summary of the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration in 2018 is:
Base salaries
The Executive Directors (other than the Chief Executive) received a 
3% increase in base salary with effect from 1 July 2017, in line 
with the average increases awarded to employees. The Chief 
Executive received a 5% increase in base salary, in line with the 
increases awarded to high performers and reflecting his 
progression in the role, leading a business of increasing scale and 
complexity, and the Group’s good performance in challenging 
market conditions. The Committee is satisfied that the Executive 
Directors’ base salaries are in line with the median of those paid 
at peer group companies.
“ The new remuneration policy is aligned to Kier’ s 
Vision 2020 and will continue to incentivise 
management to drive the performance of the  
Group for the long-term benefit of shareholders.”

 Remuneration Report, terms of

82 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 When setting salaries, the Committee takes into account a 
number of factors, including the nature of the role (and its 
evolution), an individual’s performance, the external environment 
(including shareholder feedback), an individual’s total 
remuneration and the average salary increases awarded to the 
Group’s employees (and how these are distributed). 
Annual bonus
The maximum bonus opportunity for the Chief Executive will be 
125%, with 115% for the other Executive Directors (an increase 
from 100% in 2017). The Committee considers these 
opportunities to be in line with those at peer group companies.
So that the increased bonus opportunities further incentivise 
the delivery of Vision 2020, ‘on-target’ bonus payments (as a 
percentage of salary) for the Executive Directors (other than the 
Chief Executive) will remain unchanged from those which applied 
in the 2017 financial year. Reflecting his higher bonus opportunity, 
the ‘on target’ payment for the Chief Executive (as a percentage of 
salary) will increase by 6%.
The bonus targets will relate to: profit before tax (50%), the 
Group’s year-end net debt position (30%), safety targets (10%) 
and personal objectives (10%).
When assessing the profit before tax element of the bonus, 
the Committee will take into account any non-underlying items 
incurred in the year. When assessing the net debt element, 
the Committee will take into account its key target of average 
month-end net debt being less than the average month-end capital 
invested in the Property and Residential divisions.
The safety element of the bonus will require a reduction in the 
Group’s AAIR during the year. The Committee will also take into 
account any material incidents which may occur during the year. 
The personal objectives element of the bonus will relate to 
matters including customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, risk 
management, innovation and employee engagement.
Further details of the specific targets, together with performance 
against them, will be included in the 2018 Annual Report.
LTIP awards
The Executive Directors will continue to receive an award of 
150% of their base salary in 2018 (the same level as in 2017). 
The performance conditions will again relate to EPS (50%), TSR 
(25%) and net debt : EBITDA (25%), over the three-year period 
ending 30 June 2020.
There will be three changes to the performance conditions for the 
2017 awards, as follows:
 › the use of a bespoke group of listed companies against which 
to compare the Group’s TSR performance, as set out on page 
100. These companies were selected because they compete 
with the Group across the range of services that it provides;
 › as a result of an increased correlation with the new comparator 
group, a reduction in the full-vesting requirement for the TSR 
element from a 12% to a 10% per annum outperformance. The 
Committee considers that the revised requirement is of 
equivalent difficulty to the existing performance condition, 
requiring upper quartile performance; and
 › a reduction in the full-vesting requirement for the EPS 
performance condition from 15% to 13% per annum growth, 
which remains in line with the median full-vesting requirement 
within the FTSE 250. The Committee considers that the revised 
EPS target remains stretching, when assessed against a 
number of internal and external reference points.
Other changes
In 2018, the Committee will introduce:
 › a two-year holding period for vested LTIP shares; and
 › ‘recovery’ provisions in both the holding period and the cash 
element of the annual bonus (alongside existing malus provisions). 
Remuneration outcomes in 2017
Annual bonus
The 2017 bonus targets related to: profit before tax (50%), the Group’ s 
year-end net debt position (40%) and health and safety targets (10%). 
Although the Group’s profit before tax (£126.1m) exceeded the 
threshold for a bonus payment, the Committee took into account 
the level of non-underlying items incurred during the year and 
decided that there would be no payment with respect to this 
element of the bonus. 
The Group’s year-end net debt of £110m represented a strong 
performance. So as to ensure that the year-end net debt figure 
was representative of the Group’s overall net debt position, the 
Committee took into account the Group’s average month-end net 
debt position relative to the average month-end aggregate capital 
invested in the Property and Residential divisions and, having 
done so, was satisfied that a 40% payment for this element of the 
bonus was appropriate.
During the year, the Group’s UK AAIR reduced by 16%, resulting in 
a 4% to 8% payment for the Executive Directors (depending on the 
number of site visits undertaken). 
LTIPs
The performance period for the 2015 LTIP awards ended on 
30 June 2017. These awards will vest as to 29%. Please see 
page 95 for further information.
Remuneration across the Group
In determining the Executive Directors’ remuneration, the 
Committee takes into account general trends in remuneration 
across the Group as a whole. The Committee seeks to ensure 
that the underlying principles which support its decisions on the 
Executive Directors’ remuneration are consistent with those 
which relate to decisions on the pay of the wider workforce. 
In practice, the Executive Directors’ remuneration is more heavily 
weighted towards variable pay (and, therefore, is linked to the 
Group’s performance) than the pay of other employees (which is 
principally driven by market comparators and individual experience 
and performance).
Conclusion
The Committee recognises that executive remuneration in general 
continues to be an area of focus for shareholders and other 
stakeholders. When setting the Executive Directors’ 2018 
remuneration, the Committee took into account shareholders’ 
feedback and is satisfied that, overall, the link between pay and 
performance remains strong, the interests of the Executive 
Directors and shareholders have been further aligned (for 
example, via the new holding period for vested LTIP shares) and 
the Executive Directors’ remuneration remains competitive. 
The Committee will continue to monitor developments in executive 
remuneration and engage with shareholders to ensure that Kier’s 
leadership team is appropriately incentivised to continue to deliver 
growth and the Group’s long-term strategy. 
I will be available to answer any questions you may have about the 
Committee, our work and how we operate at the AGM on 
17 November 2017.

The tables and charts below:
 › smmarise the principal elements of the Executive Directors’ remuneration in 2017;
 › provide an illustration of the application of the new remuneration policy in 2018; and
 › summarise how key elements of the new remuneration policy (as set out on pages 86 to 93 (inclusive)) will be implemented in 2018 
(subject to its approval at the AGM).
Principal elements of the Executive Directors’ remuneration in 2017
The scenarios set out in the above charts reflect or assume the following:
 › ‘Fixed’ remuneration comprises:
 › base salary from 1 July 2017;
 › the estimated value of taxable benefits to be provided in 
2018 in line with the remuneration policy (based on the 
actual value of such benefits provided in 2017, using an 
average (mean) for the other Executive Directors); and 
 › a pension contribution/cash allowance equal to 20% 
of salary.
 › The ‘on-target’ remuneration assumes an annual bonus 
payment of 65% of the maximum opportunity and a 
‘threshold’ LTIP vesting (25% of the maximum opportunity).
 › The ‘maximum’ remuneration assumes maximum 
performance is achieved and therefore awards under the 
annual bonus and the LTIP pay out or vest at their maximum 
levels.
 › No share price appreciation is assumed for LTIP awards.
 › ‘Actual 2017’ applies the figures set out in the table on page 
94, using an average (mean) total single figure and 2014 LTIP 
award value for the other Executive Directors.

Introduction
The Company’s current remuneration policy, as set out in the 2014 Annual Report, received shareholder approval at the AGM in 
November 2014. The Company is therefore required to put a new remuneration policy to shareholders at the AGM on

the AGM (subject to shareholder approval). The Committee is satisfied that the new remuneration policy is in the best interests of 
shareholders and retains discretion to make non-material changes to the policy without reverting to shareholders.

Annual bonus
To reward the delivery of 
near-term performance targets 
and business strategy
The Company operates a discretionary bonus scheme.
Performance measures and targets are set by the Committee at the start of the year. Payments 
are based on an assessment of performance at the end of the year. Clawback will apply to any 
cash bonus paid in respect of the financial year ending 30 June 2018 and future years. 
One-third of any net payment is satisfied by an allocation of Kier Group plc shares, which is 
deferred for three years (subject to early release for ‘good leavers’ and upon a takeover) and is 
subject to a malus provision. Dividend payments accrue on deferred bonus shares over the 
deferral period.
See ‘Malus and clawback’ on page 90.
The maximum potential bonus for the 
financial year ending 30 June 2018 is 
125% of base salary for the Chief Executive 
and 115% of base salary for other 
Executive Directors.
‘Threshold’ performance, for which an 
element of bonus may become payable 
under each component of the annual bonus, 
is set by the Committee at the start of 
each financial year.
The level of bonus for achieving threshold 
performance varies by performance measure, 
and may vary for a measure from year to 
year, to ensure that it is aligned with the 
Committee’s assessment of the degree 
ofdifficulty (or ‘stretch’) in achieving it.
The Committee has discretion to determine 
the performance measures and their 
relative weightings each year. The weighting 
towards non-financial measures will be 
no higher than 25% of the maximum 
potential bonus.
The Committee has discretion to adjust 
bonus payments to ensure that they 
accurately reflect business and safety 
performance over the performance 
period and are fair to shareholders as 
well as recipients.
Actual targets for each performance 
measure (and performance against each 
of these targets), and any use by the 
Committee of its discretion with respect to 
bonus payments, will be disclosed in the 
Annual Report immediately following the 
end of the performance period.
Maximum 2018 opportunities 
increased from 100% of base salary 
(see ‘Opportunity’), with increased 
opportunities payable upon the Group 
exceeding ‘on-target’ performance, 
thereby further incentivising delivery 
of the Group’s strategy. 
Clawback introduced to enable the 
Committee to recover bonus in 
certain circumstances. 
LTIP
To reward the sustained strong 
performance by the Group over 
three years
Awards are made annually and vest, subject to the achievement of performance conditions, at 
the end of a three-year performance period.
At the start of each performance period, the Committee sets performance targets which it 
considers to be appropriately stretching. 
Awards are satisfied in the form of a deferred, contingent right to acquire shares in the Company, 
at no cost to the individual. A two-year post-vesting holding period will apply to awards granted in 
2017 and future years. 
Dividend equivalents (in respect of vested shares) will apply to those awards granted after 
shareholder approval of this policy and, subject to approval of (i) this policy and (ii) any necessary 
changes to the LTIP rules, to those awards granted shortly prior to the 2017 AGM.
A malus provision applies to awards pre-vesting and a clawback provision applies to the post-
vesting holding period. See ‘Malus and clawback’ on page 90.
If an event or series of events occurs as a result of which the Committee deems it fair and 
reasonable that the performance conditions should be modified, the Committee has discretion 
during the vesting period to modify them. Any modified performance conditions must be no more 
difficult to satisfy than the original performance conditions were when first set.
Any use of Committee discretion with respect to modifying performance conditions will be 
disclosed in the relevant Annual Report.
The awards are subject to the terms of the LTIP and the Committee may adjust or amend the 
awards only in accordance with the LTIP rules. 
The maximum award under the rules of the 
plan is 200% of base salary.
The Committee may grant awards of up to 
the maximum permitted under the LTIP rules 
when it considers it appropriate to do so. 
The reasons for an award in excess of 
150% of salary will be disclosed in the 
relevant Annual Report. 
On achieving the threshold performance 
level for each element of the award, 25% 
of the relevant element of the award will 
vest. Vesting is on a straight-line basis 
between threshold and maximum levels 
of performance. 
The performance conditions for the LTIP 
awards to be awarded in the 2018 financial 
year will relate to EPS (50%), TSR (25%) and 
net debt: EBITDA (25%).
EPS performance is measured by 
compound cumulative growth over the 
performance period.
TSR outperformance is measured against 
a bespoke group of listed companies 
which reflects the Group’s business mix 
and competition for capital. The TSR 
comparators for the awards made in the 
financial year ending 30 June 2018 are 
listed on page 100.
The Committee retains discretion to 
change or supplement EPS, TSR and 
net debt : EBITDA as performance 
measures with alternative or additional 
performance measures to ensure that the 
awards are always linked to sustained 
business performance. No measure will 
carry a weighting of less than 25%.
Actual performance measures and 
weightings will be disclosed in the Annual 
Report immediately following the granting  
of an award.

To reward the sustained strong 
performance by the Group over 
three years
Awards are made annually and vest, subject to the achievement of performance conditions, at 
the end of a three-year performance period.
At the start of each performance period, the Committee sets performance targets which it 
considers to be appropriately stretching. 
Awards are satisfied in the form of a deferred, contingent right to acquire shares in the Company, 
at no cost to the individual. A two-year post-vesting holding period will apply to awards granted in 
2017 and future years. 
Dividend equivalents (in respect of vested shares) will apply to those awards granted after 
shareholder approval of this policy and, subject to approval of (i) this policy and (ii) any necessary 
changes to the LTIP rules, to those awards granted shortly prior to the 2017 AGM.
A malus provision applies to awards pre-vesting and a clawback provision applies to the post-
vesting holding period. See ‘Malus and clawback’ on page 90.
If an event or series of events occurs as a result of which the Committee deems it fair and 
reasonable that the performance conditions should be modified, the Committee has discretion 
during the vesting period to modify them. Any modified performance conditions must be no more 
difficult to satisfy than the original performance conditions were when first set.
Any use of Committee discretion with respect to modifying performance conditions will be 
disclosed in the relevant Annual Report.
The awards are subject to the terms of the LTIP and the Committee may adjust or amend the 
awards only in accordance with the LTIP rules. 
The maximum award under the rules of the 
plan is 200% of base salary.
The Committee may grant awards of up to 
the maximum permitted under the LTIP rules 
when it considers it appropriate to do so. 
The reasons for an award in excess of 
150% of salary will be disclosed in the 
relevant Annual Report. 
On achieving the threshold performance 
level for each element of the award, 25% 
of the relevant element of the award will 
vest. Vesting is on a straight-line basis 
between threshold and maximum levels 
of performance. 
The performance conditions for the LTIP 
awards to be awarded in the 2018 financial 
year will relate to EPS (50%), TSR (25%) and 
net debt: EBITDA (25%).
EPS performance is measured by 
compound cumulative growth over the 
performance period.
TSR outperformance is measured against 
a bespoke group of listed companies 
which reflects the Group’s business mix 
and competition for capital. The TSR 
comparators for the awards made in the 
financial year ending 30 June 2018 are 
listed on page 100.
The Committee retains discretion to 
change or supplement EPS, TSR and 
net debt : EBITDA as performance 
measures with alternative or additional 
performance measures to ensure that the 
awards are always linked to sustained 
business performance. No measure will 
carry a weighting of less than 25%.
Actual performance measures and 
weightings will be disclosed in the Annual 
Report immediately following the granting  
of an award.
Introduction of a two-year post-vesting 
holding period to encourage long-term 
performance and a culture of long-term 
stewardship and further align the 
Executive Directors’ interests with 
those of shareholders. 
Dividend equivalents introduced to 
align with market practice. 
The Committee’s ability to waive 
performance conditions has been 
removed, in line with market practice.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
  Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 89 Payments from outstanding awards
The Company will honour any commitment entered into, and the 
Executive Directors will be eligible to receive payment from any 
award or arrangement made, (i) before this policy came into effect, 
provided that the terms of the commitment or payment are 
consistent with the 2014 policy or preceded that policy, or (ii) at a 
time when the relevant individual was not a Director and, in the 
opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration 
for the individual becoming a Director. For these purposes, 
‘payment’ includes the satisfaction of awards of variable 
remuneration and, in relation to awards of shares, upon the terms 
which were agreed when the award was granted. 
Notes to the future policy table
Malus and clawback
Allocations of shares in part satisfaction of annual bonus 
payments and unvested LTIP awards will be subject to a ‘malus’ 
provision during the deferral period and the period prior to 
vesting, respectively.
This allows the Committee to determine, in its absolute discretion, 
that (i) the level of an unvested LTIP award (or part of an award) is 
reduced (including to nil) and/or (ii) the number of deferred shares 
is reduced (including to nil) in certain circumstances. Examples of 
such circumstances include, but are not limited to:
 › a material misstatement of the Group’s financial statements;
 › a material error in determining the level of satisfaction of a 
performance condition or target;
 › a participant deliberately misleading the Company, the market 
and/or shareholders in relation to the financial performance of 
the Group; and
 › a participant’s employment being terminated in circumstances 
of gross misconduct and/or circumstances justifying 
summary dismissal.
The Committee has the right to apply the malus provision to an 
individual or on a collective basis.
Clawback will be introduced for (i) the cash element of the annual 
bonus from 2018 (and may be applied up to three years following 
payment of the bonus) and (ii) the two-year post-vesting holding 
period which will apply to LTIP awards granted in 2017 and future 
years. The Committee expects that the circumstances in which 
clawback will apply will be the same (or substantially the same) as 
for malus. The clawback may be effected by a reduction in: the 
number of deferred bonus shares previously allocated, the number 
of vested or unvested LTIP awards or salary or by repayment from 
an individual’s own funds or by any combination of these. 
Executive Director shareholding guidelines
The Committee encourages Executive Directors to accumulate a 
shareholding in the Company of at least two years’ base salary 
over a period of up to five years. Executive Directors are 
encouraged to retain any shares allocated to them as part of the 
annual bonus arrangements and 50% of the shares allocated to 
them upon the vesting of LTIP awards (net of tax) until they reach 
this level of shareholding.
Selection of performance measures and approach to setting 
targets 
The measures used for the annual bonus are determined annually 
to reflect KPIs which are considered important and relevant to the 
Group. The Committee believes that using a number of measures 
provides a balanced incentive. The measures themselves are 
aligned to, and are designed to support the delivery of, the 
Group’s strategy.
In relation to the LTIP awards, the Committee believes that the 
combination of EPS, TSR and net debt : EBITDA clearly aligns 
performance to shareholders’ interests and the Group’s long-term 
strategy. EPS is a key measure of long-term underlying 
performance of the Group. TSR is intended to measure 
management’s contribution to the creation of value for 
shareholders relative to a bespoke peer group which reflects the 
Group’s mix of business. Cash (and, therefore, net debt) is an 
important financial measure in the contracting sector and 
supports the delivery of the Group’s strategy. In future years, the 
Committee may decide to select other performance measures.
Targets for the annual bonus and the LTIP awards are reviewed 
before the awards are made, based on a number of internal and 
external reference points. The Committee intends that targets will 
be stretching but achievable and will align management’s interests 
with those of shareholders.
Approach to setting the remuneration of other employees 
Kier’s approach to setting annual remuneration is broadly 
consistent across the Group. Consideration is given to the 
experience, performance and responsibilities of individuals as well 
as to publicly available external benchmarking data, to the extent 
considered necessary or appropriate. Certain grades of senior 
employees are eligible to participate in an annual bonus scheme 
with similar performance measures to those used for the 
Executive Directors. Maximum opportunities and specific 
performance measures vary by seniority, with business-specific 
measures applied where appropriate. Senior managers (currently, 
approximately 350 individuals) are also eligible to participate in a 
long-term share incentive plan under which awards will normally 
vest after three years, subject to continued employment. Award 
sizes vary according to seniority and responsibility.
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Directors’ remuneration policy continued
90 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 Illustration of application of remuneration policy
The charts below set out the minimum (i.e. ‘fixed’) remuneration receivable by each Executive Director as at the date of this Annual 
Report, as well as the potential remuneration for ‘on-target’ and ‘maximum’ performance, as a result of the application of the 
remuneration policy set out above in the year ending 30 June 2018.
‘Fixed’ remuneration comprises base salary, taxable benefits and pension contribution/cash allowance. The ‘on-target’ 
remuneration assumes an annual bonus payment of 65% of the maximum opportunity and a ‘threshold’ LTIP vesting (25% of the 
maximum opportunity). The ‘maximum’ remuneration assumes maximum performance is achieved and therefore awards under the 
annual bonus pay out at their maximum levels of 125% (Chief Executive) and 115% (other Executive Directors) of salary, respectively, 
and LTIP awards vest at their maximum level. No share price appreciation is assumed for LTIP awards. 
Approach to remuneration on recruitment
External appointment
When recruiting a new Executive Director from outside the Group, the Committee may make use of all the existing components of 
remuneration. In addition, the Committee may consider it appropriate to grant an award under an alternative scheme or arrangement in 
order to facilitate recruitment of an individual, subject to the policy set out below:

Component Approach
Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined by reference to relevant market data, the experience and 
skills of the individual, internal relativities and the appointee’s current base salary. Where a new appointee has 
an initial base salary set below the market median, any subsequent adjustment will be managed by the 
Committee, using (where appropriate) phased increases and subject to the individual’s development in the role.
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits in line with the remuneration policy, which may also include 
(but are not limited to) any necessary expenses relating to expatriation or relocation on recruitment.
SAYE 
schemes
New appointees will be eligible to participate on the same terms as all other employees. 
SIP New appointees will be eligible to participate on the same terms as all other employees.
Pension New appointees will receive pension contributions of up to 20% of pensionable salary into a defined contribution 
pension arrangement or an equivalent taxable cash supplement or a combination of both.
Annual bonus The annual bonus structure described in the remuneration policy will apply to new appointees (including the 
maximum opportunity), pro rated in the year of joining to reflect the proportion of that year employed. One-third of 
any bonus earned will be deferred into shares.
LTIP New appointees may be granted awards under the LTIP of up to 200% of salary.
‘Buy-out’  
awards
The Committee may consider it appropriate to grant a ‘buy-out’ award (with respect to either a bonus or a 
share-based incentive scheme) under an alternative scheme or arrangement in order to facilitate recruitment. 
When doing so, the Committee may, to the extent required, exercise the discretion available under Listing Rule 
9.4.2. Any such ‘buy-out’ award would have a fair value no higher than that of the award forfeited. In granting any 
such award, the Committee will consider relevant factors, including any performance conditions attached to the 
forfeited awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining.
When considering any performance conditions, the Committee will, where appropriate, take into account those used in the Company’s 
own incentive arrangements. Where appropriate, the Committee will also consider whether it is necessary to introduce further retention 
measures for an individual – for example, extended deferral periods.
In determining an appropriate remuneration package, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to ensure that the 
arrangements are in the best interests of the Company’s shareholders.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
  Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 91 Internal promotion
When recruiting a new Executive Director through internal promotion, the Committee will set remuneration in a manner consistent with 
the policy for external appointments set out above (other than with respect to ‘buy-out’ awards). Where an individual has contractual 
commitments made prior to their promotion to Executive Director level, the Company will continue to honour these commitments.
The remuneration of individuals below the Board is typically not greater than for Executive Directors.
Service contracts
A summary of the key elements of the Executive Directors’ service agreements (insofar as they relate to remuneration) is as follows:
Term of contract Summary of provisions
Notice period 12 months’ notice (both to and from the Executive Director).
Payment in 
lieu of notice 
(PILON)
Employment can be terminated with immediate effect by undertaking to make a PILON comprising base salary, accrued 
(but untaken) holiday entitlement, pension contributions or allowance, car allowance and private medical insurance.
The Company is entitled to make the PILON on a phased basis, so that any outstanding payment(s) would be reduced 
or stopped if alternative employment is obtained.
Change of 
control
There are no payments due upon a change of control, although deferred bonus shares would be released.
Other 
entitlements 
on termination
There is no contractual entitlement to notice, or any other payments in respect of the period after cessation of 
employment, if the individual is summarily dismissed. If not required to take any remaining holiday entitlement during 
his/her notice period, the Executive Director will receive a payment for any accrued (but untaken) holiday entitlement.
Please see ‘Payments for loss of office’ below for a summary of other entitlements which may be due upon termination 
(and which relate to remuneration).
Payments for loss of office
The Company’s policy on payments for loss of office is as follows:
Component Approach
Annual  
bonus
Individuals who are considered to be ‘good leavers’ may be considered for a bonus in relation to the year in which their 
active employment ceases. Any payment will normally be pro rated for length of service and performance during the 
year. However, the Committee retains the discretion to review the performance of the individual and the Group in general 
and, having done so, determine that a different level of bonus payment would be appropriate. Clawback will continue to 
apply to the cash element of any annual bonus payment from 2018 (until the end of the three-year clawback period).
Deferred shares allocated in part satisfaction of annual bonuses may be released upon cessation of employment if an 
individual is a ‘good leaver’. Otherwise, they will be released at the end of the three-year holding period (unless they are 
forfeited in the case of gross misconduct and/or circumstances justifying summary dismissal).
LTIP If an Executive Director’ s employment ceases for reasons of death, ill-health, injury, disability, retirement with the agreement of 
the Company or his/her employing company ceasing to be a member of the Group or such other circumstances approved by 
the Committee, outstanding awards are retained. The Committee may also (at its discretion) permit unvested LTIP awards to 
vest on an accelerated basis or alternatively be retained until the vesting date. Unvested LTIP awards will, subject to 
Committee discretion, normally be pro rated for length of service during the performance period and will, subject to 
performance, normally vest at the same time as all other awards in the LTIP award cycle. Vested shares relating to awards 
made from 2017 will be subject to the two-year post-vesting holding period, irrespective of the date on which they vest.
For all other leavers, outstanding LTIP awards automatically lapse, unless the Committee exercises its discretion otherwise 
(taking into account the factors detailed immediately following this table).
SIP and SAYE 
schemes
The Executive Directors are subject to the same ‘leaver’ provisions as all other participants, as prescribed by the rules 
of the relevant scheme or plan.
Other If the Company terminates an Executive Director’ s employment by reason of redundancy, the Company will make a redundancy 
payment to the Executive Director in line with his/her service agreement, any applicable collective bargaining agreement and 
applicable law and regulation.
The Company may make a contribution towards an Executive Director’ s legal fees for advice relating to a compromise or 
settlement agreement and may also make other payments connected to the departure – for example, for outplacement services. 
With respect to any such payments, the Committee will authorise what it considers to be reasonable in the circumstances.
Change of 
control
Deferred bonus shares will be released and any outstanding LTIP awards may vest early (subject to the Committee’s 
discretion, having taken into account current and forecast progress against the performance condition(s), the proportion 
of the vesting period which has elapsed and any other factors considered by the Committee to be relevant) and the 
holding period for vested LTIP awards will cease. Clawback will no longer apply to any vested LTIP awards or prior 
payments of cash bonuses. The rules of the SIP and the SAYE schemes will apply. No payments are due under the 
Executive Directors’ service agreements upon a change of control.
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Directors’ remuneration policy continued
92 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 Where appropriate, the Committee will oblige the individual to mitigate his/her losses and either offset any alternative remuneration 
received by the individual against any payments made by the Company for loss of office or reduce any payments to be made by the 
Company for loss of office to take account of any failure to mitigate when, in the reasonable opinion of the Committee, the individual 
has failed actively to do so.
In exercising discretion in respect of any of the elements referred to above, the Committee will take into account all factors which it 
considers to be appropriate at the relevant time. These include, but are not limited to: the duration of the Executive Director’s service; 
the Committee’s assessment of the Executive Director’s contribution to the success of the Group; whether the Executive Director has 
worked any notice period or whether a PILON is being made; the need to ensure an orderly handover of duties; and the need to 
compromise any claims which the Executive Director may have. Any use of Committee discretion will be disclosed in the relevant annual 
report on remuneration.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
Employees are not formally consulted on the Executive Directors’ remuneration and were not consulted during the preparation of the 
remuneration policy set out above. However, the Group’s employee engagement survey provides an opportunity for employees to provide 
their opinion on their own remuneration arrangements.
The Committee takes into account the overall pay and employment conditions of employees within the Group when making decisions on 
the Executive Directors’ remuneration. In addition, the Committee is provided with information about the proposed annual Group-wide 
pay review when setting the Executive Directors’ salaries and is made aware of the approximate outcomes of annual bonuses within the 
wider workforce.
Consideration of shareholders’ views
The views of shareholders, and guidance from shareholder representative bodies, are important to the Committee and provide the 
context for setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors. The Chair of the Committee consulted with a number of significant 
shareholders during the year and their views have been taken into account when preparing the remuneration policy.
The Committee will keep the remuneration policy under regular review so as to ensure that it continues to relate to the Company’s 
long-term strategy and aligns the interests of the Executive Directors with those of the shareholders. In addition, the Committee will 
continue to monitor trends and developments in corporate governance and market practice to ensure the structure of executive 
remuneration remains appropriate.
Non-Executive Director remuneration policy
General
The Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration (including that of the Chairman) reflects the anticipated time commitment to fulfil their 
duties. Non-Executive Directors do not receive bonuses, long-term incentive awards, a pension or compensation on termination of their 
appointments. The policy on Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is as follows:
Element and link to strategy Operation Opportunity Performance measures Change to 2014 policy
Fees
To attract and retain 
Non-Executive Directors 
of the calibre required 
and with appropriate 
skills and experience.
Fee levels are reviewed 
annually with reference 
to individual experience, 
the external market and 
the expected time 
commitment required of 
the Director.
Additional fees are 
payable to the Chairs of 
the Board’s committees 
and to the Senior 
Independent Director.
Fees may be increased in line with 
the outcome of the annual review 
and will not normally exceed the 
increase awarded to the wider 
employee population. Higher 
increases may be awarded should 
there be a material change to the 
requirements of the role, such as 
additional time commitment.
Any changes to fees will be 
disclosed in the annual report on 
remuneration for the relevant year.
Continued strong 
performance.
None.
Benefits
To reimburse Non-Executive 
Directors for expenses.
Reasonable and necessary 
expenses are reimbursed, 
together with any tax due 
on them.
Expenses (including, without 
limitation, travel and subsistence) 
incurred in connection with Kier 
business.
Not applicable. Included for 
clarification 
purposes.
Recruiting Non-Executive Directors
When recruiting a new Non-Executive Director, the Committee will follow the policy set out in the table above.
Non-Executive Director letters of appointment
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but have entered into letters of appointment with the Company. The letters of 
appointment do not include any provisions for the payment of pre-determined compensation upon termination of appointment.

The target relates to a reduction in the Group’s average UK AAIR from 1 January to 30 June 2017, as compared with the equivalent period in 2016, with the 
maximum opportunity requiring a 20% reduction. There was a 16% reduction, resulting in an 8% payment. The Committee decided to reduce the amount payable to 
Bev Dew due to the required number of visible leaderships tours during June to September 2016 not having been undertaken.
One-third of the bonus awarded will be satisfied by an allocation of shares (deferred for three years), which will be subject to ‘malus’.

For the LTIP awards, ‘face value’ is calculated using the market price of a share in the capital of the Company on 20 October 2016 of £13.68. For the deferred 
share awards, ‘face value’ is calculated using the market price of a share in the capital of the Company on 28 September 2016 of £13.55. For the SIP , ‘face value’ 
is calculated using the total number of shares bought on behalf of the relevant individuals during the 2017 financial year and an average share price for matching 
share purchases during the year of £13.08.
The performance conditions (and respective weightings) and targets for the LTIP awards which were granted during the 2017 financial

96 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 Payments to past Directors
Steve Bowcott’s employment with the Group ceased on 30 April 2015. The Committee agreed that the LTIP award granted to Steve in 
October 2014 would be permitted to vest, subject to the satisfaction of its performance conditions and time pro rating up to 30 April  
2015. Steve will therefore receive 4,166 shares (before deductions for income tax and national insurance contributions). Based on 
the Company’s average share price for the three-month period ended 30 June 2017 of £12.73, the value of such shares is £53,033. 
No other payments were made to Steve Bowcott or any other past Directors during the 2017 financial year.
Directors’ shareholdings and share interests
The Committee encourages the Executive Directors to build up a shareholding in the Company of at least two years’ base salary, to be 
accumulated over a period of up to five years. Executive Directors are therefore encouraged to retain any shares allocated to them as 
part of the annual bonus arrangements and upon the vesting of LTIP awards until this shareholding has been reached. The following 
table sets out details, as at 30 June 2017, of the shareholdings and share interests of those persons (together with, where relevant, 
the shareholdings and share interests of their connected persons) who, during the 2017 financial year, served as a Director:

Under the SIP , any amount saved by a participant will be applied by the trustee of the SIP to make monthly purchases of shares on his/
her behalf – ‘partnership shares’. The Company matches purchases through the SIP (currently at the rate of one free share for every 
two shares purchased – ‘matching shares’) and the trustee reinvests cash dividends to acquire further shares on behalf of the 
participants – ‘dividend shares’.
Matching shares which have been purchased within three years of the termination of an individual’s employment may, depending on the 
circumstances of such termination, be forfeited.
‘Unrestricted shares’ are partnership, dividend and matching shares which were purchased more than five years from the relevant date 
and can be withdrawn from the SIP trust by the participants without incurring income tax or national insurance liability.
Details of the number of matching shares purchased during the year are set out in the table in the paragraph headed ‘Incentive awards 
made during the 2017 financial year’ on page 96.
At 20 September 2017, the Company had been notified that the following Directors had acquired beneficial interests in further ordinary 
shares in the capital of the Company under the SIP since 30 June 2017: Nigel Brook – 38 shares, Bev Dew – 37 shares, Haydn Mursell 
– 32 shares, Nigel Turner – 36 shares and Claudio Veritiero – 36 shares. There have been no other changes in the interests of the 
Directors (or their connected persons) in the ordinary shares in the capital of the Company since 30 June 2017.

Percentage change in the Chief Executive’s remuneration
The table below shows the percentage changes in base salary, taxable benefits and annual bonus of the Chief Executive in the 2017 
financial year, as compared to the 2016 financial year, together with the approximate comparative average figures for those employees 
who were eligible for salary reviews on 1 July of each year and who were not subject to collective agreements. This section of the 
employee population (comprising approximately 7,600 individuals across a number of levels) is considered to be the most appropriate 
group for comparison purposes, as their remuneration is controlled by the Group and is subject to similar external market forces as 
those which relate to the Chief Executive’s remuneration. Approximately 800 employees are eligible to receive a bonus.

The Remuneration Committee 
Membership and meeting attendance 
The names of the members of the Committee are set out on page 82, together with an indication of the Committee’s principal 
activities during the 2017 financial year. The Chief Executive and the Group HR Director (Chris Last) are invited to attend Committee 
meetings. No individuals are involved in decisions relating to their own remuneration. The Committee met formally eight times during the 
year. The secretary of the Committee is the Company Secretary (Hugh Raven). The Committee’s terms of reference can be viewed on the 
Company’s website at www.kier.co.uk/corporategovernance.
Principal activities – 2017 financial year
The annual statement of the Chair of the Remuneration Committee on pages 82 and 83 provides a summary of the Committee’s 
principal activities during the year.
Committee performance evaluation
2017 – progress against 2016 evaluation
The 2016 Board evaluation identified:
 › ensuring that the Committee is provided with high quality information at all times; and
 › tendering the role of remuneration consultants to the Committee
as being the two key areas of focus for the Committee in the 2017 financial year.
The 2017 Board evaluation process confirmed that good progress had been made with respect to the information provided to the 
Committee. Following a formal tender process, Mercer was re-appointed as remuneration consultants.
2018 – principal areas of focus
The 2017 Board evaluation identified the need for the Committee to continue to engage with all stakeholders, principally shareholders and 
the Executive Directors, to understand their views and ensure a balanced application of the new remuneration policy.
Advisers
Mercer also provides advice in respect of the Mouchel Superannuation Fund. However, the Committee is satisfied that Mercer, in 
providing remuneration advice to the Committee, did not have any connection with the Company that impaired its independence. Total 
fees of £117,780 (excluding VAT) were payable in respect of Mercer’s services as remuneration advisers during the 2017 financial year. 
Mercer is a signatory to the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants which has been developed by the Remuneration 
Consultants Group. The Committee also receives support and advice from the Company Secretary and the Group HR Director.

  Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 103 Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
Introduction 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. Company law 
requires the Directors to prepare the Group and parent company 
financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, 
they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (IFRS) and applicable law and have 
elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in 
accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law 
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). Under company law, 
the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and parent company and of their profit or loss 
for that period. In preparing each of the Group and parent company 
financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
 › select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
 › make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
 › for the Group financial statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRS;
 › for the parent company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the parent company financial statements; and 
 › prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the parent company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006 and, with respect to the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
The Directors have general responsibility for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Directors’ 
Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Corporate 
Governance Statement and for ensuring that these comply with 
applicable laws and regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions. 
Directors’ responsibility statement 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are set  
out on pages 66 and 67, confirms that to the best of his or  
her knowledge: 
 › the financial statements contained in this Annual Report, 
prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting 
standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation as a whole; and 
 › the management report contained in this Annual Report 
includes a fair review of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face. 
Disclosure to auditors 
Each Director who holds office at the date of approval of this 
Directors’ Report confirms that, so far as each such Director is 
aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the auditor 
is unaware; and the Directors have taken all the steps that they 
ought to have taken as directors to make themselves aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor is 
aware of that information.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Kier Group plc

Report on the audit of the financial statements 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
› Kier Group plc’s Group financial statements and Company 
financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true 
and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s 
affairs as at 30 June 2017 and of the Group’s profit and cash 
flows for the year then ended; 
› the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
› the Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework”, and applicable law); and 
› the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. 
We have audited the financial statements, included within 
the Annual Report and Accounts (the “Annual Report”), which 
comprise: the Consolidated income statement and statement of 
comprehensive income, the Consolidated and Company statements 
of changes in equity, the Consolidated and Company balance sheets 
as at 30 June 2017, and the Consolidated cash flow statements, 
for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, 
which include a description of the significant accounting policies. 
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Risk Management 
and Audit Committee. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the 
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. 
Independence 
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the Financial Reporting 
Council’s (“FRC”) Ethical Standard as applicable to listed public 
interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. 
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit 
services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided 
to the Group or the Company. 
Other than those disclosed in the Corporate Governance Statement 
in page 78, we have provided no non-audit services to the Group or 
the Company in the period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017. 
 
Our audit approach 
Overview  
 
› £6.3m (2016: £6.2m) – Group financial statements 
› Based on 5% of consolidated profit before tax from continuing operations excluding non-underlying items. 
› £4.9m (2016: £5.0m) – Company financial statements 
› Based on the lower of component and statutory materiality based on 2% of total assets. 
› We conducted audit work across all five of the Group’s divisions, which accounted for 95% of  
Group revenues. 
› Valuation of land and properties (Group). 
› Accounting for long-term contracts – including profit recognition, work in progress and provisioning (Group). 
› Accounting for adjustments to underlying profit (Group). 
 
The scope of our audit 
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial stat ements. In 
particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judg ements, for example in respect of significant accounting estim ates that 
involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addres sed the risk 
of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that repr esented a risk 
of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of th e financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due t o fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of res ources in the audit; 
and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures ther eon, 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we d o not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Valuation of land and properties 
Refer to page 76 (Risk Management and Audit Committee Report), 
page 121 (accounting policy) and page 140 (notes). 
Inventory in the Residential and Property divisions is stated at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value (i.e. the forecast selling price 
less the remaining costs to build and sell). An assessment of the 
net realisable value of inventory is carried out at each balance sheet 
date and is dependent upon management’s estimate of forecast 
selling prices and build costs (by reference to current prices), which 
may require significant judgement. 
The Group holds inventory of £593.9m (2016: £675.9m). The 
Residential division comprises the Group’s land held for residential 
development of £39.0m (2016: £137.3m) and residential work  
in progress of £132.7m (2016: £114.6m) where building work  
has commenced. 
In particular, we focused our work on those sites with a value of 
£46.7m (2016: £47.1m) where there is no immediate intention 
of development as there is a heightened risk that they are valued 
above their recoverable amount. Therefore a change in the Group’s 
forecast estimate of sales price and build cost could have a 
material impact on the carrying value of inventories in the Group’s 
financial statements. 
The Property division comprises the Group’s land held for 
commercial development of £3.2m (2016: £3.1m) and mixed use 
commercial and residential development work in progress of £55.0m 
(2016: £34.2m) where building has commenced. 
In particular, we focused our work on testing the recoverable amount 
of work in progress in commercial and residential developments as 
this could have a material impact on the carrying value of inventories 
held in the Group’s financial statements. 
 
We reviewed the property-specific development appraisals supporting 
the carrying values and challenged the key assumptions underlying 
these appraisals as follows: 
Residential 
› We reviewed management’s expected build cost per square 
foot by comparing to the build costs for similar units on other 
sites and where there were differences, validating explanations 
against third-party confirmations including quantity surveyor 
cost estimates, correspondence with suppliers or comparable 
properties on other sites; 
› We challenged management on their intention to develop 
these sites; and 
› We challenged management’s forecast sales prices to 
supporting third-party evidence from management’s external 
sales agents and by comparing the forecast sales price of  
a sample of sales prices achieved and the list prices of 
comparable assets as published by estate agents. 
Property 
› We reconciled the development appraisals to the  
WIP summary; 
› We interviewed the Development Manager responsible for each 
site to understand the status of the development and 
challenged the key judgements and inputs; 
› We obtained, where applicable, third party independent 
comparable evidence to support the rental and yield rates 
adopted in the appraisal and ensured that they were prepared 
by suitably qualified professionals; 
› We obtained (where applicable) 3rd Party independent 
construction quotes from tender documents, surveyor reports 
or similar and ensured that they were prepared by suitably 
qualified professionals; 
› We obtained confirmation from external sources for any other 
applicable items to the appraisal and; 
› We obtained confirmation over legal title and Planning Consent 
of each development. 
We did not encounter any issues through our audit procedures that 
indicated the land or properties tested were impaired.

Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Accounting for long-term contracts – including profit 
recognition, work in progress and provisioning 
Refer to page 76 (Risk Management and Audit Committee Report) 
and page 118 (accounting policy). 
The Group has significant long-term contracts in both the 
Construction and Services divisions.  
The recognition of profit on construction in accordance with IAS 11 
is based on the stage of completion of contract activity. This is 
assessed by reference to the proportion of contract costs incurred 
for the work performed at the balance sheet date relative to the 
estimated total costs of the contract at completion. 
Recoverability of work in progress on long-term services contracts 
involves significant estimates including an assessment of the end 
of life outcome of the projects.  
Profit on contracts is a significant risk for our audit because of the 
judgement involved in preparing suitable estimates of the forecast 
costs and revenue on contracts. An error in the contract forecast 
could result in a material variance in the amount of profit or loss 
recognised to date and therefore also in the current period. 
These judgements include the expected recovery of costs arising 
from the following: variations to the contract requested by the 
customer, compensation events, and claims made both by and 
against the Group for delays or other additional costs arising or 
projected to arise. The inclusion of these estimated amounts in the 
contract forecast at an inappropriate level could result in a material 
error in the level of profit or loss recognised by the Group. 
 
We focused our work on those contracts with the greatest estimation 
uncertainty over the final contract values and therefore profit 
outcome. These in particular included the forecast end of life 
positions on a number of infrastructure projects which have 
experienced significant change and therefore cost growth. 
We challenged the judgements applied in management’s forecasts, 
in particular the key assumptions, which included the expected 
recovery of variations, claims and compensation events from clients, 
and estimated recoveries from subcontractors, designers, and 
insurers included in the forecast. 
We inspected correspondence and meeting minutes with customers 
concerning variations, claims and compensation events, and 
obtained third-party assessments of these from legal or technical 
experts contracted by the Group, if applicable, to assess whether 
this information was consistent with the estimates made. 
We inspected selected signed contracts for key clauses to 
identify relevant contractual mechanisms such as the sharing of cost 
overruns or efficiencies with the customer, contractual damages and 
success fees and assessed whether these key clauses have been 
appropriately reflected in the amounts included in the forecasts. 
We inspected correspondence with insurers relating to recognised 
insurance claims as well as assessments of these undertaken 
by the insurers and Group’s legal experts where applicable to 
assess whether this information supported the position taken 
on the contract. 
In respect of long-term Environmental Services contracts we 
challenged the assumptions in the cash flow models surrounding 
efficiency improvements in the cost base and projected revenues 
from the sale of recyclate. 
Overall based on these procedures, we are satisfied that the work in 
progress relating to the Group’s contracts is appropriately stated and 
that revenue and profits have been recorded appropriately.

Accounting for adjustments to underlying profit 
Refer to page 76 (Risk Management and Audit Committee Report), 
page 118 (accounting policy) and page 125 (notes). 
In order to give a better understanding of the underlying performance 
of the business, management has presented a view of the 
underlying results of the Group, with separate disclosure of  
‘non-underlying items’ consisting of the following: 
› £26.3m of costs and charges associated with the closure of 
Hong Kong operations and associated contract losses; 
› £2.2m of charges in relation to the establishment of Cross 
Keys Homes joint venture; 
› A £40.0m gain relating to the disposal of Mouchel Consulting;
› £60.4m of costs associated with the closure of the Caribbean 
business and associated contract losses; 
› £8.0m of charges in relation to provisions for HSE fines arising 
from revised sentencing guidelines; 
› £11.1m of charges in relation to under-performing contracts  
in Environmental Services; 
› A £7.6m loss relating to the disposal of the investment  
in Biogen; 
› £5.5m of charges including £1.4m loss arising on disposal  
of Saudi Mining business and £4.1m of professional costs 
relating to M&A activity incurred during the year; and 
› £25.2m of intangible amortisation, discount unwind 
on acquired businesses and mining interest payable 
on borrowings. 
The determination of which items are classified as ‘non-underlying’ 
is subject to judgement and therefore users of the accounts 
could be misled if amounts are not classified appropriately 
or presented consistently. 
We also considered the risk of one-off gains during the year not 
being properly identified and therefore presented inappropriately 
within underlying profit.  
We considered the appropriateness of the adjustments made to the 
statutory result before tax to derive underlying performance. In order 
to do this we considered: 
› The Group’s accounting policy on exceptional and  
non-underlying items; 
› The application of IFRS, in particular IAS 1; and European 
Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) guidelines on 
alternative performance measures issued on 3 July 2016. 
We challenged management on the appropriateness of the 
classification of each item, being mindful that classification should 
be balanced between gains and losses, the basis for the 
classification clearly disclosed and applied consistently from one 
year to the next. 
Our work identified certain items that management had classified as 
non-underlying which we considered to be more judgemental in 
nature than others. These included the Caribbean and Hong Kong 
exit costs of £60.4m and £26.3m respectively. In each case these 
included a material project loss in addition to closure costs. Having 
assessed in detail the nature of the individual components of the 
exit costs, we were satisfied with their presentation as non-
underlying and the explanations provided in the financial statements 
as to their nature. 
We assessed the nature of material non-recurring gains during the 
year impacting the underlying result before tax and challenged 
management as to whether these should be identified within non-
underlying items. 
Having considered the nature and quantum of these items, overall 
we were satisfied that the presentation of non-underlying and 
exceptional items in the financial statements for the year ended  
30 June 2017 is materially appropriate.

How we tailored the audit scope 
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial state ments as a 
whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which 
they operate. 
The Group’s operations and reporting process is structured around five divisions represented by Property, Residential, Construc tion, 
Services, and Corporate. All five reporting divisions are cons idered financially significant and were in scope for the Group au dit. 
The vast majority of the Group’s operations are concentrated in the UK and account for 93% of the Group revenue, with the remai ning 7% 
generated from overseas businesses. Our audit approach was designed to obtain coverage over 95% of the Group’s revenue which in cluded 
UK and overseas operations. We are satisfied that we obtained appropriate audit coverage over the Group’s Income statement, Bal ance 
sheet and cash flows through our audit work on the UK and overseas operations. 
During the course of the audit, we have visited a number of projects and operations located across the UK. We have also visited the Group’s 
operations in Dubai and held meetings with local management and our local component audit team.  
Materiality 
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materi ality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit p rocedures on 
the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in 
aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.  
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: 
 
Group financial statements Company financial statements 
Overall materiality £6.3m (2016: £6.2m). £4.9m (2016: £5.0m). 
How we determined it 5% of consolidated profit before tax from continuing 
operations and excluding non-underlying items. 
Approximately 1% of total assets, limited by the 
allocation of component materiality. 
Rationale for  
benchmark applied 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality by applying a benchmark of 5% of 
consolidated profit before tax excluding non-underlying 
items. We believe that underlying profit before tax is  
the most appropriate measure as it eliminates any 
disproportionate effect of exceptional charges and 
provides a consistent year-on-year basis for our work. 
We believe that calculating statutory materiality based 
on 1% of total assets is appropriate as total assets is 
a typical primary measure for users of the financial 
statements of holding companies, and is a generally 
accepted auditing benchmark. 
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range  
of materiality allocated across components was between £1.9m and £5.5m. Certain components were audited to a local statutory au dit 
materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality. 
We agreed with the Risk Management and Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit a bove 
£0.3m (Group audit) (2016: £0.3m) and £0.3m (Company audit) (2016: £0.3m) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in  
our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. 
Going concern 
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows: 
Reporting obligation Outcome 
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to in 
respect of the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the 
directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements and the directors’ identification of any material 
uncertainties to the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern 
over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements. 
We have nothing material to add or to draw 
attention to. However, because not all future events 
or conditions can be predicted, this statement is 
not a guarantee as to the Group’s and Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. 
We are required to report if the directors’ statement relating to Going Concern in 
accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit. 
We have nothing to report.

Reporting on other information  
The other information comprises all of the information in the A nnual Report and Accounts other than the financial statements an d our 
auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any 
form of assurance thereon.  
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or other wise appears to 
be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures 
to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other inform ation. If, 
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information; we are requir ed to 
report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities. 
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Compa nies Act 
2006 have been included.  
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the au dit, the Companies Act 2006, (CA06), ISAs 
(UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as d escribed below 
(required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated). 
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Dire ctors’ Report 
for the year ended 30 June 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements. (CA06) 
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not 
identify any material misstatements in the Stra tegic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06) 
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the 
solvency or liquidity of the group 
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding: 
› The directors’ confirmation on page 62 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. 
› The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated. 
› The directors’ explanation on page 62 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. 
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantia lly less in scope 
than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checki ng that the 
statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”); and considering whet her the 
statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the c ourse 
of the audit. (Listing Rules) 
Other Code Provisions 
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when:  
› The statement given by the directors, on page 62, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and Company obtained in 
the course of performing our audit. 
› The section of the Annual Report on page 73 describing the work of the Risk Management and Audit Committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Risk Management and Audit Committee. 
› The directors’ statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from  
a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.

Directors’ Remuneration 
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report  
to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. (CA06) 
Responsibilities for the financial statements  
and the audit 
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 104, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with 
the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal 
control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation  
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible 
for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to 
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of  
the financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue 
an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.  
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of  
the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms  
part of our auditors’ report. 
Use of this report 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We 
do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
Other required reporting 
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion: 
› we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit; or 
› adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
› certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or 
› the Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns.  
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.  
Appointment 
Following the recommendation of the Risk Management and Audit 
Committee, we were appointed by the members on 13 November 
2014 to audit the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 
2015 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total 
uninterrupted engagement is three years, covering the years ended  
30 June 2015 to 30 June 2017.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2017 
  Kier Group plc | www.kier.co.uk 117 
1 Significant accounting policies 
Kier Group plc (the Company) is a public limited company domiciled 
in the United Kingdom (UK), incorporated in England and Wales and 
listed on the London Stock Exchange. The Company’s registered 
number is 2708030. The consolidated financial statements of the 
Company for the year ended 30 June 2017 comprise the Company 
and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) and the 
Group’s interest in joint arrangements. 
The consolidated financial statements were approved by the 
directors on 20 September 2017. 
Statement of compliance 
The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
and approved by the directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
(IFRS) and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation 
and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 that are applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS. The Group has applied all 
accounting standards issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (‘IASB’) and interpretations issued by the IFRS 
Interpretations Committee as adopted by the European Union and 
effective for accounting periods beginning on 1 July 2016. 
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial 
statements in accordance with the FRS101 ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’. These are presented on pages 160 to 165. 
Basis of preparation 
The Group has considerable financial resources, long-term contracts 
and a diverse range of customers and suppliers across its  
business activities. 
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, the directors continue to adopt the going concern  
basis in preparing the Group’s financial statements. 
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. They 
have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative 
financial instruments which are stated at their fair value. 
The following amendments to standards are effective for the 
financial year ended 30 June 2017 onwards: 
› Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 
› Amendments to IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other 
Entities 
› Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Instruments 
› Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment 
› Amendments to IAS 38 Intangible Assets 
› Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014 
None of the above amendments to standards have had a material 
effect on the Group’s financial statements. 
The following new standards and amendments to standards have 
been issued but were not yet effective and therefore have not been 
applied in these financial statements:  
IFRS 2 (amendments) Share Based Payment 
IFRS 4 (amendments) Insurance Contracts 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers 
IFRS 16 Leases 
IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts 
IAS 7 (amendments) Statement of Cash Flows 
IAS 12 (amendments) Income Taxes 
 
IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transaction and 
Advanced Consideration 
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income  
Tax Treatments 
Annual Improvements 2014-2016 cycle 
The directors are considering the impact of these new standards 
and interpretations in future periods.  
IFRS 15 will replace IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction 
Contracts’. It will become effective for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2018. The Group is not currently contemplating 
early adoption and therefore IFRS 15 will be applied for the first time 
to the Group accounts for the year ended 30 June 2019. The Group 
is working closely with its advisors to assess the potential impacts 
of IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’, including 
consideration of transition method. 
The main impact of IFRS 16 will be to move the Group’s larger, 
longer term operating leases, primarily on property, onto the balance 
sheet with a consequential increase in non-current assets and 
finance lease obligations. Operating lease charges included in 
administrative expenses will be replaced by depreciation and 
interest costs. No decision has yet been made on the transition 
method or the timing of adoption of IFRS 16. 
Other than the impact of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 as noted above, no 
significant net impact from the adoption of these new standards is 
expected. The Group has chosen not to adopt any of the above 
standards and interpretations earlier than required. 
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently  
in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to  
the Group’s financial statements. 
Basis of consolidation 
(a) Subsidiaries 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial 
statements of the Company and subsidiaries controlled by the 
Company drawn up to 30 June 2017. Control exists when the Group 
has direct or indirect power to govern the financial and operating 
policies of an entity so as to obtain economic benefits from its 
activities. Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date that control transfers to the Group until 
the date that control ceases. 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition 
method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which 
control is transferred to the Group. Control is the power to govern 
the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities. In assessing control, the Group  
takes into consideration potential voting rights that currently 
are exercisable. 
If a business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date 
carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the 
acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any 
gains or losses arising from such re-measurements are recognised 
in profit or loss.

1 Significant accounting policies continued 
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures 
goodwill at the acquisition date as: 
› The fair value of the consideration transferred; plus  
› The recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree; plus 
› If the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair 
value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less 
› The net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
When the result is negative, a ‘bargain purchase’ gain is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.  
Provisional fair values allocated at a reporting date are finalised 
within 12 months of the acquisition date. 
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related  
to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are 
generally recognised in the income statement. Costs related to  
the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt 
or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a 
business combination are expensed as incurred. Any contingent 
consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition 
date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent 
consideration are recognised in the income statement unless  
the contingent consideration is classified as equity, in which  
case settlement is accounted for within reserves. 
Accounting policies of subsidiaries are adjusted where necessary  
to ensure consistency with those used by the Group. All intra-Group 
transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated  
on consolidation. 
(b) Joint arrangements 
A joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group 
undertakes an economic activity that is subject to joint control with 
third parties. 
The Group’s interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the 
equity method. Under this method the Group’s share of the profits 
less losses of joint ventures is included in the consolidated income 
statement and its interest in their net assets is included in 
investments in the consolidated balance sheet. Where the share  
of losses exceeds the Group’s interest in the entity and there is no 
obligation to fund these losses the carrying amount is reduced to 
nil, following which no further losses are recognised. Interest in the 
entity is the carrying amount of the investment together with any 
long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the net 
investment in the entity. 
From time to time the Group undertakes contracts jointly with other 
parties. These fall under the category of joint operations as defined 
by IFRS 11. In accordance with IFRS 11, the Group accounts for its 
own share of sales, profits, assets, liabilities and cash flows 
measured according to the terms of the agreements. 
Goodwill and other intangible assets 
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the 
consideration over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary. 
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment  
at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the 
income statement and is not subsequently reversed. Negative 
goodwill is recognised in the income statement immediately. On 
disposal of a subsidiary or jointly controlled entity, the attributable 
carrying amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the 
profit or loss on disposal.  
Other intangible assets which comprise contract rights and 
computer software are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and impairment losses. Amortisation is charged to administrative 
expenses in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
expected useful lives of the assets, which are principally as follows: 
Contract rights  Over the remaining contract life 
Computer software  3–7 years 
Internally generated intangible assets developed by the Group are 
recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: 
› An asset is created that can be identified; 
› It is probable that the asset created will generate future 
economic benefits; and 
› The development cost of the asset can be measured reliably. 
Other research expenditure is written off in the period in which it  
is incurred. 
Non-underlying items
1
 
Certain items are presented separately in the consolidated income 
statement as non-underlying items where, in the judgement of the 
directors, they need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their 
nature, size or incidence in order to obtain a clear and consistent 
presentation of the Group’s underlying business performance. 
Examples of material items which may give rise to disclosure as 
non-underlying items include gains or losses on the disposal of 
businesses, gains or losses on closure of businesses, costs of 
restructuring and reorganisation of existing businesses, certain 
material and one-off provisions, integration of newly acquired 
businesses, asset impairments and acquisition transaction costs 
and unwind of discounts.  
Amortisation of acquired intangible assets is also treated as a  
non-underlying item so that the underlying profit of the Group can  
be measured on a comparable basis from period to period.  
These are examples, and from time to time it may be appropriate  
to disclose further items as non-underlying in order to highlight the 
underlying performance of the Group. 
Underlying operating profit is one of the key measures used by the 
Board to monitor the Group’s performance. 
1
 Exceptional items. 
Revenue and profit recognition 
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts and after 
eliminating sales within the Group. It also includes the Group’s 
proportion of work carried out under jointly controlled operations. 
Revenue and profit are recognised as follows: 
(a) Construction contracts 
Revenue arises from increases in valuations on contracts and is 
normally determined by external valuations. It is the gross value of 
work carried out for the period to the balance sheet date (including 
retentions) but excludes claims until they are actually certified. 
Profit on contracts is calculated in accordance with accounting 
standards and industry practice. Industry practice is to assess the 
estimated final outcome of each contract and recognise the profit 
based upon the percentage of completion of the contract at the 
relevant date. The assessment of the final outcome of each contract 
is determined by regular review of the revenues and costs to 
complete that contract. Consistent contract review procedures are  
in place in respect of contract forecasting. 
  
118 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017  
  Kier Group plc | www.kier.co.uk 119 
The general principles for profit recognition are as follows: 
› Profits on short duration contracts are taken when the 
contract is complete; 
› Profits on other contracts are recognised on a percentage of 
completion basis when the contract’s outcome can be 
estimated reliably; 
› Provision is made for losses incurred or foreseen in bringing 
the contract to completion as soon as they become apparent; 
› Claims receivable are recognised as income when received or 
certified for payment, except that in preparing contract 
forecasts to completion, a prudent and reasonable evaluation 
of claims receivable may be included to mitigate foreseeable 
losses and only to the extent that there is reasonable 
certainty of recovery; and 
› Variations and compensation events are included in forecasts 
to completion when it is considered highly probable that they 
will be recovered. 
Percentage completion is normally calculated by taking certified 
value to date as a percentage of estimated final value, unless the 
internal value is materially different to the certified value, in which 
case the internal value is used. 
(b) Services 
Revenue and profit from services rendered, which include facilities 
management, highways maintenance, street cleaning and recycling, 
is recognised as and when the service is provided. 
Where revenue that has been recognised is subsequently 
determined not to be recoverable due to a dispute with the client, 
these amounts are charged against the revenue recognised. Where 
non-recovery is as a result of inability of a client to meet its 
obligations, these amounts are charged to administrative expenses. 
Unbilled revenue is the difference between the revenue recognised 
and the amounts actually invoiced to customers. Where invoicing 
exceeds the amount of revenue recognised these amounts are 
included in deferred income. 
(c) Private housing and land sales 
Revenue from housing sales is recognised at the fair value of  
the consideration received or receivable on legal completion, net  
of incentives. Revenue from land sales and land exchanges is 
recognised on the unconditional exchange of contracts. Profit is 
recognised on a site-by-site basis by reference to the expected out-
turn result from each site. The principal estimation technique used 
by the Group in attributing profit on sites to a particular period is  
the preparation of forecasts on a site-by-site basis. These focus  
on revenues and costs to complete and enable an assessment  
to be made of the final out-turn on each site. Consistent review 
procedures are in place in respect of site forecasting. Provision  
is made for any losses foreseen in completing a site as soon as 
they become apparent. 
(d) Property development 
Revenue in respect of property developments is taken on 
unconditional exchange of contracts on disposal of finished 
developments. Profit taken is subject to any amounts necessary  
to cover residual commitments relating to development 
performance. Provision is made for any losses foreseen in 
completing a development as soon as they become apparent. 
Where developments are sold in advance of construction being 
completed, revenue and profit are recognised from the point of  
sale and as the significant outstanding acts of construction and 
development are completed. If a development is sold in advance  
of the commencement of construction, no revenue or profit is 
recognised at the point of sale. Revenue and profit are recognised  
in line with the progress on construction, based on the percentage 
completion of the construction and development work. If a 
development is sold during construction but prior to completion, 
revenue and profit are recognised at the time of sale in line with the 
percentage completion of the construction and development works 
at the time of sale and thereafter in line with the percentage of 
completion of the construction and development works. 
(e) Private Finance Initiative (PFI) service concession agreements 
Revenue relating to construction or upgrade services under a service 
concession agreement is recognised based on the stage of 
completion of the work performed, consistent with the Group’s 
accounting policy on recognising revenue on construction contracts 
(see above). Operation or service revenue is recognised in the 
period in which the services were provided by the Group. When  
the Group provides more than one service in a service concession 
agreement, the consideration received is allocated by reference  
to the relative fair values of the services delivered. 
Pre-contract costs 
Costs associated with bidding for contracts are written off as 
incurred (pre-contract costs). When it is probable that a contract will 
be awarded, usually when the Group has secured preferred bidder 
status, costs incurred from that date to the date of financial close 
are carried forward in the balance sheet as other receivables. 
When financial close is achieved on PFI or Public Private Partnership 
(PPP) contracts, costs are recovered from the special purpose 
vehicle and pre-contract costs within this recovery that were not 
previously capitalised are credited to the income statement, except 
to the extent that the Group retains a share in the special purpose 
vehicle. The amount not credited is deferred and recognised over 
the life of the construction contract to which the costs relate. 
Property, plant and equipment and depreciation 
Depreciation is based on historical or deemed cost, including 
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the 
items, less the estimated residual value, and the estimated 
economic lives of the assets concerned. Freehold land is not 
depreciated. Other tangible assets are depreciated to residual 
values in equal annual instalments over the period of their 
estimated economic lives, which are principally as follows: 
Freehold land and 
buildings 
25–50 years 
Leasehold buildings and 
improvements 
Period of lease 
Plant and equipment 
(including vehicles) 
3–12 years 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter 
of the term of the lease or the expected useful life of the asset.

1 Significant accounting policies continued 
Leases 
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all of  
the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. 
On initial recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount 
equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the 
minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the 
asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy 
applicable to that asset. 
Other leases are operating leases, and the rental charges are 
charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over  
the life of each lease. 
Employee benefits 
(a) Retirement benefit obligations 
For defined contribution pension schemes operated by the 
Group, amounts payable are charged to the income statement 
as they fall due. 
The Group accounts for defined benefit obligations in accordance 
with IAS19. Obligations are measured at discounted present value 
while plan assets are measured at fair value. The operating and 
financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the 
income statement; current service costs are spread systematically 
over the lives of employees and financing costs are recognised in 
full in the period in which they arise. Re-measurements of the net 
defined pension liability, including actuarial gains and losses, are 
recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. 
The net finance cost is calculated by applying the discount rate  
to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair  
value of plan assets. This cost is included in finance costs in the 
income statement. 
Where the calculations result in a surplus to the Group, the 
recognised asset is limited to the present value of any available 
future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions  
to the plan. 
(b) Share-based payments 
Share-based payments granted but not vested are valued at the fair 
value of the shares at the date of grant. This affects the Sharesave 
and Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) schemes. The fair value of 
these schemes at the date of award is calculated using the Black-
Scholes model apart from the total shareholder return element of 
the LTIP which is based on a stochastic model. 
The cost to the Group of awards to employees under the LTIP 
scheme is spread on a straight-line basis over the relevant 
performance period. The scheme awards to senior employees  
a number of shares which will vest after three years if particular 
criteria are met. The cost of the scheme is based on the fair  
value of the shares at the date the options are granted.  
Shares purchased and held in trust in connection with the Group’s 
share schemes are deducted from retained earnings. No gain or 
loss is recognised within the income statement on the market  
value of these shares compared with the original cost. 
Finance income and costs 
Interest receivable and payable on bank balances is credited or 
charged to the income statement as incurred using the effective 
interest rate method. 
Borrowing costs are capitalised where the Group constructs 
qualifying assets. All other borrowing costs are written off to the 
income statement as incurred. 
Borrowing costs incurred within the Group’s jointly controlled 
entities relating to the construction of assets in PFI and PPP 
projects are capitalised until the relevant assets are brought  
into operational use. 
Notional interest payable, representing the unwinding of the 
discount on long-term liabilities, is charged to finance costs. 
Taxation 
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is 
recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
recognised in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income for  
the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect  
of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet method, providing 
for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used 
for taxation purposes. The deferred tax provision is based on the 
expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount 
of the assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will  
be realised. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at  
the exchange rates in effect when they take place. Resulting foreign 
currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated at the 
exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange 
differences arising from foreign currency transactions are reflected  
in the income statement. 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s 
subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which each entity operates (‘the functional 
currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in 
GBP, which is the Group’s presentation currency. 
The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings are 
translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Trading profits or losses are translated at average rates prevailing 
during the accounting period. Differences on exchange arising  
from the retranslation of net investments in overseas subsidiary 
undertakings at the year end rates are recognised in other 
comprehensive income. All other translation differences are 
reflected in the income statement. 
Mining assets 
Opencast expenditure incurred prior to the commencement of 
operating an opencast site is capitalised and the cost less the 
residual value is depreciated over the ‘coaling life’ of the site on  
a coal extraction basis. 
The cost of restoration is recognised as a provision as soon as  
the restoration liability arises. The amount provided represents  
the present value of the anticipated costs. Costs are charged 
against the provision as incurred and the unwinding of the discount 
is included within finance costs. A tangible asset is created for an 
amount equivalent to the initial provision and depreciated on a coal 
extraction basis over the life of the asset.  
Where there is a subsequent change to the estimated restoration 
costs or discount rate, the present value of the change is 
recognised as a change in the restoration provision with a 
corresponding change in the cost of the tangible asset until the 
asset is fully depreciated when the remaining adjustment is taken  
to the income statement. 
120 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017  
  Kier Group plc | www.kier.co.uk 121 
Inventories 
Inventories, including land held for and in the course of development, 
are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost 
comprises direct materials and, where appropriate, labour and 
production overheads which have been incurred in bringing the 
inventories and work in progress to their present location and 
condition. Cost in certain circumstances also includes notional 
interest as explained in the accounting policy for finance income 
and costs. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling  
price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred 
in marketing, selling and distribution. 
Construction work in progress is included within inventories in  
the balance sheet. It is measured at cost plus profit less losses 
recognised to date less progress billings. If payments received from 
customers exceed the income recognised, the difference is included 
within trade and other payables in the balance sheet. 
Land inventory is recognised at the time a liability is recognised; 
generally after exchange of unconditional contracts. 
Property inventory, which represents all development land and  
work in progress, is included at cost less any losses foreseen in 
completing and disposing of the development less any amounts 
received or receivable as progress payments or part disposals. 
Where a property is being developed, cost includes cost of 
acquisition and development to date, including directly attributable 
fees, expenses and finance charges net of rental or other income 
attributable to the development. Where development property is  
not being actively developed, net rental income and finance costs 
are taken to the income statement. 
Assets held for sale 
Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their 
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount  
will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through 
continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the 
sale is highly probable and the assets are available for sale in  
their present condition. 
Share capital 
The ordinary share capital of the Company is recorded as 
the proceeds received, net of directly attributable incremental 
issue costs. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal  
or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and where  
it is probable that an outflow will be required to settle the obligation 
and the amount can be reliably estimated. 
Contingent liabilities 
The Group discloses a contingent liability in circumstances where  
it has a possible obligation depending on whether some uncertain 
future event occurs; or has a present obligation but payment is  
not probable or the amount can’t be measured reliability. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the 
Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. An assessment of whether 
a financial asset is impaired is made at least at each reporting date. 
The principal financial assets and liabilities of the Group are  
as follows: 
(a) Trade receivables and trade payables 
Given the varied activities of the Group it is not practicable to 
identify a common operating cycle. The Group has therefore 
allocated receivables and payables due within 12 months of  
the balance sheet date to current with the remainder included  
in non-current. 
Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated at their  
initial cost reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. 
Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are 
stated at their nominal value. Trade payables on extended terms, 
particularly in respect of land purchases, are discounted and 
recorded at their present value. 
(b) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement comprise 
cash at bank and in hand, including bank deposits with original 
maturities of three months or less, net of bank overdrafts where 
legal right of set off exists. Bank overdrafts are included within 
financial liabilities in current liabilities in the balance sheet. 
(c) Bank and other borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank and other borrowings are recorded at the fair 
value of the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance 
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption 
and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in 
the income statement using the effective interest method and are 
added to the carrying value of the instrument to the extent that they 
are not settled in the period in which they arise. 
(d) Private Finance Initiative (PFI) assets 
Under the terms of a PFI or similar project, where the risks and 
rewards of ownership remain largely with the purchaser of the 
associated services, the Group’s interest in the asset is classified 
as a financial asset and included at its amortised cost within 
investment in joint ventures. 
(e) Derivative financial instruments 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date that 
the contract is entered into and subsequently re-measured in future 
periods at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting 
change in fair value depends on whether the derivative is 
designated as a hedging instrument and whether the hedging 
relationship is effective. 
For cash flow hedges the effective part of the change in fair value  
of these derivatives is recognised directly in other comprehensive 
income. Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the 
income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to 
the income statement in the periods when the hedged items will 
affect profit or loss. The fair value of interest rate derivatives is the 
estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate 
the derivatives at the balance sheet date. 
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge 
accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or 
loss previously recognised in equity remains there until the forecast 
transaction occurs. 
The Group enters into forward contracts in order to hedge against 
transactional foreign currency exposures. In cases where these 
derivative instruments are significant, hedge accounting is applied 
as described above. Where hedge accounting is not applied, 
changes in fair value of derivatives are recognised in the income 
statement. Fair values are based on observable market prices at the 
balance sheet date. 
(f) Government grants 
Government grant income is recognised at the point that there is 
reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions 
attached to it, and that the grant will be received.

1 Significant accounting policies continued 
Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources 
of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities with in the next financial year are 
as follows: 
(a) Revenue and profit recognition 
The estimation techniques used for revenue and profit recognition in 
respect of property development, private housing sales, construction 
contracts and services contracts require forecasts to be made of the 
outcome of long-term contracts which require assessments and 
judgements to be made on the recovery of pre-contract costs, 
changes in the scope of work, contract programmes, maintenance 
and defects liabilities and changes in costs. 
(b) Valuation of land and work in progress 
The key judgements and estimates in determining the net realisable 
value of land and work in progress are: 
› An estimation of costs to complete; 
› An estimation of the remaining revenues; and 
› An estimation of selling costs. 
These assessments include a degree of uncertainty and therefore if 
the key judgements and estimates change unfavourably, write downs 
of land and work in progress may be necessary. 
(c) Defined benefit pension scheme valuations 
In determining the valuation of defined benefit pension scheme 
assets and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been 
made. The key assumptions, which are given below, are largely 
dependent on factors outside the control of the Group: 
› Expected return on plan assets; 
› Inflation rate; 
› Mortality; 
› Discount rate; and 
› Salary and pension increases. 
Details of the assumptions used are included in note 8. 
(d) Provisions 
Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount and therefore 
in making a reliable estimate of the amount and timing of liabilities 
judgement is applied and re-evaluated at each reporting date. 
(e) Goodwill 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation  
of the value in use of cash generating units (CGUs) to which the 
goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an 
estimate to be made of the timing and amount of future cash flows 
expected to arise from the CGU and the application of a suitable 
discount rate in order to calculate the net present value. Cash flow 
forecasts for the next three years are based on the Group’s budgets 
and forecasts. Other key inputs in assessing each CGU are revenue 
growth, operating margin and discount rate. The assumptions are  
set out in note 12 together with an assessment of the impact of 
reasonably possible sensitivities. 
(f) Non-underlying items 
Non-underlying items are items of financial performance which the 
Group believes should be separately identified on the face of the 
income statement to assist in understanding the underlying financial 
performance achieved by the Group. Determining whether an item is 
part of underlying or non-underlying items requires judgement. 
A total non-underlying cost of £88.3m after tax was charged to the 
income statement for the year ended 30 June 2017. The items that 
comprise this are set out in note 4 together with an explanation of 
their nature. 
(g) Taxation 
The Group is subject to tax in a number of jurisdictions and 
judgement is required in determining the overall provision for income 
taxes. The Group provides for future liabilities in respect of uncertain 
tax positions where additional tax may become payable in future 
periods and such provisions are based on management’s 
assessment of exposures. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally provided for in full and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is judged probable 
that future taxable profit will arise against which the temporary 
differences will be utilised. 
2 Segmental reporting 
The Group operates four divisions: Property, Residential, 
Construction and Services, which is the basis on which the Group 
manages and reports its primary segmental information. Corporate 
includes unrecovered overheads and the charge for defined benefit 
pension schemes.  
Segmental information is based on the information provided to the 
Chief Executive, together with the Board, who is the chief operating 
decision maker. The segments are strategic business units which 
have different core customers and offer different services. The 
segments are discussed in the Chief Executive’s strategic review  
on pages 14 to 19 and the divisional reviews on pages 42 to 51. 
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as 
those described in the summary of significant accounting policies on 
pages 117 to 122. The Group evaluates segmental information on 
the basis of profit or loss from operations before non-underlying 
items, interest and income tax expense. The segmental results that 
are reported to the Chief Executive include items directly attributable 
to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a 
reasonable basis.

continued 
Portfolio simplification – closure of businesses 
The ongoing programme of portfolio simpli fication, including the wind down and closure of the Hong Kong and Caribbean businesses  
and related final accounts contract settlements, resulted in costs of £86.7m. The single remaining contract in the Caribbean is nearing 
completion. The final contract in Hong Kong is complete with the final account in the final stages of negotiation. The prior ye ar’s charge 
included a £10.6m impairment of the UK Mining business which the Group is in the process of winding down and, consequently, the results 
are presented as continuing but non-underlying. As a result of the charge in the prior year, the result of the mining operation s in 2017  
was nil. 
Portfolio simplification – sale of assets and other M&A activity 
The disposal of Mouchel Consulting in October 2016 generated a pr ofit on sale of £40.0m and net cash proceeds of £58.9m. Biogen 
Holdings Limited was sold in April 2017 generating a loss of £7.6m and net cash proceeds of £9 .7m, following an impairment charge of 
£5.0m in the prior year. The integration of Mouchel is complete and consequently there are no further costs of acquisition or integration in 
the current year (2016: £49.9m). Other minor M&A activity took pl ace during the year, including the sale of mining operations i n Saudi 
Arabia, resulting in a total charge of £3.8m and £1.6m of transact ion costs relating to the McNicholas acquisition, which took place post 
year end (2016: gain on sale of Kier FPS Limited: £1.7m). 
Other non-underlying costs 
The Group continues to work through the legacy contract issues in the Environmental Services business against a backdrop of rec yclate 
pricing pressure. As a result of exiting one contract four years early and the current year impact of reduced recyclate income, a further 
charge of £11.1m has been taken. The prior year charge of £35. 6m similarly comprised of both contract costs and recyclate price impact. 
A provision of £8.0m has been made for a potential increase in Health & Safety Executive fines arising from revised sentencing guidelines. 
The establishment of the Cross Keys Homes joint venture in March 2017 resulted in initial costs of £2.2m. Closure of acquired M ouchel 
Pension schemes to future accrual has resulted in a one-off pension curtailment gain of £6.0m. 
Further details on amortisation of intangible contract rights and financing costs are given in note 12 and note 5.

8 Retirement benefit obligations 
The Group operates a number of pension schemes for eligible employees as described below. 
Kier Group scheme 
This is the principal scheme and includes a defined benefit secti on and a defined contribution section. The assets of the schem e are held  
in trust separate from the assets of the Group. The trustees are responsible for investing the assets and delegate day-to-day d ecisions to 
independent professional investment managers. 
The defined benefit section of the scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 January 2002; existing members continued to accrue be nefits 
for service until the scheme was closed to future accrual on 28 February 2015. 
The contributions paid during the year were £16.9m (2016: £15.5m ) which included contributions of £15.5m (2016: £15.5m) to fund the 
past service deficit. 
Going forward, contributions will include an allowance for fundin g the past service deficit identified at the 2016 valuation da te. The Group 
expects to make contributions of £12.8m for funding the past service deficit and ongoing scheme administration costs in the yea r to  
30 June 2018. 
The Pension Protection Fund levy is payable in addition to the above contributions. 
The scheme as at 30 June 2017 has 2, 838 deferred members and 2,803 retirees. 
Other defined benefit schemes 
Acquired with the May Gurney Group 
The May Gurney defined benefit scheme was acquired with May Gurney in the year to 30 June 2014. This defined benefit scheme has 
closed to future accrual and the deficit contributions payable in the period to 30 June 2017 am ounted to £2.1m (2016: £1.9m). T he assets 
of the scheme are held in trust separate from the assets of the Group. The trustees are responsible for decisions and holding t he assets, 
and delegate day-to-day decisions to independent professional investment managers. 
An actuarial valuation of the May Gurney scheme was undertaken by the trustees’ independent actuaries as at 31 March 2014 using the 
projected unit method. The market value of the scheme’s assets at that date was £62.0m which represented approximately 83% of t he 
benefits that had accrued to members at that date, after allowing for future increases in pensionable salaries. Deficit contrib utions for the 
financial year to 30 June 2018 of £2.4m have been agreed with the trustees.  
The scheme as at 30 June 2017 has 365 deferred members and 274 retirees.  
Acquired with the Mouchel Group 
The Group acquired a number of defined benefit pension schemes with the Mouchel Group. The assets of the scheme are held in tru st 
separate from the assets of the Group. The trustees are responsible for decisions and holding the assets, and delegate day-to-d ay decisions 
to independent professional investment managers.

8 Retirement benefit obligations continued  
These schemes were closed to new entrants in 2001. Other than the ‘public sector comparable’ parts, the Mouchel schemes were cl osed 
to future accrual in 2010. The remaining parts of most of the Mouchel schemes were closed to future accrual in the current year, resulting  
in a total curtailment gain of £6.0m. A single ‘public sector comparable’ scheme remains open to future accrual. There is a def icit recovery 
plan in place for the Mouchel schemes, requiring deficit contributions of £8.6m in the year to 30 June 2018. 
The contributions paid during the year were £12.3m (2016: £9.7 m) which included contributions of £10.7m (2016: £8.0m) to fund t he past 
service deficit. 
In total, the schemes as at 30 June 2017 have 18 acti ve members, 1,994 deferred members and 1,444 retirees. 
The Mouchel schemes were formally valued by the trustees’ independent actuaries as at 31 March 2016. 
Other defined contribution schemes 
Contributions are also made to a number of other defined contribution arrangements. The Group paid contributions of £41.9m (201 6: 
£43.2m) during the year to these arrangements. 
The Group also makes contributions to local government defined benefit pension schemes in respect of certain employees who have 
transferred to the Group under TUPE transfer arrangements. The Group is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets a nd liabilities 
in the schemes on a consistent and reasonable basis and consequently the pension costs for these schemes are treated as if they were 
defined contribution schemes.

Risk exposure 
As IAS 19 actual assumptions are driven by market conditions, th ere is a risk that significant changes in financial market cond itions could 
lead to volatility in the defined benefit obli gation disclosed in the balance sheet from year to year. In addition, the asset p osition may also  
be volatile as it will be influenced by changes in market conditions. However, the risk of significant changes to the overall b alance sheet 
position has been mitigated to an extent due to the asset hedging strategies in place for the schemes. 
Pension sensitivity

The sensitivity analyses above have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurrin g at  
the end of the reporting period and may not be representative of the actual change, which is based on a change in a key assumpt ion while 
holding all other assumptions constant. When calculating the sensitivity to the assumption, the same method used to calculate t he liability 
recognised in the balance sheet has been applied. The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analys es did not 
change compared with the previous period.

Non-underlying items includes significant one off costs related to restructuring, disposals, acquisitions and business closures. Amortisation 
disclosed as non-underlying separately relates to the amortisation of contract right costs held as intangibles on the balance s heet.  
Kier Group and its subsidiaries are based predominantly in the UK and are subject to UK corporation tax. The Group does not hav e an 
aggressive tax policy and since 1 July 2012 Kier has not entered into any tax avoidance schemes which were or should have been notified 
under the Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Scheme (DOTAS) rules. 
The tax charge before non-underlying items and amortisation of contract rights of £21.9m (2016: £20.9m) shown in the table abov e 
equates to an effective tax rate of 17.4% (2016: 18.0%) on adju sted profit before tax of £127.0m (2016: £116.8m). This effectiv e rate is 
lower than the standard rate of corporation tax of 19.75% (2016: 20.00%) due to a number of items shown in the table above. The non-
deductible expenses included in underlying mainly relate to depreciation on non-qualifying assets. 
In accordance with UK tax legislation, capital gains arising on disposal of certain investments, including some of the joint ve ntures disposed 
of during the year, are not subject to tax. 
Tax relief on expenses not recognised in the income statement includes the impact of the tax deduction received in respect of t he cost of 
shares exercised under the Group’s employee Save As You Earn Scheme and Long Term Incentive Plan. 
The net charge adjustment of £2.3m (2016: credit of £1.4m) in respect of prior years’ results arise from differences between th e estimates 
of taxation included in the previous year’s financial statements and the actual tax liabilities calculated in the tax returns s ubmitted to and 
agreed by HMRC.

(d) Factors that may affect future tax charges 
The deferred tax balance as at the year end has been recognised at 17.0% which is the enacted corporation tax rate that will be effective 
from 1 April 2020. 
(e) Tax losses 
At the balance sheet date the Group had unused tax losses of £161.6m (2016: £172.5m) available for offset against future profit s. 
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £10.6m (2016: £23.3m) of income tax losses.  
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining losses due to the unpredictability of future profit strea ms against 
which these losses could be offset. Under present tax legislation, these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

totalling circa £43.7m will be paid on 1 December 2017 to shar eholders on the register at the close of business on 29 September 2017. 
A DRIP ‘dividend reinvestment plan’ alternative will be offered.

Goodwill largely relates to the Services cash generating unit (‘CGU’). This has been built up by the acquisition of MRBL Limite d (Mouchel 
Group) (£309.3m), May Gurney Integrated Services PLC (£194.7m), Kier Partnership Homes Limited (£5.2m), Pure Recycling Limited 
(£4.8m), Beco Limited (£2.6m) and Southdale (£0.8m). These balances have been subject to an annual impairment review based upon the 
projected profits of each CGU. 
The cost of contract rights relates to: 
› The acquisition of the businesses and assets of the construction and business services operations of Sheffield City Council 
(£21.3m), Stoke-on-Trent City Council (£1.9m) and North Tyneside Council (£7.2m). These contracts are in partnership with the 
respective councils that have retained a participatory ownership interest and the rights for a minority share in the profits. These 
profit shares are reflected in the income statement as minority interests. The amounts for the year to 30 June 2017 are: Stoke-on-
Trent City Council £0.5m (2016: £0.5m), North Tyneside Council £0.2m (2016: £0.2m), Unity Partnership £0.4m (2016: £nil);  
› The acquisition of Pure Recycling Limited (£2.0m) and Stewart Milne (£1.0m); 
› The acquisition of a commercial refuse collections business from Wealdon District Council (£3.6m);  
› The acquisition of May Gurney Integrated Services plc (£106.7m); and 
› The acquisition of MRBL Limited (Mouchel Group) (£138.6m). 
Contract rights on May Gurney and Mouchel are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected total contract duration. All other 
contract rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract life.

For impairment testing purposes, the goodwill has been allocated to the above four CGUs. The recoverable amount of the goodwill and 
intangibles has been determined based on value in use calculations, which use cash flow projections based on the Group’s foreca sts 
approved by management, covering a three-year period. 
The resulting cash flows are discounted to present value, with the discount rate used in the value in use calculations based on the Group’s 
weighted average cost of capital, adjusted as necessary to reflect the risk associated with the assets being tested. 
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the forecast revenues and gross margins during the forecast period and the 
discount rates applied to future cash flows. Cash flows for periods beyond those forecast have a terminal growth rate assumptio n applied. 
Significant headroom exists in all CGUs and management considers that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions wou ld not 
lead to an impairment being recognised. 
Services CGU 
A revenue growth rate of 1.9% and a fixed operating margin of 5.0% have been applied to the Services CGU cash flows into perpet uity. 
These assumptions are in line with current trading and current forecasts of UK GDP growth rate. The pre-tax discount rate used is 9.2% 
(2016: 9.3%).  
Based on the value in use calculation, thes e assumptions derived a recoverable amount for the Services CGU that is £510.0m abov e the 
carrying value of CGU assets. 
The Services CGU impairment review is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions: discount rate, revenue growth rate and the o perating 
margin, although management do not consider that any reasonable possible change in any single assumption would give rise to an 
impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles. The assumptions would have to change as follows for any single as sumption 
change to bring headroom down to £nil: 
› Discount rate – increase from 9.2% to 14.0%; 
› Growth rate – reduce from positive 1.9% to negative 6.1%; and 
› Underlying operating margin – reduce from 5.0% to 2.2%.

Insurance provisions are in respect of legal and other disputes in various Group companies.  
Mining provisions of £8.7m, representing the cost of restoration of opencast mining activities, have been transferred from the disposal 
group (see note 19) following the Group’s decision in the year not to exit from its UK Mining operations. 
HSE regulatory provisions are in respect of potential fines arising from changes to safety, health and environmental legislatio n and 
regulation (see note 4 to the financial statements). 
Other provisions primarily represent contractual obligations on cessation of certain contracts and fair value provisions. 
It is anticipated that the amounts pr ovided will be utilised as follows:

£m 
2016
£m
Due within one year 19.0 22.8
Due after one year 60.3 57.7
 79.3 80.5
Due to the nature of the provision for insurance claims, the timing of any potential future outflows in respect of these liabil ities is uncertain. 
Future outflows in respect of other provisions are expected to occur over the next 10 years.

The value per option represents the fair value of the option less the consideration payable. 
The fair value of the TSR element incorporates an assessment of the number of shares that will be awarded, as the performance c onditions 
are market conditions under IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’. 
The performance conditions of the EPS and the net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ratio (N et 
Debt:EBITDA) elements are non-market conditions under IFRS 2. The fair value therefore does not include an assessment of the nu mber of 
shares that will be awarded. Instead the amount charged for this element is based on the fair value factored by a ‘true-up’ for the number of 
awards that are expected to vest. 
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years. The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK 
Government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life. 
An amount of £2.7m relating to share-based payments has been recognised in the income statement as employee costs (2016: £5.6m) . 
Included in other payables is an amount of £0.7m (2016: £0.8m) relating to provisions for employer’s national insurance.

26 Guarantees and contingent liabilities 
There are contingent liabilities in respect of performance bonds, guarantees and claims under contracting and other arrangement s, including 
joint operations and joint ventures, entered into in the normal course of business. 
During the year, the directors have reviewed the aggregate po tential liability which may arise from certain safety, health and environmental 
incidents which took place before the implementation of relevant se ntencing guidelines in February 2016. Following this review, a provision 
has been made for the directors’ current estimate of the financial impact on the Group. For further details, please see note 4 to the 
financial statements. 
27 Financial instruments 
Capital risk management 
The Group’s capital management objectives are: to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern; and to optimise th e capital 
structure in order to minimise the cost of capital; whilst maintaining a strong balance sheet to support business development a nd tender 
qualification. The four operating divisions of the Group have complementary capital characteristics, with the Construction divi sion, and to a 
lesser extent the Services division, generating a net cash surp lus, whilst the Property and Residential divisions require net c apital to fund 
developments. The Group’s capital management strategy is to use a blend of capital types with different risk, return and maturi ty profiles  
to support the operating divisions and deliver the Group’s capital management objectives. The Group’s overall capital risk mana gement 
strategy remains unchanged from 2016. 
The capital structure of the Group comprises: equity, consisting of share capital, share premium, retained earnings and other r eserves  
as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity; and cash, cash equivalents and borrowings as disclosed in note 20 and 
described further below. The Group forecasts and monitors short, medium and longer-term capital needs on a regular basis and ad justs  
its capital structure as required through the payment of dividends to shareholders, the issue of new share capital and the incr ease or 
repayment of borrowings. All investment decisions are made with regard to the Group’s weighted average cost of capital and typically a  
pre-tax annualised return of at least 15.0% is required to ensure such investments are value enhancing for shareholders. 
Financial risk management 
Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed. In the course of its business, the Group is expo sed primarily 
to credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk. The overall aim of the Group’s financial risk management policies is to minimis e any potential 
adverse effects on financial performance and net assets. 
The Group’s treasury team manages the principal financial risks wi thin policies and operating limits approved by the Board. The treasury 
function is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions. Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure 
to fluctuations in interest and exchange rates and some commodity prices. 
ꉝ redit risk 
Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and interest rate and currency hedges. 
Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history. The Group’s most significant clients are public  
or regulated industry entities which generally have high credit ratings or are of a high credit quality due to the nature of the client. 
Short-term bank deposits and hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings 
issued by the major ratings agencies. Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one 
counterparty are within acceptable limits. At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. 
Trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are stated net of bad debt provisions which have been estimated by ma nagement 
following a review of individual receivable accounts. There is no Group-wide rate of provision and provision made for debts tha t are overdue 
is based on prior default experience and known factors at the balance sheet date. Receivables are written off against the bad d ebt provision 
when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable. 
An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below:

There were £82.9m (2016: £88.4m) of trade receivables that were overdue at the balance sheet date that have not been provided a gainst, 
of which £48.5m (2016: £43.2m) had been received by the end of Au gust 2017. There are no indications as at 30 June 2017 that th e 
debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet t hat are 
overdue and un-provided. The proportion of trade receivables at 30 June 2017 that were overdue for payment was 37.8% (2016: 41. 7%). 
Credit terms vary across the Group; the average age of trade receivables was as follows: 
Construction 16 days (2016: 19 days)  
Services 14 days (2016: 12 days)  
Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to significant credit risk. 
Market risk 
Interest rate risk 
The Group has borrowing facilities to finance short-term working capital requirements and term loans to finance medium-term cap ital 
requirements, which carry interest at floating rates, at a margin over LIBOR. The Group’s borrowings, excluding the effect of d erivatives, can 
be analysed as follows: 
 
2017

2016
£m
Fixed rate 288.0 276.2
Variable rate 346.5 30.0
Cost of raising finance (2.7) (3.0)
 631.8 303.2
In addition, a number of the Group’s joint ventures have entered into interest rate swaps where there is significant interest r ate risk. 
Foreign currency risk 
The Group operates primarily within the UK such that its exposure to currency risk is not considered to be significant. Where s ignificant 
foreign currency exposures are identified, these are hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts or swaps. 
Liquidity risk 
The Group’s policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund operations without the need to carry 
significant net debt over the medium term. The Group’s principal borrowing facilities are provided by a syndicate of relationsh ip banks and 
established investors, and in the case of a number of our Loan Notes, in the form of unsecured committed borrowing facilities. The amount 
of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regula rly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross de bt levels. 
On the 6 July 2017 the Group r enegotiated the Revolving Credit Facility, extending the renewal date and total facility level. See note 32 for 
further details. 
Derivative financial instruments  
During 2013 the Group entered into three cross-currency swaps to hedge the currency risk on a US dollar denominated loan, nomin al 
value US$28.0m. During 2014 the Group entered into four cross-currency swaps to hedge the currency risk on a US dollar denomina ted 
loan, nominal value US$116.0m. During 2016 the Group entered into two cross-currency swaps to hedge the currency risk on a Euro 
denominated loan, nominal value €20.0m, and three interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk on a GBP denominated loan , 
nominal value £58.5m. During 2017 the Group reduced the value on the HSBC intere st rate swap from £15.0m to £10.0m and entered 
into an additional swap of £12.0m bringing the total value to £6 5.5m. These swaps continue to meet the criteria for hedge accou nting.  
The following table indicates the periods in which the cash flow s associated with cash flow hedges are expected to occur, how t hose cash 
flows will impact the income statement and the fair value of the related hedging instruments:

In addition to the above, a number of the Group’s PFI and property joint ventures have entered into interest rate derivatives a s a means of 
hedging interest rate risk. Interest-bearing debts and associated interest rate derivatives within these joint ventures have a typical term of 
between 20 and 25 years and are without recourse to the Group. At 30 June 2017 the aggregate amount outstanding on these intere st-
bearing debts against which interest rate derivatives are held is £82.9m (2016: £121.9m). The Group’s share of the total net fa ir value 
liability of these interest rate derivatives at 30 June 2017 amounted to £6.3m (2016: £8.0m) whic h, together with the related deferred 
tax asset of £1.1m (2016: £1.4m), have met the criteria for hedge accounting.

Property joint ventures 
The property division typically uses joint ventures to structur e transactions, and the Group considers disposals of such vehicl es to be 
underlying trading which are in the underlying course of business.  
During the year the Group, through its subsidiary Kier Project Investment Limited, disposed of its interests in Blue3 (London) (Holdings) 
Limited, for a total consideration of £3.8m. The profit on disposal recognised in the year was £1.3m.  
During the year the Group, through its subsidiary Kier Project Investment Limited, disposed of its interests in Blue3 (Staffs) (Holdings) 
Limited, for a total consideration of £5.0m. The profit on dispos al recognised in the year was £2.3m. In addition there is an e lement of 
deferred consideration totalling £1.4m not yet recognised which is likely to be recognised in the future. 
On 2 September 2016 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital and loan notes of Lysander Student Properties Investments Limi ted 
(LSPIL). LSPIL had previously been held as a joint venture of wh ich the Group had a 50% holding. The additional 50% of the shar e capital

32 Events after the end of the reporting period 
Acquisition of McNicholas 
On 12 July 2017, the Group acquired the entire share capital of McNicholas Construction (Holdings) Limited (‘McNicholas’), a le ading 
infrastructure services provider. The acquisition of McNicholas builds on the Group’s strategy to accelerate growth and hold le ading 
positions in its chosen markets. The Board believes the acquisition is a highly complementary addition to the Group’s utility s ervices 
business and enhances the Group’s presence in the power, rail and telecoms markets, with its long-standing client relationships . 
The maximum consideration payable for the acquisition is £27.4m, comprising £13.4m in cash paid at completion and £14.0m of def erred 
contingent consideration. The £14.0m of deferred contingent consideration comprises: 
› £9.5m in cash payable on achieving certain EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) targets; and 
› £4.5m payable on achieving debt-recovery targets. 
The fair value of the total consideration expected to be paid is £21.9m. 
The fair value of net liabilities acquired totalled £33.0m. Due to the proximity of the acquisition to the Group’s reporting da te, the fair values 
of assets and liabilities acquired are provisional to allow for further adjustments in the measurement period. 
The difference between the fair value of consideration and net li abilities acquired of £54.9m will be attributed to goodwill an d intangible fixed 
assets including contract rights. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
The majority of the £1.8m of acquisition costs were incurred in the year and were expensed to the income statement as a non-
underlying item. 
As McNicholas was acquired after the end of the current reporting period, the business made no contribution to the Group revenu e or 
underlying profit before taxation in the year. 
Renegotiation of financing facilities 
On 6 July 2017 the Group extended the tenor, to April 2022, of it s core multi-bank Revolving Credit Facility. In addition to a lower borrowing 
rate, the banking group has been extended and the total av ailable facilities have been increased to £670.0m from £400.0m.

Notes to the Company financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2017 
162 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 
1 Accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They 
have been applied consistently throughout the year and the 
preceding year. 
Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ 
(‘FRS101’) and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements 
have been prepared under the historical cost convention. 
Kier Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom 
under the Companies Act. The address of the registered office is 
given on page 167. 
The Company’s financial statements are included in the Kier Group 
plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 
2017. As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006,  
the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account. 
The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure 
exemptions in preparing these financial statements, as permitted 
by FRS101. 
› The requirement of paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 
‘Share Based Payment’ 
› The requirements of IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures’ 
› The requirements of paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS13 ‘Fair 
Value Measurement’ 
› The requirement in paragraph 38 of IAS1 ‘Presentation of 
Financial Statements’ to present comparative information in 
respect of paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS1 
› The requirement of paragraphs 10(d), 10a(f), 16, 38A, 38B, 
38C, 38D, 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D and 111 of IAS1 
‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ 
› The requirements of paragraphs 134 to 136 of IAS1 
‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ 
› The requirements of IAS7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’ 
› The requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS8 
‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates 
and Errors’ 
› The requirement of paragraphs 17 and 18A of IAS24 ‘Related 
Party Disclosures’ 
› The requirements in IAS24 ‘Related party disclosures’ to 
disclose related party transaction entered into between two or 
more members of a group 
› The requirements of paragraphs 134(d) to 134(f) and 135(c) 
to 135(e) of IAS36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ 
These financial statements are separate financial statements. 
The Company is exempt from the preparation of consolidated 
financial statements because it is included in the Annual Report  
and Financial Statements of the Group. 
Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements of the Group as shown in  
note 1 to 9. 
Going concern 
The directors have made enquiries and have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue 
in existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
Fixed asset investments 
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are included in the balance 
sheet at cost less any provision for impairment. 
Taxation 
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is 
recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
recognised in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income for 
the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect 
of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet method, providing 
for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used 
for taxation purposes. The deferred tax provision is based on the 
expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount 
of the assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will  
be realised. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the 
Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to 
the contractual provisions of the instrument. The principal financial 
assets and liabilities of the Company are as follows: 
(a) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, 
including bank deposits with original maturities of three months or 
less, net of bank overdrafts where legal right of set off exists. Bank 
overdrafts are included within financial liabilities in current liabilities 
in the balance sheet. 
(b) Bank and other borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank and other borrowings are recorded at the fair 
value of the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance 
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption 
and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in 
the income statement using the effective interest method and are 
added to the carrying value of the instrument to the extent that they 
are not settled in the period in which they arise. 
 
162 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017  
  Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 163 
(c) Derivative financial instruments 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date that  
the contract is entered into and subsequently re-measured in future 
periods at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting 
change in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated 
as a hedging instrument and whether the hedging relationship  
is effective. 
For cash flow hedges the effective part of the change in fair value 
of these derivatives is recognised directly in other comprehensive 
income. Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the 
income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to 
the income statement in the periods when the hedged items will 
affect profit or loss. The fair value of interest rate derivatives is  
the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay  
to terminate the derivatives at the balance sheet date. 
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge 
accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or 
loss previously recognised in equity remains there until the forecast 
transaction occurs. 
The Company enters into forward contracts in order to hedge  
against transactional foreign currency exposures. In cases where 
these derivative instruments are significant, hedge accounting is 
applied as described above. Where hedge accounting is not applied, 
changes in fair value of derivatives are recognised in the income 
statement. Fair values are based on quoted market prices at the 
balance sheet date. 
Share-based payments 
Share-based payments granted but not vested are valued at the fair 
value of the shares at the date of grant. This affects the Sharesave 
and Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) schemes. The fair value of 
these schemes at the date of award is calculated using the Black-
Scholes model apart from the total shareholder return element of 
the LTIP which is based on a stochastic model. 
The cost to the Company of awards to employees under the 
LTIP scheme is spread on a straight-line basis over the relevant 
performance period. The scheme awards to senior employees a 
number of shares which will vest after three years if particular 
criteria are met. The cost of the scheme is based on the fair 
value of the shares at the date the options are granted.  
Shares purchased and held in trust in connection with the 
Company’s share schemes are deducted from retained earnings.  
No gain or loss is recognised within the income statement on the 
market value of these shares compared with the original cost. 
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty 
In the application of the Company accounting policies which are 
described above, the directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
The estimates are based on historical experience and the factors 
that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from 
those estimates. 
The estimates are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the 
estimate is revised. 
There are no critical judgements, apart from those involving 
estimates, that the directors have made in the process of applying 
the Company’s accounting policies and that have a significant effect 
on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. 
They key assumptions and a key source of estimation uncertainty 
at the balance sheet date that has a significant risk of carrying a 
material adjustment to the carrying amount within the next financial 
year is: 
Impairment of investment in subsidiaries 
Determining whether the Company’s investments in subsidiaries 
have been impaired requires estimations of the investments’ value 
in use. The value in use calculations require the entity to estimate 
the future cash flows expected to arise from investments. The 
carrying amount of the investment in subsidiaries at the balance 
sheet date was £173.6m (2016: £170.9m). No impairment losses 
have been recognised. 
2 Profit for the year 
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the 
Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account 
for the year. The profit for the year was £22.6m (2016: £20.0m). 
The auditors’ remuneration for audit services to the Company was 
£0.1m (2016: £0.1m).  
3 Information relating to directors and employees 
Information relating to directors’ emoluments, pension entitlements, 
share options and LTIP interests appears in the directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 82 to 101. The Company has  
no employees other than the directors. 
4 Dividends 
Details of the dividends paid by the Company are included in  
note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.

8 Derivative financial instruments 
During 2013 the Company entered into three cross-currency swaps to hedge the currency risk on a US dollar denominated loan, nom inal 
value US$28.0m. During 2014 the Company entered into four cross-currency swaps to hedge the currency risk on a US dollar denomi nated 
loan, nominal value US$116.0m. During 2016 the Company entered into two cross-currency swaps to hedge the currency risk on a Eu ro 
denominated loan, nominal value €20.0m, and three interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk on a GBP denominated loan , 
nominal value £58.5m. During 2017 the com pany reduced the value on the HSBC interest rate swap from £15.0m to £10.0m and entere d 
into an additional swap of £12.0m bringing the total value to £6 5.5m. These swaps continue to meet the criteria for hedge accou nting  
and as a result have been recognised directly in equity. 
The following table indicates the periods in which the cash flow s associated with cash flow hedges are expected to occur, how t hose cash 
flows will impact the income statement and the fair value of the related hedging instruments:
