This report comprises the annual report of Reuters Group PLC in accordance with the United Kingdom requirements and its annual report on Form 20-F in
accordance with the requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for 2004. A cross-reference guide setting out the information
in this report that corresponds to the Form 20-F items is provided on pages 94-95.
As used in this report, ‘Reuters Group’ and ‘Group’ refer to Reuters Group PLC and its subsidiary undertakings, including Instinet Group Incorporated (Instinet
Group), joint ventures and associates. The ‘company’ refers to the parent Reuters Group PLC. ‘Reuters’ refers to Reuters Group excluding Instinet Group.
The consolidated financial statements of Reuters Group included in this report are presented in pounds sterling (£). On 31 December 2004, the noon buying 
rate in New York City for cable transfers in foreign currencies as announced for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (Noon Buying Rate)
was US$1.92 = £1; on 4 March 2005 the Noon Buying Rate was US$1.92 = £1. For additional information on exchange rates between the pound sterling and 
the US dollar, see exchange rates on page 85.
Reuters Group’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom (UK GAAP).
UK GAAP differs in certain respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (US GAAP). The material differences between UK GAAP
and US GAAP relevant to Reuters Group are explained on pages 74-80.
This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to Reuters
Group’s financial condition, results of operations, business and management strategy and plans and objectives. For a discussion of risks associated with these
statements see ‘Risk Factors’ on pages 23-25.
Reuters, the sphere logo and Reuters product names referred to in the report are trade marks or registered trade marks of the Reuters Group of companies
around the world. Other trade marks of third parties are used in this report for the purpose of identification only. It is a privilege to follow in the footsteps of Sir Christopher Hogg. I am 
grateful for the warm and open welcome I have received from Tom Glocer and
his team and my Board colleagues. I hope to justify their confidence. 
Reuters is one of the world’s great brands. The principles which govern the
company are special. The people who work here are a unique blend. And yet
the business stumbled. But a resolute team has fought back, focused again 
on the core and rebuilt confidence and strength. The benefits of Fast Forward
are clear and will grow. Momentum will be maintained in 2005 but we must
also put in place a strategic framework for sustained growth in the years ahead.
There is growth potential in our core business, in adjacent markets and in new
sectors and geographies. Our task is to identify opportunities which play to
our competitive strengths and encompass risk which we understand. 
In doing so we must start with the extraordinary brand that is Reuters. What
does it stand for today and to what can it realistically aspire? How do we grow
the company to fill the space occupied by the brand? Where are the multiple
skills and special values of Reuters people best deployed? When can this
deliver value to our shareholders and worth to society?
As Chairman, my role is to lead the Board in a manner that allows the CEO 
to run the company effectively. This requires the correct balance between
detachment, thereby avoiding interference, and being sufficiently engaged 
to know when to intervene. Our Board discussions should always be open,
candid and trusting. We must be prepared to challenge, confront, disagree
and probe. But always in a way that is constructive and supportive of the
business agenda. As a Board we should be judged through the sustained
success of the business. I am excited by the challenge, yet humbled by 
the responsibility.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
02 Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004
“We must put in place a strategic
framework for sustained growth 
in the years ahead.” CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004   03
ONE TO ONE WITH TOM GLOCER
Our CEO answers the key questions about Reuters
Q What was the high point of 2004?
We increased Group operating profit by 51% to £197 million as our sales
began to recover. User accesses also started to climb again during the year,
reaching 328,000, an increase of 14,000 since the end of the first quarter.
… and the low point?
Unfortunately, our journalists and photographers are all too often exposed to
danger as they report world events. I deeply regret that in the last year, three
have lost their lives: Adlan Khasanov in Chechnya and Dhia Najim and Rashid
Khaled in Iraq. Their deaths are a searing reminder of the heroism of Reuters
journalists who put their lives on the line to report the reality of conflict to
those of us who live in a safer environment. 
Q You say Reuters is being transformed – from what to what?
In short, from a company at the edge to a great company again. The Reuters
of three years ago was at a crisis point. Our revenues were falling rapidly, we
were losing market share, our costs were too high, and our organisation was
too complex. Today, two-thirds of the way through Fast Forward, I’m pleased
with our progress. We have strengthened our product line, we are meeting 
our cost savings targets and we have done much to simplify the company and
reduce our portfolio. It’s a tough process, and one that will continue this year,
but it’s worth it because I truly believe we are on the way to making Reuters 
a great company again. 
Q What is being done to improve Reuters products?
The answer, and our approach, begins with identifying and understanding
customer needs. I think we are doing a much better job at this, and the results
show in new or significantly improved products such as Reuters 3000 Xtra,
Reuters Knowledge and Reuters Station. What I believe we need to improve 
is speed of execution and responsiveness to customers. Part of the answer 
lies in the cultural transformation we have underway at Reuters, and part lies 
in organising ourselves better. Towards this end, we reorganised our
Development and Operations groups at the beginning of 2005 to integrate
our software developers directly into the Customer Segment business teams
and focus on Customer Service.
Q What more can be done to improve customer satisfaction?
Our customer satisfaction score continued to improve during 2004, and I am
proud of the way the Reuters culture is changing to put the customer at the
heart of everything we do. However, our customer satisfaction took a hit in 
the fourth quarter in the wake of the power disruption we experienced last
October at our London data centre. It brought home to me just how integral
we are to the way our customers run their businesses and how we can create 
a competitive advantage for Reuters by increasing our investment in business
continuity and disaster recovery. 
Q Where do you expect Reuters growth to come from in the next few years?
Our dialogue with customers, investors and Reuters own staff has shifted from
one of recovery to growth. This is a challenge I take up eagerly. We are hard at
work on an ambitious growth strategy which will follow the completion of the
Fast Forward transformation plan in 2005.
We start from a good base. Our financial services market is returning to growth
after several difficult years; we will seek to outgrow the market by increasing
share. We are launching innovative trading systems to grow usage revenues
alongside subscription revenues. We are investing in parts of our business 
with high growth potential such as risk management systems and enterprise
information products, and we are expanding our business in emerging markets
such as China and India. Finally, as we take steps to reinforce the power of 
the Reuters brand, we believe there is more we can aspire to in the provision
of information direct to consumers.

Notes:
1 Under UK GAAP , dividends declared are those declared in respect of the year for which selected financial data is presented. Under US GAAP , dividends declared are those formally declared within each
calendar twelve-month period. Dividends declared for 2000-2002 include UK tax credits. Dividends declared for 2003 and 2004 exclude UK tax credits. Amounts receivable could be higher for 
US shareholders who have elected to retain the benefits of the old US/UK tax treaty. For further information relating to dividends and the UK taxation of dividends see pages 85-86.
2 Dividends expressed in US$ have been converted at the actual exchange rates used in the payment of dividends to US shareholders, except that the final dividend declared in respect of 2004, 
payable to US ADS holders on 5 May 2005, has been converted at the Noon Buying Rate on 4 March 2005 for convenience.
3 Restated following the adoption of UITF17 and UITF38, and the reclassification of transaction-related regulatory fees following recently issued SEC guidance (see ‘Accounting Basis’ on page 72).
4 The Group has restated its 2003 and 2002 US GAAP financial information to give effect to differences between UK and US GAAP concerning foreign exchange gains on cross currency interest rate swaps
and the capitalisation of certain costs related to internal use software. For further explanation see ‘Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), on 
page 74. The impact of the restatement on the US GAAP financial information in 2001 and 2000 was to increase net income by £1million and £3 million respectively, and to increase shareholders’ equity
by £6 million and £3 million respectively. OVERVIEW 
Reuters Group incorporates Reuters core financial business and Instinet Group,
a 62%-owned public subsidiary which operates an institutional broker and
INET®, the electronic market place. 
At Reuters we specialise in providing indispensable information tailored for
professionals in the financial services, media and corporate markets. We also
provide news and information direct to the consumer. We provide the content,
analytics, trading and collaboration tools needed by financial professionals and
news in the form of text, graphics, video and pictures, to media organisations
across the globe. Our trusted information drives decision-making around the
world, based on our reputation for speed, accuracy and independence. 
We provide tools to enable traders to perform fast and accurate analysis 
of financial data and to manage trading risk. Our electronic trading services
connect financial communities, helping them to gain access to the best prices
and to trade efficiently and cost effectively.
At 31 December 2004, we had approximately 14,500 staff in 91 countries,
including some 2,300 editorial staff in 196 bureaux serving 129 countries,
making Reuters the largest multimedia news agency. In addition, Instinet
Group had approximately 1,000 employees in ten countries. 
01 THE MARKETS WE SERVE 
Reuters serves the global financial and media markets. In 2004, these markets
continued to recover after a three year decline, with the rate of progress 
faster in the US than in other regions. Key performance indicators and market
drivers include industry headcount, trading volumes, regulation and levels 
of consolidation. 
Employment levels at our key customers increased in 2004 after significant
declines in 2002 and 2003. For example, in the US, the Securities Industry
Assocation recorded a 4% increase in industry headcount in 2004. However,
headcount recovery remains fragile, with more job losses announced in the
banking industry in the fourth quarter of 2004. Employment is not currently
predicted to return to the peak levels seen in 2001. We are making our
business less dependent on industry headcount as we align it more closely
with growth areas like electronic trading.
Growth in electronic trading is being driven by lower spreads in traditional
cash equities markets and a quest for greater efficiency as firms seek to grow
their trading platforms to handle an ever-increasing number of trades whilst
employing fewer people. On the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), programme
trading rose from 41% of total trading volume at the beginning of the year to
54% by the end of 2004. 
A notable driver in our market place is increased regulation. Proposed
Regulation NMS in the United States and the Markets in Financial Instruments
Directive (MiFiD) in Europe are likely to change the way many instruments are
traded. Worldwide, markets are undergoing greater levels of regulatory scrutiny
and we are positioned to benefit with our increased focus on our risk business
and enterprise data products as our customers spend more on compliance. 
Concentration of trading liquidity and increased regulation are in turn 
driving the trend towards consolidation. We see a polarising market, where 
big customers are getting bigger but at the same time, smaller specialised
boutiques are also thriving. This applies both to banks and brokers on 
the sell side, and to investment management firms on the buy side. 
Our challenge is to supply the right products at the right price for each 
of these categories of customer.
02 STRATEGY
Reuters goal is to be the information company our customers value most, 
by offering indispensable content, innovative trading services and great
customer service. 
There are three stages to achieve this goal:
• First, complete and realise the benefits of Fast Forward, our business
transformation programme – ‘Fix it’
• Second, complete the migration of our customers to our latest products,
expand into areas of our market closely related to our current business, 
and make our business more resilient – ‘Strengthen it’
• Third, reposition our business over the longer term to take advantage of the
structural changes and new opportunities in the global markets – ‘Grow it’.
‘Fix it’ through Fast Forward
The Fast Forward programme aims to transform Reuters into a more
competitive, simpler, more customer service-driven and more efficient
organisation. We have now completed two-thirds of the Fast Forward
programme and have made real progress in each of these areas. 
Our drive to become more competitive delivered a successful defence of 
our foreign exchange information and trading franchise, where the number 
of user positions grew in 2004 for the first time in seven years, despite
increased competition.
To simplify the way we do business, we have made major changes to our
product line and cut the number of products being actively sold by two-thirds,
on the way to our target of 50 desktop financial information products. 
We also continued to clear out our portfolio, and have now divested over 
80 holdings. The most significant of these in 2004 was the sale of the majority
of our stake in TIBCO Software Inc. (TSI). 
To make Reuters more efficient, we exceeded our cost savings targets. At the
end of 2004, we had cumulative savings of £234 million towards our goal of
£440 million by the end of 2006.
We conduct an annual survey of 12,000 customers to measure their satisfaction
with our products and service. Customer satisfaction continued to increase in
2004, following the trend from 2003, with users of the latest versions of our
products ranking us more highly than users of our older products. However, 
a power disruption at our UK Docklands data centre in October caused a
setback in the fourth quarter, and we immediately took corrective action to
improve data centre resilience. 
‘Strengthen it’ – expand into related business areas and improve 
service resilience
We will continue to invest in 2005 to make service resilience a competitive
advantage by providing world-class service continuity and back-up. Customers
are investing in building greater resilience in their own systems, and are
encouraged to see Reuters undertake similar initiatives. 
We are continuing to work with our customers to complete the migration from
legacy products such as the 2000 and 3000 series to our latest products.
In November, we announced the development of new transactions services 
for fixed income and equities which build on our successful foreign exchange
trading franchise and position us to benefit from the rapid growth in electronic
trading. On 21 February 2005 we launched Reuters Trading for Fixed Income
with tradeable prices from six banks. Being at the centre of our customers’
trading activities will not only make us more competitive, but also allow us to
benefit from growth in trading volumes. 
Building on the content and expertise we gained through our acquisition of
Multex in 2003, we have strengthened our product offer for the buy side and
we are increasing our penetration of investment management firms.
Our pending acquisition of Moneyline Telerate (Telerate) would strengthen 
our fixed income content and end user community. For more details, see the
following page.
We are also strengthening our Enterprise Information Products and Risk
Management software offerings, to capitalise on increases in compliance spend.
‘Grow it’ – capitalise on structural changes in global markets
The third element of our strategy involves making inroads into growth areas in
the financial markets, transforming our media business from a largely wholesale
model to include direct-to-consumer initiatives and exploring opportunities in
other markets. 
China, we believe, is poised for significant financial markets growth. Reuters 
has operated in China for almost 150 years, and in 2004 we sought to 
build on our established position so that we can participate in future growth.
We reached an agreement with the China Foreign Exchange Trading System
(CFETS), the operator of China’s interbank foreign exchange system, to
provide an internet-based foreign exchange trading service. We also tapped
the growing market for risk management services, selling systems to five banks

  Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004   07
and signing an agreement to open a new financial risk research laboratory with
the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Widespread use of the internet is changing the way in which individuals access
information. With our trusted global news and information brand, we are well
positioned to build our consumer media offer. We have cut back distribution 
of our highly-respected financial news to other websites in order to draw more
visitors directly to our own sites. In 2004, this has contributed to a doubling in
the average number of unique visitors per month to 12 million and reinforced
the value of our content. 
We are taking advantage of the rapid adoption of new media technologies 
to deliver our content. In 2004, we launched a business information service 
on Vodafone’s UK mobile phone service and an interactive TV news channel 
in the US on Microsoft’s new Windows
®
XP Media Center, offering packaged
business, market and breaking world news in streaming video format. 
Pending acquisition of Telerate
On 20 December 2004, we entered into agreements to acquire substantially 
all of the business of Telerate as well as a subsidiary of QUICK Corp. (Quick)
that serves as the exclusive distributor of Telerate products in Japan. Based in
New York, Telerate is a global provider of benchmark content for the capital
markets primarily focused on money markets, fixed income, foreign exchange
and over-the-counter derivatives, and providing services to more than 3,500
customers with more than 30,000 user accesses in 85 countries and territories
around the world. With the acquisition of Telerate, we would extend our
presence among core financial customers, including fixed income, buy side
firms and regional dealers. The acquisition is expected to provide further
impetus to our goal to be the best-in-class provider of financial content,
electronic transactions and distribution to market participants, and to strengthen
our recently-announced effort to add trading capabilities to Reuters desktops,
especially in the fixed income markets, where the substantial Telerate client
base would benefit our growing trading community. We are uniquely placed 
to achieve cost synergies from the acquisition because Telerate’s information
distribution infrastructure already operates on our systems. Both transactions
are anticipated to complete in mid-2005, subject to regulatory approvals for
the Telerate acquisition and other customary conditions. For more information,
see pages 20 and 89.
03 OUR MARKETS DRIVE OUR ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE  
At Reuters, we operate our business through our four Customer Segments,
which are closely aligned with the user communities they serve.
• Sales & Trading focuses on salespeople and traders who deal in the 
foreign exchange, fixed income, equities, commodities and energy and
related markets. 
• Research & Asset Management focuses on supporting portfolio managers,
wealth managers, brokers, investment bankers and research analysts who make
complex financial decisions outside the core sales and trading environment.  
• Enterprise targets the complete business enterprise, as distinct from the 
end-user.
• Media focuses on the needs of the world’s newspapers, television and cable
networks, radio stations, websites and consumers. It is also working to create
a new avenue of growth in direct-to-consumer services, principally through
the reuters.com family of websites.
Customer Segment businesses also include the management of recoveries,
which arise when Reuters recharges costs, primarily exchange fees and
communication costs, to customers. The revenues received from customers
almost exactly match the exchange fees and communications costs incurred
within the Channel.
During 2005, the Segments will evolve into business divisions with full profit
and loss responsibility.
The software development teams who build and support our products and
infrastructure are being integrated with the business divisions, to bring developers
closer to customers and improve our responsiveness to consumer needs.
Within Development, product development teams develop, build and maintain
our products and delivery platforms, driven by customer requirements.
The infrastructure development team provides Reuters with its shared
infrastructure design to provide scale efficiencies and compliance with standards
and the Chief Technology Office drives standards and technical coherence in 
our technical architecture and brings innovation into the business through
technology leadership. 
Geographic Sales and Service Channel
We serve our customers through a global Sales and Service Channel split into
geographic regions: the Americas, Asia, and Europe, Middle East and Africa.
In addition our Focus Group Accounts team serves our largest customers with
truly global relationship management. Locally, members of our sales and
service teams work with customers to build relationships and to identify the
correct products to meet customer needs. Through regular training visits, our
customer training staff work with end-users to ensure they get full value from
our products. We also offer a help desk service and pro-active telephone
support out of three regional support hubs, one based in each time zone.
The Channel supplies feedback to the Customer Segments on how products are
performing and how they could be enhanced to meet future customer needs.
During 2005 the Operations group, which manages our data centres, central
systems and distribution networks, will be integrated into the Sales and Service
Channel to bring our customer service and support activities under a single
unified management team. We believe this and other initiatives will improve
the service we offer to customers across the world.
Revenues for the three years to 31 December 2004 are analysed by segment
on pages 18-19 of the Operating and Financial Review and by geography 
and by segment on pages 44-45 in note 1 on the consolidated profit and 
loss account.
Communications networks
We distribute our products using multiple communications networks. During
2004, we continued to migrate our main products on to global IP-based
networks, principally provided by Radianz Limited (Radianz), in order to deliver 
greater resilience, capability and flexibility, achieved through the use of
industry standards.
We have major technical centres in the Asian, European and American time
zones, supported by many smaller local data centres. The data centres are
linked by communications services provided principally by Radianz and SAVVIS
Communications Corporation (Savvis), using a range of communications
technologies. Communications between data centres and subscribers are
provided by Radianz in 20 countries and by Reuters directly or by third 
parties elsewhere. 
Radianz was formed in 2000 to develop a secure extranet network for use 
by the financial services industry, as a joint venture between Reuters and 
the Equant Group BV (Equant). Radianz connects all categories of market
participants: brokers, institutions, exchanges, custodians, and clearing and
settlement houses. For further information regarding Radianz and our
relationship with Radianz, see ‘Related party transactions and material
contracts  – Radianz’ on page 87. In November 2004, we purchased Equant’s
stake in Radianz with a view to selling Radianz to BT Group PLC (BT). See
‘Pending transactions – Proposed disposal of Radianz’ on page 10.
The services agreements with Radianz and with Savvis are important to 
our ability to deliver products and services to customers. Although we take
reasonable steps with Radianz and Savvis to ensure continuity of service, any
failure or interruption of such systems could have a significant effect on our
business. See ‘Risk Factors’ on pages 23-25. Summaries of these network
services agreements are given on pages 87 and 89.
04 PRODUCTS
Millions of consumers see and hear news from Reuters in the world’s media
and over 300,000 financial professionals across the globe each day receive
market data, in-depth news, quotes, statistics and analytics on financial and
commodities markets from Reuters. We are the largest financial information
provider in the world. 
We collect financial information from an array of sources such as exchanges,
over-the-counter markets, research services and other contributors such as
energy and fixed income data providers, as well as from our own news,
research and data operations. Our data is available through various delivery
platforms such as workstations, datafeeds, internet and wireless solutions.
  COMPANY INFORMATION
continued
We offer systems to help our customers manage trade processing, financial
content and internal business processes more effectively throughout their
organisations.
Our customers have access to a trading community of around 18,000 foreign
exchange and money market traders globally, and can use Reuters large
equities order routing network to gain electronic access to a variety of brokers. 
Product families 
We group our products into ‘families’, each of which serves the needs of a
distinct set of customers. 
Financial desktop products
• Reuters Xtra family – targeted at the most sophisticated end-users within
sales, trading and portfolio management. It includes cross-asset class, cross-
geography information, advanced integrated analytics and trading capabilities.
• Reuters Trader family – targeted at sales staff and traders who do not need
the sophistication and full integration capability offered by the Reuters Xtra
family of products, including those who focus on domestic and regional
financial instruments. In 2004, we launched new browser-based Reuters
Trader products, and we are working with our customers to migrate them
from older products such as the 2000 and 3000 series. 
• Reuters Knowledge family – targeted at the research and advisory business
(including investment bankers and analysts), portfolio managers, and others
focused on company and industry-specific research. Reuters Knowledge
offers an integrated package of public and proprietary fundamental
information about companies along with basic access to markets information,
news and other content. 
• Reuters Wealth Manager family – targeted at private client advisors and 
retail brokers who require products that can be integrated closely with their
in-house systems. The Reuters Wealth Manager family includes portfolio
management tools and information on a wide range of managed funds. 
In 2004, our Lipper subsidiary strengthened its offering by acquiring Fitzrovia
International PLC, which analyses mutual fund fees and expenses.
Enterprise products
• Datafeeds – broad-ranging, in-depth data in machine-readable format – from
high-volume exchange data to deep company estimates and fundamental
data – which companies use to power mission-critical systems like
programme trading and portfolio management. 
• Market Data Systems – provides the enterprise with a range of applications,
tools and infrastructure components to manage financial content in real-time
across the customer trading environment with a high degree of scalability
and resilience.  
• Enterprise Information Products – feeds of reference data often used for
compliance purposes, including end-of-day and intra-day instrument prices,
corporate actions, price histories and terms and conditions. 
• Risk Management – provides the enterprise with a range of products to help
manage order flow, make trade decisions and control risk.
Media products
These products target our traditional publishing and broadcasting customers –
newspapers and magazines, news and information websites and TV channels –
with comprehensive, accurate and immediate broadcast news, video and
photographic coverage.
Our consumer products target business professionals, individual investors 
and world citizens with fast, accurate news and financial data, enabling them
to stay informed about world events, manage their financial portfolios and
perform better professionally. Advertising services is a relatively new business
offering advertising space in our consumer products, such as the reuters.com
network of websites. 
Factiva, our 50% owned joint venture with Dow Jones, provides a broad range
of global news and a deep historical archive of business information which
client organisations can integrate into their business applications and intranet
portals. Around 70% of Factiva’s revenue is derived from sources outside the
financial services sector. 
Customers
Customers generally pay for Reuters products and services in one of three
ways: subscription fees to cover accesses and maintenance fees for software
(recorded as recurring revenue); one-off software purchases (outright revenue);
and fees based on transaction volumes (usage revenue). In 2004, 92% of
Reuters revenue was recurring, 4% was outright and 4% usage. Our increasing
focus on transactions means that we anticipate a shift in the mix of subscription
and usage revenues over time. The numbers of accesses for Reuters at the end
of the last three years are shown below. During 2004, user accesses increased
for the first time in three years after dipping to 314,000 in March.

05 RESOURCES
Our business is built on three key resources: our brand, our people and our
content. Our ability to realise the potential of these assets determines the
extent to which we can achieve our strategic goals.
Brand
The starting point for growth is the Reuters brand and the relationship it 
has with our stakeholders. Financial and media professionals make critical
decisions every day with confidence because they trust the accuracy of the
information that they get from Reuters. Millions of consumers see and hear
news, information and pictures attributed to Reuters in the world’s media 
as we report on important events unfolding around the world. Reuters news
and information is trusted for its objectivity and authenticity because the
Reuters Trust Principles safeguard the integrity of everything that we do.
Financial institutions also rely upon Reuters to feed their financial applications
directly with market data so that they can keep pace with the significant
growth of programme trading, electronic pricing and risk management.
These traditional brand strengths provide the springboard for growth within
core markets as well as new sectors and new geographies. People increasingly
access information through a variety of new media channels. There is a growing
distrust in the accuracy of some sectors of the media and an increasing
scepticism in the independence of investment research. With our reputation 
as a trusted source, we have the opportunity to build and develop the Reuters
brand for individual people as well as businesses. We will focus particularly 
on growing in financial markets such as China and India, where the media
opportunity will be significant.
In all of these developments we will be giving the Reuters brand more impact,
making it more inspirational and using it more consistently. This will ensure that
the brand is playing its full part in the future vision of the Reuters business.
People
Our people are critical to the success of our business, notwithstanding the
reductions we have made over the last several years to our headcount, and 
we are committed to retaining and developing the talent we need. To do 
this effectively, we have remuneration, organisation and people development
systems and processes to ensure that we have the right people in the right
jobs, equipped with the necessary skills. We place a significant emphasis on
leadership and, in keeping with the Reuters Trust Principles, we have extensive
fair employment practices in place.
If we are to achieve the business transformation we have undertaken with 
Fast Forward, every part of the organisation must be aligned with our strategy.
Our objective-setting process for employees is fundamental to this alignment.
The CEO’s mission and goals form the starting point of this process, flowing
through the members of our Group Management Committee and then
translating into an appropriate set of objectives for each business unit and 
each employee. 
08 Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004
  Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004   09
We have created learning and development programmes to raise our
employees’ levels of product and market knowledge and ensure that they have 
access to the latest developments in their areas of specialism. We have a
process to review talent, organisational capability and succession planning 
for key positions. We also have a long-established relationship with the
University of Michigan for the development and delivery of leadership
development programmes.
We regularly undertake employee surveys to evaluate morale and to identify
any employee issues that need to be addressed. These surveys measure
opinion in a number of key areas, including leadership, customer orientation,
performance culture and career development. Despite the challenges of Fast
Forward, the survey showed an improvement in overall employee engagement
in 2004. The results are communicated to employees. We place a strong
emphasis on communicating with our employees and won a ‘Communicators
in Business’ award for excellence in employee communications during 2004.
We want to ensure that everyone in Reuters has a fair opportunity to contribute
to our business, and in 2004 we established a Global Diversity Advisory
Council, chaired by the CEO, to advise on diversity issues and to help drive
related initiatives. For additional information concerning our people, see
Employees on page 26.
Content
Content brings together all of Reuters news, data and other information. 
The role of our editorial group is to cover and edit the news to the highest
standards of accuracy and timeliness. Our journalists and photographers file
over two and a half million news items a year to customers in the form of text,
pictures, TV, video and graphics and we publish news in 18 languages. Our 
data group is responsible for acquiring, producing, packaging and delivering
an extensive range of content, including research, market data and other
information. Our coverage includes data from over 300 exchanges, more than
1.2 million bonds, 250,000 foreign exchange and money market instruments
and award-winning commodities and energy content. This is further
complemented by data from over 4,000 contributors. In addition, our
fundamentals and estimates data is recognised as a leading source of high
quality financial information covering over 35,000 companies worldwide. 
In 2004, we opened a new content facility in Bangalore, India, where over 
500 highly-skilled data staff have already taken on the task of managing some
of our content and are developing our new investments in data. The investment
in our Bangalore data management operation is achieving operational
efficiencies in line with our Fast Forward objectives. Additional activities will be
migrating to Bangalore in 2005 as we build on our initial success and continue
our investment in new content to meet our customers’ needs. 
06 INSTINET GROUP
Our subsidiary, Instinet Group, is the largest global electronic agency securities
broker and has been providing investors with electronic trading solutions 
and execution services for more than 30 years. Instinet Group operates two
major businesses: Instinet, the institutional broker, and INET, the electronic
market place.
Instinet Group completed an initial public offering in May 2001 and its
common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market (symbol INGP.O). As a
result of the initial public offering, exercise of stock options, and acquisitions 
in which Instinet Group shares were used as consideration, the largest of which
was the purchase of Island ECN (Island) in 2002, our shareholding of Instinet
Group is approximately 62%.
Instinet is a global electronic agency securities broker that provides
sophisticated electronic trading solutions and execution services to enable
buyers and sellers worldwide to trade securities directly and anonymously 
with each other. Instinet also gives customers the opportunity to use its sales-
trading expertise and sophisticated technology tools to interact with global
securities markets, improve their trading and investment performance and
lower their overall trading costs. Through Instinet’s electronic platforms,
customers can access other US trading venues, including NASDAQ and NYSE,
and almost 30 securities markets throughout the world, including stock
exchanges in Frankfurt, Hong Kong, London, Paris, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto 
and Zürich. Instinet’s customers primarily consist of institutional investors, such
as mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies and hedge funds. INET 
is an electronic communications network (ECN) that provides execution and
routing services to US broker-dealer customers and enables buyers and sellers
to trade securities directly and anonymously with each other. INET represents
the consolidation of the order flow of the former Instinet ECN and former
Island ECN, providing its US broker-dealer customers one of the largest
liquidity pools in NASDAQ-listed securities. 
In November 2004, we announced that we would consider opportunities to
extract value from our holding in Instinet Group. Reuters and Instinet Group
are considering strategic alternatives, including a possible sale, merger or
other business combination or corporate transaction. There can be no assurance
that any transaction will be effected at all (for any particular value) or in any
specific time period. See ‘Risk Factors – Reuters Group may not be able to
realise the anticipated benefits of existing or future acquisitions or disposals’
on page 24.
07 COMPETITORS 
We face significant competition in all the market sectors and geographical
areas in which we operate. We actively monitor the competitive landscape 
in order to be able to respond to market developments.
Bloomberg, Thomson Financial (a division of The Thomson Corporation),
Telerate, Quick, Telekurs, IDC, Dow Jones and Factset, plus a number of
smaller local and regional competitors, offer information products for the
financial markets. Several exchanges compete with our datafeed business 
by providing low-latency real time feeds of their data direct to banks and
financial institutions.
Our Lipper funds information business competes with Morningstar, the
Micropal unit of Standard & Poor’s, a division of the McGraw-Hill Companies,
Value Line and The Thomson Corporation’s CDA Weisenberger.
Our foreign exchange spot dealing services compete with voice brokers and
with the Electronic Broking Service and Bloomberg, which have formed an
alliance in this area. 
Competitors in the supply of risk products and market data systems or related
components include Algorithmics, Murex, Summit Systems, Sungard Data
Systems, IBM, TSI, GL TRADE and a large number of smaller firms.
Our main competitors in the supply of news to the media are Associated Press,
Agence France Presse, Dow Jones and Bloomberg News. 
Instinet Group competes with the following, among others: market makers 
and other traditional broker-dealers acting as agent or principal; traditional and
electronic trading methods in use on US and international exchanges, including
NYSE specialists and the electronic matching systems of international exchanges;
the trading platform for the NASDAQ market.  
08 GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
We are regulated by several bodies in the various jurisdictions in which 
we operate:
The UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) under the Financial Services and
Markets Acts 2000 regulates Reuters Limited, our principal operating company,
as a service company. Reuters Transaction Services Limited (RTSL), through
which Dealing 3000 Spot, Forwards, FX Options, Matching for Interest Rates
and our new suite of next generation transaction products such as Reuters
Trading for Fixed Income are operated, is subject to regulation by the FSA
equivalent to that applied to broking participants in the London market. 
In addition, from 1 April 2004 RTSL has been classified by the FSA as an
Alternative Trading System (ATS). RTSL provides services throughout the
European Economic Area (EEA) in accordance with the provisions of the EU
Investment Services Directive. RTSL’s operations in Singapore and Hong Kong
are approved and subject to oversight by the Monetary Authority of Singapore
and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, respectively. In 2004 RTSL was
granted an Australian Market Licence by the Australian Securities and
Investments Commission. 
Reuters Global Routing Services Limited (RGRS UK), is the Group’s other
authorised firm in the UK. It is responsible for an order routing and indications
of interest network. Under the passporting provisions of the ISD, RGRS UK may
provide its services across the EEA. The RGRS UK order routing network is also
offered in the US through Reuters Global Routing Services (US) LLC (RGRS US)
where it is subject to regulation by the SEC and the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD). Under the passporting provisions of the EU
Investment Services Directive, RGRS UK may provide its services across the EEA
  and, in addition, introduce UK and EU clients directly to our subsidiary, 
Bridge Trading Company (Bridge Trading) in the US. For information regarding 
the pending sale of Bridge Trading to Instinet Group, see ‘Pending
Transactions’, below.
In order to comply with anti-money laundering regulations and to reduce the
opportunity for Reuters trading products to be used as a conduit for money
laundering operations, all regulated firms have put in place appropriate ‘know
your customer’ systems and controls. 
As registered broker-dealers, members of self-regulatory organisations in the
US and other countries in which they operate and, in the case of the Instinet
ATSs and the INET ATS, as operators of electronic communications networks
and/or alternative trading systems in the US, Instinet Group, Bridge Trading
and RGRS US are subject to regulation under the US securities laws and their
equivalents in other countries, including but not limited to net capital
requirements, and to possible increased levels of regulation in the future.
In December 2001, Island ECN submitted to the SEC an application in draft
form for registration as a national securities exchange. INET submitted a new
draft application to the SEC for registration as a national securities exchange 
in May 2004 and continues to work with the SEC towards the filing of a formal
application. See ‘Related party transactions and material contracts – Instinet
Group – Corporate Agreement’ on page 89 and ‘Risk Factors – Changes in 
the regulatory environment could have an adverse effect on Instinet Group’s
business’ on page 24. 
09 PENDING TRANSACTIONS
For information about the pending acquisition of Telerate, see page 7.
Proposed disposal of Radianz
Initially, Radianz was a joint venture with Equant, in which Reuters owned 51% 
of the voting shares and Equant owned 49%. However, through shareholders’
agreements, Reuters shared effective control with Equant and therefore did
not consolidate Radianz as a subsidiary for accounting purposes. 
On 16 November 2004, Reuters purchased Equant’s entire stake in Radianz 
for £60 million (US$110 million) in cash, together with the release of future
funding obligations and, as a result, all joint venture arrangements came to an
end. Reuters also announced that exclusive discussions were taking place with
BT to secure a long-term agreement for the provision of network services,
involving the sale of Radianz to BT. Both the commercial arrangements and the
sale are subject to due diligence, regulatory approvals and the negotiation of
definitive agreements. These transactions are expected to complete during the
first half of 2005. For more information, see ‘Related party transactions and
material contracts – Radianz’ on page 87.
Pending disposal of Bridge Trading
On 28 February 2005 Reuters entered into an agreement to sell Bridge
Trading, its soft dollar institutional broker, to Instinet Group. Reuters acquired
Bridge Trading in 2001 as part of its acquisition of certain businesses and
assets of Bridge Information Systems (Bridge). This sale combines the Reuters
Group’s equity brokerage business into one unit and is consistent with the Fast
Forward strategy of divesting non-core assets. The transaction is expected to
complete by the end of April 2005, subject to approval from the NASD and
other customary conditions. For more information, see ‘Related party
transactions and material contracts – Instinet Group – sale of Bridge Trading’ 
on page 88.
10 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS)
Reuters Group will be required to comply with IFRS with effect from 
1 January 2005. An evaluation of the impact on the financial statements of
Reuters Group, and on its financial processes and systems, has been made. 
A programme of work is underway to enable the preparation of financial
statements, which comply with IFRS, for the year ended 31 December 2004, 
as well as from 1 January 2005 onwards. For more information, see 
pages 22-23.

  OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004   11
REVIEW OF YEAR END RESULTS
Under US law, all statements other than statements of historical fact included
in this review are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements within
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Certain important factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in such forward-
looking statements are described under Section 9 ‘Risk Factors’ on pages
23-25 as well as elsewhere in this review. All written and oral forward-looking
statements made on or after the date of this report and attributable to Reuters
are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors.
01 KEY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES
Reuters Group measures its performance by reference to revenue and profit,
operating margin, earnings per share (EPS) and cash flow.
To supplement these UK GAAP measures, Reuters undertakes further analysis
to break them out into their component parts, which results in the creation of
certain non-GAAP measures. The rationale for this analysis is outlined below
and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used to UK GAAP are included
within the review of results. These measures are used by management to
assess the performance of the business and should be seen as complementary
to, rather than replacements for, reported statutory results.
Underlying results
Period-on-period change in Reuters is measured both in overall terms (i.e.
actual reported results under UK GAAP) and in underlying terms. Underlying
change is calculated by excluding the impact of currency fluctuations and the
results of acquisitions and disposals.
The impact of currency fluctuations is excluded from underlying results to
enable period-on-period comparison of the operating results of Reuters on 
a like-for-like basis. Variations in currency exchange rates impact the results
because Reuters generates revenues and incurs costs in currencies other than
its reporting currency. Year-on-year, currency exchange rate movements will
influence the reported numbers to a greater or lesser extent, and therefore
they are discussed separately from the underlying results to make clear their
impact on the overall growth or decline in operations. Underlying results are
calculated by restating the prior periods’ results using the current period’s
exchange rates. This also reflects the variables over which management has
control, as business units do not manage currency exposure, and business unit
operating performance is managed against targets set on a constant currency
basis. Currency exposure is described in Section 6 ‘Treasury Policies, Financing
and Foreign Exchange’ on pages 21-22.
The impact of acquisitions and disposals is also excluded from underlying
results to enable period-on-period comparison of the operating results of
Reuters on a like-for-like basis. Underlying results are calculated by excluding
the results of entities acquired or disposed of during either the current or prior
period from the results of each period under review. Underlying results reflect
the operating results of the ongoing elements of each business unit, and
measure the performance of management against variables over which they
have control, without the year-on-year impact of a step change in revenue 
and costs that can result from acquisition or disposal activity.
Underlying figures also allow investors to compare the reported Reuters results
with the forward-looking guidance issued by Reuters to the investor community.
Because Reuters is not able to forecast currency movements or the exact
timing and impact of acquisition and disposal activity, it communicates its
revenue guidance to investors on an underlying basis. Therefore, providing the
underlying results in addition to the actual reported results assists investors in
making their own assessment of Reuters performance against the guidance
given by management.
Exclusion of restructuring charges
Reuters results are reviewed before and after the impact of Reuters business
transformation plan, which includes the Fast Forward programme. Under the
Fast Forward programme, Reuters is incurring restructuring costs relating
primarily to headcount reduction and rationalisation of the company’s property
portfolio. Fast Forward is a three-year programme implemented to accelerate
and expand on Reuters five-year business transformation plan which was
launched in 2001; the programme is scheduled to complete in 2005 as
originally envisaged.
The Fast Forward programme is centrally managed, and its performance
against targets is evaluated separately from the normal day-to-day business 
of Reuters. 
As the restructuring charges are incurred as part of centrally managed
programmes of activity, they do not form part of Reuters ongoing business.
Restructuring charges are therefore excluded from certain profit and margin
measures, so as to provide a more detailed analysis and understanding of the
ongoing business. Restructuring charges are considered exceptional under UK
GAAP and are separately identified in note 2 on the consolidated profit and
loss account, but because the charges are being incurred over more than two
years they are considered ‘recurring’. However, because of their time-limited
and defined nature, Reuters believes presenting certain profit measures both
including and excluding such charges gives investors a more detailed insight
into the performance of management and the business. In addition, Reuters
management uses both measures to assess the performance of management
and the business.
Exclusion of amortisation of goodwill and other intangibles, 
impairments and disposals
For certain cost, profit, margin and earnings per share measures, Reuters
analyses its results both before and after the impact of restructuring,
amortisation of goodwill and other intangibles, impairments and disposals. 
The rationale for isolating restructuring charges is explained above. Reuters
also isolates the impact of income and charges in respect of its investments.
These charges relate to goodwill and other intangibles, amortisation and
impairments of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures and amounts 
written off investments.
Income and charges from investments relate to pre-tax profits and losses 
on disposal of subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures and investments. The 
non-GAAP EPS measure also eliminates the earnings impact of non-recurring
tax charges and credits related to impairments, reorganisations and disposals.
Such charges and income arise from corporate acquisition and disposal activity,
rather than from the ongoing operations of the business units. These are
analysed and reviewed separately from ongoing operations, as this is
consistent with the manner in which Reuters sets internal targets, evaluates its
business units and issues guidance to the investor community. Acquisition and
disposal activity does not form part of the operations controlled by business
unit management, and decisions around such activity are usually determined
centrally.
Presenting earnings before amortisation of goodwill and other intangibles,
impairments and disposals and the above non-recurring tax items also helps
investors measure performance in relation to the Group’s dividend policy. In
2001, Reuters Group defined the long-term goal of its dividend policy to be 
a dividend cover of at least two times, based on Reuters earnings before
amortisation of goodwill and other intangibles, impairments and disposals.
Free cash flow
Reuters free cash flow is used as a performance measure and to assess the
extent of the Group’s dividend cover from a cash perspective. Free cash flow 
is intended to measure all Reuters cash movements other than those which are
both discretionary in nature and unrelated to ongoing operating activities such
as purchases of shares by the Employee Share Option Trusts (ESOTs), loans to
associates and dividends paid by the Group. Whilst Reuters believes that free
cash flow is an important performance measure in respect of its cash flows, it 
is not used in isolation, but rather in conjunction with other cash flow measures
as presented in the financial statements. 02 FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Reuters Group revenue decline slowed significantly during 2004
• Reuters Group revenue in 2004 was £2,885 million, falling 11% compared 
to 2003, driven in large part by US dollar depreciation and continued difficult
trading conditions.
• Reuters revenue was £2,361 million, down 11% of which 5 percentage points
were due to the impact of currency, primarily US dollar weakness. Underlying
revenue decline was 5% in 2004.
• Instinet Group revenue was £530 million, 8% lower than 2003 but slightly higher
if adjusted to reflect the negative impact of the weaker US dollar on revenue.
Reuters Group operating profit increased by 51%
• Reuters Group operating profit in 2004 was £197 million compared to £130
million in 2003, representing a margin of 6.8% compared with 4.0% in 2003.
• In Reuters, £234 million of cumulative Fast Forward savings helped to deliver an
operating profit (before amortisation of goodwill and intangibles, impairments
and restructuring) of £357 million, with a margin of 15.1%. Reuters took a
restructuring charge of £120 million in 2004, which along with other non-trading
costs reduced operating profit to £168 million at a margin of 7.1%.
• Instinet Group operating costs continued to fall at a faster rate than revenue,
driven by a 17% reduction in headcount. As a result, operating profit was
£29 million compared to an operating loss of £48 million in 2003.
Reuters Group profit before taxation increased by £381 million
• Reuters Group profit before taxation was £437 million in 2004 compared to
£56 million in 2003.
• Reuters profit before taxation increased by £279 million, driven mainly by
profits on disposals, which included the majority of Reuters stake in TSI as
well as its holdings in GL TRADE, Riskmetrics, TowerGroup, Yankee Group
Research Inc. (Yankee) and ORT SAS Group (ORT).
• Instinet Group profit before taxation was £56 million in 2004 compared to
a loss of £46 million in 2003, mainly driven by a return to operating profit

2004 RESULTS COMPARED WITH 2003
Reuters Group
Revenue
Reuters Group revenue in 2004 was £2,885 million, falling 11% compared to
2003, driven largely by US dollar depreciation which had an adverse impact on
both Reuters and Instinet Group revenue.
Operating costs
As a consequence of declining revenues over the past three years, actions
have been taken at both Reuters and Instinet Group to reduce the operating
cost base. Cost savings were primarily driven by greater cost discipline across
all functions including a reduction in staff numbers of 7% at Reuters and 
17% at Instinet Group. 2004 Reuters Group restructuring costs reduced by 
£50 million to £128 million. In addition, impairment charges and goodwill
amortisation dropped from £121 million to £76 million due to the decision to
dispose of certain non-core subsidiaries in 2004 and impairments taken in
2003. As a result, Reuters Group operating costs were £2,688 million in 2004,
a reduction of 13% compared to 2003.
Operating profit and margin
Reuters Group operating profit in 2004 was £197 million, an increase of 51%
compared to 2003. This improvement was primarily driven by a return to
operating profit by Instinet Group, where an operating loss of £48 million 
in 2003 was turned into an operating profit of £29 million in 2004.
Reuters Group operating margin was 6.8% in 2004, compared to 4.0% in 2003.
The improvement was primarily driven by a reduction in other non-trading
operating costs.
Non-operating income/(costs)
Reuters Group share of affiliates’ losses of £28 million in 2003 was turned 
into a profit of £6 million in 2004. This reflected the Reuters Group portfolio
rationalisation programme and the improvement in performance at Radianz.
Lower restructuring and impairment charges within the affiliates compared to
2003 were also significant drivers.
Reuters Group net interest charge reduced from £29 million in 2003 to 
£4 million in 2004, due to the movement from net debt in 2003 to net funds 
in 2004. This was primarily driven by the portfolio rationalisation and reduced
capital expenditure.
Amortisation/impairment of affiliates intangibles and investments have
decreased from £19 million in 2003 to £5 million in 2004. Charges in 2004
included a £3 million impairment charge relating to Radianz.
Reuters Group profits on disposals were £243 million in 2004 compared to 
£2 million in 2003. The disposals included the majority of Reuters stake in TSI
as well as its holdings in GL TRADE, Riskmetrics, TowerGroup, Yankee and ORT.
Instinet Group disposed of its stakes in Euronext, the London Stock Exchange
and Archipelago.
Profit before taxation
Reuters Group reported a profit before taxation of £437 million in 2004
compared to £56 million in 2003, comprising a £381 million profit in Reuters
and a £56 million profit in Instinet Group. The improvement was primarily
driven by a return to operating profit in Instinet Group and profits on disposals
generated by the portfolio rationalisation programme in Reuters.
  Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004   15
Taxation charge
Reuters Group taxation charge for 2004 was £73 million, up from £22 million in
2003, reflecting the higher level of profit before taxation at Reuters and Instinet
Group’s return to profitability. The rate of increase in taxation was lower than
the growth in profitability due to the lower level of taxation payable on asset
disposals (£9 million charge). A reconciliation of the actual taxation charge to the
taxation charge expected by applying the standard 30% UK rate of corporation
tax to the reported profits is provided in note 4 on the consolidated profit and
loss account.
EPS
Reuters Group recorded basic earnings per share of 25.1 pence in 2004 as
compared to 3.6 pence per share in 2003. This follows the higher level of
Group profit after taxation of £364 million (2003: £34 million).

Reuters operating costs were £2,193 million in 2004, a decrease of 12% from
2003, or 5% on an underlying basis. Costs reduced as Reuters delivered a further
£159 million of Fast Forward savings in 2004. Currency movements, particularly
the weak US dollar, contributed £113 million of the decline. Operating costs,
excluding restructuring charges, amortisation of goodwill and other intangibles
and goodwill impairment, reduced by 11%.
Amortisation charges of £55 million in 2004 were lower than in 2003, principally
due to the disposals of TowerGroup, Yankee and ORT. There was a £14 million
charge related to Bridge Trading for the impairment of subsidiaries in 2004
(2003: £7 million).

Reuters operating profit of £168 million was down 5% against 2003. Cost

As a result, Reuters operating margin was 7.1% in 2004 compared to 6.7% 
in 2003.

Profit before taxation 381 102 26
Reuters share of income from affiliates and investments was £5 million in 2004.
This was a £33 million improvement on the £28 million operating loss reported
in 2003. The most important contributor to this turnaround was Radianz, where
losses fell from £27 million in 2003 to £6 million in 2004. Other factors were a
profit of £4 million from Factiva (2003: £4 million), a profit of £3 million from
TSI (2003: £10 million loss) and a profit of £2 million from GL TRADE (2003: 
£5 million profit), which was sold during the year. Other associates contributed
a profit of £2 million in aggregate (2003: £nil).
Reuters total amortisation and impairment of affiliate intangibles and
investments was £5 million. The reduction from prior years largely reflects 
the disposal of companies from Reuters portfolio.
Profit on disposals at Reuters totalled £223 million. As part of the Fast 
Forward programme, the portfolio of companies continues to be scaled back.
During 2004, Reuters sold its holdings in a number of companies including
TowerGroup, Yankee, ORT, GL TRADE and Riskmetrics and significantly
reduced its stake in TSI. 
Reuters net interest expense was £10 million in 2004. The reduction from 
prior years primarily relates to lower net debt as a result of proceeds from the
rationalisation of the portfolio of companies. 
In 2004, Reuters profit before taxation was £381 million, up from £102 million
in 2003. This growth was primarily driven by a £220 million increase in profits
from asset disposals, a £33 million improvement in affiliate and investment
income, lower net interest charges (£24 million) and reductions in amortisation
and impairment charges (£12 million).
EPS
Reuters recorded basic earnings per share of 23.5 pence in 2004, compared to
5.5 pence in 2003. This follows the higher level of Reuters profit after taxation
of £329 million (2003: £77 million).

16 Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004
Reuters Group
Reuters Group had net funds of £326 million as at 31 December 2004 
(2003: net debt of £77 million) consisting of net funds in Instinet Group of
£495 million (a significant portion of which is required to be held for regulatory
capital and/or business purposes) and net debt in Reuters of £169 million.
Reuters Group net cash inflow from operating activities was £253 million
compared to £429 million in 2003. This difference was mainly due to working
capital movements arising from a decrease in creditors due to a reduction in
operating costs at Reuters of 12%, a reduction in provisions, and movements 
in counterparty debtors and creditors in Instinet Group. Additionally, Reuters
experienced an increase in debtors of £18 million relating to an interim
funding payment in connection with the pending acquisition of Telerate 
(see ‘Related party transactions and material contracts – Other material
contracts – Telerate acquisition agreement’ on page 89). 
Reuters
Reuters net debt position as at 31 December 2004 was £169 million, compared
to £610 million as at 31 December 2003. The movement of £441 million was
primarily due to net cash proceeds from disposals of £434 million, with the
largest contributor being the sale of a majority of the holding in TSI. The net
debt position was also improved by: reduced capital expenditure due to a
reduction in subscriber equipment spend and the phasing of some major
project expenditure; cash inflows from property disposals in connection with the
relocation of Reuters London operations to Canary Wharf; cash inflows from
property sale and leaseback transactions in the US; lower interest payments
due to the reduction in net debt; and reduced taxation payments. These cash
flows offset the reduction in net cash inflow from operating activities and cash
payments for acquisitions of £78 million, with the largest contributor being the
purchase of the remaining 49% of Radianz.
Instinet Group
Instinet Group’s net funds position reduced by £38 million from £533 million 
as at 31 December 2003 to £495 million as at 31 December 2004. This
movement was driven by net cash outflows from operating activities, increased
capital expenditure and increased taxation payments offset by proceeds from
the disposal of fixed asset investments.
Reuters free cash flow
Reuters generated free cash flow of £211 million in 2004 (2003: £197 million),
providing funds of 1.5 times the dividend of £140 million. The interim funding
payment represents payments made to Telerate in respect of the planned
acquisition (see ‘Telerate Acquisition Agreement’ on page 89). A reconciliation
of net cash inflow from operating activities to free cash flow is shown below:

Instinet Group’s revenue was £530 million in 2004, 8% lower than 2003,
reflecting improved trading performance offset by the negative impact of a
weaker US dollar. Revenue rose in the fourth quarter of 2004, both at Instinet,
the institutional broker, and at INET, the electronic market place, reflecting
higher equity market volumes.
Operating costs continued to fall, driven by a 17% reduction in headcount to
around 1,000 people at year end.
In 2004, restructuring charges totalled £8 million, down from £44 million 
in the prior year. Amortisation and impairment of subsidiaries goodwill was 
£7 million, compared to £25 million in 2003. The higher 2003 charge primarily
reflected impairment charges taken against Island ECN technology assets.
Instinet Group’s 2004 operating profit was £29 million, compared to a loss of 
£48 million in 2003. This reflects strong cost control ensuring that efficiency
gains exceeded the decline in revenues. The operating margin at Instinet
Group was 5.4% in 2004 and represents an improvement over 2003.

Instinet Group reported £1 million of income from affiliates and investments
(2003: £nil). This relates to dividends received from the London Stock Exchange.
Net interest income was £6 million in 2004, compared to income of £5 million 
in 2003, due to higher US dollar interest rates in the second half of 2004.
Instinet Group reported no amortisation or impairment of affiliate intangibles
and investments in 2004 (2003: £2 million). The 2003 results contained
impairment charges relating to Tradeware and Instinet Group Exchange, both
of which were written down in 2003 to nil carrying value.
Instinet Group reported £20 million of profit on disposals in 2004 compared to
a £1 million loss in 2003. The 2004 sales are of stakes in Euronext, the London
Stock Exchange and Archipelago. 
Instinet Group’s profit before taxation was £56 million in 2004, compared to 
a loss of £46 million in 2003. This movement is largely due to improvements 
in operating profit combined with higher profit from disposals.

2003 RESULTS COMPARED WITH 2002
Reuters Group
Revenue
Reuters Group revenue declined by 10% in 2003 to £3,235 million.
Operating costs
Reuters Group operating costs in 2003 were £3,105 million, a reduction of 17%
over 2002. This was the result of actions taken at both Reuters and Instinet
Group in 2003 to reduce the operating cost base. Impairment and goodwill
amortisation also fell from £315 million in 2002 to £121 million in 2003.
Operating profit and margin
Reuters Group operating loss of £142 million in 2002 was converted to a 
£130 million profit in 2003. Reuters Group operating margin was 4.0% in 2003. 
Profit before taxation
Reuters Group share of affiliates’ losses decreased from £62 million in 2002 to
£28 million in 2003. The main driver of this was a £31 million improvement in
TSI, due to stronger cost control, minimal restructuring charges compared to
2002 and a £2 million gain on investments compared to a £4 million loss in
2002. The other key affiliates, Radianz and Factiva, contributed a broadly similar
performance in 2003 as in 2002.
The net interest charge increased from £20 million in 2002 to £29 million in
2003. This was partly due to the Multex acquisition and also to a £4 million
reduction in the interest receivable by affiliates due to the falling value of 
US dollar interest earnings. Included in the interest charge was a write-off 
of front-end fees of £4 million attached to Reuters syndicated loan facility.
Impairment charges and net disposal losses decreased from £109 million in
2002 to £10 million in 2003. Losses in 2003 included a £17 million provision 
in respect of the disposal of two London-based properties as part of the Fast
Forward programme. In 2002, there were £81 million of charges taken to
reflect a reduction in the carrying value of various investments held by the
Group and net losses on disposal of £28 million. The losses included a 
£19 million loss on the deemed disposal of a portion of the Group’s
investment in Instinet Group, following the Island acquisition.
Reuters Group reported a profit before taxation of £56 million in 2003
compared to a loss of £344 million in 2002. The 2003 profit was made up of 
a £102 million profit in Reuters, partly offset by a £46 million loss in Instinet
Group. Excluding amortisation of goodwill and other intangibles, impairments
and disposals, Reuters Group profit before taxation was £194 million, up from
£91 million in 2002.
Taxation charge
The taxation charge for 2003 was £22 million, £1 million lower than 2002, when
a charge arose due to the non-deductible nature of amortisation charges, and
certain write downs, as well as from a dividend paid by Instinet Group.
EPS
Reuters Group recorded basic earnings per share of 3.6 pence, as compared
to a 18.3 pence loss per share in 2002. The 2003 EPS reflected the Reuters
Group’s return to a net profit. The loss in 2002 primarily reflected the 
£317 million non-cash impairment charges in that year.
Reuters Group EPS before amortisation of goodwill and other intangibles,
impairment of goodwill, disposals and non-recurring tax effects of impairments,
reorganisations and disposals was 11.4 pence (2002: 6.9 pence). The
improvement in EPS was largely due to cost savings outstripping revenue decline. 
Cash Flow
Reuters Group had net debt of £77 million as at 31 December 2003, an
increase of £11 million from 2002. This consisted of net funds in Instinet Group
of £533 million (2002: £518 million) and net debt in Reuters of £610 million
(2002: £584 million). Reuters Group net cash inflow from operating activities
was £429 million in 2003 compared to £355 million in 2002. The improvement
in Reuters Group net cash inflow was due to a £117 million increase in Instinet
Group’s net cash inflow, due to movements in net counterparty debtors and
creditors. Reuters net cash inflow of £401 million was £43 million lower than in
2002, mainly due to lower revenues.
Reuters
Revenue
Reuters revenue was down 11% to £2,664 million in 2003, reflecting weak
trading conditions in global financial markets.
Operating costs
Reuters operating costs were £2,486 million in 2003, a reduction of 
£309 million (11%) from 2002. This decrease was driven by savings from 
Fast Forward and earlier transformation programmes.
Operating profit and margin
Reuters operating profit decreased by £19 million in 2003 to £178 million,
largely driven by an increase in restructuring charges. Excluding amortisation
of goodwill and other intangibles, impairments and restructuring charges,
Reuters generated an operating profit of £408 million (2002: £395 million),
with the 3% increase reflecting strong cost control across all business units.
Reuters operating margin was 6.7% in 2003 on an actual basis (2002: 6.6%),
and increased from 13.2% to 15.3% before amortisation of goodwill and other
intangibles, impairments and restructuring.
Instinet Group
Revenue
Instinet Group revenue was down 5% to £578 million, largely reflecting the
adverse impact of the weaker US dollar on Instinet Group revenues.
Operating loss
Instinet Group’s operating loss decreased from £339 million in 2002 to 
£48 million in 2003, mainly due to once-off goodwill amortisation and 
impairment charges of £229 million in 2002.

Reuters classifies revenue into three distinct types – recurring, outright and
usage. Recurring revenue, which makes up approximately 92% of Reuters 2004
revenues, refers to the sale of subscription products and includes maintenance
fees from solutions sales. Recurring revenue declined by 11.9% on an actual
basis to £2,164 million and by 5.4% on an underlying basis, reflecting a
gradually improving market environment. This compares with a decline in the
previous year of 9.3% on an actual basis and 10.2% on an underlying basis.
Outright revenue, comprising approximately 4% of Reuters 2004 revenues, is
principally derived from the sale of software and hardware solutions. Outright
revenue declined by 15% on an actual basis, or 10% on an underlying basis, to
£89 million as we exited bespoke solutions sales as part of Fast Forward and
market conditions continued to be difficult.
Usage revenue, approximately 4% of Reuters 2004 revenues, is principally
derived from Dealing Matching and Bridge Trading products where revenue 
is generated based on trading volumes. In 2004, usage revenue grew by 5%
on an actual basis and 11% on an underlying basis, to £108 million. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

customers. Around 16,000 of the 19,000 additional positions of Reuters 3000
Xtra installed in 2004 were upgrades of existing accesses, with the balance
made up by new business. There were around 18,000 Dealing user accesses at
the end of the year. Access numbers grew by more than 100 during the year,
despite competitive pressure from the EBS/Bloomberg alliance. This reflected
the success of the vigorous sales campaign to defend this revenue stream. 
ARPA for the Reuters Xtra product family declined by 13% year-on-year on 
an actual basis, or 9% on an underlying basis. The factors driving this were an
increased proportion of Reuters 3000 Xtra accesses (including some upgrades
offered on a temporary basis to mitigate the delay in Reuters Trader), more
customers moving into higher discount bands as their installed base increased
and the impact of the weaker US dollar on revenues generated from some
larger customers whose 3000 Xtra accesses are priced in US dollars. 
Revenue from the Reuters Trader product family (which comprises Reuters
Trader, 2000/3000 series products and regional products), fell by £177 million,
to £416 million, a decline of 26% on an underlying basis. This was caused
primarily by the migration of users of legacy products to 3000 Xtra and, to a
lesser extent, by cancellations and by competitive losses. Recurring revenue
from legacy 2000/3000 series products totalled £212 million, falling 42% on 
an actual basis. 
Reuters Trader family accesses declined by 24% during the period. 2000/3000
series product accesses declined by 35% year-on-year, driven by migration
activities. The rollout of the new Reuters Trader product in Europe was slower
than expected due to post-launch product issues, and further work is underway
to optimise overall product performance. In total, there were 4,300 Reuters
Trader accesses installed by the end of 2004. ARPA for the Reuters Trader family
declined by 4% year-on-year on an actual basis or 2% on an underlying basis. 
Usage revenue in Sales & Trading was down 3% on an actual basis but showed
growth on an underlying basis compared to 2003. Volatility in the foreign
exchange markets and an extension of the product to support trading in
derivatives drove 4% growth in Dealing Matching revenues compared to 2003.
Research & Asset Management
Revenue from Research & Asset Management accounts for 10% of Reuters
revenues. In 2004, revenue fell by £55 million to £235 million. This reflected
the impact of the disposals of ORT, TowerGroup and Yankee which caused
actual revenues to decline by 19%. On an underlying basis, the segment’s
revenue increased by 2%. Within Research & Asset Management, revenue is
derived from the Reuters Knowledge and Reuters Wealth Manager product
families. The Research & Asset Management segment also generated £73
million in revenue from the Reuters Xtra and Reuters Trader product families.
The Reuters Knowledge product family comprises Reuters Knowledge for
Investment Management, Reuters Knowledge for Corporates and Reuters
Research. Disposals drove an actual decline of 39% in Knowledge family
revenue to £65 million, but a strong product line and a global sales campaign
among investment management firms drove excellent underlying growth of
56%. The Reuters Wealth Manager product family includes Reuters Wealth
Manager, Reuters Plus and Lipper. Revenue fell by £6 million to £97 million,
but increased by 2% on an underlying basis. The actual decline was driven
mainly by the effect of the weaker US dollar on Reuters Plus revenue. Reuters
Plus revenue increased by 11% on an underlying basis and Lipper revenue by
9% on an underlying basis. 
8,400 positions of Reuters Knowledge were installed at the end of 2004.
Within the Reuters Wealth Manager family, access growth was level. Good
growth in Reuters Plus accesses was offset by a decline in Reuters Market
Monitor (RMM) accesses. Reuters Wealth Manager, launched in September
2004, provides a migration path for RMM accesses and achieved around 
4,400 sold accesses at the end of the year.
ARPA across the Reuters Knowledge and Reuters Wealth Manager families
remained the same in 2004 on an actual basis, but increased 8% on an underlying
basis, driven by the successful rollout of higher-priced Reuters Knowledge products.
Enterprise
Revenue from the Enterprise segment, which accounts for 20% of Reuters
revenues, fell by £79 million to £481 million, a decline of 14% on an actual
Trends in user accesses and average revenue per access (ARPA)
User accesses declined by approximately 10,000 over the year as a whole.
However, they have increased since a low point at the end of Q1, increasing by
14,000 since March 2004. User accesses were restated to reflect the exclusion
of mobile and other low-cost accesses. ARPA decreased 1% on an actual basis,
but increased 2% on an underlying basis over 2003, reflecting a higher
proportion of premium products, primarily due to upgrades and the removal 
of accesses at the lower end of the price range.

In 2004, Reuters redefined its Customer Segments and organised its products
into product families. For details see pages 7-8 in ‘Company information’.
Revenue from the Xtra product family is divided between Sales & Trading
(93%) and Research & Asset Management ( 7%). For details, see ‘Segmental
analysis’ note on pages 44-45. The performance of the Xtra product family is
discussed under Sales & Trading.
Sales & Trading
Revenue from Sales & Trading, which accounts for 50% of Reuters revenues,
was £1,180 million, a decline of 9% on an actual basis and 4% on an underlying
basis. Within Sales & Trading, revenues are derived from the Reuters Xtra and
Reuters Trader product families.
Revenue from the Reuters Xtra product family (which comprises 3000 Xtra,
Dealing, Reuters Station, Reuters Electronic Trading and Securities Transactions)
increased by £51 million to £837 million. Total revenue from Reuters 3000 Xtra
was £494 million, up 18% on an actual basis. Dealing revenues of £238 million,
which include both subscription and matching revenues, decreased by 8% on 
an actual basis. 
The installed base of 3000 Xtra grew steadily through 2004 and reached 88,000
at the end of the year, a 27% year-on-year increase. This reflected increased
traction from the enterprise-wide deals signed with some of our largest Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004   19
basis and 9% on an underlying basis. Within Enterprise, revenues are derived
from four product lines, offering customers fully integrated business solutions.
Risk Management and Enterprise Information Products both have good potential
for growth, and account for 24% of total Enterprise revenues. Datafeeds and
Market Data Systems are more established businesses with strategically vital
capabilities, that sit at the heart of Reuters new transactions offer. 
Enterprise Information Products generated revenue of £34 million and grew by
43% on an actual basis and 57% on an underlying basis in 2004, driven by a
solid product offering and renewed market focus on data usage compliance.
Risk Management acquired 30 new customers during 2004 and continued to
show good potential despite a 6% actual decline or a 2% underlying decline 
in revenues this year. 
Datafeed revenues showed an annual decline of 19% on an actual basis and
15% on an underlying basis while Market Data Systems declined 13% on an
actual basis and 10% on an underlying basis. These declines were driven by
Reuters withdrawal from its consulting business as part of Fast Forward, major
customers consolidating systems into larger centres and an aggressive
campaign by Reuters to migrate small and medium sized customers to newer,
desktop-based offerings. Nevertheless, Reuters continues to be uniquely
placed to supply sophisticated enterprise solutions to customers with
technology-intensive businesses. 
Media 
Revenue from Media, which accounts for 6% of Reuters revenues, declined 
by £9 million to £144 million, an actual decline of 6% and an underlying
decline of 2%. Within Media, revenues are derived from the Text, Visuals,
Consumer and Advertising Services product lines. 
The main driver of the decline in Media revenue was Reuters decision to
restrict access to premium news distributed through internet content
aggregators, and to retain it exclusively for distribution through Reuters own
consumer websites. This policy has resulted in an increase in reuters.com site
traffic which has helped to increase consumer revenues to £7 million in 2004,
compared to £2 million in 2003. 
Recoveries
Recurring revenue from recoveries, including exchange fees and ‘last mile’
communications costs totalled £321 million, a decline of 11% on an actual
basis and 7% on an underlying basis.

Operating costs were £2,193 million in 2004 compared to £2,486 million in
2003. The principal drivers of the reduction in operating costs of £293 million
were the Fast Forward transformation programme and the impact of currency
movements. Employee costs fell by a net 10%, with reductions in headcount
through Fast Forward initiatives and divestments partly offset by more
employees being hired into customer-facing roles and increased numbers of
content production and product development staff in lower-cost locations.
Property costs reduced by £25 million, or 13% on an actual basis, as
consolidation of office space continued. Communications costs declined by
£46 million, or 13% on an actual basis, as a result of the weakened US dollar
and Fast Forward initiatives. Research and development expenditure totalled
£128 million in 2004 compared with £136 million in 2003 and £154 million in
2002. The decline in Reuters research and development costs largely reflects
the impact of efficiency and cost reduction measures across the development
organisation and has been driven partly by moving development resources
into lower-cost locations. In 2004, notable areas of spend included electronic
trading systems and enhancements to products within the Xtra Family and Risk.
Customer Segments
Customer Segments expenditure totalled £166 million, and accounted for 8%
of trading costs in 2004. This reduced by £84 million over 2003, 33% on an
actual basis and 14% on an underlying basis. The reduction was primarily driven
by divestment of subsidiaries and net headcount reductions. 
Channel
Channel costs totalled £822 million, and accounted for 41% of 2004 trading
costs, a reduction of £118 million from 2003, 12% on an actual basis and 8%
on an underlying basis. Close to half of Channel costs consist of recoveries and
employee-related costs. The majority of underlying cost savings in 2004 came
from staff cost reductions. Property rationalisation also contributed to savings.
Increased investment in client training and customer support activities was
outweighed by streamlining and efficiency gains.
Operations & Technology
Operations & Technology costs totalled £630 million, accounting for 31% of
2004 trading costs, a reduction of £44 million versus the prior year. Costs fell 
7% on an actual basis but remained flat on an underlying basis. This compared
with an actual reduction in 2003 of 7%. The underlying savings were achieved
mainly in product development, principally from headcount reduction and
through relocating resources to more cost-efficient locations and continuing 
to close down certain development facilities.
Content
Content costs, comprising Data and Editorial, totalled £262 million in 2004,
representing 13% of trading costs, a decrease of £16 million from the prior
year, or 6% on an actual basis and 1% on an underlying basis, compared with 
a reduction of 6% on an actual basis in 2003. Productivity improvements and
efficiencies in third party data expenditure were partly offset by investment
in coverage of the year’s major news events, such as the US Elections and
the Olympics.
Corporate services/other
Costs from Corporate services, which comprises corporate head office functions
and internal services, and other costs totalled £124 million, and accounted for
7% of trading costs in 2004. An increase of £10 million from the prior year, or
8% on an actual basis and 15% on an underlying basis, was driven mainly by 
a reduction in currency gains relative to 2003.
Restructuring
The Fast Forward programme resulted in a restructuring charge of £120 million
in 2004 within operating profit. This compared with Fast Forward restructuring
charges of £134 million, net of a £10 million release of legacy programme
provisions, in 2003, and to previous business transformation plan charges of
£112 million in 2002.
In 2004, Fast Forward delivered a further £159 million in cost savings leading
to cumulative savings from the programme of £234 million. 900 employees
were made redundant during the course of 2004, most of whom have already
left the company, with the rest expected to leave in 2005. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
continued
20 Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004
commissions, the decrease of NASDAQ market making and diminished
investment banking fee revenues, which have compelled them to spend 
more time looking for additional profit-generating opportunities. This has 
led traditional brokerage firms to increase their focus on offering algorithmic
trading, program trading and direct market access to institutional customers.
These firms now directly compete with Instinet in price and technology to
provide these services to customers. As a result, customers have become more
demanding and cost conscious. Instinet pricing for US equities, measured in
cents per share, declined 2.6% in 2004 and 10.1% in 2003, and pricing for
non-US equities, measured as a percentage of the total consideration of the
trade, declined 5.4% in 2004 and 1.7% in 2003. Going forward, Instinet
expects institutional pricing to continue to decline amid strong competition 
for customer business.
Instinet Group continues to monitor future price competition and evaluate 
its pricing structures as part of its ongoing efforts to allow its businesses 
to remain competitive. The Reuters Group is unable to anticipate whether 
the changes in trading volumes and pricing are indicative of future trends,
although management expectation is that the intense competition may
continue, and if it or the other adverse factors continue or intensify, Instinet
Group’s revenues could be adversely affected.
05 EXPECTED FUTURE PERFORMANCE
Reuters
Reuters expects underlying recurring revenues for the first quarter of 2005 to
decline by around 1.5% compared to the same period in 2004. With net sales
off to a good start early in 2005, the company expects further gradual
improvement in the decline in recurring revenues in the second quarter. 
Reuters will continue to reduce its operating expenditure in 2005, with over
£100 million of cost savings expected to be delivered under the Fast Forward
transformation programme this year. This will bring the cumulative total cost
savings to approximately £340 million by the end of 2005, on track to realise
the full £440 million of promised savings by the end of 2006. The Fast Forward
restructuring charge for 2005 is expected to be around £80 million. This figure
is higher than originally expected because the Fast Forward restructuring
charge now includes certain once-off expenditure associated with completing
the move of Reuters London operations to Canary Wharf.
In 2005, Reuters expects an increase in capital expenditure to reflect
approximately £30 million of fit-out costs for the company’s new London
headquarters in Canary Wharf and an additional £30 to £40 million to build
data centre capacity and improve service resilience.
Instinet Group
Instinet remains committed to bringing down its fixed costs throughout the
year. Its cost reduction plan for 2005 includes reducing its spending on
technology, consolidating office space and reducing discretionary expenses
which collectively are expected to reduce annualised costs (excluding staff
costs) by approximately £26 million by the end of the fourth quarter of 2005
when compared to the third quarter of 2004.
Pending acquisition of Telerate
On 20 December 2004, Reuters entered into agreements to acquire
substantially all of the business of Telerate as well as a subsidiary of Quick that
serves as the exclusive distributor of Telerate products in Japan. The Telerate
purchase price will be US$100 million (£52 million), subject to adjustment for
working capital and an increase by an amount currently estimated to be US$28
million (£15 million) to the extent certain actions Telerate may independently
take prior to closing result in corresponding reduction of Reuters anticipated
post-closing restructuring costs, plus Reuters 14% stake in Savvis (which is
currently convertible into approximately 76 million shares of Savvis common
stock). The purchase price for the Quick subsidiary will be JPY1.1 billion 
(£5 million) in cash, subject to certain adjustments, and Reuters current 4.85%
holding in Quick. Telerate’s 2003 revenue was US$292 million (£152 million).
For 2004 (unaudited and based on information from Telerate management),
Telerate’s revenue was US$274 million (£143 million), with an operating loss 
of US$42 million (£22 million) before depreciation and amortisation. Reuters
expects to spend around £40 to £45 million, including approximately 
£15 million as part of the purchase price described above, to integrate
Telerate fully. The result is that the acquisition is expected to be dilutive to
Reuters EPS during the integration period. Upon completion of integration,
which is expected to take around 18 months, the acquisition is expected to
Instinet Group
A key driver of Instinet Group’s business is average daily trading volume in the
US securities markets, which increased in 2004 after moderate annual decreases
over the previous five years. From 2000 through to early 2003, these markets
experienced significant volatility and declines in volume associated with the
weaker economic climate, a reduction in corporate transactions and a generally
more difficult business environment. Overall trading volume increased in 2004
over 2003 levels primarily due to the continuing economic recovery, an increase
in the level of corporate transactions and increased investor confidence. Instinet
Group’s business is also affected, though to a lesser extent, by changes in
trading volumes in non-US markets, which experienced considerable volatility
and significant declines in volume from 2000 through to 2003, followed by
recent increases in stock prices. Overall, non-US markets grew in 2004
compared to 2003, with very strong year-on-year gains in Asian markets.
A significant portion of securities traded in Instinet Group’s business are
NASDAQ-listed securities. Average daily trading volume in NASDAQ-listed
stocks was down 3.7% for the full year 2003 compared to 2002, but increased
6.4% in 2004, and has continued to increase in the first two months of 2005
compared to average 2004 levels. Average daily trading volume in US
exchange-listed stocks has grown steadily over the past five years, although
the growth has slowed since 2001. For 2004, average daily volume of US
exchange-listed stocks increased 9.0% over 2003 levels. 
Overall market share for INET, the electronic market place, increased slightly to
13.4% of total US market share volume for 2004 from 13.3% in 2003, while the
actual number of shares matched in INET’s marketplace increased by 9.2% to
131 billion shares in 2004 compared to 120 billion shares in 2003. In 2002,
including the acquisition of Island at the end of the third quarter, INET’s overall
market share was 8.4%, or 76 billion shares, of total US market share volume.
Overall market share for Instinet, the institutional broker, decreased to 2.7%, 
or 26 billion shares, of total US equity trading volume for 2004 compared to
2.8%, or 25 billion shares, in 2003 and 2.5%, or 23 billion shares in 2002. 
The volatility in market share reflects the intense competitive environment
within the brokerage business, which has resulted in price reductions since
2001. In September 2001, INET reduced average prices by 11% with a new
pricing schedule for US broker-dealer customers. In March 2002, INET began
offering broker-dealer rebates. In October 2003, it reduced pricing for routing
orders in NASDAQ-listed stocks to other trading venues through its automated
smart order-routing system by 37% and introduced tiered pricing offering
lower prices to customers based on volume levels. In October 2004, INET
introduced a new pricing schedule for transactions in US exchange-listed
stocks. In January 2005, INET announced that it would share up to 50% of 
its market data revenue for certain American Stock Exchange transactions. 
Instinet also operates in a highly competitive environment. Traditional
brokerages have also been severely impacted by tighter spreads, smaller

before amortisation of goodwill and intangibles, impairments and restructuring

Reuters current reporting. Starting in 2005, Reuters will be reporting under the
new IFRS standards, which are not expected to significantly affect the amount
of EPS accretion or the impact of margin from the acquisition, but may affect
Reuters core EPS calculation. The transactions are expected to complete around
mid-2005, subject to regulatory approvals for the Telerate acquisition and
other customary conditions. For more information, see pages 7 and 89.
06 TREASURY POLICIES, FINANCING AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE
Reuters Group treasury function is a cost rather than profit centre. As such, 
all transactions which are undertaken are designed to mitigate risk within the
business or to secure committed funding. At no time are speculative transactions
undertaken nor transactions without an underlying commercial rationale.
The key objectives of the treasury function are to ensure sufficient liquidity
exists to meet funding needs and to manage the interest rate and currency risks
arising from Reuters Group’s operations and its sources of finance. All treasury
activity takes place within a formal control framework under policies approved
by the Board. A separate treasury function exists within Instinet Group.
FINANCING
Reuters finances its operations by a mixture of cash flows from operations,
short-term borrowings from banks and commercial paper markets, backed up
as required by committed bank facilities and finance from capital markets.
Reuters manages its net debt position and interest costs to support its
continued access to the full range of debt capital markets. Reuters expects to
be able to finance its current business plans, including the Telerate acquisition
(in connection with which Reuters expects to receive approximately 
US$22 million; see ‘Related party transactions and material contracts – other
material contracts – Telerate transitional services agreement’ on page 90), from
ongoing operations and its external facilities.
Net cash flows are generally either applied to reduce debt or placed in short-
term investments with financial institutions holding strong credit ratings within
pre-agreed limits set by the Board. As at 31 December 2004, the Group held
cash and short-term investment balances of £836 million, of which £503 million
was held by Instinet Group.
Reuters borrows in various currencies, at both fixed and floating rates, and 
uses derivative contracts to create the desired currency and interest rate basis. 
The conversion of net investments in overseas subsidiaries into the Group’s
reporting currency of sterling creates translation exposure. To help mitigate
this effect, to the extent that the Group has core debt, it will be held in
currencies approximately proportionate to the currency profile of the Group’s
net assets, including its net investment in Instinet Group. 
In broad terms, using the average net funds position, a 1% increase in global
interest rates would have reduced profit before tax in the year by approximately
£2 million (2003: £2 million, 2002: £1 million) excluding the impact of hedging. 
Syndicated credit facility
In April 2003, Reuters entered into a committed syndicated credit facility 
for £1.0 billion. £520 million of the facility either expired or was voluntarily
cancelled in 2004. At 31 December 2004, Reuters had £480 million available
under the facility. The facility was undrawn during 2004. The commitment
expires and final repayment is due in April 2008.
The facility is generally on customary terms and conditions. Drawings under
the facility may be made in sterling, euros or other currencies agreed at the
time and bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin, variable according to the long
term credit rating of Reuters Group. The facility cross-defaults upon default 
by Reuters in payment or acceleration of any other borrowings in excess of 
£20 million. The facility contains two financial covenants: that Reuters
operating profit before interest, tax and amortisation (subject to certain
adjustments) should be greater than 2.75 times net finance charges and 
that Reuters net borrowings should not be greater than 3.50 times Reuters
operating profit before depreciation and amortisation (subject to certain
adjustments). As at 31 December 2004, Reuters complied with these
covenants. 
Bilateral loan facilities
At the same time as the syndicated credit facility was arranged, committed
bilateral facilities of £90 million were also put in place on similar terms. During
2004, £66 million of the facilities either expired or were voluntarily cancelled. 
At 31 December 2004, Reuters had £24 million available. The facility was
undrawn during 2004.
Euro Commercial Paper Programme
A £1.5 billion Euro Commercial Paper Programme is available, in respect of
which Reuters had outstanding obligations of £70 million at 31 December
2004, repaid in January 2005. The minimum outstanding during 2004 was 
£nil and the maximum was £70 million. 
The programme is generally on customary terms and conditions, including 
a condition that the company should not be in default on any other debt or
similar obligation. The programme has no final maturity date and there is no
requirement to update the programme documentation. Debt is issued at
market rates agreed between the issuer and the dealer. The programme
documentation contains no financial covenants.
Euro Medium Term Note Programme
Reuters also has available a £1 billion Euro Medium Term Note Programme. 
At 31 December 2004, Reuters had outstanding obligations of £387 million
under the programme, repayable at various dates up to November 2010
including a €500 million public bond, issued in November 2003 and maturing
in November 2010. The minimum outstanding during 2004 was £387 million
and the maximum was £727 million. 
The programme is generally on customary terms and conditions. The
programme has no final maturity date but the offering circular, containing
financial information, is updated each year to allow issuance to continue. 
Debt is issued at market rates agreed between the issuer and the dealer. 
The programme documentation contains no financial covenants and notes 
in issue have no cross-default provision. 
Short-term uncommitted facilities 
In addition, Reuters has short-term uncommitted bank borrowing facilities
denominated in various currencies, the sterling equivalent of which was
approximately £155 million. Drawings under these lines were £45 million at 
31 December 2004. Instinet Group has access to the equivalent of US$189
million short-term uncommitted bank facilities of which US$15 million were
drawn at 31 December 2004. 
Contractual financial obligations
The following table summarises Reuters Group’s principal contractual financial
obligations at 31 December 2004, certain of which are described in the
consolidated financial statements and notes. Reuters Group expects to be able
to fund such obligations from ongoing operations and its external facilities.

22 Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004
FOREIGN EXCHANGE
Almost 90% of Group revenue is denominated in non-sterling currencies. 
The Group also has significant costs denominated in foreign currencies with 
a different mix from revenue. Group profits are therefore exposed to currency
fluctuations. The approximate proportions of operating profit excluding
goodwill amortisation and currency gains received in each key currency group
were as follows:
Year to 31 December
2004 2003 2002
Adjusted Group operating profit by currency % %%
Euro 137 171 296
US dollar 8 (5) (71)
Japanese yen 28 32 53
Sterling (103) (133) (283)
Other 30 35 105
Total 100 100 100
Sterling costs exceeded sterling revenue due to the level of restructuring costs
and UK-based marketing, development, operational and central services costs.
In broad terms, using the 2004 mix of profits, the impact of an additional
unilateral 1% strengthening of sterling would have been a reduction of
approximately £5 million in operating profits before hedging (2003: £4 million,
2002: £7 million).
Exchange rate movements in 2004 had an £8 million net impact on operating
profit.

No unremitted profits are hedged with foreign exchange contracts as Reuters
judges it inappropriate to hedge non-cash flow translation exposure with cash-
based instruments.
Forward foreign exchange contracts, currency options and foreign exchange
swaps are used to manage, where appropriate, the effects of transaction
exposure and certain intercompany transactions which impact Group profits.
Transaction exposure occurs when, as a result of trading activities, an entity
receives cash in a currency different from its functional currency. 
07 MANAGEMENT OF RISKS
Reuters Group’s Board has adopted a process for identifying, evaluating and
managing significant risks faced by Reuters Group. The process is described in
‘Risk Management, Internal Controls and Disclosure Controls and Procedures’
on page 41.
08 ACCOUNTING POLICIES, US GAAP AND INTERNATIONAL
FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS
Group accounting policies conform with UK GAAP . In accordance with the
requirements of Financial Reporting Standard 18 (FRS18), these policies and
any applicable estimation techniques have been reviewed by the directors,
who have confirmed them to be the most appropriate for the preparation 
of the 2004 financial statements.
Critical accounting policies
In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best
estimates and judgements of certain amounts included in the financial
statements. The most significant judgemental areas in 2004 related to:
The impairment of fixed assets, current asset investments and goodwill
Under UK accounting standards, impairment is measured by comparing the
carrying value of an asset with the higher of its net realisable value and value
in use. These comparisons sometimes require subjective judgements and
estimates to be made by management with regard to projected future cash
flows of income-generating units or the amounts that could be obtained from
the sale of investments. As a result, some current asset investments and
goodwill have been written down to net realisable value.
Accounting for long-term incentive plans (LTIP)
The costs of shares acquired to cover LTIP awards are charged in the profit 
and loss account over the period to which the performance criteria relate.
Adjustments are made during the three to five-year vesting period of each
plan to reflect changes in the possibility of performance criteria being met.
These adjustments are to some extent subjective as performance is based on
Reuters Group’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to the TSR of the other
companies in the FTSE 100 at the start of the measurement period. As a result
of Reuters Group’s low TSR ranking for the relevant periods, it has now been
assumed that the 2001 and 2002 LTIP schemes are unlikely to deliver any 
value to the participants, and that the 2003 LTIP scheme is likely to only vest
partially. For additional information concerning the LTIP, see ‘Equity incentive
plans – LTIP’ on page 33.
Provisions
The 2004 restructuring charges cover primarily leasehold properties and
severances. A number of leasehold properties have been identified as being
surplus to requirements. Although efforts are being made to sub-let this vacant
space, management recognises that this may not be possible immediately
given the current economic climate. Estimates have been made to cover the
cost of vacant possession, together with any shortfall arising from sub-leased
rental income being lower than lease costs being borne by the Group. 
A judgement has also been made in respect of the discount factor, based on 
a risk-free rate, that is applied to the rent shortfalls. For severance provisions, 
we book amounts where employees have a valid expectation or have 
already been told of their redundancy. Other provisions are held where 
the recoverability of amounts is uncertain, where the actual outcome may 
differ from the resulting estimates.
Allowances for doubtful accounts
For all trade debtors, Reuters management makes a judgement regarding 
the ability of customers to pay and accordingly establishes an allowance for
estimated losses arising from non-payment. In evaluating this allowance,
customer credit worthiness, current economic conditions and previous
experience are taken into account. If actual collections differ from estimates,
this will affect future profit.
Deferred taxation
Under UK and US accounting standards, in assessing which deferred tax assets
to record on the balance sheet, management has made subjective judgements
over projected future profitability of certain legal entities.
Assets held for sale
As permitted by the Companies Act and UK GAAP , where an acquisition has been
made exclusively with a view to subsequent resale and has not previously been
consolidated in the Group’s accounts, it has been treated as a current asset
investment. Where it is not management’s intention to retain a long-term interest
in a fixed asset investment, the investment has been reclassified as a current asset. 
US GAAP
A reconciliation of net income under UK and US GAAP is set out on page 78.
A discussion of the relevant US accounting policies which differ materially from
UK GAAP is given on pages 74-77 in the ‘Summary of differences between UK
and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles’. Details of recent US GAAP
accounting pronouncements are given on page 80.
Off-balance sheet arrangements
The Group does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by
the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on
the Group’s financial position or results of operations material to investors.
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
Reuters Group, along with all companies listed on an EU Stock Exchange, 
will be required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance
with IFRS in respect of accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January
2005. The first-time adoption rules of IFRS require the comparative financial
information presented in the first set of IFRS financial statements to be
prepared on a consistent basis. This will require Reuters Group to restate its
2004 financial statements and present a series of reconciliations to the
previous reported UK GAAP numbers. Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004   23
Reuters will provide indicative external guidance on the anticipated impact 
that IFRS is expected to have on Reuters 2004 performance, excluding 
Instinet Group (who are yet to quantify fully the impact of IFRS). The material
presented will be available on Reuters website from 10 March 2005. This
indicative guidance was prepared on the basis of current IFRS standards and
interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
These standards are subject to ongoing amendment by the IASB and
subsequent endorsement by the European Commission and are therefore
subject to change. There may also be new standards that Reuters may wish to
adopt early. As a result, the numbers reported in Reuters Group’s 2005 Annual
Report and Form 20-F may vary from those included in the guidance provided.  
Our indicative unaudited guidance highlights the following key impacts 
of IFRS on Reuters 2004 UK GAAP financial statements: (i) no impact on
revenue, (ii) an increase of approximately £4 million on 2004 pre-tax profit, (iii)
consolidation of Radianz from 16 November 2004 (but treated as a
discontinued operation), (iv) no impact on cash flow other than from
consolidation of Radianz and (v) an increase of close to £100 million in net
assets assuming an adoption date of 1 January 2004 which is subject to
approval by the SEC. However, the impact of IFRS on 2005 reported results
could be materially different from 2004 due to a number of factors including 
the following:
• IAS32 and 39, which relate to the recognition of financial instruments, is
applicable from 1 January 2005 with no retrospective application. As a result
Reuters will be recognising movements in the fair value of financial assets,
liabilities and embedded derivatives in 2005 for the first time.
• IFRS 2, relating to share-based payments, provides that only costs associated
with options granted after 7 November 2002 and not vested by 1 January
2005 need to be recognised under IFRS. Consequently the full annual impact
of this standard will not be seen until 2006.
• The level of impairment of goodwill, which may vary significantly from year
to year as it is no longer amortised but subject to annual impairment testing.
• The greater emphasis being placed on recording assets and liabilities at 
fair value under IFRS, which could lead to increased volatility in the 
income statement.
Other material issues may become apparent during the transition process and
therefore the above list should not be regarded as definitive. Reuters does not
expect the change to IFRS to alter the specific future guidance for Reuters as
set out on page 20 under ‘Expected future performance – Reuters’.
09 RISK FACTORS 
Forward-looking statements
This document contains certain forward-looking statements within the 
meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
with respect to Reuters Group’s financial condition, results of operations and
business and management’s strategy, plans and objectives. In particular, all
statements that express forecasts, expectations and projections with respect to
certain matters, including trends in results of operations, margins, growth rates, 
overall financial market trends, product releases, the impact of interest rates 
or exchange rates, anticipated cost savings and synergies and the completion
of strategic transactions or restructuring programmes are all forward-looking
statements. These statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate
to events and depend on circumstances that may occur in the future. There 
are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to
differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking
statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, the Risk Factors
discussed below. Any forward-looking statements made by Reuters Group 
or on its behalf speak only as of the date they are made. Reuters Group 
does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.
Reuters may not be able to realise the anticipated benefits of its 
Fast Forward transformation plan.
The Fast Forward plan includes investing in new information, streamlining the
way information is delivered, offering a simpler and segmented product line,
rationalising the non-core elements of the business, reshaping the cost base
and reinvigorating the company culture. There can be no assurance of
achievement of these objectives or of the exact timing or extent to which 
the anticipated benefits of the Fast Forward programme will be realised.
Unfavourable conditions in financial markets may have a significant adverse
effect on the Group’s business.
Reuters Group’s business is dependent upon the health of the financial
markets and the participants in those markets. Reuters Group’s foreign
exchange Dealing products are dependent on the level of activity in the
foreign exchange market. Similarly, the businesses of Bridge Trading and
Instinet Group are dependent upon the level of activity in the equity markets.
While market conditions improved in 2004, the economic downturn which
began in 2001 continued to negatively impact Reuters Group’s results. 
If these conditions were to worsen or in the event of significant trading market
disruptions or suspensions there could be further adverse effects on Reuters
Group’s business. In addition, Reuters Group’s business could be adversely
affected by further consolidations among clients and competitors.
Currency fluctuations and interest rate fluctuations may have a significant
impact on the Group’s reported revenue and earnings.
Reuters Group reports results in pounds sterling but receives revenue and
incurs expenses in more than 70 currencies and is thereby exposed to the
impact of fluctuations in currency rates. Currency movements resulted in 
a small negative impact on Reuters Group operating profit in 2004. A
strengthening of sterling from current levels, especially in relation to other
currencies in which Reuters Group derives significant revenues or holds
significant assets such as the euro or the US dollar, could adversely affect
results in future periods. To the extent that these currency exposures are not
hedged, exchange rate movements may cause fluctuations in Reuters Group’s
consolidated financial statements. In addition, an increase in interest rates from
current levels could adversely affect the Group’s results in future periods.
Reuters Group may experience difficulties or delays in developing or 
responding to new customer demands or launching new products.
Reuters Group’s business environment is characterised by rapid technological
change, changing and increasingly sophisticated customer demands and
evolving industry standards. If Reuters Group is unable to anticipate and
respond to the demand for new services, products and technologies on a
timely and cost-effective basis and to respond and adapt to technological
advancements and changing standards, its business may be adversely affected.
In addition, Reuters Group may delay or halt the launch of new products and
services; its existing products and services may cease to be attractive to
customers; and new products and services that Reuters Group may develop
and introduce may not achieve market acceptance. In the event any of the
foregoing occurs, Reuters Group’s financial results could be adversely affected.
Reuters Group is dependent on third parties for the provision of certain
network and other services.
Reuters Group has outsourced the day-to-day operation of most of its networks
to Radianz, which also provides network services to companies in addition 
to Reuters Group. Although Reuters currently owns all the voting shares of
Radianz, it intends to transfer ownership of Radianz to BT and conclude a 
long-term network services agreement currently being negotiated with BT.
Accordingly, Reuters ability to affect the performance of Radianz may be
limited and its business could be adversely affected as a result.
In connection with the 2001 acquisition of certain businesses and assets of
Bridge, Reuters entered into a network services agreement with Savvis which
was the primary provider of network services to Bridge. Reuters currently holds
approximately 14% of Savvis’ voting share capital, which it has agreed to
transfer as partial consideration for Telerate. In addition, Savvis has a network
services agreement with Telerate, which Reuters would acquire in its pending
acquisition of Telerate. Savvis has a majority controlling shareholder, and
Reuters has very limited, if any, ability to affect the performance of Savvis.
Failure or inability of any third party that provides significant services to Reuters
Group, such as Radianz or Savvis, to perform its obligations could adversely
affect Reuters Group’s financial results.
The Group’s business may be adversely affected if its networks or systems
experience any significant failures or interruptions or cannot accommodate
increased traffic.
Reuters Group’s business is dependent on the ability to rapidly handle
substantial quantities of data and transactions on its computer-based networks
and systems and those of Radianz, Savvis and others. Any significant failure or
interruption of such systems, including terrorist activities, could have a material
adverse effect on its business and results of its operations. The continuing
  OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
continued
24 Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004
increase in the update rates of market data may impact product and network
performance from time to time. Factors that have significantly increased the
market data update rates include: the emergence of proprietary data feeds
from other markets; high market volatility; decimalisation; reductions in trade
sizes resulting in more transactions; new derivative instruments; increased
automatically-generated algorithmic and program trading; market
fragmentation resulting in an increased number of trading venues; and
multiple listings of options and other securities. While Reuters Group has
implemented a number of capacity management initiatives, there can be 
no assurance that Reuters Group and its network providers will be able to
accommodate accelerated growth of peak traffic volumes or avoid other
failures or interruptions.
Reuters Group is exposed to a decline in the valuation of companies in which
it has invested.
Reuters Group has entered into joint ventures with, and made strategic
investments in, a number of companies and also has significant interests in
companies and joint ventures such as Instinet Group and Factiva. The value of 
a number of these companies fluctuated widely from 2002 through to 2004, 
in part as a result of external market factors. The value of Reuters interests in
these companies is dependent on, among other things, the performance of
these companies generally, whether such performance meets investors’
expectations, and external market and economic conditions. Reuters Group 
has limited ability to influence the management or performance of these
companies.
Significant competition in the financial information and trading industries 
could adversely affect Reuters Group’s business.
Reuters Group faces significant competition in the financial information
industry. The availability of public internet technology reduces barriers to entry
and increases the availability of commoditised data in less expensive forms
and loss of control over intellectual property. Instinet Group and Bridge
Trading face competition from securities brokers, trading venues and other
financial service providers, including many that are well-capitalised and
substantially larger than Instinet Group or Bridge Trading, as the case may 
be, and have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and other
resources. If Reuters Group is unable to cope effectively with increased
competitive pressure arising from the above or any other factors, its financial
results could be adversely affected.
Changes in the regulatory environment could have an adverse effect on
Reuters business.
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 authorises brokers to provide research as
well as trade executions to their clients in return for brokerage commissions.
The payment of brokerage commissions to brokers who also provide proprietary
or independent research is sometimes referred to as ‘soft dollars’. The SEC has
been reviewing the operation and regulation of mutual funds and, as part of
that review, may propose rules addressing the scope of information and other
services that may be considered ‘research’ for this purpose. The UK FSA is also
reviewing the regulatory requirements addressing the provision to institutional
investors of brokerage and other services, including research and information
services. The FSA has issued a policy statement on the definition of ‘research’
expressing its belief that raw data and market information generally do not
constitute ‘research’. The FSA is expected later this year 
to propose rule changes to implement this policy.
The SEC and the US Congress are considering changes to the structure of 
US securities markets. On 15 December 2004, the SEC published for public
comment an amended version of proposed ‘Regulation NMS’. Among other
things, the proposed regulation would address access to and relations between
trading centres and update the requirements for consolidating, distributing,
and displaying market information. The SEC’s efforts in this area could result in
additional regulation of or reduced operational flexibility for the provision of
US market information by Reuters.
Financial services regulators in the United States and other jurisdictions
continue to review business continuity and disaster recovery requirements 
for the institutions they regulate. To the extent that Reuters provides such
institutions with services in areas subject to such requirements, Reuters 
services may have to meet such requirements.
At this time, Reuters Group is unable to predict the impact on its business 
or results of operations of any potential or proposed regulatory changes.
Changes in regulatory environment could have an adverse effect on 
Instinet Group’s business.
As a result of their compliance with the requirements of Regulation ATS, 
none of Instinet Group’s ATSs is currently required to register as a US national
securities exchange. In May 2004, INET submitted a draft application to the
SEC for registration as a national securities exchange and continues to discuss
with the SEC issues related to the filing of a formal application for exchange
registration. If INET or any of Instinet Group’s subsidiaries were to register
voluntarily as a national securities exchange, or if the SEC were to require 
INET to do so, Instinet Group could become subject to substantial additional
regulation, which might reduce its operational flexibility in ways that could
have a material adverse effect on its business. Among other consequences,
Instinet Group might be required to comply with fair representation or
ownership requirements. These and other requirements could adversely affect
its operations and could also result in material limitations or restrictions on
Reuters equity interest in Instinet Group or Reuters ability to exercise its voting
and other governance rights with respect to Instinet Group. Instinet Group’s
ATSs are also subject to Regulation ATS and certain other rules, which require
ATSs meeting certain trading volume criteria to provide quotation data to an
SRO and to provide other broker-dealers execution access to such quotes.
Compliance with Regulation ATS could have an adverse effect on Instinet
Group’s business, financial condition and operating results. In July 2002, the
SEC also took action that resulted in the suspension of market data revenue
sharing programmes in which INET (then known as Island ECN) participated
and led to INET’s suspension of its own programme. These programmes were
subsequently reinstated, but only for US exchange-listed securities. Regulation
NMS proposes changes to the NMS Plan formulas governing the allocation of
market data revenue among SROs, and thus the revenues available for SRO
revenue-sharing programmes. The SEC has also indicated that it could allow
the reinstatement of such programmes in NASDAQ-listed stocks in the future 
if its proposed allocation formulas were adopted. In January 2005, INET began
sharing with subscribers a portion of the market data revenues it receives from
SROs in American Stock Exchange-listed securities. Instinet Group is unable to
determine whether the adoption of the proposed formulas would adversely
impact the value of INET’s market data for purposes of determining an SRO’s
share of market data revenue, and thus affect the revenues INET would be
eligible to receive through SRO revenue sharing programmes. Instinet Group
has been from time to time, and is currently, involved in discussions and
proceedings with the SEC and some if its customers regarding the application
of these and other SEC rules, which may have a material adverse effect on
Instinet Group’s pricing policies and business operations. Future SEC rule-
makings or interpretations relating to equities securities markets and market
conditions could adversely affect Instinet Group’s business, financial condition
and operating results. The NASD regulates the activities of Instinet Group’s US
broker-dealer subsidiaries and its NASDAQ subsidiary competes with Instinet
Group. The NASD, either directly or through subsidiaries, is able to propose,
and often obtain SEC approval of rule changes that the Group believes can be
to NASDAQ’s competitive benefit as a securities marketplace and to Instinet’s
competitive disadvantage. Reuters Group is unable to predict at this time the
impact of any proposed or potential changes to the regulatory environment in
which Instinet Group and its affiliates operate, which may include additional
changes to the NASDAQ marketplace considered by the NASD or the
adoption by authorities in other jurisdictions of new methods for regulating
electronic over-the-counter trading.
Reuters Group may be exposed to adverse governmental action in countries
where Reuters conducts reporting activities.
As the world’s largest news and information company, Reuters Group may
suffer discriminatory tariffs or other forms of adverse government intervention
due to the nature of its editorial and other reporting activities.
Reuters Group may not be able to realise the anticipated benefits of existing 
or future acquisitions and disposals.
To achieve its strategic objectives, Reuters Group has acquired, invested in
and/or disposed of, and in the future may seek to acquire, invest in and/or
dispose of various companies and businesses. No assurance can be given that
Reuters Group will realise, when anticipated or at all, the benefits it expects 
as a result of any acquisition, investment or disposal. Achieving the benefits 
of acquisitions and investments will depend on many factors, including the
successful and timely integration, and in some cases the consolidation of
products, technology, operations and administrative functions, of companies
  Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004   25
that have previously operated separately. Considering the highly technical and
complex nature of Reuters Group's products and services, these integration
efforts may be difficult and time-consuming. In particular, the ability of Reuters
to complete the Telerate acquisition and realise the anticipated benefits is
subject to the risks that necessary regulatory approvals are not obtained; risks
related to the integration of the companies’ operations and products following
completion, including achieving expected synergies; and general risks
associated with the companies’ businesses.
Achieving benefits of disposals will likewise depend on many factors, including
realisation of appropriate value, successful separation of the businesses and
operations and management of related costs, and achievement of any benefits
sought in connection with the transaction. The ability of Reuters to complete
the sale of Radianz to BT and realise the anticipated benefits is subject to the
risks that the parties agree to a satisfactory price and other terms, that the
conditions to such transactions will not be satisfied and that BT's acquisition
and operation of Radianz results in the anticipated benefits and efficiencies to
Reuters. There can be no assurance that Reuters will successfully sell all or any
part of its stake in Radianz or that it will receive any particular price for it.
Reuters Group may identify issues with controls over financial reporting, 
as a result of the implementation project to achieve compliance with 
Sarbanes Oxley Act, section 404.
Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F for the year ended 
31 December 2006 will be required to comply with section 404 of the US
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This requires that companies evaluate and report
on their systems of internal control over financial reporting. In addition, Reuters
Group’s independent auditors must report on management’s evaluation of
those controls. Reuters Group began working on necessary activities in 2003
and is in the process of documenting and testing its systems of internal controls
over financial reporting to provide the basis for its certification. During this
process, Reuters Group may identify deficiencies in its system of internal
controls over financial reporting that may require remediation. At this stage,
due to the ongoing evaluation and testing of Reuters Group’s internal controls,
there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies identified may not be
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that would be required to be
reported. Reuters Group complies with other elements of the Act that are
already in force. 
Reuters Group’s financial reporting will be impacted by compliance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (effective 1 January 2005) 
or other changes mandated by regulatory authorities.
Reuters Group, along with all companies listed on an EU Stock Exchange, will
be required to report its consolidated financial statements in accordance with
International Financial Reporting standards (IFRS) in respect of accounting
periods commencing on or after 1 January 2005. The first-time adoption rules
of IFRS require the comparative financial information presented in the first set
of IFRS financial statements to be prepared on a consistent basis. This will
require us to restate our 2004 financial statemtents and present a series of
reconciliations to the previously reported UK GAAP numbers. For US GAAP
reporting, the US SEC has yet to determine whether we are required to
present comparatives for the year ended 31 December 2002. Other material
issues may become apparent during the conversion process. For additional
information, see Section 8 – ‘Accounting Policies, US GAAP and International
Financial Reporting Standards’. DIRECTORS’ REPORT
26 Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004
The directors submit their annual report and audited financial statements for
the year ended 31 December 2004.
01 ACTIVITIES
Reuters Group’s business is described on page 6. A detailed review of
activities during 2004 and likely future developments is given on pages 6-10.
Details of our research and development activity and expenditure is given on
page 19.
02 SHARE CAPITAL AND DIVIDENDS 
Details of the changes in the authorised and called-up share capital are set out
in notes 26 and 27 on pages 66-67. Details of significant shareholdings are
given on page 81.
An interim dividend of 3.85 pence per ordinary share was paid on 1 September
2004. The directors recommend a final dividend of 6.15 pence per ordinary
share, giving a total of 10.0 pence per ordinary share for the year (2003: 10.0
pence). Subject to shareholders’ approval at the annual general meeting
(AGM) to be held on 21 April 2005, the final dividend will be paid on 28 April
2005 to members on the register at the close of business on 11 March 2005.
03 EMPLOYEES
The total number of employees at 31 December 2004 was Reuters: 14,465;
Instinet Group: 1,010 (31 December 2003: Reuters: 15,521; Instinet Group:
1,223). Details of average number of employees by segment are given on 
page 49.
Reuters policy is that selection of employees, including for recruitment, training,
development and promotion, should be determined solely on their skills, abilities
and other requirements which are relevant to the job and in accordance with the
laws in the country concerned. Reuters equal opportunities policy is designed to
ensure that disabled people are given the same consideration as others and
enjoy the same training, development and prospects as other employees. 
In the UK, as well as being a member of the Employers Forum for Disability,
Reuters has made use of the services of both AbilityNet (which supplies
technology for disabled users) and Employment Opportunities (a UK charity
helping people with disabilities find and retain work). Reuters has successfully
retained staff who have become disabled as well as integrated those who are
disabled when they join the company. This has been possible by using
innovative technological solutions and re-design of the way that jobs are
handled, enabling individuals to contribute actively to business needs.
Reuters makes extensive use of its intranet as a communication tool to 
provide employees with the information they need to understand and achieve
the company’s business objectives. Meetings are regularly held between
management, employees’ union representatives and less formal groups of
employees so that the views of employees can be taken into account in making
decisions which may affect their interests. Reuters European Employee Forum
operates as a pan-European works council. The CEO or other executive
directors meet with the Forum regularly. Reuters regularly undertakes employee
surveys to evaluate morale and to identify any employee issues that need to be
addressed. The results are communicated to employees. 
The Board values the courage and professionalism shown by employees
operating in zones of conflict. Reuters keeps under review the adequacy of 
its policies, training and procedures for employees generally and for those
working in dangerous places in particular. Reuters has reaffirmed the standing
instructions to its employees to avoid risks wherever possible and for hostile
environment training, protective equipment and post traumatic stress disorder
training programmes to be provided to all employees who may need them.
04 CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS
In 2004, Reuters continued to support community initiatives and charitable 
causes, mainly through the work of the Reuters Foundation charitable trust. 
A report on the activities of the Foundation and Reuters wider corporate social
responsibility programme can be found in the Reuters Annual Review 2004 
on pages 16-19 or at www.about.reuters.com/csr. Reuters donated cash
totalling £2.4 million during 2004 (2003: £2.5 million). Reuters 2004 donations
included a contribution of £500,000 to assist tsunami relief efforts. In addition
to these cash contributions, employees are encouraged to give their time and
skills to a variety of causes and Reuters provides equipment and information
services free of charge. 
It is Reuters Group’s policy not to make political contributions and none was
made in 2004.
05 CREDITOR PAYMENT TERMS
It is Reuters normal procedure to agree terms of transactions, including
payment terms, with suppliers in advance. Payment terms vary, reflecting local
practice throughout the world. In the UK Reuters has signed up to the Better
Payment Practice Code. Reuters policy is to make payments on time, provided
suppliers perform in accordance with the agreed terms. Group trade creditors
at 31 December 2004 were equivalent to 19 days’ purchases during the year
(2003: 18 days).
06 AUTHORITY FOR COMPANY TO PURCHASE OWN SHARES
At the AGM held on 22 April 2004, shareholders renewed the company’s
authority under section 166 of the Companies Act 1985 to make purchases of
up to 143,254,000 ordinary shares at a price of not more than 5% above their
average middle market quotation in the London Stock Exchange Daily Official
List for the five business days prior to the date of purchase. The company did
not repurchase any of its own shares during 2004.
07 POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
Details of post balance sheet events are given on page 70.

DIRECTORS AND SENIOR MANAGERS
continued CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004   29
01 STATEMENT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMPLIANCE
Corporate governance – the system by which the company is directed and
controlled – is an important subject for Reuters Group. The strength of the
company’s corporate values, its reputation and its ability to deliver its business
objectives depends, amongst other things, on the effectiveness of its corporate
governance system. 
External influences on the Group’s approach to corporate governance are:
•
the laws to which it is subject; 
• the rules which apply as a company listed on the London Stock Exchange
and on NASDAQ in the US;
• the regulations applied by financial services regulators around the world; and
• the guidance given by investors and others interested in governance 
best practice. 
Reuters monitors and responds to these, particularly in the UK and USA which are
where most of the company’s shareholders are located, continuously improving
the company’s internal governance systems as part of its business transformation.
Since 1 January 2004, the company has complied with the Combined Code 
on Corporate Governance published in July 2003 save that:
•
as described below, in 2004 the company modified its approach to
performance evaluation of the Board to take account of the fact that a new
Chairman and three new non-executive Directors were appointed during the
year (code principle A6); and 
•
no individual member of the Audit Committee has been identified by the
Board as having ‘recent and relevant financial experience’(code principle C3.1).
However, in common with all the non-executive directors, the members of the
Audit Committee are all experienced and influential individuals, having the
skills described in their biographies in ‘Directors’ (see pages 27 and 28) and
the Board considers that, collectively, the members have the attributes
required to discharge properly the Committee’s responsibilities. 
The company also complies with all SEC and (with the exception of two waivers
and one notification described below) NASDAQ governance requirements.
The company has received waivers from NASDAQ from two provisions of its
governance rules, in both cases on the basis that compliance with the rules
would be contrary to standard UK business practice. For approximately fifteen
years the company has operated under a waiver of NASDAQ’s requirement
that all shareholder meetings require a quorum of at least one-third of
outstanding voting shares; instead, the company’s Articles provide, as is typical
for English public companies, that a quorum shall consist of any two
shareholders. 
The company has also received a waiver from NASDAQ’s provisions requiring
shareholder approval of employee share-based incentive schemes. The
company does seek and has received shareholder approval of its employee
share-based incentive schemes to the extent required by UK regulation,
including the UKLA Listing Rules. In addition, during 2004 the company
notified NASDAQ that for a brief period from April to July 2004 it did not 
have three Audit Committee members as required by NASDAQ. One of the
Audit Committee seats became vacant when Sir John Craven retired at the
AGM in April 2004. The vacancy was filled when Lawton Fitt joined the Audit
Committee in July 2004. During the interval the Audit Committee, which 
then comprised Dick Olver and Ian Strachan, met once on routine matters. 
02 REUTERS TRUST PRINCIPLES
The company’s internal system of governance begins with the Reuters Trust
Principles (see ‘Information for shareholders – Memorandum and articles of
association – the Reuters Trust principles and The Founders Share Company’
on pages 82-83) which are designed to protect Reuters integrity and
independence and represent the core values at the heart of Reuters business.
They are set out in the company’s constitutional documents and in the Code of
Conduct which applies to every Reuters employee. The Trust Principles are
a fundamental part of our brand. 
The directors are required by the articles to have due regard to the Trust
Principles insofar as they are capable of being observed in accordance with
their other duties as directors. Thus the Trust Principles are integral to the
Board’s approach to the Group’s business.
03 THE BOARD
Board composition and directors’ independence
Niall FitzGerald chairs the company’s Board. He met the independence 
criteria set out in the Combined Code when he was appointed. His significant
commitments, other than Reuters, are being a member of the World Economic
Forum’s Foundation Board, Co-chairman of the TransAtlantic Business Dialogue
and Chairman of The Conference Board. In addition, on 22 November 2004 
he was appointed Chairman of the Nelson Mandela Legacy Trust (UK). 
Reuters Group’s CEO is Tom Glocer, its CFO is David Grigson and its third
executive director is Devin Wenig, President of Business Divisions. 
There are seven non-executive directors on the Board, including Dick Olver
who is the senior independent non-executive director. He is available to
shareholders if they have concerns. No shareholder contacted him, or his
predecessor, Sir John Craven, during 2004. 
The quality of the individual directors, the balance of the Board’s composition 
and the dynamics of the Board as a group, ensure both the Board’s effectiveness
and the inability of an individual or small group to dominate the Board’s decision
making. The Board has determined that each of the non-executive directors 
is independent in character and judgement by reason of his or her personal
qualities, and that each of the non-executive directors is ‘independent’ as 
that term is defined in NASDAQ and SEC governance requirements.
Each executive director receives a service contract on appointment (see the
Remuneration Report for further information) and each non-executive director
receives a letter setting out the terms of the appointment and specifying 
that the appointment is for a term of six years, subject to review after three
years. Dick Olver and Charles Sinclair have continued to hold office beyond
the initial six year term by agreement with the Board. Copies of the service
contracts and non-executive directors’ letters of appointment are available 
to shareholders from the Company Secretary on request. 
The articles of association provide that at each AGM any director appointed
since the last annual general meeting shall stand for election by the
shareholders and one third of the directors shall retire from office by rotation
and be eligible for re-election by the shareholders. To recognise that some
shareholders prefer all the directors to stand for re-election each year, at the
2005 annual general meeting each of the directors will retire from office and
offer himself or herself for re-election. 
Role of the Board and its committees
The Board is responsible for the success of the company within a framework 
of controls which enables risk to be assessed and managed. Its aim is for the
group to achieve profitable growth within an acceptable risk profile. It seeks 
to achieve this by:
• agreeing the strategic framework and keeping it under vigorous review;
•
monitoring the implementation of strategy through the operational plans;
•
focusing on long-term sustainable value creation;
• safeguarding the longer-term values of the company, including its brand and
corporate reputation;
•
overseeing the quality of management and how it is maintained at world
class levels;
•
maintaining a governance framework that facilitates substance and not
merely form.
A schedule of matters reserved for the Board’s decision identifies those
matters that the Board does not delegate. It includes the approval of
corporate objectives, strategy and the budget, significant transactions and
matters relating to share capital.
The Board is assisted by its committees. Through the Audit Committee, it
satisfies itself on the integrity of financial information and that the financial,
operational and compliance controls and systems of risk management are
robust. Through its Remuneration Committee, the Board determines
appropriate levels of remuneration of executive directors and other senior
managers. The Nominations Committee is the forum through which the Board
discharges its role in nominating new directors and succession planning. 
These committees are described in more detail on the following page. 30 Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the running of the Board,
which is the Chairman’s responsibility, and the running of the Reuters Group’s
business, which is the CEO’s responsibility with the Board having oversight.
The division of responsibilities is set out in a document approved by the Board.
Directors’ induction, training and information
On becoming Chairman, Niall FitzGerald began a comprehensive induction
into Reuters Group, building on the knowledge he had previously acquired 
in his capacity as a non-executive director. Since becoming Chairman, he has
met with employees, customers, shareholders and associates of Reuters Group 
and he has received briefings from the management team on their respective
areas of responsibility. 
Ken Olisa, Lawton Fitt and Penny Hughes are also receiving information and
briefings as part of their induction into Reuters. They have each received a
Directors’ Manual which provides them with information about Reuters and the
operation of the Board and its committees. In addition, a series of briefings
and site visits is being undertaken to gain insights into the group and to
enable the directors to see business operations first hand. All directors are
supplied with Reuters products. 
Ongoing training for directors is available as appropriate. The company’s legal
advisers and auditors provide briefings to the directors from time to time. In
2004 briefing topics included the new ethics and compliance guidelines for
companies in the US, Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 which affects the company
because its securities are registered with the SEC, and the new International
Financial Reporting Standards. In addition, guest speakers are occasionally
invited to join Board dinners to discuss topics of interest with the directors 
and opportunities are provided for non-executive directors to meet with
shareholders, customers and others involved in Reuters business.
Monthly financial information is provided to the directors. Regular and ad 
hoc reports and presentations are prepared and circulated to the directors in
advance of Board meetings, together with minutes and papers relating to the
Board’s committees, to ensure the directors are supplied, in a timely fashion, with
the information they need. They also have access to the Company Secretary who
is responsible for advising the Board through the Chairman on all governance
matters. The Company Secretary is appointed by, and can only be removed by,
the Board. The directors may take independent professional advice at the
company’s expense, although no such advice was sought during 2004. 
Frequency of meetings
The Board met six times in 2004 and, in addition, held a strategy review
meeting in June. The directors attended all the Board meetings in 2004 save
that, by prior arrangement, Niall FitzGerald was absent from the February
meeting and Roberto Mendoza, Charles Sinclair and Ed Kozel were each
absent from one meeting. 
Board effectiveness
Usually each year the Chairman meets at least once with the non-executive
directors without the executive directors present. No such meeting was held 
in 2004 because of the change in the chairmanship of the Board but such
meetings are being held in 2005.
Also, usually the senior independent non-executive director conducts a
chairmanship review meeting at which the Chairman’s remuneration and
performance are reviewed. However, no such meeting was held in 2004 
since it was not considered that it would serve any useful purpose in view of 
Sir Christopher Hogg’s retirement as Chairman in October and replacement 
by Niall FitzGerald. The review will be reintroduced for 2005.
Each year the Chairman and the non-executive directors review the CEO’s
performance and the CEO reviews the performance of the other executive
directors as part of the company-wide employee performance review process.
In view of the Board alterations in 2004, namely the change in Chairman, 
the retirement of three non-executive directors and the appointment of 
three new non-executive directors, rather than having a retrospective
effectiveness review for 2004 the Board concentrated on considering and
determining how it should function, going forward. It plans an in-depth 
review of its effectiveness during 2005 using an external professional facilitator.
The facilitated review in 2005 will also cover the effectiveness of the 
Board’s committees.
The Audit Committee did not conduct an effectiveness review for 2004 since 
it will be covered by the in-depth review being undertaken in 2005. However,
the Remuneration Committee did undertake an evaluation of its performance
during 2004. A questionnaire was circulated to the Committee members and
the collated responses were discussed by the Committee and reported to 
the Board. Account will be taken of the results in the way the Committee 
is managed henceforth.
Board Committees
The Board delegates specific responsibilities to certain committees. 
Each Committee has its own terms of reference set by the Board. 
These are available on request from the Company Secretary or at
www.about.reuters.com/csr/corporategovernance.
The Audit Committee The Audit Committee reviews and, as appropriate,
actively engages in the processes for financial reporting, internal control, 
risk assessment, audit and compliance assurance, the independence of 
the company’s internal and external auditors and the effectiveness of the
company’s system of accounting, its internal financial controls and the 
internal and external audit functions. 
Members of the committee during 2004 were Dick Olver (Chairman), 
Lawton Fitt and Ken Olisa (since their appointments to the committee on 
6 July 2004 and 16 December 2004 respectively), and Sir John Craven and 
Ian Strachan (until their retirements from the committee on 21 April 2004 
and 8 February 2005 respectively). Each member of the committee is
considered by the Board to be independent including under the SEC 
and NASDAQ definitions. 
The Audit Committee does not include a member who is a ‘financial expert’,
as defined in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules because
the Board considers that none of the members clearly meets all the criteria set
out in the relevant definitions nor has the Board identified a member of the
committee as having recent and relevant financial experience. However, the
Board considers that collectively the members have the requisite skills and
attributes to enable the committee properly to discharge its responsibilities.
The Company Secretary is secretary to the committee.
The Audit Committee’s remit, which is set out in its terms of reference,
includes responsibility for:
• the oversight responsibilities described in the above paragraphs and 
for reviewing compliance with laws, regulations, the company’s code 
of conduct and policies;
•
approving related party transactions to the extent required under 
NASDAQ rules;
• monitoring the integrity of the company’s financial statements and any
announcements relating to the company’s financial performance and
reviewing significant financial reporting judgements contained in them;
•
monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the company’s internal 
audit function;
• making recommendations to the Board, for it to put to the shareholders 
for their approval, regarding the appointment, re-appointment and removal 
of the external auditor and approving the remuneration and terms of
engagement of the external auditor; 
• reviewing and monitoring the external auditor’s independence and the
effectiveness of the audit process and developing and implementing policy
on the engagement of the external auditor to supply non-audit services; and
•
overseeing the receipt, review and treatment of complaints received
regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, auditing and compliance
matters, whether through the company’s ‘whistleblower’ confidential helpline
or otherwise.
The committee met four times in 2004 with the CEO, the CFO, other officers
and the auditors attending as required. The auditors have unrestricted access
to the Audit Committee and, in accordance with usual practice, met twice
during the year privately with the committee, as did the Head of Audit. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
continued Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004   31
The Chairman of the Audit Committee meets with the Head of Audit and with
the external auditors before each Audit Committee meeting. All members of
the Audit Committee attended every committee meeting during the year.
The committee reports its activities and makes recommendations to the Board.
During 2004, the committee discharged the responsibilities described above.
Its activities included:
• formally reviewing the draft annual report and interim statement respectively
and associated announcements, focusing on the main areas of judgement
and critical accounting policies;
• reviewing the findings of the external auditors and the report of the Head 
of Audit on internal audit activities;
•
reviewing the effectiveness of internal control systems, the risk management
process and the compliance programme (including the whistleblower
programme), paying particular attention to the work being undertaken 
in connection with section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
• receiving the report of the CEO and the CFO on the processes 
followed prior to certification being given by them in accordance with
Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
•
reviewing the external audit strategy and the external auditors’ report to 
the committee in respect of the annual report and interim statement;
• keeping under review the proportion of non-audit fees to audit fees 
paid to the auditors and giving pre-approval to non-audit work undertaken 
by the auditors;
•
reviewing the effectiveness of the auditors and undertaking a competitive
audit tender process which resulted in a recommendation being made to the
Board to propose to shareholders that PricewaterhouseCoopers be retained
as the company’s auditors; and
•
reviewing a report on the company’s corporate social responsibility activities.
The committee adopted a code of conduct for the company’s CEO and senior
financial officers in 2003, in addition to the company’s general code of conduct.
No amendments to, or waivers in respect of, either code were made during
2004. A copy of the codes is available on request from the Company Secretary
and can be viewed at www.about.reuters.com. Instinet Group has also
adopted a code of conduct which can be viewed at www.instinetgroup.com
The committee monitors adherence to the company’s Auditor Independence
policy, which it prohibits Group entities from engaging the auditors in activities
prohibited by the SEC. The policy permits the auditors to be engaged for
other services provided the engagement is specifically approved in advance by
the committee or meets the detailed criteria of specific pre-approved activities 
and is notified to the committee. However, any services where the expected 
level of fees is greater than £150,000 or the expected term is longer than 
one year, must be approved in advance by the committee. The exception to 
this is Instinet Group, which uses the same auditors as Reuters and, as a US
publicly traded company, is separately subject to the auditor independence
requirements and has an audit committee which oversees the use by Instinet
of the independent auditors, under its own policy.
For details regarding fees paid to the Group’s auditors, see note 2 on the
consolidated profit and loss account on page 47.
The committee may engage, at the company’s expense, independent counsel
and other advisers as it deems necessary to carry out its duties. None was
engaged during the year.
The Remuneration Committee has oversight of executive remuneration policy.
Information concerning the Remuneration Committee is set out in the
Remuneration Report on page 32.
The Nominations Committee makes recommendations to the Board about
future appointments of non-executive directors, the Chairman and the CEO
and considers recommendations from the CEO to the Board about the future
appointment of executive directors. The committee gives due consideration 
to the Combined Code’s provisions relating to directors when making
appointments to the Board. The terms of reference for the committee are
available from the Company Secretary on request and can be viewed at
www.about.reuters.com
In 2004, the composition of the committee was Sir Christopher Hogg (until 
his retirement in October), Dick Olver, Niall FitzGerald and Charles Sinclair
(since his appointment to the committee in September 2004). The committee
is chaired by Niall FitzGerald. The Board has determined that these directors
are independent according to the NASDAQ and SEC definitions. The terms of
reference require the committee to meet at least twice a year and it did so in
2004. A director may not attend or be involved in any decision concerning him
or his successor. The committee has appointed an external adviser to assist it
in its work in identifying potential candidates for non-executive directorships. 
During 2004, the Nominations Committee recommended to the Board 
the appointments of Penny Hughes, Lawton Fitt and Ken Olisa. It also
recommended the changes that were made to the Board’s committees’
membership during 2004 and the appointment of Dick Olver as senior
independent non-executive director on Sir John Craven’s retirement from 
the Board.
04 EXECUTIVE COMMITTEES
The Group Management Committee (GMC), which is chaired by the CEO,
implements strategy and manages the Group. It comprises the three executive
directors and the senior managers listed on page 27. It met twenty-two times
in 2004. 
A Disclosure Committee, chaired by the CEO was set up in 2002. Its members,
comprise the CEO, the CFO, the Global Head of Corporate Affairs, the
General Counsel & Company Secretary, the Head of Audit, the Head of Global
Finance, the Head of External Reporting, the Area General Counsel for the
Americas and the Head of Investor Relations. The Committee meets formally
five times a year to review the Group’s trading statements and financial 
results and to consider the adequacy of the Group’s disclosure controls and
procedures. A sub-committee meets on an ad hoc basis to address disclosure
matters arising between reporting periods.
05 RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The executive directors meet regularly with institutional shareholders and
analysts. Non-executive directors are offered the opportunity to attend
meetings with major shareholders and from time to time some attend the
presentations of the annual results to analysts. When Niall FitzGerald became
chairman he met with investors who expressed general satisfaction with the
direction, performance and governance of the business.
An investor relations department is dedicated to facilitating communications
between the company and its shareholders. It provides a regular report on
investor relations as part of the routine Board report materials. In 2004 the
company’s brokers carried out a survey of investors’ views and the results of
this survey were communicated to the Board. 
The company’s AGM is used as an opportunity to communicate with private
investors. The chairmen of each of the Board committees are available to
answer questions at the AGM and all directors are expected to attend the
AGM. At the AGM the level of proxies lodged on each resolution and the
balance for and against the resolution and the number of votes withheld are
announced after the resolution has been voted on. At the 2005 AGM we will
be introducing voting by proxy to replace voting by a show of hands as we
consider proxy voting gives a better representation of shareholders’ views. 
The results of voting at the AGM in 2005 will be available at
www.about.reuters.com
06 DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES, INTERNAL CONTROLS 
AND FINANCIAL REPORTING
The directors’ responsibilities and information on internal controls and financial
reporting can be found on page 41. 32 Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004
This report sets out the Reuters Group executive remuneration policy, structure
and details of the remuneration received by directors and senior managers in
respect of the year ended 31 December 2004. Shareholders will be invited to
approve this report at the AGM on 21 April 2005.
01 CONSIDERATION OF REMUNERATION MATTERS
The Board has overall responsibility for determining the framework of
executive remuneration and its cost, and is required to take account of any
recommendations made by the Remuneration Committee. Through formal
terms of reference, the Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee
oversight of the specific remuneration packages for the executive directors and
consideration of executive remuneration issues generally, including the use of
equity incentive plans in particular.
The Remuneration Committee consists solely of non-executive directors. All
members of the Remuneration Committee have been determined by the Board
to be independent as defined by NASDAQ. Its current members are Charles
Sinclair (Chairman), Ed Kozel, Penny Hughes (from 6 July 2004) and Ian Strachan
(from 16 December 2004). Roberto Mendoza ceased to be a member of the
Remuneration Committee on 6 July 2004. The Company Secretary is secretary 
to the Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee met four times 
in 2004. All members were present at each meeting.
The CEO and the Chairman normally attend meetings of the Remuneration
Committee. Neither is present at any discussion concerning his own
remuneration. During 2004, the Remuneration Committee was advised
internally by the Global Head of Human Resources and the Global Head of
Performance & Reward. The terms of reference permit the Remuneration
Committee to obtain its own external advice on any matter, at the company’s
expense. These executives take external advice and information from many
sources in preparing proposals for the Remuneration Committee and received
information from Towers Perrin, Mercer HR Consulting, Watson Wyatt and
Kepler Associates in relation to remuneration decisions made during 2004. In
addition, to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, executives
were provided with advice from Deloitte & Touche LLP, Linklaters and
Shearman and Sterling LLP in respect of the two new share plans introduced 
in 2004, the Annual Bonus Profit Sharing Plan and the Restricted Share Plan.
02 DIRECTORS
The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that remuneration and incentive
arrangements are market-competitive, consistent with best practice and
support the interests of shareholders.
In practical terms, this means that the reward structure for directors should
attract, motivate and retain high-calibre individuals capable of successful
leadership. To achieve this in a global business environment, Reuters executive
remuneration must reflect the competitive practices of its principal competitors
and the other multi-national businesses with which it competes for talent. 
The Remuneration Committee believes that market-determined executive
compensation, with a heavy emphasis on the variable remuneration elements,
is the best way to ensure that Reuters has the high performing executives
necessary to achieve its immediate and longer-term strategic objectives. 
The Remuneration Committee has established a structure that ensures that 
the quantum of remuneration received by executives is commensurate with
returns to shareholders.
Total executive remuneration is calibrated to deliver mid-market rewards 
at formally targeted levels of personal and corporate performance. Variable
reward components provide an opportunity for much higher levels of
remuneration where this is supported by above-target performance, whether
on an individual level or in relation to short-term and longer-term business
priorities. The annual cash bonus plan supports operational objectives over 
the financial year, while the long-term incentive plan will reward superior
performance relative to competitors over the medium term and share options
complement growth objectives.
Reuters continues to ensure that an increasing proportion of executive reward
is variable and wholly dependent upon performance. As such, the structure of
the individual packages currently in place includes a significant proportion of
variable reward that is performance related, with basic pay representing well
under a third of the target earnings potential. In 2004, excluding pension
entitlements, the targeted composition of each executive director’s
remuneration was as follows:
Fixed Variable 
Long-term
Base pay Bonus incentives Total
% % % %
Tom Glocer 17% 26% 57% 100%
David Grigson 29% 29% 42% 100%
Devin Wenig 29% 29% 42% 100%
Executive directors are required to build and maintain a personal equity stake
in the company. The personal shareholding policy requires each executive
director to accumulate a personal holding worth twice his basic salary within
five years.
03 NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Details of non-executive director appointments are contained on page 26.
Non-executive directors have letters of engagement rather than service
contracts and are not eligible to participate in executive share plans. 
Charles Sinclair was invited to join the Board in October 1993, Dick Olver in
September 1997, Ed Kozel in February 2000, Ian Strachan in April 2000, Niall
FitzGerald in January 2003, Ken Olisa in April 2004, and Penny Hughes and
Lawton Fitt in July 2004. Sir John Craven, who had been a non-executive
director since February 1997, resigned from the Board on 22 April 2004 and
Roberto Mendoza, who had been a non-executive director since February
1998, resigned on 6 July 2004. No letter of engagement contains any
provision for compensation in the event of termination outside of the periods
referred to above.
The Chairman’s remuneration is determined by the Board who, in reaching
future decisions on appropriate fee levels, will continue to have regard to the
remuneration arrangements of chairmen of other UK listed companies of a
similar size and complexity.
Sir Christopher Hogg was Chairman from 1985 until 30 September 2004, when
he also retired from the Board. His annual fee was £290,000. In addition, he
received a pension entitlement as detailed on page 37. On 1 October 2004,
Niall FitzGerald succeeded Sir Christopher Hogg as Chairman. Niall FitzGerald
receives an annual fee of £500,000. This fee is fixed until 1 October 2007. 
The company does not provide a pension contribution to Niall FitzGerald.
Our shareholders determine the remuneration paid to the non-executive
directors. From 1 January 2004, this is set at £50,000.
The Board determines the fees payable to each non-executive director who
chairs a Board committee. For 2004, these were £15,000 per annum, £10,000
per annum and £5,000 per annum for chairing the Audit, Remuneration and
Nominations Committees respectively. Until his retirement on 30 September
2004, Sir Christopher Hogg was Chairman of the Nominations Committee: he
waived receipt of any fees. Niall FitzGerald succeeded Sir Christopher Hogg
and he has also waived receipt of any committee chairmanship fees. Dick Olver,
who replaced Sir John Craven as senior independent non-executive director,
receives an additional £5,000 per annum for this role. From 2004, non-executive
directors who are resident outside of Europe are eligible to receive a travel
allowance of £5,000 for each Board meeting attended in the UK.
04 REMUNERATION STRUCTURE
It is Reuters general policy to construct executive remuneration packages as
described below. However, in order to safeguard Reuters ability to recruit and
retain the best senior executives, the Remuneration Committee believes it
needs to maintain the freedom to negotiate terms of employment on an
individual basis, taking account of the circumstances of each case. Where it is
necessary, special arrangements will also be made to accommodate the needs
of, for example, international executives who are required to relocate.
Basic salary and benefits
In formulating and reviewing pay packages for the executive directors, 
the Remuneration Committee receives comparator group information 
and assistance from independent remuneration consultants. In 2004, the
Remuneration Committee reviewed the comparator group and reaffirmed 
its relevance. Reuters policy is to maintain a salary structure with salary ranges
based upon the mid-market of this comparator group of companies. Individual
salaries are positioned at an appropriate point within the salary range. In
recognition of a reliance on the intellectual capital of its people, where
appropriate, actual salaries are centred around the upper quartile position. 
REMUNERATION REPORT
  Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004   33
The Remuneration Committee takes account of the salary levels of other
executives and senior managers. The executive directors indicated that they
did not wish to receive a salary increase in 2004 and this was affirmed by the
Remuneration Committee.
Non-cash benefits are provided to executive directors and the Chairman 
in line with normal market practice and detailed on pages 36-37. All executive
directors receive a company car or an allowance and private healthcare
benefits. Death and disability benefits are also provided to each executive
director. Niall FitzGerald does not receive any death and disability or other
benefits. Under the terms of Tom Glocer’s relocation agreement, Reuters
Group provides accommodation in the UK and pays home leave expenses 
for him and his family.
Pensions
All executive directors participate in defined contribution arrangements. 
Since April 1999 it has been Reuters policy that all new UK employees,
including executive directors, are offered participation in a defined contribution
pension plan. In the case of UK executive directors, in lieu of pension provisions
above the statutory earnings cap (where applicable) an additional taxable
allowance is granted. The Remuneration Committee may substitute certain
benefits following changes to UK pensions legislation. However, there is no
intention to provide any additional compensation as a consequence of such
changes. In the US, all employees are offered participation in a defined
contribution (401K) plan. In lieu of a contribution on salary above the tax
qualified limit, an additional contribution is granted to a Supplemental
Employee Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). The SERP is unfunded.
Annual performance-related bonus
Contractual bonus arrangements are negotiated individually. The
Remuneration Committee determines performance targets annually. 
Bonus payments are non-pensionable.
In 2004, the executive directors were eligible for an annual cash bonus, 
with a maximum level of 100% of base salary for all but Tom Glocer, whose
maximum level was 150% of salary. Bonus targets were set on a sliding scale
and included a mix of financial and strategic measures: 60% of the bonus
potential was based on performance against financial measures (30% of which
was dependent on our budgeted operating profit before restructuring,
amortisation of goodwill and other intangibles and impairments – Target
Operating Profit; 15% on our budgeted revenue; and 15% on a free cash flow
target). The remainder of the bonus potential was divided equally between a
target to improve the customer satisfaction survey result and the achievement
of the Fast Forward programme transformational targets. In addition, stretch
targets were established on the revenue measure and customer satisfaction
result where, for significant out-performance, there was the potential for an
additional 17.5% of bonus target. In February 2005, the Remuneration
Committee considered 2004 performance, relative to the specified targets,
and determined that the executive directors had earned bonuses of 99.4% 
of bonus potential. 
Given that 2005 is the final year of the Fast Forward programme, the
Remuneration Committee has increased the focus on achieving the financial
results associated with the Fast Forward programme. In 2005, the Remuneration
Committee will increase the emphasis on financial performance, with 80% of
the maximum bonus potential being measured against Target Operating Profit,
budgeted revenue and free cash flow targets with the remainder on customer
satisfaction results. There is the potential to earn additional bonus payments
based on significant out-performance against Target Operating Profit and
customer satisfaction targets.
The Remuneration Committee retained the profit threshold, based on Target
Operating Profit, below which no bonuses will be paid. The Remuneration
Committee reviewed the shareholding requirements for the executive directors.
Taking this into account, together with the changes in the tax treatment of
deferred compensation in the US, the Remuneration Committee decided that
no share-based deferral will apply to bonus payments. However, Tom Glocer
has committed to increase his investment in Reuters shares by an amount at
least equivalent in value to the post-tax component that would otherwise have
been deferred.
Equity incentive plans
The executive directors also participate in a discretionary stock option plan
(DSOP) and a long-term incentive plan (LTIP) designed to reward longer-term
performance. Details of all share incentive awards outstanding for each
executive director serving during 2004 are set out on pages 38 and 39.
All executive directors’ future entitlements are subject to the performance
conditions applicable to the relevant plan. The Remuneration Committee has
initiated a review of remuneration arrangements, including the structure of
equity plans, to ensure that these are aligned with the achievement of the
objectives to be established in Reuters growth strategy post the Fast Forward
programme. Until completion of this review, other than as described below, 
Reuters has no present intention of making any significant change to the
executive directors’ existing entitlements under these plans.
In 2004, the Remuneration Committee introduced an Annual Bonus Profit
Sharing Plan and a Restricted Share Plan as discussed below.
LTIP: since 1993, Reuters has operated a long-term incentive plan which seeks 
to encourage and reward long-term growth in shareholder value. It is Reuters
practice to make an annual award of contingent share rights to executive
directors and to those senior managers most able to influence corporate
performance. From 2003, awards have been based on the fair market value
per share using option pricing methodology. The fair market value ascribed 
to each share for LTIP purposes is presently 43.8% of current market value.
The Remuneration Committee considers that relative total shareholder return
(TSR) remains the most appropriate measurement criterion for the LTIP. Whilst
endorsing relative TSR as a measure, the Remuneration Committee recognises
that we do not fall naturally into any one of the existing FTSE industrial sectors.
Accordingly, following a review of the comparator group, the Remuneration
Committee believes that the FTSE 100 generally, rather than one individual
sector or a bespoke peer group e.g. media and photography, remains the
most appropriate peer group for comparison purposes.
Under the terms of his service contract, annual equity awards to Tom Glocer
will be based on a fair market value, calibrated by reference to the average 
of the mid-market position of a comparator group of FTSE 100 companies,
with significant international operations (excluding the top and bottom five
companies measured by market capitalisation) and the mid-market position 
of a US comparator group comprising media companies. For both comparator
groups, the data has been provided by Towers Perrin. LTIP awards will form
part of the total equity grant. Details of the grants for 2004 are set out in the
table on page 38.
For 2005, it is anticipated that the fair market value of Tom Glocer’s LTIP award
will be approximately 100% of basic salary. David Grigson and Devin Wenig will
receive awards of equivalent value: due to exchange rate fluctuations this
represents a fair market value of around 67% and 85% of basic salary for David
Grigson and Devin Wenig respectively. To be consistent with the objectives of
the plan, and to ensure growth is measured relative to other major UK
companies, performance is measured over a three-year period by comparing
Reuters TSR with that of other companies comprising the FTSE 100 at the
beginning of the period. The companies are ranked according to their TSR for
the measurement period with the company having the highest TSR ranked first.
As a matter of good practice, the measurements are verified independently
before being presented to the Remuneration Committee for approval.
For 2004 awards, Reuters position on the list determines the extent to which
plan awards will vest. Reuters must achieve median TSR performance for a
proportion of the award to vest: full vesting only occurs for top quartile
performance. At the 2004 AGM and from 2004, the shareholders approved the
removal of the re-testing provision and accordingly the plan will not permit any
extension of the measurement period if the awards do not, or only partially,
vest. Awards that do not meet at least the median performance condition on
completion of the performance period will lapse. Future awards shall continue
to vest in full for top quartile performance, with one-third of the initial award
vesting for median performance, with proportionate vesting for incremental
performance between these points. 
For awards made prior to 2003 that do not vest or only partially vest after
three years, the plan permits the measurement period to be extended by 
up to two years under a re-testing provision. Awards granted in 2000 did not
meet the performance condition required for vesting and accordingly, these
awards lapsed. 34 Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004
The pre-set vesting criteria for awards which vested during 2004 or which have
not yet vested are shown in the table below together with the actual ranking 
at 31 December 2004 (or on vesting if earlier). Awards granted prior to 2004
that vest under the plan are not released until at least five years from the 
date of grant.
Pre-set vesting criteria

1 January 2003 1 to 25 51 to 100 70
1 January 2004 1 to 25 51 to 100 1
In order to smooth the opening and closing points of measurement, the
average of the daily closing prices for the immediately preceding twelve
months is used as the initial and final share prices when calculating the TSR.
Shares awarded under the plan will continue to be met from existing shares
held by Reuters employee share ownership trusts (ESOTs). The costs are
charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting periods.
DSOP: a global discretionary stock option plan was adopted by the
Remuneration Committee in October 2000 and approved by shareholders 
in April 2001. It aims to reward growth in earnings and in the share price.
Therefore, the options granted to executive directors can only vest if the
percentage growth in our basic earnings per share (EPS) exceeds the
percentage growth in the retail price index by more than 9% over the three
year performance period. For awards made prior to 2004, if the target is not
met, the performance period may be extended by up to two years with an
increase of 3% in the hurdle rate of EPS growth for each year added to the
performance period. If the target rate is not met by the end of the fifth year,
the options will lapse.
These performance conditions were established in 2001 to retain management
focus on earnings in a particularly challenging market. The Remuneration
Committee believes that it is appropriate to retain these performance
conditions for executive directors until the completion of the remuneration
review referred to above. The review will determine whether it is appropriate
to continue to operate the DSOP and if so, to determine whether an EPS
performance condition is appropriate. The review will also consider whether 
it is more appropriate to use alternative equity related arrangements for the
executive directors as Reuters looks beyond the Fast Forward programme.
From 2004, the re-testing provisions have been removed and accordingly, new
awards will not permit any extension of the measurement period. If the awards
do not meet the EPS performance condition upon completion of the initial
performance period they will lapse.
The performance conditions have been measured for the 2001 and 2002
grants: the first grants to executive directors with these performance
conditions. The performance conditions were not met for either grant.
The executive directors are contractually entitled to participate in the DSOP.
Under the terms of his service contract, annual equity awards to Tom Glocer
are based on a fair market value using the option pricing methodology which
currently ascribes to each share a value of 25.4% of the market price. 2004
awards are detailed in the table set out on page 39. For 2005, it is anticipated
that the fair market value of Tom Glocer’s DSOP award will be approximately
200% of basic salary. David Grigson and Devin Wenig will receive awards of
equivalent value. As the awards are calculated in sterling and Devin Wenig’s
salary is denominated in US dollars, the proportion of his salary actually awarded
is impacted by the exchange rate. At present, these awards represent a fair
market value of approximately 133% and 170% of basic salary for David Grigson
and Devin Wenig respectively. It is the Remuneration Committee’s practice 
to divide participants’ annual entitlements into two awards, normally made
following the announcement of preliminary annual and half-yearly results. 
With effect from 2004, to reduce the dilutive impact DSOPs have on
shareholders’ interests, the number of participants was reduced significantly.
Any participation will normally be confined to executive directors and
members of the GMC. Other employees may be eligible to participate in 
the Restricted Share Plan (see following).
SAYE Plan: an all-employee international savings related share option plan is
offered in which the executive directors are eligible to participate. Participants
save a fixed monthly amount of up to £250 (subject to a maximum, established
annually for each offer) for three years and are then able to use their savings 
to buy shares at a price set at a 20% discount to the market value at the start
of the savings period. In line with market practice, no performance conditions
are attached to options granted under this plan. For the 2004 offer, the fixed
monthly savings amount was established at a maximum of £100 per month
with a three year savings period.
Legacy plans: the following four plans are legacy plans under which Tom
Glocer and Devin Wenig received awards prior to becoming executive
directors. It is not intended that executive directors should receive any further
awards under these plans.
Performance related share plan (PRSP): this plan operated from 1995 to 2001
and targeted senior executives not participating in the LTIP. Tom Glocer and
Devin Wenig hold awards granted before they became executive directors.
The performance condition is the same as for the LTIP, although vested shares
can be released three years after grant.
Deferred bonus share plan (DBSP): restricted share awards were made in 
2000 as a special retention bonus to a total of around 100 senior managers,
excluding the executive directors in office at that time. As a retention tool, 
and in line with the then market practice, they were made conditional only 
on remaining in employment until the shares vested. These awards vested in
February 2002 and February 2003. Tom Glocer has previously deferred the
vesting of his shares under the plans: these are due to vest in April 2005. The
shares awarded under the plan are satisfied by existing shares from ESOTs.
Executive stock option plan (ESOP): Tom Glocer participated in an executive
stock option plan operated in 1993 and 1994 prior to being appointed to the
Board. Options under the plan carry no performance conditions and vested
automatically on the third anniversary of grant.
Plan 2000: a one-off all-employee option grant was made in 1998 in order 
to support the retention of employees over the millennium period. In common
with such all-employee plans, there is no performance condition to be
satisfied. All employees, including the executive directors, were given the
opportunity to apply for an option to acquire 2,000 shares at an exercise price
of £5.50 per share. These options became exercisable in September 2001 
and will normally expire in September 2005. A small supplementary grant 
was made to new employees in March 1999, at an option price of £8.14 and
these will normally expire in March 2006. We may issue new shares to satisfy
options granted under this plan.
Annual Bonus Profit Sharing Plan: on 18 December 2003, Reuters announced 
its intention to introduce a new profit-sharing plan across the all-employee
population. This plan was introduced to focus employees on reward for profit
growth. Executive directors and members of the GMC did not participate in 
this plan in 2004. For 2005, participation in this plan will exclude other senior
executives. For 2004 performance awards will be made equivalent to 2% of
the basic salary. Payments under the plan will typically be made in the form 
of shares which will normally be subject to a 12 month vesting period.
Restricted Share Plan (RSP): on 17 April 2004, at the AGM, the shareholders
approved the introduction in 2004 of the RSP. Currently restricted shares will
not normally be granted for long-term incentive purposes to executive
directors or members of the GMC. It is intended that, other than for executive
directors and GMC members, employees will be eligible to participate in this
plan instead of the DSOP. This plan enables Reuters to provide market-
competitive remuneration, whilst reducing the dilution impact to shareholders.
Other than in 2004, the year of introduction, employees would generally not
be eligible to participate in the DSOP and the RSP in the same year. Following
the introduction of the Annual Bonus Profit Sharing Plan, for 2005, the number
of participants in the RSP will be significantly lower than in 2004. This will
reduce the dilutive impact of the RSP.

05 PERFORMANCE GRAPH
Reuters TSR for the five years to 31 December 2004 compared with the return
achieved by the FTSE 100 index of companies is shown below. This index is
used as the comparator group for the performance conditions attached to the
LTIP and PRSP referred to above. The calculations assume the reinvestment of
dividends. Performance in respect of individual awards is shown on page 34.
06 SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKING SHARE PLANS
A few subsidiary undertakings operate share plans over new or existing 
shares for their directors and employees. Of these, only the stock option 
plans operated by the Instinet Group are significant for the Group.
The Instinet 2000 Stock Option Plan permits the grant of options up to a
maximum of 44.1 million shares of the common stock outstanding. Options may
be granted to directors and employees of Instinet Group at an exercise price 
of not less than fair market value at the date of grant. Options normally vest in
instalments over a three- or four-year period and may not exceed a term of ten
years. Approximately 885 employees and directors of Instinet Group participate
in the plan. At 31 December 2004, options were outstanding over approximately
25.8 million Instinet Group shares, equivalent to 7.7% of Instinet Group’s
outstanding common stock. These options have exercise prices ranging 
from US$3.25 to US$18.70 per share with a term of seven years from grant.
As a result of the acquisition by the Instinet Group of Island in 2002, a 
further 416,406 shares under option were outstanding under the Island stock
option plan (and are now exercisable into Instinet Group common stock) 
as at 31 December 2004. Exercise prices range from US$0.91 to US$9.23 
(on an adjusted basis) with a term of ten years from grant. In 2004 Instinet
obtained shareholder approval for a new Performance Share Plan, whereupon
shares may vest to participants if Instinet achieves certain specified
performance objectives over a three year period. For 2004 grants, the
performance condition related to the achievement of a target return on equity.
07 SERVICE CONTRACTS
It is Reuters policy that new executive directors be offered notice periods 
of not more than one year. Reuters recognises, however, that, in the case 
of appointments from outside the company, a longer notice period may
initially be necessary, reducing to one year subsequently. The Remuneration
Committee ensures that appropriate provisions are in place in the event 
of the termination of any director’s service contract.
Tom Glocer has a service contract, with an effective date of 23 July 2001,
normally terminable by him on 90 days’ notice or, where due to our fault, on
30 days’ notice. We may terminate without cause on 30 days’ notice. In the
event of termination by Tom Glocer due to our fault or by us without cause,
Tom Glocer’s compensation will be limited to a maximum of 12 months’
accrued benefits being annual salary, annual bonus and pension contributions.
However, in the event of a change in control of the company, Tom Glocer
would have been entitled to a maximum amount of compensation based 
on 20 months’ salary, annual bonus and pension contributions, if such 
change of control had occured prior to 1 July 2004. He will be entitled to 
16 months’ salary, annual bonus and pension contributions, if such event
occurs prior to 1 July 2005 and 12 months’ salary, annual bonus and pension
contributions thereafter.
In the event of termination at any time which is not due to the fault of 
Tom Glocer, he retains the benefit of any outstanding share plan awards as if
his employment had not ceased. In addition, Tom Glocer and his family retain 
the life assurance and private healthcare benefits provided by Reuters for 
one year following termination.
David Grigson’s and Devin Wenig’s contracts have effective dates of 21 June
2001 and 17 February 2003 respectively, and can be terminated on one year’s
notice. Any termination payment will not exceed an amount equal to the sum
of annual salary, bonus and 12 months’ pension contributions paid by Reuters.
On a change of control of the company, all the executive directors are entitled
to terminate their contracts on one month’s notice unless the acquiring party
has, within three months of the change of control, agreed to adopt and 
uphold the Reuters Trust Principles (see page 82). Termination payments of 
a maximum of 12 months’ salary, annual bonus and 12 months’ pension
contributions are payable to David Grigson and Devin Wenig (and to Tom
Glocer as previously detailed) in such circumstances.
All executive directors have contractual terms that limit the ability of an
executive director to work for a defined list of competitor companies for a
period of time. These provisions are in place to protect intellectual property
and commercially sensitive information.
08 POLICY ON EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
Reuters recognises that executive directors may be invited to become non-
executive directors of other companies or to become involved in charitable 
or public service organisations. As the Board believes that this can broaden
the knowledge and experience of directors to its benefit, it is Reuters policy 
to approve such appointments, provided there is no conflict of interest and 
the commitment required is not excessive. Board approval is required and
directors are permitted to retain cash-only fees paid for such appointments.
No executive directors retained any fees for external directorships during 2004
except for Devin Wenig who received fees of US$19,125, which includes an
annual fee of US$3,000 and US$16,125 in fees for attending board and
committee meetings, and US$3,913 in travel expenses, in his capacity as
director of Nastech Pharmaceutical Company.

Note:
1 Following Sir Christopher Hogg’s retirement on 30 September 2004 and in accordance with the provisions contained in his Pension Deed we elected to pay a lump sum of £2,257,967 in substitution 
for the pension benefit due. The difference between the lump sum and the transfer value of the accrued pension as at 31 December 2003 represents the increase in the value of Sir Christopher Hogg’s
accrued benefits during 2004. The amount of the lump sum was calculated by an independent actuary, as the net present value of the pension benefit that would otherwise be payable to 
Sir Christopher Hogg. There was therefore no remaining obligation in relation to pension benefits at the year-end.
Reuters also paid an amount of £3,600 in respect of life cover for Sir Christopher Hogg.
The information shown complies with requirements under both the UK Listing Authority and the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. The transfer
value at the start of the year has been calculated in accordance with the guidance note ‘GN11’ published by the Institute of Actuaries and Faculty of Actuaries.
The total amount of contributions or accruals made in 2004 to provide pension and similar benefits for the directors was £693,315 (2003: £368,000) and for the
directors and the other senior managers as a group was £1,622,626 (2003: £1,024,000). These figures include the increase in the value of Sir Christopher Hogg’s
accrued benefits over the nine months to his retirement and the contribution of £460,000 paid into the Reuters Supplementary Pension Scheme in respect of
David Ure (see the past directors section below for further details). These aggregate figures also include an accrual of £58,000 and £65,000 respectively for the
investment returns within the US executive pension arrangements. These investment returns are calculated based on each individual’s notional fund choices made
by reference to actual investment funds and the actual investment returns achieved on these funds.

11 PENSION ARRANGEMENTS FOR PAST DIRECTORS
David Ure served as a director between June 1989 and July 2000. He retired
from employment on 5 August 2004 and, in accordance with the rules of the
Reuters Supplementary Pension Scheme, was entitled to an early retirement
pension of two-thirds of final pensionable salary, without reduction. Final
pensionable salary under the scheme is defined as the highest basic salary 
over any twelve months in the five years prior to retirement, with the full-time
equivalent of basic salary being used for any periods of part-time employment.
Reuters made a special contribution of £460,000 to the Reuters Supplementary
Pension Scheme to allow for the funding cost of these early retirement benefits.
Reuters carried out a partial restructuring of its UK approved pension
arrangements for senior employees during the year. As part of this
rearrangement, the pension liabilities within the Reuters Pension Fund for a
number of retired past directors were transferred to the Reuters Supplementary
Pension Scheme in November 2004. There was no change to the benefits
payable to the individuals as a result of the transfer. The past directors
involved were Sir Peter Job, Jean-Claude Marchand, John Parcell, Robert
Rowley, David Ure, André Villeneuve, Geoffrey Weetman and Mark Wood.

  Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004   41
01 FINANCIAL REPORTING
The directors are required by UK company law to prepare financial statements
for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of
the company and the Group as at the end of the financial year and of the
profit and cash flows of the Group for the period. Reuters Group is also
required to prepare financial statements in accordance with the requirements
of the SEC.
Reuters Group has complied with both UK and US disclosure requirements 
in this report in order to present a true and fair view to all shareholders. In
preparing the financial statements, applicable accounting standards have been
followed, suitable accounting policies have been used and applied consistently,
and reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates have been made 
where appropriate.
The directors have reviewed the budget and cash flow forecasts for the Group
and the company for the year to 31 December 2005 and outline projections
for the subsequent year in the light of the financial position and borrowing
facilities at 31 December 2004. On the basis of this review, the directors are
satisfied that Reuters Group is a going concern and have continued to adopt
the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
02 RISK MANAGEMENT, INTERNAL CONTROLS AND DISCLOSURE
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
The directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Group’s system of
internal control and confirm they have reviewed its effectiveness. In doing 
so, the Board has taken note of the Guidance on Internal Control (the 
Turnbull Guidance) contained in the Combined Code.
The Board confirms that it has adopted a process for identifying, evaluating
and managing significant risks faced by the Group. This process, which accords
with the Turnbull guidance, has been in place for the full financial year and is
ongoing. The control system includes:
• objective setting, risk assessment and monitoring of performance at 
both strategic and business unit levels though a process known within 
the company as ‘mission analysis’;
• the use of ‘balanced scorecards’ to track performance against targets relating to
the financial, business, people and customer aspects of the company’s business; 
• written policies and control procedures;
• monthly financial reporting to the Board and senior management which,
amongst other things, tracks performance against the annual budget; and
• systems to communicate rapidly to appropriate managers incidents 
requiring immediate attention.
In a group of the size, complexity and geographical diversity of Reuters 
it should be expected that breakdowns in established control procedures 
might occur. There are supporting policies and procedures for reporting and
management of control breakdowns. The Board considers that the control
system is appropriately designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and
not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The concept 
of reasonable assurance recognises that the cost of a control procedure should
not exceed the expected benefits.
Using a common risk management framework throughout Reuters, each of the
principal business and functional units summarises the risks that could impede
the achievement of its objectives. For each significant risk, line managers
document an overview of the risk, how it is managed and any improvement
actions required. A document called a ‘risk radar’ is created which sets out the
main strategic, operational and financial risks that have been identified. This
document is reviewed by the Group Management Committee (GMC) 
and the Board. 
At the year end, before producing the statement on internal control in the
annual report and Form 20-F, the CEO and CFO meet with members of the
GMC and others to consider formally the operation and effectiveness of the
company’s risk management and financial, operational and compliance internal
control systems. This review includes consideration of self-assessment reports
from line management and covers each of the most significant risks the
company faces and how well these are controlled and managed. The CEO and
the CFO report on the results of this review to the Audit Committee and to the
Board. The Disclosure Committee (described on page 31) supports the process
by reviewing disclosure controls and procedures.
Instinet Group, which is listed on NASDAQ, has its own systems of risk
management and internal controls on which it reports to its shareholders. 
Reuters executive directors are members of the Instinet Group board. The
boards of Radianz Limited and Factiva, which include Reuters representatives,
have responsibility for adopting processes for identifying, evaluating and
managing significant risks in their respective businesses. Reuters assessment 
of the main risks relating to its affiliate companies and Instinet Group are
reviewed by the CEO and the CFO who also report on the results of these
reviews to the Audit Committee and to the Board. 
In addition to the self-assessment and management review procedures,
Reuters monitors its internal financial control system through a programme 
of internal audits. Internal auditors independently review the controls in place 
to manage significant risks and report to the Audit Committee twice a year.
The Audit Committee reviews annually the assurance procedures, including
compliance controls, and reports their findings to the Board.
The Group’s external auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, have audited 
the financial statements and have reviewed the work of internal auditors 
and the internal control systems to the extent they consider necessary to
support their audit report. The Audit Committee has met the internal auditors 
and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to discuss the results of their work.
During 2004, the directors were not aware of any control breakdowns that
resulted in a material loss.
At the end of the period, Reuters management carried out an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Group’s disclosure controls
and procedures. These are designed to ensure that information required to 
be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is
recorded, summarised and reported within specific time periods. Based on this
evaluation, the CEO and the CFO concluded that the design and operation of
these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as at 31 December
2004 to a reasonable assurance level (within the meaning of the US federal
securities laws).
During the year, two accounting adjustments were identified by management
which related to prior accounting periods, and together were considered
material. The 2003 and 2002 UK to US GAAP reconciliations have been
restated accordingly. These adjustments are discussed on page 74 and have
the effect of increasing the Group’s profits in each of 2002 and 2003 as stated
under US GAAP. No adjustments are required in respect of the Group’s 
primary UK GAAP financial statements and no issues of governance arise as a
consequence of making these adjustments. The CEO and the CFO believe 
that the need for this restatement constitutes a significant control deficiency
but not a material control weakness (as such terms are used in the US federal
securities laws) for the period under review. This conclusion is based on the
fact that control procedures have improved year on year leading to the
identification and correction of the issues for the 2004 year end.
No significant changes were made in the Group’s internal controls over
financial reporting during the period covered by this report that materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to affect materially, the Group’s internal
control over financial reporting.
Instinet Group’s annual report for 2004 will contain an internal control report 
as required by section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Please refer to Instinet’s
annual report for its internal control report. Reuters Group’s Annual Report and
Form 20-F for 2006 is also expected to contain an internal control report, so
Reuters management and auditors have taken during 2004, and will be taking
throughout 2005 and 2006, steps in preparation for the section 404 reporting
and attestation requirements that are scheduled to be met in respect of the
financial year ending 31 December 2006.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 42 Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004
UNITED KINGDOM OPINION/UNITED STATES OPINION
UNITED KINGDOM OPINION
Independent auditors’ report to the members of Reuters Group PLC
We have audited the financial statements which comprise the consolidated
profit and loss account, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated cash
flow statement, the statement of total recognised gains and losses and the
related notes and the balance sheet of Reuters Group PLC which have been
prepared under the historical cost convention and the accounting policies 
set out in the statement of accounting policies. We have also audited the
disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985
contained in section 9 of the Remuneration Report (‘the auditable part’).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and
accounting standards are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
The directors are also responsible for preparing the Remuneration Report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part 
of the Remuneration Report in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and
only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of
the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this
opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give 
a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the auditable 
part of the Remuneration Report have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the
directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the company
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified
by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and Form 
20-F and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of 
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial
statements. The other information comprises only those sections set out 
in the table of contents, including the Chairman’s statement, the Directors’
report, the report on Corporate governance, the unaudited part of the
Remuneration Report, the statement of the directors’ responsibilities and 
the Operating and financial review.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the company’s
compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 Combined Code specified 
for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and 
we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk
and control procedures.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued 
by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and the auditable part of the Remuneration Report. It also includes
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the
directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information 
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us 
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements and the auditable part of the Remuneration Report are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. 
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the affairs of the company and the Group at 31 December 2004 and of 
the profit and cash flows of the Group for the year then ended and have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. Those parts 
of the Remuneration Report required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to 
the Companies Act 1985 have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985.

UNITED STATES OPINION
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated profit and loss account, consolidated cash flow statement and
statement of total recognised gains and losses present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Reuters Group PLC and its subsidiaries 
at 31 December, 2004, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December,
2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
Kingdom. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Group’s
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in the Accounting policies, the Group changed its method of
accounting for employee share ownership trusts, employee share schemes 
and transaction-related regulatory fees in 2004, in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom. The change has been
accounted for by restating comparative information at 31 December 2003 
and 2002 and for the years then ended.
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom vary in
certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted 
in the United States of America. Information relating to the nature and effect
of such differences is presented in the Summary of differences between 
UK and US generally accepted accounting principles, as restated in the
consolidated financial statements.

01 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
The tables below show a segmental analysis of revenue, costs and results which reflect the way Reuters was managed during 2004 and the management of
Instinet Group as a separate business within the Reuters Group. From 1 January 2004, management changed the structure of its Customer Segments to more
closely reflect the communities they serve. This is explained in more detail on pages 7-8. Prior periods have been restated to reflect changes in the management
of costs and revenues resulting from the change in segment structure, the adoption of UITF17 and UITF38, and the reclassification of transaction-related
regulatory fees following recently issued SEC guidance (see ‘Accounting Basis’ on page 72).
Reuters revenue is allocated to Customer Segments by reference to product families which map directly to only one Customer Segment with two exceptions.
Reuters Xtra family and Reuters Trader family revenues are initially fully attributed to the Sales & Trading Customer Segment. Those revenues earned from
Research & Asset Management customers are then re-allocated to that Customer Segment based on management judgement and by reference to the activities
at particular customer sites. Recoveries revenues arise when Reuters recharges costs, primarily exchange fees and communication costs, to customers. The
revenues received from customers almost exactly match the exchange fees and communication costs incurred within Channel costs.
Segmental revenue less direct Customer Segment costs does not purport to represent segmental profitability. Direct Customer Segment costs include the costs 
of global Customer Segment management, marketing, non-integrated businesses and specific revenue related activities. The majority of revenue related costs 
are included within the Channels, Operations & Technology, Content and Corporate Services.

01 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS continued
Revenue is normally invoiced in the geographical area in which the customer is located. Revenue earned, therefore, generally represents revenue both by origin
and by destination.
The geographical analysis of performance reflects the revenues earned and operating costs incurred in each area excluding amortisation and impairment 
of goodwill and other intangibles and net currency gain.

United Kingdom and Ireland revenue was £380 million (2003: £428 million, 2002: £485 million). With the exception of Instinet Group, Reuters products are
delivered and sold primarily through a common geographical infrastructure and delivered over a number of communications networks.
The impact of the Multex acquisition in 2003 and the Island acquisition in 2002 are reflected primarily in the Americas.

The directors believe that the nature of Reuters Group’s business is such that the format of the analysis of operating costs required by the Companies Act 1985 
is not appropriate. The format has been adopted in a manner consistent with Reuters Group’s activities. Services include equipment hire and bought-in services,
including consultancy and contractors, advertising and publicity, professional fees and staff-related expenses. Other operating income primarily comprises
amounts received from joint ventures in respect of costs incurred by Reuters on their behalf.

12 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Discussion of the Group’s objectives and policies for the management of financial instruments and associated risks together with information relating to hedging
activities is included under ‘Treasury policies, financing and foreign exchange’ in the Operating and Financial Review on pages 21-22.
A substantial portion of Reuters Group revenue is receivable in foreign currencies with terms of payment up to three months in advance. As such, Reuters Group
is subject to currency exposure from committed revenue and, additionally, to interest rate risk from borrowing and the investment of cash balances. Reuters
Group seeks to limit these risks by entering into a mix of derivative financial instruments.
If the derivative financial instruments were considered separately from the underlying future revenue and interest, Reuters Group would be subject to market risk
on these financial instruments from fluctuations in currency and interest rates. Reuters Group only enters into such derivative financial instruments to hedge (or
reduce) the underlying exposure described above. There is, therefore, no net market risk on such derivative financial instruments and only a credit risk from the
potential non-performance by counterparties. The amount of this credit risk is generally restricted to any hedging gain and not the principal amount hedged.

The following table provides an analysis by currency of derivative contracts held for currency hedging purposes as at 31 December. Comparatives have been

The results of currency and interest rate hedging activities for the three years to December 2004 are as summarised below:

2004 2003 2002
Recognised gains/(losses)  £m £m £m
Currency hedging 29 11 10
Interest rate hedging  10 (3) (2)
Recognised currency hedging gains in 2004 were favourable mainly due to the effect of the weaker US dollar on hedges of the net investment in overseas
subsidiaries.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised. Unrecognised gains and losses
on instruments used for hedging, and the movements, are set out below:
Gain (Losses) Net

Unrecognised at 1 January 2004 5 (4) 1

Of which: 
Expected to be recognised in 2005 1 (1) –
Expected to be recognised in 2006 or later  11 (1) 10
Net unrecognised gains on derivatives used for hedging were £10 million at 31 December 2004 compared to £1 million at 31 December 2003 and £nil at 
31 December 2002.
The weighted average variable rate payable on the interest rate swaps used to alter the currency and interest rate profile of debt issued at 31 December 2004
was 3% (2003: 3%, 2002: 4%). The weighted average variable rate is based on the rate implied in the yield curve at the balance sheet date.
All derivative instruments are unsecured. However, Reuters Group does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparties who are all banks with recognised 
long-term credit ratings of ‘A3/A-’ or higher.

The fair value of fixed asset investments and investments held for sale is the carrying value unless the investment has a readily determinable market value 
which is higher.
The fair value of listed short-term investments was based on quoted market prices for those investments. The carrying amount of the other short-term deposits
and investments approximated to their fair values due to the short maturity of the instruments held.
The fair value of short-term borrowings approximated to the carrying value due to the short maturity of the investments.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the above analysis and all other disclosures in this note, other than the currency risk disclosures. NOTES ON THE CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENT

Financial instrument sensitivity analysis
The analysis below summarises the sensitivity of the fair value of the Group’s financial instruments to hypothetical changes in market rates. Fair values are the
present value of future cash flows based on market rates at the valuation date.
The estimated adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments are based on an instantaneous:
i) 1% increase in the specific rate of interest from the levels effective at 31 December 2004 with all other variables remaining constant; and
ii) 10% weakening in the value of sterling against all other currencies from the levels applicable at 31 December 2004 with all other variables remaining constant.

Exchange differences that arise as a consequence of trading transactions and the translation of monetary assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and loss
account. In accordance with the Group’s accounting policy, exchange differences attributable to long-term foreign currency borrowings used to finance the Group’s
foreign currency investments are taken directly to reserves. Consequently, long-term foreign currency borrowings have been excluded from the above table.

Interest on floating rate investments is earned at rates based on local money market rates. Floating rate investments include £370 million (2003: £303 million,
2002: £135 million) of money market deposits which mature within three months of the balance sheet date.
Fixed rate investments are those investments which have an interest rate fixed for a period of greater than one year. Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004   55

In April 2003, Reuters entered into a committed syndicated credit facility for £1.0 billion. £520 million of the facility either expired or was voluntarily cancelled 
in 2004. At 31 December 2004, Reuters had £480 million available under the facility. The facility was undrawn during 2004. The commitment expires and final
repayment is due in April 2008.
At the same time as the syndicated credit facility was arranged, committed bilateral facilities of £90 million were also put in place on similar terms. During 2004,
£66 million of the facilities either expired or were voluntarily cancelled. At 31 December 2004, Reuters had £24 million available, all of which was undrawn. No loans
were outstanding under this facility during 2004.
In addition, at 31 December 2004, the Group had unused, short-term, uncommitted bank borrowing facilities denominated in various currencies, the sterling
equivalent of which was approximately £200 million, at money market rates varying principally between 2% and 6%, depending on the currency. 56 Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004

Prior to the adoption by the Group of UITF38 ‘Accounting for ESOP Trusts’, the shares held in Reuters Group PLC by the Reuters ESOTs were held as a fixed asset
investment. In accordance with the requirements of UITF38, these shares have been deducted from shareholders’ equity. This change has been accounted for as a
prior period adjustment and previously reported figures have been restated accordingly (see note 26 on page 66).
Fixed asset other investments consist principally of small equity investments. Impairment write downs have been made when, based on directors’ valuations, 
a permanent diminution in the carrying value of the investment has occurred.
The reclassification of investments from interests in associates within fixed asset investments to other investments within current asset investments arises from 
the part-disposal of Reuters interest in TSI (see note 31 on page 69), and reflects management’s intention to dispose of its remaining shareholding.

On 16 November 2004, Reuters purchased the 49% of the voting shares of Radianz that it did not already own from Equant, thereby increasing its shareholding
from 51% to 100% of voting shares. The acquisition of the additional 49% stake is included within current asset investments. The 49% was acquired with a view
to resale, and the stake has not been previously consolidated in the Group financial statements. As permitted by the Companies Act, Radianz has not been
consolidated at 31 December 2004. The original investment has continued to be equity accounted in accordance with FRS 9 ‘Associates and Joint Ventures’, 
as shown in the table above. The aggregated capital and reserves of Radianz as at 31 December 2004 were £96 million and the loss for the year was £7 million.
Balances between Reuters and Radianz as at 31 December 2004 and details of the nature and extent of transactions between the two parties during the year 
are given in note 29 ‘Related Party Transactions’. During 2004, Reuters wrote down the carrying value of its investment in Radianz by £3 million.
Had all listed investments been disposed of on 31 December 2004, no tax would have been payable on the assumption that none of the earnings would 
be repatriated. 1.0 million TSI shares subject to in-the-money options held by Reuters employees who worked at TIBCO Finance Technology Inc., a former
Reuters subsidiary which was incorporated into other Reuters businesses in 2001, have been included in the market value of current asset investments at the
value of the option proceeds.

22 CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Reuters Group is exposed to concentrations of credit risk. Reuters Group invests in UK and US government securities and with high credit quality financial
institutions. Reuters Group limits the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution. The Group is also exposed to credit risk from its trade debtors,
which are concentrated in the financial community. Reuters Group estimates that approximately 72% of its subscribers are financial institutions, 17% are
corporations in other sectors of the business community, 4% are from the news media and 7% are government institutions and individuals worldwide 
(2003: 70%, 16%, 6% and 8% respectively, 2002: 68%, 19%, 6% and 7% respectively).
In addition, Instinet Group is exposed to the possibility of trades between its counterparties failing to settle. Due to the settlement mechanisms employed, the
maximum exposure is generally limited to the market movement between the trade date and the settlement date. There are no material unprovided off-balance
sheet exposures or positions in respect of trades undertaken on or prior to 31 December 2004. 
23 PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS
Reuters Group has established various pension arrangements covering the majority of its employees. In all plans, except those which are internally funded, 
the assets are held separately from those of the Group and are independently administered.
Defined contribution plans
Reuters Group operates 34 defined contribution plans covering approximately 67% of its employees, of which the largest plans are: the Reuters Pension Fund,
the Reuters Retirement Plan and the Reuters 401K Pension Plans. The percentage of employees covered and the company contribution to these plans were:
Company

% of employees % of basic salary
Reuters Pension Fund  10.3% 9.5%

23 PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS continued
Defined benefit plans
The Group also operates 33 defined benefit plans covering approximately 24% of employees. Individually, these plans are of a relatively minor nature. The 17 largest
plans are valued under SSAP 24 by independently qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The SSAP 24 provision is reviewed annually based on
locally reported information, with the most recent review being at 1 January 2004. The smaller remaining plans are subject to regular valuations based on accepted
actuarial practice and standards within the country in which the plan is established. The largest plans are directly invested and others are invested in insurance
contracts. The remainder are internally funded in accordance with local practice, with provisions in the subsidiary undertakings to recognise the pension obligations.
Funding policy is set in accordance with local requirements.
The largest defined benefit plans are the UK Supplementary Pension Scheme (SPS) and those in Switzerland, Japan and Hong Kong. The charges in respect 
of these plans in 2004 were £2 million, £3 million, £2 million and £1 million respectively (2003: £2 million, £5 million, £3 million and £2 million respectively).
Details of the SSAP 24 valuation results in respect of these plans are given below.

Post-retirement medical benefits
In the US, the Group closed its post-retirement medical plan with effect from 1 July 2002. A total of 190 employees, retirees and covered spouses retain entitlement
to post-retirement medical benefits which remain unfunded. The principal assumptions used in the most recent actuarial valuation undertaken at 1 January 2004
were a discount rate of 8% and that the growth in healthcare costs would decrease from 9% per annum in 2004 to 6% by 2007 and remain at 5% thereafter.

The assets and liabilities reported under UK plans cover a small UK scheme with 35 active members together with unfunded early retirement and retirement
benefit schemes, the liabilities of which are covered through book reserves. The figures do not include Reuters Pension Fund, as this is a defined contribution
plan and its assets and liabilities are not required to be disclosed under FRS 17.

Two of the overseas plans are closed to new entrants, therefore under the projected unit credit method, the current service cost will increase as a percentage of
payroll as members of the scheme approach retirement. The service cost for these schemes totals £2 million in 2004.
Contributions to funded plans in 2005 are expected to increase slightly on 2004 levels.
The Group is anticipating that a further overseas plan may be closed to new entrants in 2005. Existing members will retain accrued benefits in the scheme, but
transfer future contributions into a new defined contribution scheme. 24 DEFERRED TAXATION (ASSETS)/LIABILITIES

Reuters Group has provided for deferred tax liabilities in respect of dividends which are either accrued as receivable or where there is a binding agreement to
remit the earnings of overseas subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates. To the extent that earnings of its overseas subsidiary undertakings, joint
ventures and associates are not expected to be remitted in the foreseeable future, no tax is expected to be payable.

The valuation allowance of £16 million in respect of fixed assets is made against assets in respect of which it is uncertain that suitable taxable income will be
available when the timing differences reverse (2003: £16 million).
Similarly, the valuation allowance of £114 million in respect of losses is made where it is uncertain that suitable taxable income will arise. It has increased by 
£11 million in 2004.
Other timing differences include reorganisation costs, accrued employee costs (including pension costs) and other provisions.
Reuters does not recognise the potential future tax benefit of capital losses.

Included within the rationalisation provision at the end of 2004 are obligations related to the Reuters Fast Forward and Instinet Group restructuring programmes,
which were first announced in 2003 and include headcount reduction and property rationalisation. Severance-related provisions are expected to be utilised
during 2005 and property-related provisions will be utilised over the remaining lease periods.
The legal/compliance provision represents the expected cost of settling disputes arising from contractual arrangements with third-party suppliers and individuals.
Other property provisions reflect Reuters contractual liability at the balance sheet date to make good dilapidations under ongoing rental agreements outside the
rationalisation programmes.

During 2004, £6 million (2003: £nil, 2002: £2 million) was received by Reuters Group PLC on the issue of shares in respect of the exercise of options awarded
under various share option plans.
Cumulative translation losses at 31 December 2004 totalled £188 million (2003: £163 million, 2002: £50 million).
In 1998, a court-approved capital reorganisation took place. In exchange for every 15 ordinary shares in Reuters Holdings PLC, shareholders received pro-rata 
13 ordinary shares in Reuters Group PLC plus £13.60 in cash. The difference between the proforma nominal value of shares in issue of Reuters Group PLC
immediately prior to the reorganisation and the previously reported capital and reserves of Reuters Holdings PLC, excluding the profit and loss reserve,
represents the merger difference which has since been reflected in the Other reserve.
As at 31 December 2004, the deduction from shareholders’ equity in respect of treasury stock held by the ESOTs was £209 million (2003: £225 million, 2002:
£235 million). The number of unvested shares held by the ESOTs as at 31 December 2004 was 32.0 million (2003: 34.4 million, 2002: 35.9 million). These shares
had a market value of £121 million as at 31 December 2004 (2003: £81 million, 2002: £64 million). 27 SHARE CAPITAL

28 EMPLOYEE SHARE OPTION PLANS continued
In August 1990, January 1994 and August 2004, Reuters established ESOTs with the power to acquire shares in the open market. The trustee of these trusts is 
an offshore independent professional trustee. Shares purchased by the trusts, which are included within reserves on the consolidated balance sheet, will be used
either to meet obligations under the company’s restricted share plans described in the Remuneration Report on pages 32-40 or to satisfy the exercise of options
granted, or to be granted, under other employee share option plans. Alternatively, new shares may be issued to satisfy these option obligations.
SAYE options are issued at a 20% discount to the market price at the time of granting the options. This does not give rise to a charge against profit as Reuters
has taken advantage of the exemption allowed under UITF17 ‘Employee Share Schemes’.
29 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
During the year, Reuters Group carried out a number of transactions with related parties in the normal course of business and on an arm’s length basis.

In addition, on 16 November 2004, Reuters Group acquired Equant’s entire stake in Radianz for £60 million in cash, together with the release of future funding
obligations of £22 million. The accounting treatment of Radianz is described in note 16.
Disposals
During 2004, Reuters disposed of a number of subsidiary undertakings, including: TowerGroup; Yankee; ORT; Reuters Investment (Bermuda) Ltd; Reuters Funds
Investments Ltd; Reuters (UGS Property) Ltd; plus a number of small wholly-owned subsidiaries. These disposals resulted in a net profit of £10 million.
Losses on deemed partial disposal of Reuters interest in Instinet Group, arising on the exercise of Instinet share awards by Instinet Group employees during the year,
amounted to £1 million.
During the year, Reuters made disposals of certain equity investments. In February 2004, Reuters reduced its stake in TSI from 48.4% to 8.8% (6.2% fully diluted)
through a combination of public offering and a sale of shares back to TSI, for aggregate net proceeds of £310 million, realising a profit of £151 million. Reuters
disposed of its 34.2% stake in GL TRADE, realising a gain of £48 million. Other disposals of joint ventures and associates realised net profits of £7 million.
In June 2004, Radianz disposed of its voice service business; the Reuters share of the gain arising on the disposal was £9 million.
In 2004, Reuters disposed of a number of small fixed asset investments, realising a net loss on disposal of £1 million. Instinet Group made disposals of certain
fixed asset investments during 2004, including: the disposal of its stake in Euronext; a further part-disposal of its stake in Archipelago; the disposal of its stake 
in the London Stock Exchange; and other disposals of small fixed asset investments. The net gain arising from these disposals was £20 million.
Realised net gains, all of which were recorded in the 2004 profit and loss account, were:

On deemed partial disposal of subsidiary undertaking (1)
On disposal of joint ventures and associates  206
On disposal of business by joint venture 9
On disposal of other fixed asset investments  19

Adjustments to goodwill
Adjustments of £6 million have been made to goodwill during the year (see note 14 on page 58). These relate to the re-negotiation of earn out agreements in
relation to the acquisitions of AVT Technologies Limited and Capital Access International LLC, and also to the finalisation of fair value adjustments in respect of
the acquisition of Multex. The fair value adjustments are based on an independent valuation performed by professionally-qualified valuers. 32 SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS, JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES

33 POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
On 28 February 2005, Reuters and Instinet Group entered into an agreement for Instinet Group to acquire Bridge Trading Company for US$21.5 million 
in Instinet Group stock. The transaction is subject to NASD approval and other customary conditions, and is expected to close by the end of April 2005. 
The transaction will be accounted for as a transfer of net assets between Group companies at fair value, with consequent impact on the minority interest 
in Instinet Group. There is no tax on the transaction. 
Since the year end, Reuters has reduced its holding in TSI to 7.4%, generating total net proceeds of £9 million. No tax is expected to be payable as a result 
of this transaction.

Following the approval of a High Court Scheme of Arrangement, the majority of the issued share capital of Reuters Holdings PLC was acquired by Reuters Group
PLC in February 1998.
The loss for the year mainly represents interest and revaluation on intercompany borrowings, and dividends paid to shareholders.
During the year, Reuters Group PLC granted an option to the Reuters Group PLC 2004 Employee Trust. The Trust will use the option in order to satisfy awards
granted to Reuters employees outside of the UK under the Restricted Share Plan, once the scheme vests (see page 34). The movement in the Other reserve
represents the option proceeds received. Accounting basis
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards.
UITF38 ‘Accounting for ESOP Trusts’ has been adopted for the first time in
the 2004 financial statements. As a result, shares in Reuters Group PLC held
by ESOTs have been reclassified from fixed asset investments and are now
treated as a deduction from Shareholders’ Equity. No new shares have been
acquired by the ESOTs during the year. In addition, revisions to UITF17
‘Employee Share Schemes’ have changed the basis on which the costs of
employee share schemes are charged to the profit and loss account.
The impact of both these changes in accounting treatment has resulted in
prior period adjustments and previously reported figures have been restated
accordingly. The reclassification of shares acquired by the Reuters ESOTs from
fixed asset investments to Shareholders’ Equity has reduced net assets by 
£74 million as at 31 December 2003, by £68 million as at 31 December 2002
and by £153 million as at 31 December 2001. The impact of adopting the
amendment to UITF17 was to decrease profit before tax by £2 million for the
year to 31 December 2004, and to increase profit before tax by £7 million for
the year to 31 December 2003 and £149 million for the year to 31 December
2002. The prior period adjustment in the Statement of Total Recognised
Gains and Losses of £151 million reflects the change in the basis on which
charges to the profit and loss account are determined, and the reversal of
previous impairment charges.
Following recently issued SEC guidance, Reuters Group has determined that
transaction-related regulatory fees in Instinet Group are more appropriately
reclassified and shown gross within revenue, rather than offset within brokerage,
clearing and exchange fees. For the years ended 31 December 2004, 
31 December 2003 and 31 December 2002, the regulatory fee expenses 
were £30 million, £38 million and £18 million respectively. This adjustment 
has no impact on profit before tax.
The acquisition of the remaining equity interests in Multex Investor Europe
and Multex Investor Japan in 2003 was accounted for in accordance with FRS
2 ‘Accounting for Subsidiary Undertakings’, which represented a departure
from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include:
• the financial statements of Reuters Group PLC and its subsidiaries to 
31 December. The results of subsidiaries are included for the period 
during which they are a member of the Group;
• Reuters Group’s share of the post-acquisition results of joint ventures and
associates. Investments in joint ventures and associates are included at the
Group’s share of the net assets and unamortised goodwill at the dates of
acquisition plus the Group’s share of post-acquisition reserves.
Foreign currency translation
On consolidation, the profit and loss accounts and cash flow statements of
entities with non-sterling functional currencies are translated into sterling at
the average rates for the year. Exchange differences arising on consolidation
as a result of the translation of the profit and loss account from the average
rate to the year-end rate are accounted for through reserves.
Exchange differences that arise as a consequence of trading transactions and
the translation of monetary assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and
loss account. Foreign currency investments (including subsidiary undertakings,
joint ventures and associates) are translated at the 31 December rate, and 
the associated exchange differences are taken directly to reserves. Exchange
differences attributable to foreign currency borrowings used to finance the
Group’s foreign currency investments are taken directly to reserves.
Treasury
Reuters Group receives revenue and incurs expenses in more than 
70 currencies and uses financial instruments to hedge a portion of its 
net cash flow and operating profit.
The derivative contracts are treated from inception as an economic hedge 
of the underlying financial instrument, with matching accounting treatment
and cash flows. The derivative contracts have high correlation with the 
specific underlying risks being hedged both at inception and throughout 
the hedge period.
Reuters uses financial instruments to hedge a portion of its interest exposure.
Profits and losses on financial instruments are reported as part of profit for the
period to which they relate.
Financial instruments hedging the risk on foreign currency assets are revalued
at the balance sheet date and the resulting gain or loss offset against that
arising from the translation of the underlying asset into sterling.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for
speculative purposes.
Revenue
Revenue represents the turnover, net of discounts, derived from services
provided to subscribers and sales of products applicable to the year.
Revenue from sales of subscription-based real-time and historical information
services are recognised rateably over the term of the subscription.
Revenue from contracts for the outright sale of systems-based product
solutions, which include the sale of fully developed software licences, 
is recognised at the time of client acceptance. Short-term contracts 
are accounted for on a completed contract basis. Long-term contracts 
are accounted for in accordance with the contractual terms either on a
percentage of completion basis or on a time and materials as incurred basis.
Revenue from associated maintenance and support services is recognised
rateably over the term of the maintenance contract. Where contracts allow
Reuters to recharge costs from communications suppliers and exchanges
onwards to subscribers, this income is recognised as revenue.
Transaction products usage revenue is accounted for on a trade date basis.
Securities transactions
Securities transactions between Instinet Group counterparties which pass
through Instinet Group and in its role as agency brokers, are recorded on 
a settlement date basis and, therefore, are only reflected in the balance 
sheet if there is a failure to settle. Revenues and related expenses arising 
from such securities transactions are accrued from the date of the transaction.
Development
Development expenditure is charged against profit in the year in which 
it is incurred.
Pensions and similar obligations
The expected costs of defined benefit pensions and post-retirement medical
benefits are charged against profit so as to spread the cost over the service
lives of the employees affected.
For defined contribution schemes the charge to the profit and loss account
represents contributions payable by Reuters Group during the period.
Restricted share and Instinet long-term incentive plans
Costs of the restricted share and Instinet long-term incentive plans are
charged to profit over the vesting period of the awards.
Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis so as to write down the
assets to their residual values over their expected useful lives:
Freehold land Not depreciated
Freehold buildings Normally 50 years
Leasehold property Over the term of the lease
Computer systems equipment,
office equipment and motor vehicles 2 to 5 years
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
72 Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004
  Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004   73
Stock and contract work in progress
Stock and contract work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net
realisable value less progress payments received and receivable from clients.
Progress payments in excess of the value of work carried out are included
within creditors.
Cost is calculated on a first in first out basis by reference to the invoiced value
of supplies and attributable costs of bringing stocks to their present location
and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated market value less selling costs.
Short-term investments
Government securities are stated in the balance sheet at the lower of cost
plus accrued capital appreciation and market value. Income from these
securities and any adjustment for changes in their market value during the
year is reported as part of profit.
Movements in short-term investments are reported under the heading of
management of liquid resources in the cash flow statement.
Debt issuance
Medium-term notes and commercial paper are stated at the amount of the
net proceeds plus accrued interest or any discount or premium. Discounts 
or premia to the nominal value are amortised over the term of the issue.
Costs associated with debt issuance are charged against profit over the life 
of the instrument.
Foreign currency swap agreements and forward contracts are used to convert
non-sterling debt into sterling. Interest rate swaps, swaptions and forward rate
agreements are used to manage interest rate exposures. Amounts payable or
receivable in respect of these derivatives are recognised as adjustments to
interest expense over the period of the contract.
Leasing
Operating lease rentals are charged against profit on a straight line basis over
the period of the lease.
Operating lease incentives received are initially deferred and subsequently
recognised over the minimum contract period.
Deferred taxation
Tax deferred or accelerated by the effect of timing differences is accounted
for to the extent that a transaction or an event that has occurred at the
balance sheet date gives rise to an obligation to pay more tax in the future 
or a right to pay less tax in the future. Deferred taxation is recognised on an
undiscounted basis.
However, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that, based 
on all available evidence, it is more likely than not that suitable taxable profits
will arise from which the reversal of the asset can be deducted.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the
consideration paid and the fair value of the Group’s share of the net assets 
at the date of acquisition. No value is attributed to internally generated
intangible assets.
Purchased goodwill and other intangibles are capitalised and amortised
through the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over their
estimated useful economic lives, which are up to 20 years depending on 
the nature of the business acquired. Impairment reviews are carried out 
at the end of the first financial year after acquisition and where there is 
any indication of impairment.
Impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset with 
the higher of the net realisable value and the value in use. Any impairment
charges are recognised in the profit and loss account for the period in 
which they arise.
Interest in shares of Reuters Group PLC
Shares held by the employee share ownership trusts are recorded in the
balance sheet as a deduction from Shareholders’ Equity at cost less shares
unconditionally vested.
Fixed and current asset investments
Fixed asset investments are held at cost net of permanent diminution in
values as assessed by the directors. Where it is Reuters Group’s intention 
to dispose of an investment in the short-term, the investment is treated as 
a current asset, and valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
  01 ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with UK GAAP, which differ in certain significant respects from US GAAP. 
Prior period restatements
In November 2003, the Group entered into cross currency interest rate swaps
to hedge fixed rate Euro debt into floating rate other currencies, principally
US dollars. These instruments have a maturity date of November 2010. Under
UK GAAP, the resulting US dollar foreign currency debt has been designated
as a net investment hedge and, foreign currency translation gains and losses
arising on the instrument are recorded directly to equity and included in the
statement of total recognised gains and losses. During the year, as part of an
overall review of complex derivative instruments, the Group concluded that
under US GAAP the gains or losses on these instruments are required to be
included in the income statement. The amounts for 2003 have been restated
to remove the amount recorded directly to equity and include the amount
within the income statement under US GAAP .
Under UK GAAP, computer software licences acquired and other direct
internal costs incurred for internal use software are expensed as incurred. The
Group has reviewed its accounting for such items during the year and has
concluded that the same treatment should not be applied under US GAAP,
which requires capitalisation of certain internal use software costs. The Group
has restated prior years to properly reflect the capitalisation and related
amortisation of these costs under US GAAP . 
The impact on the net loss, basic and diluted earnings per ADS, and
Shareholders’ Equity in accordance with US GAAP of these restatements 
is as follows:

in the accounting policies note on pages 72-73. As a result, shares in Reuters
Group PLC held by employee share ownership trusts (ESOTs) have been
reclassified from fixed asset investments and are now treated as a deduction
from Shareholders’ Equity. In addition, revisions to UITF Abstract 17 ‘Employee
Share Schemes’ have changed the basis on which the costs of employee share
schemes are charged to the profit and loss account. The impact of these
changes in accounting treatment has resulted in prior period adjustments and
previously reported UK GAAP figures for 2003 and 2002 have been restated
accordingly. The summary of adjustments between UK and US GAAP has
therefore been restated to reflect the restated UK GAAP figures, and also
changes to the differences between UK and US GAAP , as explained below:
Shares held by employee share ownership trusts (ESOTs)
Under UK GAAP, shares in Reuters Group PLC held by ESOTs are now
shown as a deduction from Shareholders’ Equity until such time as share
options vest un-conditionally in employees, whereas previously they were
shown as a fixed asset investment. Under US GAAP, shares held by ESOTs
are shown as a deduction from Shareholders’ Equity until share options are
exercised by employees.
Employee Share Schemes
Under UK GAAP , compensation charges relating to employee share 
schemes are based on the intrinsic value of the awards at the date of 
grant, calculated as the market value of the shares, less any option price to
employees. Previously, awards satisfied by the issuance of shares from ESOTs,
primarily certain stock-based long-term incentive plans, were expensed to
the profit and loss account based on the original cost of shares held by the
ESOTs less impairment. Under US GAAP , the compensation charge of long-
term incentive plans is based on the value of the awards at the balance 
sheet date. Under both UK and US GAAP , the total compensation charge is
adjusted to take account of performance conditions and the compensation
charge is spread over the service period. The adjustment arising from this
difference is classified within ‘Employee costs’.
A description of the relevant accounting principles which differ materially is
given below.
a. Revenue recognition
Under UK GAAP , revenue from contracts for the outright sale of systems-based
product solutions, which include the sale of fully developed software licences, 
is recognised at the time of client acceptance. Under US GAAP , specific rules
establish the criteria that must be met for revenue recognition. Under these
rules, certain contracts with multiple elements require an amount of revenue 
to be deferred until all criteria are met for revenue to be recognised.
The UK to US GAAP adjustments in 2003 and 2002 arise from the release 
of revenue deferred in prior years. No revenue has been deferred for the
purposes of US GAAP in 2004.
Under UK GAAP, soft dollar revenues are netted against operating costs 
in the profit and loss account. Under US GAAP, soft dollar revenues are
presented gross in revenues and operating costs (2004: £148 million, 2003: 
£169 million, 2002: £192 million). There is no difference in net income as a
result of the classification.
Under UK and US GAAP, interest income arising on cash provided as security
on stock-borrowing transactions related to Instinet Group’s clearing business
is recorded in revenue. Under UK GAAP, interest on fixed income securities
and on cash balances is recorded below operating activities in the profit and
loss account. Under US GAAP, this interest is recorded in revenue.
b. Software
Under UK GAAP , costs of developing computer software products and
websites are usually expensed in the year in which they are incurred. Under 
US GAAP , the costs of developing computer software products subsequent 
to establishing technical feasibility are capitalised. Additionally, certain costs
relating to website development incurred subsequent to the planning stage
are also capitalised. The amortisation of the capitalised costs is based on the
estimated future revenues or remaining estimated useful economic lives of the
products involved.
Under UK GAAP , computer software licences acquired for internal use are
expensed the year they are incurred. Under US GAAP , certain costs relating to
computer software licences acquired for internal use are capitalised. Computer
software costs that are incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed
as incurred. Once the capitalisation criteria have been met, external direct
costs of licences and services consumed and internal employee costs incurred
in developing or obtaining internal use software are capitalised. Costs
capitalised are amortised over the life of the licence.
c. Joint ventures and associates
Under UK GAAP, the difference between the book value and fair value of 
SUMMARY OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UK AND US
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)
74 Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004
  Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 75
the assets contributed to joint ventures and associates is recognised in 
the statement of total recognised gains and losses. Under US GAAP, the
difference is released to the income statement over the anticipated life of 
the assets contributed to the venture.
Under UK GAAP , stock compensation expenses are not required to be recorded
in respect of certain joint ventures’ and associates’ stock option plans. Under US
GAAP , the Group’s share of the results of joint ventures and associates has been
adjusted to reflect stock compensation charges where appropriate.
Under US GAAP , the Group’s share of the results of joint ventures and associates
is adjusted to reflect the non-amortisation of goodwill since 1 January 2002.
d. Gains on deemed disposal of subsidiary undertakings and associates
Under UK GAAP, gains on the deemed partial disposal of subsidiary
undertakings and associates involving non-qualifying consideration are
recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses. Under US
GAAP, these gains are recorded in the income statement and are calculated
using asset and consideration values as determined under US GAAP.
e. Gain/loss on disposal of subsidiary undertakings
Under UK GAAP , goodwill is amortised on a systematic basis whereas under
US GAAP goodwill is not amortised but tested for impairment on an annual
basis. Under US GAAP , therefore, the carrying value of goodwill can be higher,
and result in a different gain or loss on disposal of subsidiary undertakings.
Under UK GAAP , the gain or loss on disposal of an overseas subsidiary is
calculated with reference to assets translated to sterling at the foreign currency
exchange rate prevailing at the date of disposal. Under US GAAP on disposal
of a foreign currency subsidiary, the amount attributable to that entity and
accumulated in the translation adjustment component of equity is removed
from the separate component of equity and is reported as part of the gain 
or loss on sale of the subsidiary.
f. Gain on disposal of associates
Under UK GAAP, equity accounting for associates is based on results
prepared in accordance with UK GAAP. Under US GAAP , the Group’s 
share of results of associates is adjusted to be based on results prepared 
in accordance with US GAAP . Under UK GAAP , goodwill is amortised on 
a systematic basis, whereas under US GAAP, goodwill is not amortised but
written down when an impairment arises. These differences result in the
carrying value of associates being different under US GAAP , and therefore
different gains and losses arise on disposal. 
Under UK GAAP, the gain or loss on disposal of an investment in an associate
held in a foreign currency is calculated with reference to the investment
translated to sterling at the foreign currency exchange rate prevailing at 
the date of disposal. Under US GAAP on disposal of a foreign currency
associate, the amount attributable to that entity and accumulated in the
translation adjustment component of equity is removed from the separate
component of equity and is reported as part of  the gain or loss on sale 
of the associate.
g. Fixed asset investments
Under UK GAAP, fixed asset investments are held in the balance sheet at 
cost net of permanent diminution in value as assessed by the directors. 
Under US GAAP, fixed asset investments which are available for sale are
stated at fair value with unrealised gains or losses included in the statement 
of other comprehensive income. Under US GAAP , traded fixed asset
investments are stated at fair value with movements in fair value included 
in the income statement.
h. Goodwill and other intangibles
Under UK GAAP, goodwill and other intangible assets are amortised. Under
US GAAP, prior to 1 July 2001, goodwill was amortised over its estimated
useful life consistent with UK GAAP . In 2002, Reuters adopted the provisions
of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 (FAS 142) ‘Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets’ and as a result goodwill is no longer subject to amortisation
under US GAAP. In addition, the non-amortisation of goodwill provisions of
FAS 142 were effective immediately for goodwill arising on all acquisitions
completed after 30 June 2001.
Under UK GAAP, goodwill impairment reviews are carried out at the end of
the first financial year after acquisition and where there is any indication of
impairment. Impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of the
business with the higher of the net realisable value and the value in use.
Under US GAAP, the Group performed a transitional impairment test effective
1 January 2002, as required by FAS 142. Goodwill impairment reviews are
also conducted whenever the Group considers there to be an indication of
impairment. Beginning in 2002, the Group also completes an annual goodwill
impairment test, as required by FAS 142. 
Under US GAAP, where the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair
value then a goodwill impairment is recorded based on the excess of the
carrying value of goodwill in a reporting unit over the implied fair value of
that goodwill.
Under UK GAAP, the fair value of quoted securities issued to effect a 
business combination is measured at the market price at the date of closing
the acquisition. Under US GAAP, the fair value of the securities issued is
determined using the market price for a reasonable period before and after
the date that the terms of the acquisition are agreed to and announced.
Under UK GAAP, contingent consideration arising as part of a business
combination is included within goodwill and recorded as a liability at the time
of the acquisition. Under US GAAP , contingent consideration is recorded as
an adjustment to goodwill at the time it is realised. Under UK GAAP, liabilities
recorded in respect of contingent consideration are discounted to net present
value and included within goodwill at the time of the business combination.
Under US GAAP, as the liability is recorded when the contingency is resolved,
the value taken to goodwill can be different.
Both UK GAAP and US GAAP require purchase consideration in respect of
subsidiaries acquired to be allocated on the basis of fair values to the various
net assets of the acquiree at the date of acquisition. The excess of purchase
consideration over the fair value assigned to the net assets is treated as
goodwill. Both UK GAAP and US GAAP require separately identifiable
intangible assets to be held separately from goodwill. Under US GAAP a
different definition of intangible assets applies, therefore additional intangible
assets may be identified under US GAAP.
i. Current asset investments
Under UK GAAP , current asset investments are held in the balance sheet at
the lower of historical cost and net realisable value. Under US GAAP, available
for sale current asset investments are stated at fair value, with unrealised gains
and losses included in the statement of other comprehensive income. 
j. Employee costs
Reuters grants options under save-as-you-earn (SAYE) plans at a 20%
discount. Under UK GAAP, the share issues are recorded at their discounted
price when the options are exercised. Under US GAAP, the discount is
regarded as employee compensation and is accrued over the vesting period
of the grants.
Under US GAAP, if a SAYE scheme is offered at a lower price than those
offered previously and participants are able to transfer out of an existing
scheme into the new scheme, variable accounting rules apply. Under these
rules, a compensation charge is recorded on issue of the option for the
intrinsic value of the award at the grant date, and any subsequent movement
in the share value results in a re-measuring of the compensation charge,
which continues until the option is exercised. Variable plan accounting applies
to all options in existing higher priced schemes and also to options in lower
priced schemes to the extent that those options have been transferred from 
a higher priced scheme.
Under UK GAAP, no compensation charge is recorded when the vesting terms
of an option award are accelerated, or when an option plan is amended with
substantially similar terms as the old plan. Under US GAAP , additional
compensation cost is recognised when the vesting of an option has been
accelerated and those options would otherwise have been forfeited unvested.
Additional compensation cost is also recognised where a new measurement
date is established following the amendment of a stock option plan where the
exercise price is less than the market value of the underlying shares on the
new measurement date.
Under UK GAAP, the liability for national insurance on stock options is
accrued based on the intrinsic value of the options on the date of grant and
adjusted for subsequent changes in the market value of the underlying shares.
Under US GAAP, this expense is recorded when the liability crystalises upon
exercise of the stock options. Under UK GAAP, compensation charges relating to employee share schemes
are based on the intrinsic value of the awards at the date of grant, calculated
as the market value of the shares, less any option price to employees. Under
US GAAP, the cost of long-term incentive plans is remeasured to the value of
the awards at the balance sheet date until the final measurement date. Under
both UK and US GAAP, the total compensation charge is adjusted to take
account of the performance conditions and the compensation charge is
spread over the service period.
Under UK GAAP, costs relating to employee share schemes dependent on
company performance in a particular period are recognised in full in that 
year, regardless of when the options vest. Under US GAAP , the cost of such
schemes is spread over the period from the date of grant to the vesting 
date of the options.
Under UK GAAP, the expected costs under defined benefit pension and 
post-retirement arrangements are spread over the service lives of employees
entitled to those benefits. Variations from regular cost are spread on a straight
line basis over the expected average remaining service lives of relevant
current employees. Under US GAAP, the annual pension cost comprises the
estimated cost of benefits accruing in the period adjusted for the amortisation
of the surplus arising when FAS 87 ‘Employers’ Accounting for Pensions’ was
adopted. The valuation assumptions used to determine the annual pension
cost under US GAAP are the same as those used to determine the FRS 17
cost as set out in note 23 on pages 61-64.
Under UK GAAP, the transfer of employees that held unvested stock option
awards to a joint venture does not give rise to a charge against profit. Under
US GAAP, the stock awards are considered to be held by non-employees and
accordingly a stock option expense relating to the fair value of the unvested
awards is included in ‘share of operating profit/loss in joint ventures’ over the
remaining vesting period.
k. Restructuring
In 2003, under US GAAP , Reuters adopted the provisions of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 146 (FAS 146) ‘Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities.’ FAS 146 has been applied in respect of
employee severance provisions and property cost provisions. US GAAP
requires that employee severance costs that are not one-time termination
charges be recognised when it is probable that these costs will be incurred
and the amount is capable of being estimated. Under UK GAAP, Reuters
recognises provisions for employee severance charges once the Group has 
a constructive obligation to incur the costs. A constructive obligation is
considered to exist when a detailed formal plan is in place and a valid
expectation has been raised in those affected. 
Under UK GAAP, Reuters recognises provisions for costs associated with the
exit of a property once the intention to exit has been announced. Under US
GAAP, charges for costs associated with the exit of properties are recognised
upon vacation of the property or legal termination of the lease contract.
l. Derivative instruments
Under US GAAP, the Group adopted FAS 133 ‘Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities’ as amended by FAS 138, on 1 January
2001. FAS 133 introduced new rules in respect of hedge accounting and the
recognition of movements in fair value through the income statement. As a
result of the adoption, all derivatives and embedded derivative instruments,
whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are carried on the
balance sheet at fair value.
The company has not designated any of its derivative instruments as qualifying
hedge instruments under FAS 133. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of
derivative and embedded derivative instruments have been included within
current earnings under US GAAP .
Under current UK GAAP, the company has continued to apply hedge
accounting and is not required to record its derivative instruments or any of
its embedded derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value.
Under UK GAAP, compound derivative instuments that have multiple
underlyings can be designated as a net investment hedge and, where this
treatment is applied, foreign currency translation gains and losses arising on
the instrument are recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and
losses. Under US GAAP, such instruments cannot in all cases be designated 
SUMMARY OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UK AND US
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) continued
76 Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004
as a net investment hedge and therefore foreign currency translation gains
and losses arising on the instrument may in some cases be recorded in the
income statement.
m. Consolidation of subsidiary undertakings
Under UK GAAP , investments in certain subsidiaries are treated as financing
arrangements in substance and the net investment reflected within short-term
investments. Under US GAAP , such subsidiaries are consolidated under the
voting interest model and assets are reflected within the appropriate accounts.
This has resulted in a reclassification between asset categories within current
assets in the current year. 
On 16 November 2004, Reuters purchased the 49% voting stake of Radianz
that it did not already own from Equant, thereby increasing its shareholding
from 51% to 100% of the voting shares. Under UK GAAP , the acquisition of the
additional 49% stake is included within current asset investments at the lower
of cost and net realisable value. As this 49% was acquired with a view to
resale, and the stake has never been treated as a long-term investment, in the
opinion of the directors it does not represent a continuing investment in
Radianz and is therefore included within current asset investments. The original
investment has continued to be accounted for using equity accounting. 
Under US GAAP , Radianz is treated as a joint venture of Reuters Group for 
the period 1 January 2004 to 16 November 2004 and for the years ended 
31 December 2003 and 2002. The acquisition of the additional 49% stake 
in Radianz has been accounted for as a step acquisition and Radianz has
therefore been fully consolidated as a subsidiary from the date of acquisition.
Under US GAAP such subsidiaries are consolidated under the voting interest
model and the assets and liabilities are recorded within the appropriate
balance sheet categories. This has resulted in a reclassification from current
assets to other balance sheet line items in the current year. It is the opinion of
the directors that Radianz meets the criteria set forth in FAS 144 as a disposal
group and is therefore classified as an asset held for sale.
The summarised results of Radianz under UK GAAP for the period 1 January
2004 to 16 November 2004 and for the years ended 31 December 2003 and
2002 are set out below:

n. Sale and leaseback 
Under UK GAAP , property sale and leaseback transactions where the leaseback
meets the criteria of an operating lease are accounted for as an operating sale
and leaseback, regardless of any sub-lease of the leased property.
Under US GAAP, where a portion of the leased property is sub-let and that
sub-lease is not minor, the sale and leaseback is accounted for as financing.
The asset is retained on the balance sheet at its written down value and
depreciated over the term of the lease. The proceeds received from the sale
of the property are deferred on the balance sheet as a financing liability,
whilst lease rental payments are offset against the liability as made, the
difference between the initial proceeds received and the rental payments 
is recorded as financing cost over the term of the lease. 
o. Interest
Under UK GAAP, liabilities recorded in respect of contingent consideration Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004   77
NOTES ON SUMMARY OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UK AND US
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)
arising as part of business combinations are discounted to net present value.
The discount is unwound through the profit and loss account over the life of
the liability. Under US GAAP, no liability is recorded in respect of contingent
consideration, therefore the interest charge is adjusted as appropriate.
p. Taxation
Under UK GAAP, FRS 19 ‘Deferred Taxation’ requires deferred taxes to 
be accounted for on all timing differences. Deferred tax assets are to be
recognised to the extent that, on the basis of all available evidence, it can 
be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits
from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be
deducted. Assets not recognised are shown by way of a valuation allowance
in the balance sheet. Under US GAAP , deferred taxes are accounted for in
accordance with FAS 109 ‘Accounting for Income Taxes‘ on all timing
differences and a valuation allowance is established in respect of those
deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some portion will
remain unrealised. 
This has not given rise to a significant adjustment in the UK to US GAAP
reconciliation. The adjustment is primarily the result of the deferred tax
impact of the other US GAAP adjustments made in the reconciliation.
q. Dividends
Under UK GAAP, dividends are provided for in the year in respect of which
they are declared or proposed. Under US GAAP , dividends are recognised
only in the period in which they are formally declared.
The effects of these differing accounting principles are shown in notes 36-39.
02 CASH FLOW STATEMENT
The cash flow statement set out on pages 50-55 has been prepared in
conformity with UK FRS 1 (Revised) ‘Cash Flow Statements’. 
Set out below is a summary consolidated cash flow statement under US GAAP:
Restated Restated
2004 2003 2002
Notes £m £m  £m
Net cash inflow from

Net increase/(decrease) in cash

Net increase/(decrease) in 
cash under UK GAAP 24 (97) 86
The principal differences between the UK GAAP cash flow statement and the
cash flow statement presented in accordance with FAS 95 are as follows:
Notes:
1 Under UK GAAP, net cash inflow from operating activities is determined
before considering (a) net cash outflow from returns on investments and
servicing of finance (2004: £10 million, 2003: £28 million, 2002: £64 million),
(b) dividends received from associates (2004: £4 million, 2003: £3 million,
2002: £2 million) and (c) taxes paid (2004: £43 million, 2003: £33 million,
2002: £73 million). Under US GAAP , net cash inflow from operating
activities is determined after these items. Net cash inflow from operating
activites under US GAAP also includes £10 million cash inflow in respect 
of Radianz Limited.
2 Under UK GAAP , net cash flow from capital expenditure, financial investments
and acquisitions and disposals (2004: £343 million inflow, 2003: £216 million
outflow, 2002: £217 million outflow) are classified separately while under
US GAAP they are classified as investing activities.
Under UK GAAP, movements in short-term investments (2004: £164 million
increase, 2003: £99 million increase, 2002: £378 million decrease) are not 
included in cash but classified as management of liquid resources. Under
US GAAP, short-term investments with maturity of three months or less at
the date of acquisition (2004: £57 million increase, 2003: £37 million
decrease, 2002: £234 million decrease) are included in cash and cash
equivalents. Only short-term investments with a maturity of over three
months (2004: £107 million increase, 2003: £136 million increase, 2002:
£144 million decrease) are classified as investing activity. Net cash
inflow/(outflow) from investing activities under US GAAP also includes 
£2 million cash outflow in respect of Radianz Limited.
Under UK GAAP, cash outflow from the acquisition of computer software
licences and other direct internal costs incurred for internal use software
(2004: £4 million, 2003: £14 million, 2002: £29 million) have been included
in net cash inflow from operating activities. Under US GAAP, this
expenditure has been capitalised and therefore the cash outflow has been
included in the net cash inflow/(outflow) from investing activities.
3 Under UK GAAP, dividends paid (2004: £140 million, 2003: £140 million,
2002: £139 million) are classified separately while under US GAAP dividends
paid are classified as financing activities. Under UK GAAP, the purchase of
Reuters shares by the ESOTs (2004: £nil, 2003: £nil, 2002: £65 million) is
classified as investing activities whereas under US GAAP this is classified 
as financing activities.
Under UK GAAP, cash flows relating to the movement in bank overdrafts
(2004: £11 million inflow, 2003: £11 million outflow, 2002: £63 million
outflow) are classified as movements in cash while under US GAAP they 
are classified as a financing activity.

million loss, 2002: £28 million loss). At 31 December 2004, the balance sheet
includes a derivative asset of £45 million. The current year gain includes a 
gain of £21 million (2003: £26 million loss, 2002: £19 million loss) relating to
currency forward contracts embedded within long-term customer contracts.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
FAS 123(R)
In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004)
‘Share Based Payment’ (FAS 123 (R)). The statement is a revision of FASB
Statement No. 123 ‘Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation’ and supersedes
APB Opinion No. 25 ‘Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees’ and its related
implementation guidance. FAS 123 (R) establishes standards for accounting for
transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and
services, primarily employee services. The statement requires a public entity to
measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of
equity instruments to be based on the grant date fair value of the award, as
determined using an option pricing model which considers the unique
characteristics of those instruments. The cost should be recognised over the
period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange
for the award. FAS 123 (R) is applicable to the Group from the start of the first
interim and annual reporting period beginning after 15 June 2005. The
implementation of FAS 123 (R) will require the Group to establish the grant
date fair value for all its employee share option plans. The Group is in the
process of assessing these fair values and the resulting impact on the Group’s
financial position.
FAS 153
In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 153 ‘Exchanges of
Non-monetary Assets’ (FAS 153) as an amendment to APB Opinion No. 29
‘Accounting for Non-monetary Transactions’.
The guidance in APB Opinion No. 29 is based on the principle that exchanges
on non-monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the 
assets exchanged, with certain exceptions to that principle. FAS 153 amends
APB Opinion No. 29 to eliminate the exception for non-monetary exchanges
of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for
exchanges on non-monetary assets that do not have commercial substance. 
A non-monetary exchange has commercial substance if future cash flows of 
the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange.
FAS 153 is effective for non-monetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods
beginning after 15 June 2005. This accounting pronouncement is not expected
to have a significant impact on the Group’s financial position or the results of
its operations.
EITF 03-01
In June 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF 03-01 
‘The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to
Certain Investments’. The issue includes determining the meaning of other
than temporary impairment and its application to debt and equity securities
within the scope of FAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity securities and equity securities that are not subject to the scope of FAS
115 and not accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Group
is in the process of assessing the impact of this pronouncement on the Group’s
financial position.

01 ORDINARY SHARES
As of 2 March 2005, there were 1,403,957,850 ordinary shares outstanding,
excluding 32,550,175 ordinary shares owned by certain employee share
ownership trusts (see note 28 on the consolidated balance sheet on 
pages 67-68).
02 MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS
The company had received notice under section 198 of the UK Companies Act
1985, as at 2 March 2005 that the following parties held notifiable interests in
its shares:
Percentage 
Number Number of issued
of shares of shares share capital
(March 2005) (March 2004) (March 2005)
Fidelity Investments 130,364,252 94,238,074 9.08
Legal & General Investment 
Management 58,006,88743,076,6694.04
Barclays PLC 53,902,608 46,046,872 3.75
Merrill Lynch Investment Managers 48,978,642 48,978,642 3.48
The company’s major shareholders do not have any different voting rights from
the other ordinary shareholders. Brandes Investment Partners and Franklin
Templeton Investments decreased their holdings during the first half of 2004
and no longer hold a notifiable interest. Barclays PLC acquired a notifiable
holding during 2004 and its holding has fluctuated around the 4% mark
throughout 2004. As shown above, Fidelity Investments has increased its
shareholding during 2004 by around 36 million shares. There were relatively
few other movements in the major shareholders.
The Founders Share
Independence, integrity and freedom from bias in the gathering and
dissemination of news and information are fundamental to Reuters Group.
Reuters Founders Share Company Limited (the Founders Share Company) 
was established to safeguard those qualities and holds a single Founders
Share. This share may be used to outvote all ordinary shares if other
safeguards fail and there is an attempt to effect a change in control of the
company. ‘Control’, for this purpose, means 30% of the ordinary shares. 
The directors of the Founders Share Company have a duty to ensure, as 
far as they are able by the proper exercise of the powers vested in them, 
that the Reuters Trust Principles are observed (see page 82-83).
The Founders Share Company’s directors are nominated by a Nomination
Committee which includes certain serving directors of the Founders Share
Company, one person nominated by each of four news associations, two
people appointed by the Chairman of Reuters Group PLC and two people
appointed after consultation with the European Court of Human Rights. 
A director of the Founders Share Company may not be a director or 
employee of Reuters Group.
The current directors of the Founders Share Company are as follows:

INFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS
anniversary of his or her nomination or last renomination and will be eligible
for renomination (unless he or she has reached the age of 75).
Except as described above, to the best of Reuters Group’s knowledge, 
the company is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another
corporation, by any foreign government or by any other natural or legal
person, severally or jointly, and currently there are no arrangements that 
may, at a subsequent date, result in a change in control of the company.
03 CORPORATE STRUCTURE
The Reuters Group conducts its business through a portfolio of companies,
including wholly and partly-owned subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures 
and associates. Information concerning the most significant companies 
is contained in note 32 on the consolidated balance sheet, on page 70.

05 HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT
The ultimate holding company for the Group, Reuters Group PLC, was
incorporated in England and Wales on 24 December 1996, though its
predecessor was formed in London in 1851. Reuters Group PLC’s registered
office and corporate headquarters are located at 85 Fleet Street, London 
EC4P 4AJ, UK (telephone: +44 (0)20 7250 1122), and will be moving 
in 2005 to 30 South Colonnade, Canary Wharf, London E14 5EP , UK.
06 MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
The following description summarises certain material rights of holders 
of the company’s ordinary shares of 25 pence each and material provisions 
of the company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association (the Articles), 
the Memorandum and Articles of Association of Reuters Founders Share
Company Limited (the Founders Share Company) and English law. The
following description is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the Articles (which have been filed with the SEC and Companies
House) and the Companies Act. 
All of the outstanding ordinary shares are fully paid. Accordingly, no 
further contribution of capital may be required from the holders of such 
shares by Reuters.
In this description, the term ‘holder’ refers to the person registered in the
register of members as the holder of the relevant share and the term ‘beneficial
owner’ refers to a person other than the holder who has a beneficial interest in
the relevant share. JPMorgan Chase Bank, which acts as Depositary under the
Deposit Agreement relating to the American Depositary Shares, or ADSs, is the
holder of the ordinary shares represented by the outstanding ADSs.
General
Reuters Group PLC is incorporated under that name and is registered in
England and Wales with registered number 3296375. Its objects are set out in
the fourth clause of its Memorandum of Association and cover a wide range of
activities, including the following:
• collecting information and supplying news and information services and
products;
•
acquiring and operating wireless installations, satellites and other means 
of communication;
•
utilising the Group’s communications capabilities to provide various financial
and securities markets services; and
•
carrying on any other business supplemental to the foregoing or capable of
enhancing the Group’s profitability or capitalising on the Group’s expertise.
The Memorandum of Association provides a broad range of corporate powers
to effect these objectives.
The Reuters Trust Principles and the Founders Share Company
The Articles contain two sets of restrictions relating to the ownership of Reuters
shares. These restrictions are intended to ensure continued compliance with the
following principles (the Reuters Trust Principles) set out in the Article F.114:
• that Reuters shall at no time pass into the hands of any one interest, group
or faction;
•
that the integrity, independence and freedom from bias of Reuters shall at all
times be fully preserved;
•
that Reuters shall supply unbiased and reliable news services to newspapers,
news agencies, broadcasters and other media subscribers and to businesses,
governments, institutions, individuals and others with whom Reuters has or
may have contracts;
• that Reuters shall pay due regard to the many interests which it serves in
addition to those of the media; and
•
that no effort shall be spared to expand, develop and adapt the news and
other services and products of Reuters so as to maintain its leading position
in the international news and information business.
For the purposes of the Reuters Trust Principles, the Articles define the term
Reuters to mean Reuters Group PLC and every subsidiary of it from time to
time supplying news services.
The first set of restrictions contained in the Articles applies to persons that
become ‘interested’ in 15% or more of the ordinary shares outstanding at 
any time (excluding any shares held by Reuters Group as treasury shares). 
The term ‘interested’ is defined in the Articles by reference to provisions of 
the Companies Act which require persons to disclose to public companies
interests in voting shares in excess of a prescribed percentage. Subject to
certain exceptions, all shares held by a person who reaches the 15% limit will
be disenfranchised and the shares exceeding the 15% limit must be disposed
of. This set of restrictions is more fully described below under ‘Rights and
restrictions attaching to shares – Restrictions on ownership – Disenfranchisement
and disposals of excess interests.’
Second, the company’s share capital includes the Founders Share, which 
is held by the Founders Share Company, a company limited by guarantee
consisting of individuals, referred to as the Reuters Trustees, who constitute
both its members and directors. The Founders Share empowers the Founders
Share Company to cast such number of votes as will pass any resolution
supported by and defeat any resolution opposed by, the Founders Share
Company if it believes that any person or persons have obtained, or are
seeking to obtain, control of Reuters Group. Control for these purposes is

Analysis of shareholders defined as the ability to control the exercise of 30% or more of the votes 
that may be cast on a poll at general meetings. Under the Articles, the special
rights attaching to the Founders Share may not be varied or abrogated in any
respect without the prior written consent of the Founders Share Company. 
The rights attaching to the Founders Share are described in more detail below
under ‘Rights and restrictions attaching to shares – Voting rights – Rights
conferred by Founders Share.’
The restrictions on interests in ordinary shares and the extraordinary voting
rights of the Founders Share may be characterised as anti-takeover provisions
to the extent they may have the effect of preventing a bid for control of 
Reuters Group. Tender offers or other non-market acquisitions of shares are
usually made at prices above the prevailing market price of a company’s shares.
Acquisitions of shares by persons attempting to acquire control through 
market purchases may support the price of shares at market levels higher than
otherwise would be the case. The restrictions and extraordinary voting rights
summarised in this section may be expected to preclude such offers.
Directors
The company’s Articles provide for a board of directors consisting of not fewer
than five nor more than 15 directors. The Articles require that, in performing
their duties, the directors have due regard for the Reuters Trust Principles
insofar as, by the proper exercise of their powers and in accordance with their
other duties as directors, the directors may do so. 
The Articles contain provisions that require the board of directors to include 
at least five non-executive directors before a new executive director can 
be appointed.
Under the Articles, a director may not vote in respect of any contract,
arrangement or proposal in which the director, or any person connected with
the director, has any material interest other than by virtue of the director’s
interests in securities of, or otherwise in or through, the company. This is
subject to certain exceptions relating to proposals (a) giving the director any
guarantee, security or indemnity in respect of obligations incurred at the
request of or for the benefit of Reuters Group, (b) giving any guarantee,
security or indemnity to a third party in respect of obligations of Reuters Group
for which the director has assumed responsibility under an indemnity or
guarantee, (c) relating to an offer of securities of Reuters Group in which the
director may be entitled to participate or will be interested as an underwriter,
(d) concerning any other company in which the director is beneficially
interested in less than 1% of the issued shares of any class of the company 
or the voting rights available to its shareholders, (e) relating to the adoption,
modification or operation of any employee benefits plan which will provide 
the director with the same benefits as other employees and (f) relating to 
any liability insurance that Reuters is empowered to purchase for its directors
or employees in respect of actions undertaken as directors or officers of
Reuters Group. 
The directors are empowered to exercise all the powers of Reuters Group to
borrow money, subject to the limitation that the aggregate principal amount
outstanding in respect of monies borrowed by the Reuters Group shall not
exceed a sum equal to the higher of two-and-a-half times the company’s share
capital and aggregate reserves, calculated in the manner described in the
Articles and £5,000 million, unless sanctioned by an ordinary resolution of 
the company’s shareholders.
At each annual general meeting of Reuters shareholders at least one-third 
of the directors (or, if their number is not a multiple of three, the number
nearest to but not greater than one-third) shall retire from office by rotation.
The directors to retire by rotation at the annual general meeting include any
director who is due to retire at the meeting by reason of age. A retiring
director shall be eligible for re-election subject to the requirements of the
Combined Code. Starting at this year’s annual general meeting the Board will
ask all directors to stand for re-election on an annual basis. For additional
information see the Directors’ Report and Corporate Governance which
appear on pages 26 and 29-31.
Directors are not required to hold shares in order to qualify as a director. 
A director not holding any shares may nevertheless attend and speak at
general meetings of the company.
Rights and restrictions attaching to shares
Dividends
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to participate in the payment of
dividends pro rata to their holdings. The Founders Share is not entitled to
participate in the payment of dividends nor will any dividend be paid on any
shares held by Reuters in treasury. The Board may propose and pay interim
dividends and recommend a final dividend, in respect of any accounting
period out of the profits available for distribution under English law.
A final dividend may be declared by the shareholders in general meeting by
ordinary resolution, but no dividend may be declared in excess of the amount
recommended by the Board.
The company may allot ordinary shares in lieu of cash dividends, subject 
to shareholder approval at the time the relevant dividend is declared. 
In addition, the company may declare and pay equivalent dividends to
shareholders outside the United Kingdom in local currencies and pay such
dividends to the Depositary for value on the payment date.
Voting rights
Rights conferred by ordinary shares Voting at a general meeting of shareholders
is by show of hands unless, before or on making known the result, a poll is
demanded in accordance with the Articles. If voting is by show of hands, each
holder of ordinary shares who is present in person has one vote. On a poll,
every holder of ordinary shares who is present in person or by proxy has one
vote for every ordinary share held. This year the Board has decided that voting
on all resolutions will be carried out by way of a poll. This approach is consistent
with the recommendations of the recently published Myners Report to the
Shareholder Voting Working Group.
Holders of a substantial number of ordinary shares may be disenfranchised
under the circumstances described under ‘Restrictions on ownership’ below.
Rights conferred by Founders Share The Founders Share confers upon the
Founders Share Company the right to cast such number of votes as are
necessary to defeat any resolution which would vary or abrogate the rights 
of the Founders Share. The Articles provide that the alteration of specified
articles relating to the Founders Share and the Reuters Trust Principles are
deemed to constitute a variation of the rights of the Founders Share. In
addition, any resolution proposing the winding up of Reuters Group
voluntarily, by the Court, or any reconstruction of Reuters Group, or any
resolution which would attach to any share voting rights not identical in all
respects with those of the ordinary shares, is deemed to be a variation of 
the rights of the Founders Share.
Additionally, if there are, in the opinion of the Founders Share Company,
reasonable grounds for believing that any person and his associates have
obtained or are attempting to obtain, directly or indirectly, control of Reuters
Group, the Founders Share Company is entitled in its absolute discretion to
serve Reuters with a written notice (a Founders Share Control Notice) to that
effect. Control is defined for these purposes as the ability to control the
exercise of 30% or more of the votes which may be cast on a poll at a general
meeting. At all times after the service of a Founders Share Control Notice and
pending its rescission, the Founders Share confers upon the Founders Share
Company the right to cast on a poll such number of votes as are necessary to
ensure the effective passing of any resolution in favour of which it votes and to
ensure the defeat of any resolution against which it votes. The Articles provide
that the opinion of the Founders Share Company in respect of the service or
rescission of a Founders Share Control Notice shall be final and binding and
may not be challenged on any grounds whatsoever.
The Founders Share Company is entitled at any time to serve Reuters with 
a written request for an extraordinary general meeting and the directors are
obliged to comply with such request. If they do not comply, the Founders
Share Company is entitled to convene an extraordinary general meeting. 
If a Founders Share Control Notice has been served, however, the Founders
Share Company can convene an extraordinary general meeting without first
requesting that the directors do so.
Four Reuters Trustees present at the relevant Trustees’ meeting can bind all
the Founders Share Company directors to exercise the voting rights attaching
to the Founders Share so as to defeat a resolution that would be deemed to
Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004   83 INFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS
continued
84 Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004
be a variation of the rights attached to the Founders Share. However, the vote
of a majority of the Reuters Trustees (the chairman of the Founders Share
Company having a casting vote in the event of equality of votes) is required 
to determine whether a Founders Share Control Notice should be served and,
if so, the manner in which the voting rights attaching to the Founders Share
shall be exercised (excluding the vote of any Reuters Trustee who is associated
with or materially financially interested in the person attempting to obtain
control of Reuters).
Restrictions on ownership
Ordinary shares Under the Articles, a person is ‘interested’ in shares if, 
among other things, he is interested directly, or through his family or one or
more companies, or through an interest in association with others pursuant to
an agreement or understanding, or through a trust or if he controls the voting
rights of others. The definition of ‘interest in shares’ in the Articles is made by
reference, with specified variations, to certain provisions of the Companies Act.
Disclosure of interests in ordinary shares The Articles provide for the disclosure
of interests in Reuters ordinary shares by reference to the Companies Act
provisions mentioned above, with specified variations. Under these provisions
as currently in force, if a person acquires an ‘interest’ in voting shares of a
public company amounting to 10% or more of the voting shares of any class,
or if he increases or reduces such holding by at least 1% or if he ceases to
have such holding, he is obliged to notify the company within two days of the
day on which he acquired 10% or any such change in his interest took place.
Further, if his interest is a ‘material interest’ the 10% referred to above is
reduced to 3%.
The Articles provide for disenfranchisement of shares which are the subject of 
a notice under Section 212 of the Companies Act (which allows a company to
require disclosure of certain details concerning ownership of its shares) if the
person served with the notice is in default in answering it. The Articles also
provide for the imposition of restrictions on transferability of the shares
concerned and on the right to receive dividends if such shares represent at
least 0.25% of the class concerned. Such restrictions cannot, however, be
imposed until the expiry of 14 days after the date of the Section 212 notice.
Any such restrictions cease if the shares concerned are sold pursuant to a
takeover offer or to an unconnected third party or through the London Stock
Exchange. The restrictions on transferability only apply to certificated shares.
Where a holder of uncertificated shares is in default in answering a Section 212
notice, the Articles provide that the Founders Share Company may require the
Group’s directors to apply to the Court for such order as may be appropriate.
Disenfranchisement and disposals of excess interests Subject to certain
exceptions described below, certain restrictions apply to persons that become
‘interested’ (as defined in the Articles) in 15% or more of the ordinary shares. 
If any person becomes interested in 15% or more of the outstanding shares
(excluding any shares held by Reuters as treasury shares) (the ‘Relevant
Shares’), the directors are required to serve a Restriction Notice on that
person, on any other person known to the directors to have an interest in the
Relevant Shares and, if different, on the registered holder of the Relevant
Shares. While a Restriction Notice in respect of Relevant Shares is in force, 
a registered holder of the Relevant Shares is not entitled to attend or vote,
either in person or by proxy, at any general meeting or at any meeting of the
holders of any class of Reuters shares. In addition, a Restriction Notice will
require such person to dispose of any Relevant Shares exceeding the 15% limit
and supply evidence to the company that such disposal has occurred within 
21 days or such longer period as the directors consider reasonable. If such
disposition is not made within the specified period, the directors must, 
as far as they are able, dispose of any shares exceeding the 15% limit. Under
the Articles, any belief, resolution, decision or action of the directors held,
made or taken pursuant to any of the provisions concerning restrictions on
ownership shall be conclusive, final and binding on all persons concerned 
and may not be challenged on any grounds whatsoever.
The restrictions are subject to certain modifications where a person becomes
interested in 15% or more of the issued shares of any class by reason of a
rights issue or an underwriting in the ordinary course of its business.
The Founders Share Ownership of the Founders Share is restricted to the
Founders Share Company. Under its Memorandum of Association, the
Founders Share Company is not permitted, directly or indirectly, to dispose of
the Founders Share or of any interest therein, or to grant any rights in respect
of the Founders Share or any interest therein. 
Treasury Shares Reuters may acquire and thereafter hold up to 10% of its
issued listed share capital in treasury. Any such acquisition must be financed
from the distributable profits of Reuters. Subject to certain limited exceptions,
the rights attaching to shares while held in treasury will be suspended. Treasury
shares may only be subsequently disposed of by Reuters by way of cash sale,
transfer for the purposes of or pursuant to an employees’ share scheme 
or cancellation.
Pre-emptive rights, new issues of shares, sale of treasury shares 
and repurchase of shares
Holders of ordinary shares have no pre-emptive rights under the Articles.
However, the ability of the directors to cause the company to issue shares,
securities convertible into shares or rights to shares, or to sell treasury shares,
otherwise than pursuant to an employee share scheme, is restricted.
Under the Companies Act, the directors are, with certain exceptions, unable 
to allot any equity securities without express authorisation, which may be
contained in the Articles or given by its shareholders in general meeting, but
which in either event cannot last for more than five years. The Companies 
Act imposes further restrictions on the issue of equity securities for cash or 
sale of treasury shares for cash other than by offering them first to existing
shareholders unless the statutory requirement is displaced or modified by 
the shareholders in general meeting or under the company’s Articles.
At Reuters annual general meeting to be held on 21 April 2005, a resolution
will be proposed to authorise the directors to allot relevant securities, as
defined in the Companies Act, including any equity securities, up to an
aggregate nominal amount of £108,000,000 until the earlier to occur of the
annual general meeting in 2006 or 21 July 2006. A resolution will also be
proposed to authorise equity securities as defined in the Companies Act to 
be issued within this limit by way of a rights offer, or otherwise pro rata to
existing shareholders, but other issues of equity securities, except for shares
issued pursuant to employee share schemes, will be limited to an aggregate 
of £17,000,000 in nominal value.
Subject to applicable provisions of English law, the company may purchase 
its ordinary shares. Currently, it has general authority to repurchase up to
143,254,000 ordinary shares at prices ranging from 25 pence and not more
than 5% above the average of the middle market quotations taken from the
Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange for the five business days
before the purchase is made. At the Reuters annual general meeting on 
21 April 2005, a resolution will be proposed to increase this authority to
143,540,000 ordinary shares. The directors would only make such purchases
after considering the effects on earnings per share and the benefits for
shareholders generally.
Rights in a winding up
If Reuters Group PLC is wound up, the liquidator may, with the authority of an
extraordinary resolution, divide among the holders of ordinary shares and the
Founders Share, pro rata to their holdings, Reuters assets (after satisfaction of
liabilities to creditors), provided, however, that the Founders Share Company
may receive up to £1 and no more.
Variation of rights and alteration of share capital
If, at any time, the company’s share capital is divided into different classes of
shares, the rights attached to any class may be varied, subject to the provisions
of the Companies Act, with the consent in writing of holders of three-quarters
in value of the shares of that class or upon the adoption of an extraordinary
resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of the
class. At every such separate meeting, all of the provisions of the Articles
relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, except that the quorum 
is to be the number of persons (which must be two or more) who hold or
represent by proxy not less than one-third in nominal value of the issued
shares of the class.
  The company can increase its share capital by ordinary resolution in 
conformity with the provisions of the Companies Act. However, new shares
cannot have voting rights, which are not identical to those of ordinary shares
without the prior written consent of the Founders Share Company. Furthermore,
the company may issue shares with preferred and other special rights or
restrictions, provided that the prior written consent of the Founders Share
Company has been sought for issuing any shares with rights not identical to
those of ordinary shares. The company can consolidate, divide and cancel 
any of its shares (other than the Founders Share) by extraordinary resolution
and can reduce its share capital (other than the Founders Share).
Annual general meetings and extraordinary general meetings
Annual general meetings must be convened upon advance written notice of
21 days. An extraordinary general meeting must be convened upon advance
written notice of 21 days for the passing of a special resolution and 14 days for
any other resolution, depending on the nature of the business to be transacted.
The notice must specify the nature of the business to be transacted if it is other
than routine business or if an extraordinary or a special resolution is proposed.
The notice may also specify a time, not more than 48 hours prior to the time
fixed for the meeting, by which a person must be entered on the company’s
register in order to have the right to attend and vote at the meeting.
Limitations on voting and shareholding
There are no limitations imposed by English law or the company’s Articles on
the right of non-residents or foreign persons to hold or vote ordinary shares or
ADSs, other than the limitations that would generally apply to all of 
Reuters shareholders.
07 EXCHANGE CONTROL
Under English law and the Articles, persons who are neither residents nor
nationals of the UK may freely hold, vote and transfer their ordinary shares 
in the same manner as UK residents or nationals.
There are currently no UK foreign exchange control restrictions on remittances
of dividends to non-resident holders of ordinary shares or on the conduct of
Reuters operations.

trading day of each calendar month during the period.
On 4 March 2005 the Noon Buying Rate was US$1.92 per £1. 
Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the 
US dollar will affect the US dollar amounts received by holders of the ADSs
upon conversion by the depositary of cash dividends paid in pounds sterling
on the ordinary shares and represented by the ADSs. Also, fluctuations in the
exchange rate may affect the relative market prices of the ADSs in the US 
and the ordinary shares in the UK.
For the effect on the Group’s results of operations of fluctuations in the
exchange rates between the pound sterling and the other major currencies
(including the US dollar) in which revenues are received and expenditures are
made by us, see the ‘Operating and financial review’ on pages 11-25.
09 TAXATION INFORMATION FOR US SHAREHOLDERS
The following is a summary of the material US federal income tax and UK tax
consequences of the ownership of ordinary shares or ADSs by a US holder who
holds the ordinary shares or ADSs as capital assets. The summary does not
purport to be a complete technical analysis or listing of all potential tax effects
relevant to a decision to acquire the company’s ordinary shares or ADSs. Nor
does it take into account the specific circumstances of any particular investors,
some of which may be subject to special rules, such as dealers in securities, 
US holders who hold directly or indirectly 10% or more of the voting stock 
or US holders who elected to apply the provisions of the former income tax
convention between the United States and the United Kingdom. In addition,
the summary is based in part upon the representations of the Depositary and
the assumption that each obligation in the Deposit Agreement and any related
agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms. The summaries 
of US and UK tax laws are based on the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations, published
rulings and court decisions, current tax laws, current UK Inland Revenue
published practice and the terms of the UK/US double tax treaty which came
into effect on 31 March 2003 (the Treaty), as appropriate, all of which are
subject to change at any time, possibly with retrospective effect.
For the purposes of this discussion, a ‘US holder’ is any beneficial owner of
ordinary shares or ADSs that is (i) a citizen or resident for tax purposes of the
US, (ii) a corporation organised under the laws of the US or any US State, 
(iii) an estate the income of which is subject to US federal income tax without
regard to its source, or (iv) a trust if a court within the US is able to exercise
primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more US
persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust.
Taxation of dividends 
UK taxation 
Under current UK taxation legislation, no withholding tax will be deducted
from dividends paid by the company. A shareholder that is a company
resident for UK tax purposes in the UK will not generally be taxable on any
dividend it receives from the company. A shareholder who is an individual
resident for tax purposes in the UK is entitled to a tax credit on cash dividends
paid on ordinary shares or ADSs equal to one-ninth of the cash dividend or
10% of the dividend plus the tax credit. Such shareholders will be taxable on
the total of the dividend and the related tax credit, which will be regarded as
the top slice of the shareholder’s income. The tax credit may be set off against
a UK resident individual shareholder’s total income tax liability, but no cash
refund will be available. A US holder will not be entitled to any tax credit from
the UK Inland Revenue in respect of a dividend although there will be no
further UK tax to pay in respect of that dividend.
US federal income taxation
The gross amount of any dividend paid to a US holder will generally be
subject to US federal income taxation. Such a dividend will not be eligible 
for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to US corporations 
with respect to dividends from other US corporations. The amount of the
dividend to be included in income will be the US dollar value of the pound
sterling payments made, determined at the spot pound sterling/US dollar 
rate on the date of the dividend distribution, regardless of whether 
the payment is in fact converted into US dollars.
Qualified dividend income
An individual US holder’s ‘qualified dividend income’ is subject to tax at a
reduced rate of tax of 15% provided that the ordinary shares or ADSs are held
for at least 61 days of the 121 day period beginning on the date which is 60
days before the ex-dividend date and the holder meets other holding period
requirements. Dividends will not however qualify for the reduced rate if the
company were to be treated for the tax year in which dividends are paid 
(or for the prior year), as a ‘foreign investment company,’ a ‘foreign personal
holding company,’ or a ‘passive foreign investment company’ (a PFIC) for US
federal income tax purposes. Recently enacted legislation repealed the foreign
investment company and foreign personal holding company provisions for 
tax years beginning after 31 December 2004. Reuters Group does not believe
that it would be treated as a foreign investment company or a foreign personal
holding company for 2004, or that it is a PFIC or was a PFIC for 2004.
Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004   85 INFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS
continued
86 Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004
Accordingly, Reuters Group considers that dividends paid with respect to the
ordinary shares or ADSs will be ‘qualified dividend income’ and, subject to the
US holder’s satisfaction of the holding period requirements described above,
should be eligible for the reduced 15% US federal income tax rate. Reuters
Group’s dividends generally will be foreign source passive income for US
foreign tax credit purposes.
Taxation of capital gains
UK taxation
Upon a sale or other disposal by a holder of ordinary shares or ADSs, a gain or
loss may be recognised for UK capital gains tax purposes equal broadly to the
difference between the sterling value of the disposal proceeds and the holder’s
tax basis in the relevant ordinary shares or ADSs (and subject to the availability
of any applicable exemptions). Under the Treaty, capital gains on disposals of
ordinary shares or ADSs will generally be subject to tax only in the jurisdiction
of residence of the relevant holder as determined for the purposes of the
Treaty, unless the ordinary shares or ADSs are held as part of the business
property of a permanent establishment of that holder in the UK in which case
such capital gains may be subject to tax in both jurisdictions. The Treaty also
contains an anti-avoidance rule which will be relevant to individuals who are
residents of either the UK or the US and who have been resident of the other
jurisdiction (the US or the UK, as the case may be) at any time during the six
years immediately preceding the relevant disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs.
The Treaty provides that, in such circumstances, capital gains arising from the
disposal may be subject to tax not only in the jurisdiction of which the holder 
is resident at the time of the disposal, but also in that other jurisdiction.
US federal income taxation
Upon a sale or other disposal by a US holder of ordinary shares or ADSs, 
a gain or loss may be recognised for US federal income tax purposes equal
broadly to the difference between the US dollar value of the disposal proceeds
and the US holder’s tax basis (determined in US dollars) in the relevant ordinary
shares or ADSs. Generally, such gain or loss will be regarded as a capital gain
or loss and, as a long-term capital gain or loss, if the US holder’s holding
period for such ordinary shares or ADSs exceeds one year. Long-term capital
gains of a non-corporate US holder are generally subject to a maximum tax
rate of 15%.
Any such gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the
US for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. The deductibility of a capital loss
is subject to limitations since the ADSs and ordinary shares are publicly traded,
their disposal will be considered to occur on the ‘trade date,’ regardless of the
US holder’s method of accounting. In addition, a US holder that receives
foreign currency upon the sale or exchange of ordinary shares or ADSs and
subsequently converts the foreign currency into US dollars, will have a foreign
exchange gain or loss based on any appreciation or depreciation in the value
of the foreign currency against the US dollar. Foreign exchange gain or loss
will generally be US source ordinary income or loss. Deposits and withdrawals
of ordinary shares by US holders in exchange for ADSs will not result in the
realisation of a gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes.
Additional tax considerations
UK inheritance tax
An individual who is domiciled in the US for the purposes of the UK/US Estate
and Gift Tax Convention (the Convention) and who is not a national of the UK
for the purposes of the Convention, will not generally be subject to UK
inheritance tax in respect of ordinary shares or ADSs on the individual’s death,
or on a transfer of ordinary shares or ADSs during the individual’s lifetime
provided that any applicable US federal gift or estate tax is paid. However,
such an individual will be subject to UK inheritance tax if the ordinary shares or
ADSs are part of the business property of a permanent establishment of the
individual in the UK, or pertain to a fixed base in the UK of an individual who
performs independent personal services. Special rules apply to ordinary shares
or ADSs held in trust. In the exceptional case, where the disposition is subject
both to UK inheritance tax and to US federal gift or estate tax, the Convention
generally provides for any tax paid in the UK to be credited against tax liable
to be paid in the US, or for tax paid in the US to be credited against the tax
payable in the UK, based on priority rules set out in the Convention.
UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax
No UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) will be payable on 
the transfer of an ADS, or agreement to transfer an ADS, provided that the
instrument of transfer, or written agreement, is executed and retained outside
the UK and does not relate to any matter or thing done, or to be done, in 
the UK.
UK stamp duty will generally be payable on conveyances or transfers 
of ordinary shares, at the rate of 0.5% of the amount or value of the
consideration, if any, for the transfer (rounded up to the next multiple of £5).
SDRT will be imposed, at the rate of 0.5% of the amount or value of the
consideration for the transfer if an agreement is made for the transfer of
ordinary shares, unless an instrument of transfer of the ordinary shares in
favour of the purchaser, or its nominee, is executed and duly stamped within
six years of the day that the agreement is made (or, in a case where the
agreement is conditional, the day that the condition is satisfied) in which case,
any SDRT paid will be repaid (together with interest where the SDRT is not less
than £25) on a claim for repayment or, to the extent not paid, the charge to
SDRT will be cancelled. SDRT is in general payable by the purchaser of
ordinary shares, but there are regulations which provide for collection from
other persons in certain circumstances, including from CREST where the
relevant ordinary shares are held in CREST. UK stamp duty or SDRT will
generally be imposed on any instrument transferring ordinary shares to a
person, or to a nominee or agent for such a person, whose business is or
includes issuing depositary receipts (such as the ADSs) for relevant securities.
In these circumstances, stamp duty or SDRT will be charged at the rate of
approximately 1.5% of the amount or value of the consideration for the
conveyance or transfer on sale or, otherwise, 1.5% of the value of the security
transferred at the date the instrument is executed. A transfer into CREST will
not be subject to this charge.
An agreement to transfer ordinary shares will normally give rise to a charge 
to SDRT at the rate of 0.5% of the amount or value of the consideration for 
the ordinary shares. However, if a duly stamped instrument of transfer of the
ordinary shares is executed in pursuance of the agreement and duly stamped
within six years of the date on which the agreement is made (or, in a case
where the agreement is conditional, the date that the condition is satisfied)
any SDRT paid will be repaid. To the extent the SDRT has not already been
paid, the charge to SDRT will be cancelled. 
SDRT is in general payable by the purchaser of ordinary shares. However, 
there are regulations which provide for collection from other persons in 
certain circumstances. 
US PFIC status
If a foreign company is a PFIC, then certain distributions and gains can be
allocated rateably over a US holder’s holding period, with the effect that the
amount allocated to the current taxable year and any taxable year before the
company became a PFIC would be taxable as ordinary income in the current
year and the amount allocated to other taxable years would be taxed at the
highest rate in effect for that year on ordinary income. The tax is also subject
to an interest charge to recover the deemed benefit from the deferred
payment of the tax attributable to each such year. As stated above under the
heading ‘Taxation of capital gains – US federal income taxation’, the company
reasonably believes that it was not a PFIC in 2004 and does not anticipate
becoming a PFIC. However, the tests for determining PFIC status are applied
annually and it is difficult to make accurate predictions of future income and
assets, which are relevant to this determination. Accordingly, Reuters Group
cannot assure US holders that the IRS would agree with its belief, nor can the
company assure US holders that it will not become a PFIC. US holders are
urged to consult their own tax advisors about the PFIC rules, including the
consequences to them of making a mark-to-market election with respect to
Reuters Group’s ordinary shares and ADSs in the event that it qualifies as a PFIC.
  US information reporting and backup withholding
A US holder is generally subject to information reporting requirements with
respect to dividends paid in the US on ordinary shares or ADSs and disposal
proceeds realised from the sale, exchange, redemption or other disposal 
of ordinary shares or ADSs. In addition, a US holder is subject to backup
withholding (currently at a rate of 28%) on dividends paid in the US on
ordinary shares or ADSs and disposal proceeds realised from the sale,
exchange, redemption or other disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs unless 
the US holder is a corporation, provides an IRS Form W-9 or otherwise
establishes a basis for exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax.
The amount of any backup withholding will be allowed as a credit against a US
holder’s US federal income tax liability and may be refunded, provided that
certain information is furnished to the IRS.
10 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND MATERIAL CONTRACTS
Related party transactions – General
Related party transactions are principally with Radianz, Factiva, TSI and Instinet
Group, each as described below. Reuters Group has entered into arrangements
with many of its subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates, and has
in addition provided financial information services to, and purchased services
from, many of the companies with which it shares a common director. Except
as otherwise indicated, all of these transactions are in the normal course of
business on commercial terms. Excluding transactions with Radianz, Factiva,
TSI and Instinet Group, services provided to related parties totalled £5 million
and services purchased totalled £19 million. 
Only in the case of the transactions with Radianz, Factiva, 3 Times Square
Associates LLC (3XSQ Associates), TSI and Instinet Group were any of the
amounts involved material to either party. These services are ongoing and
continued at historical levels to the date of this report.
Radianz
During 2004 and in accordance with inter-company agreements including
those described below, Radianz provided the Group with network services
totalling £277 million (2003: £304 million, 2002: £284 million). In 2004, Reuters
Group provided Radianz with certain technical, field engineering, IT systems,
property and human resource services for a total cost of £66 million (2003: 
£82 million, 2002: £126 million).
Network Services Agreement To secure the long-term availability of the
Radianz network for the Reuters Group, Reuters entered into a Network
Services Agreement (the NSA) with Radianz in May 2000 in connection with
the formation of Radianz. The NSA had an initial term ending on 1 July 2005
and thereafter would remain in full force and effect for successive one-year
periods unless either party gave six months’ notice prior to the expiration.
Radianz agreed to provide reasonable assistance to Reuters in the event of
termination of the NSA, to ensure that Reuters could migrate the services 
from Radianz to a third-party company. The NSA remains in effect following
Reuters purchase of the Equant Group’s entire stake in Radianz. However, in
connection with Reuters exclusive discussions with BT to secure a long-term
network services agreement, Reuters has served formal notification of its
intention to terminate the NSA at the 1 July 2005 expiry of the initial term.
The standards for performance of services provided in the NSA have been
agreed between Reuters and Radianz. In addition, the NSA sets out the
processes and procedures for managing the contract going forward. In
particular, the NSA sets out details for monthly performance reviews to review
capacity service levels, operational changes and orders, introduction of new
services and ongoing requirements by Reuters. There is also provision for
quarterly meetings to discuss the contract and its operation and technical
matters relating to the business continuity plans.
Reuters generally agreed to continue to use Radianz for its network services 
in support of global and strategic products during the term of the agreement.
Detailed provisions in respect of rates and charges were agreed between
Radianz and Reuters. Radianz agreed that it shall provide the network services
to Reuters on terms which are no less favourable than reasonably comparable
services offered to any other customer of Radianz, and Reuters agreed to
spend an agreed amount with Radianz annually.
Purchase of Equant Stake On 21 October 2004, Reuters entered into an agreement
to purchase Equant’ s entire stake in Radianz for £60 million (US$110 million) in cash
together with the release of future funding obligations. The transaction completed
on 16 November 2004. The purchase agreement included standard corporate
representations and warranties by each of Equant and Reuters as to itself, and was
otherwise generally on customary terms and conditions for a transaction of this
nature. At the same time as Reuters announced its agreement to purchase Equant’ s
stake, Reuters also announced that it was in exclusive discussions with BT to secure 
a long-term agreement for the provision of network services, which is expected to
involve the sale of Radianz to BT . For more information, see ‘Our markets drive our
organisational structure – Communications networks’ on page 7.
Factiva
Factiva and Reuters each provide a variety of services to the other. Factiva
hosts and maintains Reuters pictures archiving service under a rolling one-year
contract. Under a three-year agreement commencing on 1 January 2003,
Factiva permits Reuters to incorporate Factiva content in certain Reuters
products. Under a separate licence, Factiva also permits Reuters staff to access
Factiva content. The total cost of the services provided by Factiva to Reuters 
in 2004 was £9 million (2003: £7 million, 2002: £19 million).
Reuters provides Factiva with technical and administrative support services,
including use of Reuters premises, facilities, finance and payroll services,
subject to termination by Factiva on six months’ written notice or Reuters on
twelve months’ written notice. Reuters also provides content, including its
newswires, to Factiva for incorporation in Factiva services for a royalty payment.
This agreement is currently being renegotiated. In 2004, Reuters granted
Factiva an additional trademark licence permitting Factiva to use Reuters name
for an annual fee based on a percentage, increasing in the next calendar year,
of Factiva’s gross revenues. The licence continues until breach, insolvency,
dissolution of the joint venture or Reuters owning less than 50% of Factiva. 
The total cost of the services provided by Reuters to Factiva in 2004 was 
£23 million (2003: £47 million, 2002: £61 million).
Under the terms of the agreement with Dow Jones & Co. relating to the
formation of the Factiva joint venture, Reuters has agreed that it will only
supply its content in accordance with its written policy regarding distribution 
of content to third parties and that in the event that it makes its proprietary
content available to any service that competes or would reasonably be
deemed to compete with Factiva then any revenue from such sale shall 
be paid to Factiva. Such terms also apply to Dow Jones.
In connection with the formation of the Factiva joint venture, Reuters agreed
to invest US$20 million in cash in the venture over a period of five years by
means of an interest-free promissory note. At the beginning of 2004, this
stood at £1 million. It was repaid during the year.
At 31 December 2003, Reuters held a loan of £5 million (2002: £7 million)
repayable to Factiva, for the settlement of trading balances between Reuters
and Factiva. This bore interest at LIBOR and was repaid during the year. 
A further loan of £11 million repayable to Factiva, on which interest is payable
at LIBOR, was taken out by Reuters during the year and remained payable at
31 December 2004. This is a short-term deposit of surplus cash.
TSI
On 3 February 2004, Reuters Group reduced its stake in TSI from 48.4% to
8.8%. During 2004, Reuters Group purchased £13 million of services from TSI
(2003: £16 million, 2002: £5 million).
Licences Reuters owns the underlying intellectual property and technology 
that was in existence at 31 December 1996 and that is incorporated into 
many of TSI’s products. Reuters licenses this technology to TSI. TSI owns all
technology and related intellectual property rights independently developed
by TSI since 1 January 1997, including enhancements and improvements 
to the licensed technology, which TSI itself licenses to Reuters.
Through the third quarter of 2003, Reuters had a licence, distribution and
maintenance agreement with TSI pursuant to which Reuters was required to
pay TSI certain minimum distribution fees related to sales of TSI’s products to
Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004   87 INFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS
continued
88 Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004
financial services market customers. Under this agreement, Reuters obligations
with respect to the minimum distribution fees were to expire at the end of
2003, and TSI was restricted until May 2004 from selling its products and
providing consulting services directly to companies in the financial services
market, except in limited circumstances, if Reuters continued to pay the
minimum distribution fees until that date. In October 2003, Reuters entered
into a revised commercial agreement with TSI. Pursuant to the revised
agreement, TSI has the right to market and sell its products to customers in
the financial services market, except that TSI will not be able to market or sell
risk management applications or market data systems for financial services
companies or to sell to financial services customers through four specified
resellers until May 2008. Reuters will continue to have the right to use TSI
technology internally and embedded within its products, and TSI will provide
certain fee-based support services to Reuters. The agreement provided that
Reuters and TSI would work together to migrate Reuters existing customers’
maintenance contracts to TSI, and that Reuters rights to re-sell ended in
October 2003, subject to completion of a limited number of then in progress
opportunities. From October 2003 until March 2005, Reuters made quarterly
payments of US$5 million to TSI, subject to reduction based on TSI’s direct
revenues from products and support sold to financial services customers.
On 27 February 2005, Reuters and TSI entered into an amendment to the
commercial agreement under which TSI granted Reuters new rights to resell 
a defined set of TSI software products solely in conjunction with the sale by
Reuters of its market data delivery solutions in return for Reuters paying TSI
licence fees in minimum annual amount of US$11 million. The reseller rights
have an initial term of one year which Reuters may elect to extend for two
further one-year terms. The amendment also extended the time during which
Reuters has the right to use TSI technology internally and embedded within its
products by one year, to 31 December 2012.
Repurchase by TSI At the same time as the licence agreement revision in
October 2003, Reuters and TSI entered into an agreement pursuant to which
TSI agreed to register sales by Reuters of its TSI shares under US securities
laws, and to repurchase up to US$115 million of its shares from Reuters upon
Reuters completing a single public offering of at least US$100 million of TSI
shares. In February 2004, Reuters completed a registered public offering of 
69 million TSI shares for US$473 million (£261 million), and TSI repurchased 
an additional 17 million shares for US$115 million, resulting in aggregate net
proceeds to Reuters, after underwriting and transaction fees, of approximately
US$563 million (£310 million).
3XSQ Associates 
Reuters is party to a lease entered into in 1998 with 3XSQ Associates, an 
entity owned by Reuters and Rudin Times Square Associates, LLC formed to
acquire, develop and operate the 3 Times Square property and building.
Pursuant to the lease, which has been amended from time to time, Reuters
leases approximately 692,000 square feet for a term of approximately 20 
years expiring in 2021, with an option to terminate 10 years early as to 77,000
square feet and three successive ten-year renewal options as to the entirety of
the space. During 2002, 2003 and 2004, Reuters made payments to 3XSQ
Associates in respect of rent, operating expenses, taxes, insurance and other
obligations in the amounts of US$32.7 million, US$33.3 million and US$32.9
million, respectively. The lease is supported by a US$120 million letter of credit
provided by Reuters.
Instinet Group 
Reuters and Instinet Group are party to numerous agreements and
arrangements, including those described below, under which they provide
each other with various products, services, licences and other transactions. 
Sale of Bridge Trading On 28 February 2005, Reuters entered into an
agreement to sell Bridge Trading to Instinet Group for US$21.5 million in
Instinet Group stock, subject to adjustment for working capital and net capital.
The transaction is anticipated to complete by the end of April 2005, subject to
approval from the NASD and other customary conditions. Pursuant to the
agreement, until 31 December 2005 Bridge Trading will continue to have
exclusive rights to allow its existing clients to pay for Reuters Station through
‘soft dollar’ credits generated by trading activity. In addition, Reuters has
agreed for a period of one year not to operate a US broker dealer which
allows its customers to pay for Reuters Station on a soft dollar basis, and not
to solicit Bridge Trading employees, in each case subject to certain exceptions.
The agreement otherwise includes representations and warranties, covenants
and other terms customary for a transaction of this nature. Following the sale,
Reuters will continue to provide certain transitional services to Bridge Trading
for a period through to 31 December 2005, including a lease arrangement for
space currently occupied by Bridge Trading, various administrative, technology
and other support services, and a royalty-free licence to the Bridge Trading
trademark. Other than the licence, such arrangements include fees generally
based on allocated or attributable costs.
RGRS Under agreements between Reuters and Instinet Group, Instinet Group
customers gain the ability to submit orders to Instinet Group and to receive
indications of interest from Instinet Group over the RGRS network. Instinet
Group is not required to pay for orders it receives through RGRS. The US
agreement (covering global orders submitted via a US connection) term is 
to 17 December 2005 subject to annual renewal thereafter, and is subject 
to termination rights if Reuters ceases to own a majority of Instinet Group’s
voting stock. The UK agreement (covering global orders submitted via a UK
connection) will continue until terminated by either party on six months’ notice.
In addition, under a development agreement Reuters develops enhancements
to the RGRS interface so that customers can better access Instinet Group’s
proprietary trading functionality. The current term runs through to 19 September
2005 subject to annual renewal thereafter and terminable by either party 
on a change of control of Instinet Group, including if Reuters ceases to own 
a majority of Instinet Group’s voting stock.
Newport
SM
Under an agreement with Instinet Group, Reuters has the exclusive
right to provide the real-time market data for Instinet Group’s Newport
SM
(patent pending) program trading application. The current agreement term is
to 19 September 2005 subject to annual renewal thereafter and is terminable
by either party on a change of control of Instinet Group, including if Reuters
ceases to own a majority of Instinet Group’s voting stock.
Market data Reuters had been entitled to redistribute certain proprietary
equity securities data from Instinet Group under two data distribution
agreements. Under a data distribution agreement entered into at the time of
the Instinet IPO in May 2001, Reuters had the limited right to be the exclusive
data vendor distributing some of Instinet Group’s proprietary equity securities
data; however, this agreement terminated on 17 May 2004. Under a separate
agreement originally entered into with Island ECN (which was acquired by
Instinet Group in September 2002), Reuters has the right to redistribute a
broader set of proprietary equity securities data from Instinet Group. This
agreement, which continued in effect notwithstanding the termination of the
exclusive arrangement described above, has a term until 28 June 2005 subject
to annual renewal thereafter. Reuters is not required to make payments in
connection with any such redistribution. 
Customer agreement Instinet Group has entered into an agreement for certain
Reuters information services and related hardware, software and support on
terms to Reuters independent third-party customers, as well as an addendum
under which Reuters has granted Instinet Group the right to redistribute
certain information both internally and to its customers subject to termination
upon 180 days’ notice by either party.
Preferred soft-dollar arrangement This agreement establishes a preferred
commercial and soft-dollar arrangement for Instinet Group customers that
purchase Reuters products and services. This is available to certain customers
who are increasing their level of business with Instinet Group, Reuters or both.
Reuters compensates Instinet Group’s sales personnel for new sales of Reuters
products and services, and Instinet Group will pay Reuters an annual fee for
various administrative and marketing services related to training of Instinet
Group’s personnel. The current agreement term is to 19 September 2005
subject to annual renewal thereafter and is terminable by either party on a
change of control of Instinet Group, including if Reuters ceases to own a
majority of Instinet Group’s voting stock. 
  Commission sharing agreement Instinet Group has agreed to open accounts
for some institutional clients that Bridge Trading introduces to Instinet Group,
and to rebate Bridge Trading portions of the commissions these customers 
pay at a commercially reasonable rate. This agreement is terminable at will 
by either party. 
Triad Under an agreement with Bridge Trading, Instinet Group has the ability
to deliver indications of interest and advertised trades to its customers and
potential customers through Reuters Triad network. Instinet Group pays
standard commercial rates for indications of interest and advertised trades it
delivers through Triad. The current term of the agreement is to 22 July 2005,
subject to annual renewal thereafter. 
Patent licensing agreement Reuters has granted Instinet Group a patent
licence permitting Instinet Group to make, use and sell products that include 
a system with functionality that identifies counterparties to a transaction and
enables communication between the counterparties to negotiate the terms 
of the transaction. This licence is for the life of the patent, although it may be
terminated under customary conditions. In addition, Reuters has the right to
terminate in the event that Instinet uses the patent to create products that
compete with any of Reuters products. Reuters also has the right to terminate
the licence generally if it ceases to own a majority of Instinet Group’s voting
stock, subject to Instinet retaining some rights to the patent for products
existing on or before the date of such termination. Instinet has also agreed
that if it obtains a patent for a system with substantially similar functionality, 
it would grant Reuters a licence to that patent on terms no worse than the
terms of this licence. 
Global Solutions Agreement This agreement enables Instinet Group to license
software from Reuters, usually on a one-time fee basis, on a worldwide basis.
Reuters has also agreed to provide software support for the licensed products.
Fixed income technology licence Instinet Group has granted Reuters a royalty
free, non-exclusive, non-assignable worldwide right and licence to use some
technology that is owned by or licensed to Instinet Group related to its fixed
income securities platform. This agreement will automatically terminate,
subject to Reuters retention of some rights with respect to specified products
and enhancements, once Reuters ceases to own more than 50% of Instinet
Group’s common stock.
Research & Analytics In September 2001, Reuters purchased Instinet Group’s
Research and Analytics (R&A) product, an analytic software application that
incorporates quotes, news and access to an INET trading application.
Following the R&A purchase, Instinet Group was permitted to continue to
make available soft-dollar payment options to its customers in connection 
with their use of the R&A product and any replacement product, and Reuters
agreed until 18 June 2003 not to provide any soft dollar payment options to
certain R&A customers, directly or through a third party, other than through
Instinet Group. Reuters and Instinet Group each agreed to provide various
transitional services relating to the R&A product to the other until 30 April
2003 although Instinet Group continued to provide transitional services until
31 July 2004. In addition, Instinet Group agreed to provide Reuters assistance
in migrating R&A customers to a Reuters desktop product under an incentive
arrangement scheme. The migration was completed in July 2004, with all
migrating customers bering transferred to the Reuters Station product.
3 Times Square sublease Instinet Group is subject to an agreement with
Reuters to sublease 368,000 square feet of office space at 3 Times Square 
in New York City. The sublease term is until 2021, with a one-time right of
termination in 2011 as to approximately half the space.
Corporate agreement Reuters and Instinet Group are parties to a corporate
agreement providing for, among other things: (i) Reuters rights to nominate
directors to the Instinet Group board; (ii) consent rights by Reuters with respect
to specified significant transactions so long as Reuters beneficially owns at
least 35% but less than a majority of Instinet Group’s voting stock; (iii) consent
rights with respect to Instinet Group incurring more than US$400 million net
indebtedness, other than in the ordinary course of its brokerage or similar
businesses, so long as Reuters holds a majority of Instinet Group’s outstanding
voting stock; (iv) restrictions on Instinet Group voluntarily taking any action
reducing Reuters ownership to less than 51%; and (v) restrictions on Instinet
Group becoming registered as a national securities exchange, without Reuters
prior consent, if such registration would materially affect Reuters ability to
exercise its voting and other rights related to its ownership of Instinet common
shares, so long as Reuters beneficially owns more than 30% of Instinet Group’s
voting stock.
Stockholder agreement In connection with Instinet Group’s acquisition of
Island in 2002, Reuters entered into various agreements with Instinet Group
and certain stockholders of Island providing for, among other things, director
nomination rights and voting, restrictions on purchases, sales and issuances 
of Instinet Group shares, approval rights regarding certain transactions, 
and registration rights. Reuters is limited from acquiring additional shares 
of Instinet Group without the consent of Instinet Group’s Board until
September 2005, with certain exceptions and subject to earlier termination 
in some circumstances.
Other material contracts
Savvis Network Services Agreement In connection with the Bridge acquisition 
in 2001, Reuters entered into a binding term sheet with Savvis, Bridge’s network
service provider, under which Savvis agreed to provide internet protocol network
services, internet access and co-location services necessary to continue network
services for the Bridge business and customers Reuters was acquiring. The term
sheet was formalised by an agreement entered into by the parties in September
2001, which has subsequently been amended at various times. The agreement,
which has a five-year term, contained minimum spend commitments for each
year. As a result of various set-offs and other reductions under the agreement,
for the nine-month period ending 30 September 2005, Reuters will be required
to spend a minimum of US$32.1 million, subject to adjustment and reduction
under certain circumstances; thereafter, Reuters will have no further minimum
spend commitments to Savvis. If Savvis does not meet certain required quality of
service levels, Reuters is entitled to credits and, in the event of a material breach
of such quality of service levels, Reuters is entitled to terminate the agreement.
In addition, upon successful completion of its acquisition of Telerate, Reuters
would acquire Telerate’s network services agreement with Savvis, relating to
Telerate services.
Telerate Acquisition Agreement On 20 December 2004, Reuters entered 
into an agreement to acquire substantially all of the business of Telerate 
for base consideration of US$100 million and Reuters 40,870 shares of 
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in Savvis. The purchase price is subject 
to adjustment for working capital and an increase by an amount currently
estimated to be US$28 million (£15 million) to the extent certain actions
Telerate may independently take prior to closing result in corresponding
reduction of Reuters anticipated post-closing restructuring costs. Under the
agreement, Reuters has provided US$34 million (£18 million) in funding to
Telerate, which, together with interest, will be applied against the purchase
price upon the closing or repaid through a draw on a letter of credit in the
event the deal acquisition does not proceed.
The agreement generally is on customary terms including representations,
warranties, covenants, conditions (including regulatory approvals) and
indemnities by each of the parties. A portion of the purchase price, consisting
of US$30 million cash (subject to increase in connection with an estimate of
closing working capital) and US$15 million worth of Savvis stock valued at the
closing, will be put into escrow for two years to serve, in general, as the sole
source of funding for any post-closing claims by Reuters. The agreement may
be terminated in certain circumstances, including: upon mutual agreement; if the
closing has not occurred by 20 December 2005 so long as the failure to close was
not the result of the terminating party’s material breach; upon material breach by
either party; if any condition shall become impossible to satisfy; if completion is
prohibited by final court order; or if any of Telerate’s US subsidiaries shall enter
bankruptcy proceedings. For more information on the pending Telerate
acquisition, see pages 7 and 20, as well as the discussion on the following page.

Telerate Transitional Services Agreement Reuters is party to a Transitional
Services Agreement (TSA) with Telerate and certain of its subsidiaries dated as
of 2 June 2003. The TSA arises from Reuters and Telerate’s respective
acquisitions of certain assets out of bankruptcy from Bridge in late 2001 and
formalises a term sheet the parties had been operating under since that time.
Because the businesses Telerate acquired – the global Telerate business and
certain businesses of Bridge in Europe and Asia – were dependent on the
software, systems and support capabilities acquired by Reuters and because
some of the operations acquired by Reuters in Europe and Asia were to a
lesser extent dependent on the assets and operations acquired by Telerate,
the parties entered into the TSA pursuant to which each agreed to provide 
the other with certain software and/or services for a transitional period.
Under the TSA, Telerate has a limited right to sublicence to its own clients
certain proprietary software acquired by Reuters from Bridge. Reuters also
provides Telerate with a variety of services – including data management,
central system software development, technical operations and back office
support – associated with management of the Bridge Data Network acquired
by Reuters. Telerate had provided Reuters with facilities and maintenance for
equipment supporting the data collection function of the Bridge Data Network
in Europe and Asia, among other services, although these have largely been
terminated over time as Reuters now provides these functions for itself.
For the term of the TSA, Telerate is restricted in its ability to sell equities
information products in North America where Reuters acquired the business 
of Bridge. The term of the TSA originally commenced on 18 October 2001
and ran to 18 October 2005, but has been extended as described below. 
Each party has a right to terminate services it is receiving under the TSA prior
to the TSA’s expiration. In addition, there is an obligation for each party to
cancel services it is receiving if it is able to provide those services for itself 
or to contract for the services with a third party. Each party has a right to
terminate the TSA in the event of a material breach by the other party.
In connection with discussions relating to and the execution of the definitive
agreement for Reuters acquisition of Telerate, the parties agreed to extend the
expiration date of the TSA while the acquisition is pending, and, in the event
the acquisition is terminated without completion, to extend the expiration date
further to approximately 27 months from the date of termination of the
acquisition. The parties have agreed that upon the successful completion of
the acquisition, any outstanding invoicing and payment disputes under the
TSA will be settled for a payment to Reuters of approximately $22 million,
including the release to Reuters of approximately $12 million escrowed under
the TSA from payments of disputed amounts made by each of Reuters and
Telerate during the term of the TSA.
Financing arrangement. For a discussion of other material contracts, see
‘Treasury Policies, Financing and Foreign Exchange’ on pages 21-22.

sheet on pages 59-60 and 69.
13 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
The computer equipment that Reuters uses to create, manage and deliver 
its products to customers across the world forms the bulk of its tangible 
fixed assets. This equipment is distributed across global sites with greater
concentration at the major global and regional technical centres. As Reuters
extends its use of hosting services and browser delivery for its products, the
quantity of equipment located at customer sites is being reduced.
The Group’s principal facilities are:
• the corporate headquarters (100,000 sq. ft.) in Fleet Street, London;
In September 2003, Reuters announced arrangements to consolidate its
London-based operations into a new building at Canary Wharf during 2005.
Under the agreement, Reuters has taken a lease on a 281,000 sq. ft. office
building and transferred approximately 340,000 sq. ft. of redundant offices,
including 85 Fleet Street, to Canary Wharf Group for cash consideration of
approximately £30 million, leasing back 85 Fleet Street on a temporary basis
pending the move to Canary Wharf, which is expected to be completed by
the end of 2005.
• the US headquarters at 3 Times Square in New York City (692,000 sq. ft.)
•
the technical centres in London (324,000 sq. ft.), Hazelwood, Missouri
(109,000 sq. ft.), Geneva (144,000 sq.ft.), which also includes the regional
office for EMEA, Singapore (180,000 sq. ft.), which also includes the regional
office for Asia, and Hauppauge, New York (50,000 sq. ft.); and
•
the four corporate office buildings located in St. Louis County, Missouri
(aggregate of 211,000 sq. ft.).
Reuters owns the land on which its London and Hauppauge technical centres 
are situated, whereas its buildings in Geneva and Singapore were built on
leased land. The leases, including periods covered by options to extend,
expire in 2095 and 2050, respectively.
The Reuters Building at 3 Times Square is owned, and was developed, 
by 3XSQ Associates, which is owned by Reuters and Rudins Times Square
Associates LLC. In May 2001 Reuters commenced its lease of 692,000 sq. ft.
from the venture, of which 368,000 sq. ft. is subleased to Instinet Group, which
in turn has subleased 180,000 sq. ft. to third parties. The principal part of
Reuters lease will expire in 2021. See ‘3XSQ Associates’ sublease on page 88
for further information.
In 2003, the major technical centre building in Hazelwood, Missouri was
acquired from Savvis for a total consideration of £24 million. Reuters
subsequently entered into a sale and leaseback for the facility, receiving 
£23 million under a 20 year arrangement. 
During 2004, Reuters extended its facilities in Bangkok to 100,000 sq. ft. 
In Bangalore, a second facility adjacent to the company’s existing offices was
secured, providing approximately 150,000 sq. ft. of office accommodation.
14 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Except as described below, Reuters Group is not subject to any legal or
arbitration proceedings which may have, or have had in the recent past,
significant effects on the company’s financial performance or profitability.
Instinet Group is a party to certain legal proceedings including the following:
The Island ECN Inc. v. Archipelago LLC and REDIBook ECN LLC; 
Archipelago Securities LLC v. Instinet Group Incorporated
On 20 September 2002, Island ECN commenced an arbitration proceeding
against respondents Archipelago LLC (Archipelago) and REDIBook ECN LLC
(REDIBook) before the NASD. Island alleged that each respondent entered into
a subscriber agreement with Island which prescribed certain fees and, despite
Island’s demand that each respondent abide by the terms of its contract, 
each respondent refused to pay such fees. Island is seeking damages of 
US$5.2 million from Archipelago and US$4 million from REDIBook. Archipelago
and REDIBook have answered and counterclaimed against Island by denying
the substantive allegations of Island’s statement of claim, asserting certain
affirmative defences and counterclaims against Island, alleging that Island
engaged in unfair, discriminatory pricing practices against these respondents
and asserting claims involving breach of contract, breach of obligations of 
good faith, and attempted monopolisation and conspiracy to restrain trade
under the US Sherman Act. The counterclaims allege damages of no less than
US$30 million before trebling, for a total of no less than US$90 million treble
damages pursuant to the federal antitrust laws. Archipelago is also seeking
attorney’s fees.
Additionally, on 19 February 2003, Archipelago commenced a separate action
against Instinet Group before the NASD, in which it alleged that Instinet Group
also engaged in unfair, discriminatory pricing practices against it and asserted
claims involving breach of contract, breach of obligation of good faith, and
attempted monopolisation and conspiracy to restrain trade under the US
Sherman Act. Archipelago seeks no less than US$41 million before trebling 
for a total of no less than US$123 million trebled damages. Instinet Group 
has answered and intends to defend the proceeding vigorously.
These two actions have been consolidated by agreement of the parties and
are in the discovery phase.
Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004   91 92 Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004
NexTrade Holdings, Inc. v. ProTrader Group, LP , ProTrader Securities Corp.,
ProTrader Technologies LP, ProTrader Trading LLC, ProTrader Services LP and
ProTrader.com LP. and Instinet Group Incorporated. 
On 4 February, 2003, NexTrade Holdings, Inc. commenced an action against
certain subsidiaries of ProTrader Group LP , a business acquired by Instinet
Group in 2001, in the United States District Court, Middle District of Florida,
Tampa Division. The complaint alleges that these subsidiaries adopted and
used the mark ‘ProTrader’ in violation of § 32(1) of the US Lanham Act. The
complaint further alleges that these subsidiaries’ use of the ProTrader mark is
likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception among purchasers of software,
services and goods bearing the name ‘ProTrader,’ which allegedly constitutes
false designation of origin and unfair competition in violation of § 43(a) of 
the US Lanham Act. The complaint also alleges that these subsidiaries’ use
constitutes trademark infringement in violation of Florida state statutes and 
its common law, and unfair competition based on trademark infringement in
violation of the common law of Florida. Finally, the complaint alleges fraud 
in the inducement based on defendants’ alleged deceitful negotiations to
resolve the dispute. Plaintiff seeks to recover all of these subsidiaries’ profits,
gains and advantages resulting from the unauthorised use of the ‘ProTrader’
mark, damages sustained by the plaintiff of no less than US$15 million before
trebling and that such damages be trebled, and exemplary and punitive
damages of not less than US$90 million. Defendants have answered the
complaint by denying the substantive allegations, asserting certain affirmative
defences and by counterclaiming against NexTrade, seeking a cancellation 
of the ‘Pro-Trade’ trademark on the ground that it is descriptive and Plaintiff
committed fraud on the Patent and Trademark Office during the prosecution
of its application. In June 2004, the Court ordered that Instinet Group as well
as certain former officers of the ProTrader entities be named as additional
defendants in the action. Instinet Group and NexTrade all filed motions for
summary judgment on 15 June, 2004 and then filed renewed motions for
summary judgment on 31 August, 2004. On 15 October 2004, the Court
granted ProTrader and Instinet Group’s motion with respect to their claim that
NexTrade failed to demonstrate that it had sustained damages as a result of
any alleged infringement and further decided that any profits of ProTrader 
and Instinet to which NexTrade may be entitled, if any, are to be offset by 
their losses which may be aggregated over the years of alleged infringement. 
The Court also granted Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment dismissing
Defendants’ counterclaims, but decided that Defendants’ counterclaims are a
valid defence to Plaintiff’s trademark infringement claims. On 21 January 2005,
the Court ruled that neither party will be permitted to introduce evidence
regarding Instinet Group’s profits. On 16 February 2005, the parties reached

Notes:
2003 and 2002 have been restated following adoption of UITF17 and UITF38, and the reclassification of transaction-related regulatory fees following recently issued SEC guidance 
(see ‘Accounting Basis’ on page 72).
2003 and 2002 user accesses have been restated, to reflect the exclusion of mobile and other low-cost accesses. 1997 and 1998 have been restated to reflect changes to reporting user accesses in 1999.
1999 and 2000 have been restated following adoption of FRS 19.
1995 and 1996 have been restated to reflect the effect of FRS 10 issued in 1997 which required purchased goodwill and intangible assets to be capitalised and amortised through the profit and loss account.
1994 fixed assets have been restated to reflect the effect of UITF abstract 13 issued in 1995.
Ratios:
1 Book value per ordinary share represents adjusted shareholders’ equity divided by the number of shares in issue after deducting shares held by employee share ownership trusts. In 1994 to 1997
shares in Reuters Holdings PLC held by Group companies are also deducted. In 1994 to 1997 shares in Reuters Holdings PLC held by Group companies are also deducted from shares in issue.
Adjusted shareholders’ equity is calculated after deducting the carrying value of interests in shares of Reuters Holdings PLC (1994 to 1997).
2 Return on tangible fixed assets represents profit after taxation as a percentage of average tangible fixed assets. The average is calculated by adding tangible fixed assets at the start and the 
end of each year and dividing by two.
3 Return on equity represents profit attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the average adjusted shareholders’ equity. The average is calculated by adding adjusted shareholders’ equity 
at the start and the end of each year and dividing by two. In 1998 a weighted average has been used to reflect the capital reorganisation. 94 Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004
