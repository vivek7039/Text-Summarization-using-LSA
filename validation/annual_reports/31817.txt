Strategic report
Introduction
It is a pleasure to introduce Nanoco’s results for 
the year to 31 July 2017. This has been a challenging 
year, with slower than anticipated adoption of the 
Company’s cadmium-free quantum dots (“CFQDs”) 
in the display industry. However, significant progress 
has been made in developing demand for our 
CFQDs; an increasing number of manufacturers are 
now producing demonstration displays incorporating 
our technology and we are confident that sales will 
result as these move into commercial production. 
We are also making good progress in Life sciences 
and Specialised lighting. The slower than expected 
progress in Display and the Company’s funding 
horizon have both had a detrimental impact on 
the Company’s share price. I am pleased to say 
that the recent announcement of an equity 
placing has alleviated liquidity concerns. 
MAKING STRONG 
PROGRESS
CHAIRMAN’ S S TATEMENT
I am confident about the relevance of our technology 
in display and other markets.
Summary
 •
An increasing number of manufacturers 
are now producing demonstration displays 
incorporating our technology.
 •
We now have the supply chain and the 
technology to support the development 
of the emerging market in CFQDs for 
the display industry. STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Nanoco Group plc – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Following the change in commercial strategy in 
the previous financial year, substantial changes 
were made in the business during this year, which 
have created the building blocks for future commercial 
success. The Company has a compelling go-to-market 
strategy, with a partnership with Taiwan’s Wah Hong 
Industrial Corporation (“Wah Hong”), alongside its 
two licensees, The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow”) 
and Merck KGaA (“Merck”). These routes to market 
are supported by the Company’s own manufacturing 
facility in Runcorn. We now have the supply chain 
and the technology to support the development of 
the emerging market in CFQDs for the display industry. 
The recent move by the European Commission to ban 
cadmium in displays in Europe from 31 October 2019 
is helping to accelerate adoption of the technology and 
the demonstration by major television manufacturers 
of displays featuring Nanoco’s CFQDs is further 
evidence of this adoption. 
While our focus in 2017 has been on the display 
market, Nanoco’s technology has several important 
applications beyond that sector. Important progress 
was made during 2017 in two of the Group’s three 
other target markets: life sciences and specialised 
lighting. Of particular note, the life sciences business 
was awarded an Innovate UK grant. In addition, 
after the year end, a commercial supply and license 
agreement was won from a US medical device 
company for light therapy products for the treatment 
of pain, soft tissue injury and dermatological conditions 
such as acne and skin anti-ageing. This underlines 
the value being built beyond Display and highlights 
the future potential in these other areas.
The Board has decided that the Solar assets are 
non-core and has commenced a process to divest 
these assets.
Over the year the Board made tough decisions 
to reduce costs which has led to a substantial 
reduction in headcount, the main expense of the 
business. During the period, average employee 
numbers reduced to 110 (2016: 129) and have fallen 
further to approximately 80 since the year end. 
However, that headcount reduction has not 
impacted the Group’s ability to manufacture 
product and sell its technology or its ability to 
develop next generation IP and product. 
Financial performance 
Revenues and other operating income in the year 
to 31 July 2017 were £1.6 million (2016: £0.8 million) 
and the loss before tax was £10.9 million (2016: loss 
before tax of £12.6 million). 
The Group continued to exercise careful cost control 
during the year. Cash, cash equivalents and deposits at 
the year end were £5.7 million (31 July 2016: £14.5 million; 
31 January 2017: £8.3 million). Cash balances have 
increased post year end as a consequence of the 
equity raise in November 2017 of £8.0 million net of 
expenses. No dividend is proposed for the year 
(2016: none).
Governance and Board
The Board recognises the value of meeting the 
highest standards of corporate governance and will 
continue to strive to achieve such standards for the 
benefit of all stakeholders.
Gordon Hall retired as a Non-executive Director of 
Nanoco on 31 January 2017, after eight years on the 
Board. Robin Williams stood down from the Board in 
July 2017 after three years with the Company as a 
Non-executive Director. We would like to thank both 
Gordon and Robin for their contribution to the business.
In April 2017 we announced the appointment of 
Dr Alison Fielding as a Non-executive Director. Alison 
brings an exceptional breadth of relevant skills to the 
Nanoco Board, with her background in chemistry and 
her extensive commercial, financial and international 
experience across the technology sector. 
Employees and shareholders
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of 
Nanoco’s employees for their achievements during 
the year and for their commitment to the Group. 
Nanoco benefits from an exceptional, multi-national 
team and the Board is enormously appreciative of 
its contributions and loyalty in what has been a 
challenging period.
I would also like to thank our shareholders for their 
continuing support and look forward to meeting 
as many as possible at our AGM to be held on 
12 January 2018. 
Outlook
I am confident about the relevance of our 
technology in display and other markets as well 
as our ability to execute and deliver orders and 
sales and I remain positive about the prospects 
for the Group.

ENHANCING 
OUR EXPERTISE
CHIEF EXE CUTIVE OFFICER’ S S TATEMENT
We have made substantial changes in our approach to the 
business which underpin our confidence in future success.
Summary
 •
We have developed a substantial pipeline 
of commercial opportunities in Display and 
in June secured the important milestone 
of our first commercial sales orders.
 •
New production methods have achieved a 
substantial reduction in costs while increasing 
the productivity of installed capacity.
Overview
While the Group has not met the commercial 
targets we set ourselves a year ago, we have made 
substantial changes in our approach to the business 
which underpin our confidence in future success. 
We have implemented an enhanced go-to-market 
strategy, invested in manufacturing capability and 
received our first commercial sales orders, all against a 
backdrop of growing global interest in our technology. 
The evolution in marketing strategy for the display 
industry, initiated in 2016, has enabled the Group to 
accelerate the roll-out of its technology. We have 
moved from an exclusive licensing model with Dow 
to a hybrid model, combining multiple non-exclusive 
licenses with direct sales of own manufactured product. 
In August 2016, we announced that we had signed 
up Merck as a second licensee of our technology.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Nanoco Group plc – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
OUR GROWING DIRECT 
SALES PIPELINE
NDA, scope and design specifications
Specification agreement  
and development sampling
Technical approval
Design win
First commercial sales orders
Engineering samples
Contract negotiation 
and commercial sales
As a result of promotion activities (e.g. conferences) and 
outreach, customer enquiries are screened and prioritised 
before entering into a mutual non-disclosure agreement 
(“NDA”) – this is the start of our sales pipeline. Following 
detailed technical discussions to establish the customer 
specification and Nanoco film solution options, an iterative 
program of work is undertaken. This involves computer 
simulation modelling and multiple film samples to best fit the 
customer’s display system. When technical approval is 
achieved, the customer’s “product team” presents the new 
device in demonstrator form to their business management or 
customers. If they decide to proceed to market, and launch 
the product, we are awarded a “Design Win”. What follows is 
the “kick-off” of a qualification process involving validation 
steps and engineering samples of increasing quantity, 
building to mass production and contracted supply – this 
whole process has no defined timescale, can be very lengthy 
and is not within our control.
We also developed our own channel to market for 
product manufactured at our facility in Runcorn, UK, 
and sold via our Taiwanese partner Wah Hong (referred 
to as “our direct partner”). We now have a three-pronged 
go-to-market strategy which will enable us to capitalise 
on the expected demand for our CFQDs. During the 
year, in conjunction with Wah Hong, we have developed 
a substantial pipeline of commercial opportunities in 
Display and in June secured the important milestone 
of our first commercial sales orders. We remain very 
excited about the potential for our technology both 
in Display and in our emerging Life sciences and 
Specialised lighting developments.
Display market
The market in display for CFQDs continues to grow, 
driven by the increasing appetite for enhanced 
colour and brightness and the penetration of 
ultra-high-definition (“UHD”) TVs. IHS Technology 
(“IHS”) forecasts 26 million displays will be quantum 
dot (“QD”) equipped by 2021, with more than 90% of 
the market cadmium free. Samsung, with its QLED 
brand, is leading the field and sold more than 3 million 
QD displays in 2016. Other than Samsung, the market 
for quantum dot displays is still in its infancy although 
the introduction of UHD TV and media-centric 
monitor products will drive growth in the markets.
While other display OEMs are embracing CFQD 
technology, adoption continues to be slow due 
somewhat to protracted regulatory initiatives to restrict 
the use of cadmium. However, in early August 2017, 
the European Commission announced legislation, 
which passed into law in October 2017, banning the 
use of cadmium in displays from 31 October 2019, 
which we expect to accelerate the shift to CFQDs. 
Several major Taiwanese and Chinese display and 
TV manufacturers are now actively seeking CFQD 
solutions, where Nanoco continues to have a 
competitive lead.
Commercialisation
Nanoco’s CFQDs are now being manufactured 
at Nanoco’s Runcorn facility and at Dow’s large 
manufacturing plant in Cheonan, South Korea, while 
Merck is also evaluating the establishment of a 
manufacturing facility. These sites will manufacture 
CFQDs, blend them into a resin system and supply 
the combined CFQD resin system to multiple display 
integrators located across Asia. Samsung is the 
market leader in CFQD display at present and 
Nanoco and our licensees are all actively marketing 
Nanoco technology to the global display industry 
to compete effectively with Samsung. 
Commercialisation – Runcorn
Nanoco’s Runcorn manufacturing facility has been 
extensively enhanced to meet anticipated demand. 
New production methods have achieved a substantial 
reduction in costs while increasing the productivity 
of installed capacity. Runcorn now has the capacity 
to produce enough CFQDs to supply approximately 
1 million large TVs per annum. Further capacity can 
be achieved with limited capital expenditure and 
will be brought online as demand increases. 
STRATEGIC REPORT 08
Strategic report
Commercialisation continued
Commercialisation – Runcorn continued
We were pleased to announce in December 2016 
that the Company had been awarded ISO 9001:2015 
certification for our production and supply processes, 
underlining the robust nature of our systems.
Commercialisation – Wah Hong
Wah Hong, which is quoted on the Taipei Exchange, 
is our partner for the production and sale of our Fine 
Color Film
TM
. We chose to partner with Wah Hong as 
it is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of 
optical films and sheets for the display industry 
and has a large operational footprint across China, 
Taiwan and Southeast Asia. We have benefited 
from its industry and supply chain knowledge and 
customer contacts since signing the agreement in 
July last year. Under the agreement, Nanoco will 
supply resins containing CFQDs from our manufacturing 
facility in Runcorn and Wah Hong will incorporate 
the resin into a film, under Nanoco’s CFQD
®
 Fine 
Color Film
TM
 brand, and sell to the display industry. 
We will generate revenue from the sale of resin to 
Wah Hong and receive a licence fee from Wah Hong 
based on its sales and two further milestone payments 
dependent on the volume of film sold.
The Group’s relationship with Wah Hong has 
progressed well over the period. Product from Nanoco/
Wah Hong was used by three manufacturers, Hisense, 
TCL and TPV Philips, at CES in January 2017, to 
demonstrate prototype large screen, UHD, wide colour 
gamut LCD TVs. Feedback and lead generation from 
CES were encouraging and further validated the 
market opportunity. As a result, Wah Hong brought 
forward its investment in a new coating line which is 
now commissioned and capable of producing films to 
fit up to 100-inch TVs. These developments resulted in 
Wah Hong placing the first commercial orders for 
CFQDs from Nanoco in June 2017. 
In September 2017, Nanoco’s technology was 
featured at Touch Taiwan 2017, a leading show 
for the world’s display industry, where major global 
television manufacturers showcased state-of-the-art 
4K and 8K UHD products incorporating Nanoco’s 
CFQD
®
 Fine Color Film
TM
.
At the Display Innovation Conference, which ran 
alongside Touch Taiwan 2017, Nanoco’s Senior 
Vice President of Global Sales gave a presentation 
on the growing demand from manufacturers and 
consumers for quantum dots as a method of 
achieving wider colour gamut and enhanced picture 
quality in the next generation of displays.
The trade show further validated the growing interest 
in state-of-the-art TVs and monitors incorporating 
CFQDs to enhance colour performance. 
Over the last year we have developed a very active 
pipeline of sales opportunities (see sales pipeline on 
page 7). The Group’s key short-term focus is on TV and 
monitor projects with near term potential. Moving projects 
through the sales pipeline into commercial sales takes 
many months of intensive work. Each customer has its 
own requirements and it is difficult to predict how long 
customers’ processes will take to reach mass production 
status. Nanoco/Wah Hong will continue to develop 
further opportunities in the future.
Commercialisation – Dow
Nanoco signed an exclusive licence agreement 
with Dow in January 2013 for Dow to manufacture, 
market and sell Nanoco’s heavy-metal-free quantum 
dots into the display market. Last year Dow and 
Nanoco agreed to amend the licensing agreement 
from exclusive to non-exclusive. Dow sells product 
under the TREVISTA
TM
 brand, manufactured in its 
facility in South Korea. We generate royalty revenue 
from Dow calculated as a percentage of Dow’s 
sales of Nanoco CFQDs.
Dow continues to see growing interest in CFQDs 
and is making good progress with several Display 
customers considering movement to quantum 
dot technology.
Commercialisation – Merck
Merck is the leading German science and 
technology company focused on healthcare, life 
sciences and performance materials, and the 
manufacturer of approximately 60% of the world’s 
liquid crystals used in liquid crystal displays. Nanoco 
will generate revenue from sales made by Merck 
from licence fees and royalties on Merck 
manufactured sales. 
Nanoco has completed the transfer of its 
technology to Merck, which has successfully 
produced pilot plant scale quantities of CFQDs at 
its facility in Darmstadt, Germany. Merck is carefully 
watching the development of the CFQD market and 
will continue to purchase CFQD products from 
Nanoco until it decides to build its own manufacturing 
facility. Merck is actively engaged with its potential 
customers on various CFQD application projects 
and sells under the Livilux
®
 brand.
Commercialisation – staying ahead 
of the technology curve
In May 2017 Nanoco signed a collaboration and 
joint development agreement (“ JDA”) with Kyulux Inc. 
Under the agreement, Nanoco’s CFQDs will be 
combined with Kyulux’s technology to create future 
generation hybrid OLED/QLED display technology 
with superior qualities to existing products in the 
display market. 
Nanoco also strengthened its intellectual property 
in electroluminescence with the acquisition of a patent 
portfolio from Kodak Eastman. The Group now benefits 
from c. 600 patents and patent applications.
These activities will ensure that Nanoco remains 
at the forefront of next generation products for the 
display industry.

Nanoco Group plc – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Other markets
While display was the Group’s primary focus during 
the year, Nanoco continued to develop its other 
target markets of life sciences and specialised 
lighting. The Board has decided that the solar 
assets are non-core and the divestment process 
is progressing with discussions currently ongoing 
with interested parties.
Other markets – life sciences 
Nanoco Life Sciences (“NLS”) is led by Dr Imad 
Nassani, who joined Nanoco in 2009 and is one 
of the pioneers of the use of quantum dots in the 
sector. Quantum dots have favourable optical 
and physical properties compared with organic 
dyes and radioisotopes, but their use in medical 
applications has been hindered due to the 
presence of cadmium. Because Nanoco’s quantum 
dots are free of cadmium, they can be used in the 
human body in, for example, cancer diagnosis and 
surgical imaging. The initial focus of the division is 
on illumination of cancerous tumours to facilitate 
their surgical removal and then, with further 
development, cancer diagnosis. The NLS team has 
made great strides in the development of safe and 
clinically acceptable quantum dot nanomaterials 
based on the Company’s heavy-metal-free 
quantum dot technology. 
The promising outcome from our efforts may be 
used to develop quantum dot probes for the early 
detection of aggressive tumours such as pancreatic 
and bladder cancers. This, in addition to our 
burgeoning relationships with commercial and 
research institutions at the cutting edge of the 
battle against cancer, shows the scope of our 
ambition and the value of our technology.
We are now working to prepare the technology 
for clinical trials. To date Nanoco’s life sciences 
efforts have been grant funded. In early July 2017, 
we announced that we had been awarded an 
Innovate UK grant for a VIVODOTS
TM
 programme 
in conjunction with University College London 
targeting pancreatic cancer.
In September 2017, we announced that we 
had signed a Commercial Supply and License 
Agreement with a US corporation in the field of 
medical devices. Nanoco will supply film product 
and other technologies for light therapy products 
for the treatment of pain, soft tissue injury and 
dermatological conditions such as acne and skin 
anti-ageing.
Other markets – specialised lighting
Nanoco’s CFQDs can tune the colour of light 
emitted by LEDs such that any particular shade of 
light can be produced by tailoring the wavelength. 
This ability to fine-tune the colour of light has very 
broad applications, such as the use of LEDs in homes 
and offices and in specific, niche applications where 
a particular wavelength of light is required.
Nanoco’s commercial strategy in lighting is to focus 
on niche lighting applications which take advantage 
of quantum dots’ unique properties. Lighting products 
for the horticulture and photodynamic therapy 
industries are being developed with partners 
and continue to make headway in line with 
management’s expectations. 
Restriction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”)
In August 2017, as part of the RoHS Directive, the 
European Commission announced its decision to 
prohibit cadmium in TVs and displays sold in Europe 
from 31 October 2019. Cadmium in lighting products 
was prohibited immediately, although they are not 
commercially available. This was a much needed 
decision, which will provide market certainty as to 
the end date for cadmium to be used in TVs and 
other display products such as monitors. The RoHS 
Directive recognises cadmium as the most 
hazardous heavy metal. We believe that this 
legislation should accelerate the move from 
cadmium to cadmium-free QDs in TVs and displays 
and we are already seeing increased interest from 
the industry. The lack of a decision on the future 
of cadmium led to stronger than anticipated 
competition from non-CFQD solutions.
People
This has been a challenging year for the Company 
and I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
all staff for their hard work and commitment 
throughout the period. 
Post-year end
In October 2017 we announced a placing of 19.99% 
of our issued share capital to raise £8.0 million net 
of expenses. 
This fundraise significantly strengthens Nanoco’s 
balance sheet and puts it on a strong footing for 
the opportunities ahead.
Outlook
The Group continues to make solid progress 
in commercialisation of CFQDs and expects to 
announce further progress from its healthy pipeline 
of projects. With the market developing more slowly 
than originally anticipated, we remain focused on 
careful management of costs ahead of the 
anticipated sales ramp-up. The Board remains 
confident that the opportunity for CFQDs, both in 
display and in other sectors, remains exciting and, 
moreover, that the Company has a competitive 
lead in this technology.

MAXIMISING OUR 
OPPORTUNITY
OUR S TRATE GY
Nanoco’s strategy is to focus on meeting the needs of its 
customers through the application of its scientific know-how 
and innovative CFQD
®
 technology.
Grow revenue
Revenue growth is key to the Group becoming 
self-sustaining financially while continuing to invest 
in R&D for future products.
Primarily focus on display industry
The display industry is the most developed market 
for our products and we are tightly focused on this 
market. External analysts forecast significant growth 
for CFQD
®
 applications in the display industry in the 
future. The Group operates a hybrid strategy of technology 
licensing non-exclusively to Dow and Merck and own 
manufacture and direct supply to service the display 
industry. This hybrid strategy allows the widest coverage 
of the Group’s technology in the display field.
Continue to invest in R&D
Investment in R&D to improve current products and 
also to develop new products remains a key part 
of our strategy. 
Patents
Patents protect our high quality IP and we continue 
to create new IP and protect existing IP to maintain 
our competitive advantages.
Develop in-house capability and capacity
We have invested in expanding our manufacturing 
capacity and in-house production remains a key 
part of our strategy.
Growth Investment
Performance in 2017
Whilst billings fell by £0.8 million compared to last year 
to £1.1 million, revenues grew by 179% compared to 2016 
to £1.3 million. Revenues remain modest compared to 
the opportunity ahead of us and the market has been 
slower to develop than envisaged.
Performance in 2017
R&D expenditure fell in 2017 compared to 2016 due 
to cost savings implemented as a result of the cash 
position of the Company; nevertheless, important 
progress was made during the year especially in 
improvements in product performance.
Future focus
Focus is on converting current opportunities into 
revenues with emphasis on ten TV and monitor 
projects with five major companies. We are exploring 
opportunities with many of the major players in the 
display industry.
Future focus
We will continue to invest in R&D in order to remain 
at the forefront of this technology and to open up 
new market opportunities.

In common with all businesses at Nanoco’s stage 
of development, the Group is exposed to a range 
of risks, some of which are not wholly within its control 
or capable of complete mitigation or protection 
through insurance. The Group has identified, actively 
monitors and is taking action to mitigate many 
different risks. Risks are categorised as strategic, 
financial or operational. This section does not include 
them all, but focuses on those risks that the Directors 
believe to be the most important that are currently 
faced by the business. Some risks may be unknown 
at present. Others, currently regarded as not critical, 
could become material risks in the future. 
The Board has established a routine process 
for carrying out a robust risk assessment which 
evaluates and manages the principal risks faced 
by the Group. The Board reviews the process and 
a detailed review of risks was undertaken by the 
Audit Committee during 2017.
In last year’s Annual Report we highlighted cash 
resources and production capacity at our Runcorn 
facility as the major risk issues. The Group has 
successfully managed to reduce the inherent risk 
for the business by completing a fundraising in 
November 2017 thereby removing immediate 
concerns for the future financing of the business. 
Improvements in capacity at the Group’s production 
facility in Runcorn following the introduction of 
more efficient production processes and shift 
working have continued throughout the year and 
significantly reduced the risk of being unable to 
produce sufficient output from our Runcorn plant.

ENSURING 
VIABILITY
VIABILIT Y S TATEMENT
In accordance with the provisions in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(C.2.2 of the 2016 revision), the Directors have assessed the viability of the 
Group and determined that a two-year period continues to be a suitable 
period to be utilised. The Directors’ assessment has been made with 
reference to the Group’s current strategy, strengthened balance sheet 
following the placing in November 2017 and principal risks as described 
in this Strategic report.
for 3.5 days per week. The new processes and 
shift working are ready to be implemented as 
demand dictates.
Dow and Merck are licensed to manufacture CFQD
®
 
products and they can sell their own manufactured 
products as well as CFQD
®
 products purchased 
from the Group. Wah Hong is licensed to produce 
and sell film containing CFQD
®
 products purchased 
from Nanoco.
The key issues considered by the Directors 
in evaluating the business model are:
 •
Is the display market a viable market for the Group’s 
CFQD
®
 technology?
 •
Based on the Group’s knowledge of the market 
and independent forecasts of the development 
of the display market, the Directors believe that 
the display market will remain a viable and 
growing market for the Group’s CFQD
®
 
products for a number of years.
 •
Are the Group’s current partners likely to be 
able to effectively manufacture and distribute 
CFQD
®
 products?
 •
Sample requests have increased over the past 
few months for Dow’s TREVISTA™ cadmium-free 
quantum dots and are being fulfilled exclusively 
from Dow’s Cheonan factory. 
Whilst the Directors have no reason to believe 
the Group will not be viable over a longer period, 
a two-year period is considered appropriate given 
the nature of forecasting in the market for CFQD
®
 
products and the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties. Forecasting in the CFQD market is 
difficult as it is currently in the very early stages of 
its development. There are very strong indications 
that the market is likely to grow rapidly as Samsung 
is actively promoting its televisions containing quantum 
dots and industry analysts are forecasting a large 
market in the display field; however, accurate 
forecasting in the short term remains very difficult and 
the market is developing slower than anticipated.
The Group’s non-exclusive business model enables 
the Group to sell directly to OEMs and also to 
appoint additional licensees to manufacture the 
Group’s CFQD
®
 products. The licence agreements 
agreed in July 2016 with Wah Hong and Merck are 
also still in their infancy and it is too early to make 
longer-term forecasts of the levels of business with 
these partners. The Group is working very closely 
with a number of original equipment manufacturers 
(“OEMs”) and Wah Hong in order to get the CFQD
®
 
films designed into OEM products. The first orders 
for commercial sales were received from Wah Hong 
in June 2017. The new processes developed during 
recent periods have been implemented and 
production capacity has been increased by 
developing the ability to move to a 24-hour shift  STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Nanoco Group plc – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
 •
Wah Hong has placed its first commercial 
orders for CFQD
®
 products, which will be 
produced in Nanoco’s manufacturing facility 
in Runcorn and delivered to Wah Hong, where 
it will be converted into films by Wah Hong 
and supplied for usage in OEM TV and 
monitor products.
 •
The Directors believe that Wah Hong will 
be able to produce good quality CFQD
®
 film 
and that it will be able to appoint suitable 
OEM customers.
 •
Merck is carefully watching the development of 
the CFQD market and will continue to purchase 
CFQD products from Nanoco until they decide 
to build their own manufacturing facility.
 •
The Directors are confident that they would be 
able to appoint new partners to replace any of 
the Group’s current partners should the licences 
terminate for any reason. 
 •
In the event that alternative partners cannot be 
appointed the Directors believe that the Group 
would be able to significantly increase its own 
manufacturing capabilities in order to meet 
market demand. The attractiveness of the 
opportunity should mean that any additional 
finance required to fund any additional capital 
expenditure required is available.
As a result of this assessment, the Directors have 
concluded that the Group’s business model is viable 
for the two-year period of this viability statement.
Going concern
In assessing whether the going concern basis 
is an appropriate basis for preparing the 2017 
Annual Report, the Directors have utilised their 
detailed forecasts for the period to 31 July 2019 
which take into account the Group’s current and 
expected business activities, its cash balance 
of £5.7 million as shown in its balance sheet at 
31 July 2017, the cash raised of £8.0 million following 
shareholder approval of the placing on 14 November 
2017, the principal risks and uncertainties it faces 
and other factors impacting its future performance.
The key assumptions underpinning the assessment 
during the period cover the following areas:
 •
commercialisation of CFQD
®
 products through 
existing contractual arrangements;
 •
ability to manufacture and supply sufficient 
CFQD
®
 products to meet partner demand; and
 •
continued investment in research and development.
The principal, plausible downside stress tests in 
accordance with the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties are:
 •
a significant reduction in projected CFQD
®
 sales 
volumes due to either a reduction in demand from 
the Group’s partners or an inability to supply; 
 •
lower selling prices and higher manufacturing costs; 
 •
ability of Wah Hong to produce final products that 
meet our quality standards; 
 •
ability of Wah Hong to generate sufficient demand 
at attractive price levels to generate sufficient 
operating margins for the Group and achieve 
targets for future milestone payments; 
 •
the length of time it will take our licence partners 
(Dow and Merck) to contract new customers and 
supply products in volume to generate royalty income 
and achieve targets for milestone payments; 
 •
likelihood of new inventions making CFQD
®
 
products obsolete; and
 •
higher investment in research and development.
Various sensitivity analyses have been performed 
to reflect possible downside scenarios as referred 
to above. Even in the worst case scenario whereby 
the Group achieves no cash revenues for the twelve 
months following the date of this Annual Report, the 
Company and the Group have sufficient resources 
to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. 
At the time of approving the financial statements 
the Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the 2017 Annual Report.

Results
Revenue for the year was £1.3 million (2016: £0.5 million) and 
the loss before tax was £10.9 million (2016: £12.6 million). 
As has historically been the case, the timing of revenue 
receipts in the form of milestone and joint development 
payments from strategic partners continued to be 
the major determinant of the results of the business. 
Revenue and other operating income increased 
by 112% to £1.6 million (2016: £0.8 million).
Revenue from sale of products and services rendered 
accounted for 53.6% (2016: 67.1%) with the balance of 
revenues being royalty and licence income. Revenue 
from sale of products was £0.5 million (2016: £0.2 million).
Revenue from royalties and licences and revenue 
from the joint development agreements which comprise 
payments from customers to gain preferential treatment 
in terms of supply or pricing do not have an 
associated cost of sale.
During the year, revenues and other operating income 
increased to £1.6 million and, post-year end, additional 
cash of £8.0 million was raised thereby providing the 
funding to implement our strategy.

 •
Revenue and other operating income 
increased by 112%.

Nanoco Group plc – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
During the previous year, two significant licences were 
signed which generated invoices for upfront payments 
of £1.2 million. This revenue is expected to be recognised 
as follows:
Year ending 31 July £ million
2016 – actual —
2017 – actual 0.5
2018 to 2023 0.7
Total 1.2
The invoices for the upfront payments were settled 
in the first half of the 2017 financial year. At 31 July 2017 
the amount included in deferred revenue is £0.7 million 
(2016: £1.2 million). The timing of revenue recognition 
of upfront licence fees is dependent upon the nature 
of each contract. One of the agreements signed in 
July 2016 is for a seven-year period and the upfront 
licence fee, which was settled in August 2016, is to be 
recognised as revenue evenly over the seven-year 
duration of the agreement. Future milestone payments 
received under this agreement are subject to 
performance conditions and at this stage the likelihood 
of this cannot be determined with reasonable certainty. 
Thus, any future milestone payments will be recognised 
as revenue once the milestone has been achieved. 
The other upfront payment has been recognised as 
revenue in the year ended 31 July 2017.
The impact of this is as follows:

and as a result the level of billings is considered 
a key performance indicator. Billings have fallen 
compared to 2016 as no new licence agreements 
have been signed during the year.
The decrease in research and development expenditure 
of £0.5 million to £5.5 million (2016: £6.0 million) comprises 
a decrease in R&D labour costs of £0.6 million offset 
by increases in material costs and utilities totalling 
£0.1 million. Labour costs represent 72.8% (2016: 76.6%) 
of total R&D costs with the balance of costs comprising 
materials and utility costs.
Total payroll costs (before the charge for 
share-based payments) decreased by £0.8 million 
to £5.7 million (2016: £6.5 million). The decrease in 
payroll costs is attributable to a 14.7% decrease in 
average staff numbers compared to 2016 largely 
due to a cost reduction programme implemented 
during the year to extend the Company’s cash 
runway. Staff numbers have fallen further since 
31 July 2017 and currently we have c. 80 staff. 
The decrease in administrative costs of £0.6 million 
to £6.8 million reflects decreased employee costs 
(£0.2 million), professional fees (£0.1 million), 
depreciation (£0.3 million) and material costs 
(£0.2 million) offset by increases in amortisation 
(£0.2 million).
Non-GAAP measures
The non-GAAP measures of adjusted operating loss 
and LBITDA are provided to show the operating loss 
and loss before interest and tax, before including 
non-cash charges and large non-recurring items, in 
order to give a clearer understanding of the loss for 
the year that reflects cash outflow from the business.
The adjusted operating loss* for the year ended 
31 July 2017 was £10.7 million (2016: £12.5 million).
Loss before interest, tax, amortisation and share-based 
payment charges (“LBITDA”) was as shown in the 
table below.
The decrease of £1.7 million in LBITDA compared to 
2016 is a result of the higher revenue leading to an 
increase in gross profit of £0.8 million and a decrease 
in R&D and administrative costs of £1.1 million (excluding 
the items added back in the below table).
With interest income (net of interest payments) 
decreasing by £0.1 million, the loss before tax was 
£10.9 million (2016: loss of £12.6 million). 
The tax credit for the year is £1.8 million (2016: £2.0 million). 
The tax credit to be claimed, in respect of R&D spend, 
is £1.8 million (2016: £2.0 million). Overseas corporation 
tax was £0.1 million during the year (2016: £nil). There 
was no deferred tax credit or charge (2016: £nil). 
Cash flow and balance sheet 
During the year cash, cash equivalents, deposits 
and short-term investments decreased by £8.8 million 
to £5.7 million (2016: £14.5 million) largely as a result of 
the cash outflow from operating activities. Tax credits 
of £2.0 million (2016: £1.8 million) were received during 
the year.
The Group increased its capital spend in tangible assets 
in the year to a total of £0.4 million (2016: £0.2 million). 
Expenditure incurred in registering patents totalled 
£1.2 million (2016: £0.9 million) during the year reflecting 
the Group’s continued focus on developing and 
registering intellectual property. Capitalised patent 
spend is amortised over ten years in line with the 
established Group’s accounting policy.

On 14 November 2017 the Company’s shareholders 
voted in favour of a placing of 19.99% of the Company’s 
issued share capital raising approximately £8.0 million 
net of costs. This fundraise strengthens the Company’s 
balance sheet significantly and eliminates immediate 
going concern issues.
Treasury activities and policies
The Group manages its cash deposits prudently. 
The placing proceeds and other cash balances will 
be invested across a number of financial institutions 
which have investment-grade credit ratings. The 
deposits will range from instant access to six-month 
term deposits. Cash deposits are regularly reviewed 
by the Board and cash forecasts are updated 
monthly to ensure that there is sufficient cash 
available for foreseeable requirements. 
More details on the Group’s treasury policies are 
provided in note 26 to the financial statements.
Credit risk
The Group only trades with recognised, creditworthy 
third parties. Receivable balances are monitored 
on an ongoing basis and any late payments are 
promptly investigated to ensure that the Group’s 
exposure to bad debts is not significant. 
Foreign exchange management
The Group invoices most of its revenues in 
US Dollars and Euros. The Group is therefore 
exposed to movements in those currencies 
relative to Sterling. The Group uses forward 
currency contracts to fix the exchange rate on 
invoiced or confirmed foreign currency receipts. 
The Group does not take out forward contracts 
against uncertain or forecast income. 
There were no open forward contracts as at 
31 July 2017 (2016: none). The Group’s net profit and 
its equity are exposed to movements in the value 
of Sterling relative to the US Dollar. The indicative 
impact of movements in the Sterling exchange rate 
on profits and equity based on the retranslation of 
the closing balance sheet are summarised in note 
26 to the financial statements and were based on 
the year-end position. 
Summary
Following the placing completed in November 2017, 
the Group is well positioned to exploit the exciting 
opportunities ahead.

MAKING  
AN IMPACT
SUS T AINABILIT Y
The Group recognises that, although its primary responsibility under 
UK corporate law is to its shareholders, it also has responsibilities 
towards its employees, customers, suppliers and also, ultimately, 
those consumers who benefit from its products, the broader 
public and the environment.
Health and safety 
Nanoco recognises that providing a safe, secure 
and healthy working environment is essential and 
contributes to productivity and improved performance. 
The health, safety and welfare of all of our employees, 
contractors and visitors is taken seriously across the 
entire organisation, with ultimate responsibility lying 
with the CEO. Health and safety performance is a 
standing item on each Board and Executive team 
agenda, and is also discussed within departmental 
meetings. The Group’s health and safety policy 
is reviewed annually. In addition, the Board has 
established an Environmental, Health and Safety (“EHS”) 
Committee to oversee the implementation of policy 
and involve staff in generating improvement plans.
There are various improvement and reporting 
systems in place to monitor the performance of the 
Group’s health and safety management system. 
These initiatives include but are not limited to:
i)  reporting all incidents (including near misses) 
with appropriate ownership and action tracking 
systems (switched from paper forms to web-based 
system this year);
ii)  communication of relevant topics and incidents 
via weekly toolbox talks to all departments;
Nanoco seeks to increase shareholder value 
over the long term.
Each stakeholder has different interests, 
some of which are listed below:

training and development and for treating them 
fairly. Further information about its employment

observation audits with the focus on immediate 
action resolution by the executive or senior 
manager leading the audit;
iv)  monthly departmental audits with appropriate 
ownership and action tracking processes in 
place to address issues; and
v)  monthly health and safety reports issued across 
the organisation to communicate performance 
against annual metrics and progress on key 
improvement initiatives and projects.
A risk assessment programme is in place to identify 
and mitigate the risks from our operations. These 
assessments include but are not limited to:
i)  the storage, handling and processing of 
hazardous substances;
ii)  fire safety and emergency evacuation;
iii)  use of mechanical and electrical equipment; and
iv)  other workplace operations involving manual 
handling and ergonomic risks, working at height 
and other hazards identified as part of the EHS 
improvement programme.
All risk assessments are documented and actions 
assigned and reviewed according to the defined 
frequency. All research and development functions 
are actively encouraged to, wherever possible, 
eliminate or reduce the levels of hazardous substances 
used in our products and processes. All relevant 
chemical legislation and regulatory frameworks 
are used to assess the suitability of a substance 
prior to use as part of the risk assessment process. 
Standard operating procedures are documented 
and regularly reviewed. 
All documents are reviewed and approved via the 
electronic document management system. A health 
and safety induction programme is in place for all 
new staff and visitors/contractors performing work 
on our premises. Staff are trained in standard 
operating procedures, hazard awareness, generic 
workplace health and safety risks and behavioural 
safety expectations applicable to their role within 
the Group. 
A cross-functional health and safety team meets on 
a monthly basis with representation from all areas of 
the Group, including the Executive team. Effective inputs 
and outputs from the team are designed to facilitate 
a greater focus on health and safety and to actively 
encourage discussions within respective groups.
The Group has an excellent safety record and there 
have been no reportable incidents to the respective 
UK authorities across all our operations. Nanoco is 
committed to the continuous improvement of the 
health and safety management system and has 
recently completed the Health and Safety 
Laboratory (“HSL”) safety culture survey for the 
second time (18 months after the first).
The survey showed that, across the eight factors in the 
HSL model, there has been a significant improvement 
in how staff rate our safety performance, and all our 
results now equal or exceed the average scores for 
chemical and pharmaceutical industry companies. 
Based on the results we have identified specific areas 
for improvement which are being tracked via the 
health and safety management plan and reported 
to all staff, the Executive team and the Board.
Environment
Nanoco is committed to protecting the environment 
in which our activities are conducted. This commitment 
is directly expressed in our decision to develop our 
products to be free of toxic heavy metals like cadmium, 
which is still widely used by our competitors in their 
quantum dot products. 
Nanoco has participated actively with regulators on 
the use of cadmium-based quantum dots in displays 
and LED light products. The European Commission 
(“EC”) has now completed a lengthy review of the 
use of cadmium-based quantum dots in displays 
and LED lighting, following the rejection by the 
European Parliament in 2015 of its previous proposal 
to extend their use. The report from their consultants 
(Oeko-Institute) recommended a further three-year 
extension, but after concern from member states 
and environmental NGOs the EC decided to end 
their use in LED lighting and give the minimum 
period of two years only for use in displays. The 
EC has now placed a Delegated Act before the 
European Council and Parliament to put this into 
force, which passed into law in October 2017. On this 
basis, cadmium-based quantum dots in displays will 
be effectively banned from 31 October 2019, since 
the normal RoHS limit of 100ppm will apply once the 
exemption ends. Nanoco expects that regulations in 
other key markets, including China, will fall in line 
with RoHS.
Our products are also designed to improve the 
energy efficiency of high performance lighting 
and display equipment and to generate energy 
from solar power. The Group’s environmental 
policy aims to foster a positive attitude towards 
the environment and to raise the awareness of 
employees of responsible environmental practices 
at all sites operated by the Group. The Group 
endeavours to ensure compliance with all relevant 
legislation and regulatory requirements and, where 
practical and economically viable, standards are 
developed in excess of such requirements. 
The CEO has responsibility for reporting on relevant 
environmental matters to the Board. There have been 
no incidents to report to the authorities across all our 
operations. Shareholders and other interested parties 
are encouraged to use the online version of the 
Annual Report and Accounts rather than requesting 
hard copies. Interested parties are encouraged to 
visit the Group’s website or use the regulatory news 
services instead of a hard copy. Employees are also 
encouraged to recycle paper, plastic, glass, 
cardboard and cans wherever possible.

Nanoco Group plc – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Greenhouse gas (“GHG”) reporting 
Under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic and 
Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013, the Group is 
required to state the annual quantity of emissions in 
tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent from activities 
for which the business is responsible, including the 
combustion of fuel and the operation of its facilities 
and resulting from the purchase of electricity, heat, 
steam or cooling by the business for its own use.
As both of the Group’s UK premises are in 
multi-occupancy sites we place reliance upon its 
respective landlords to provide the data needed 
to determine emissions. Our laboratories require 
continuous negative pressure environments and, 
consequently, it is not possible to set realistic 
reduction targets in the consumption of electricity. 
Our gas consumption is used for heating premises 
and site costs are shared between tenants on the 
basis of area of occupancy. In the absence of 
significant amounts of revenue from the sale of 
commercial products, the emissions of the business 
primarily arise from the occupation of its research 
and administration facilities rather than from 
revenue related production operations. 
Emissions in respect of the Group’s US office are 
considered to be negligible. Our emissions, based on 
appropriate conversion factors published by the 
Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, 
for the current year are shown in the table opposite.
Waste
During the year, the Group generated 57.7 tonnes 
of waste (2016: 69.3 tonnes) and recycled 46.8 tonnes 
of this (2016: 62.1 tonnes). The Group engages a specialist 
contractor to incinerate batches of chemicals and 
dispose of other materials no longer required. All 
waste contractors are assessed to ensure the waste 
hierarchy approach is applied to all of our materials 
handled, and that their operations and systems are 
compliant with the relevant legislation. Audits are 
performed every three years in line with our duty 
of care as a waste producer.
Other environmental matters 
Consideration of the benefits to the environment is a 
significant factor in decisions regarding investments 
to upgrade the Group’s research and development 
facilities in Manchester and Runcorn. 
Video conferencing is used where possible instead 
of physical travel in order to reduce the Group’s 
environmental footprint through fewer flights and 
other means of travel.
The Group’s display, lighting and solar technologies 
all sit in the energy efficiency and low environmental 
impact arena and, as such, will enable customer 
companies to increase the uptake of their products 
while reducing their impact on the environment.

Strategic report
Disabled employees
It is Nanoco’s policy that disabled people, including 
job applicants and employees, should be able to 
participate in all of Nanoco’s activities fully on an 
equal basis with people who are not disabled.
Nanoco has a disability discrimination policy that 
states the principles that Nanoco will not, on the 
grounds of a person’s disability, or for a reason 
relating to a person’s disability, treat that person 
less favourably than it treats, or would treat, others 
to whom the same reason does not or would not 
apply, unless genuinely justified. 
If any arrangements made by or on behalf of 
Nanoco, or any physical feature of premises occupied 
by Nanoco, put disabled people at a substantial 
disadvantage compared to people who are not 
disabled, Nanoco will take such reasonably practicable 
steps as it can to prevent this disadvantage.
Nanoco is particularly concerned that disabled 
workers are treated equally in the following areas: 
 •
recruitment and selection; 
 •
promotion, transfer and training; 
 •
terms of employment, benefits, facilities and 
services; and
 •
dismissals and redundancies.
Employee communication and involvement 
Nanoco is committed to a policy of engaging 
employees in the activities and growth of the Group. 
Human resources and senior management review 
communication channels via the use of employee 
surveys and plan communication activities to ensure 
employees are fully informed of current business 
strategy and financial results or corporate news.
Communication channels include all-Group meetings, 
senior team meetings which then cascade information 
down, regular team meetings, cross-functional working 
group meetings and management one-to-one 
updates with their team members. 
Communication media used includes the Group 
intranet, all-Group email briefings and online 
meeting software.
Consultations occur to allow employee opinions 
to be heard when making decisions affecting 
their interests and all employees can discuss any 
business or personal concerns with the human 
resources management team. Nanoco promotes 
the achievement of a good work–life balance for 
employees by offering family-friendly policies like 
flexible working and the operation of a childcare 
voucher scheme. Nanoco also has procedures 
for emergency domestic leave. Remuneration is 
Diversity
Gender diversity
There is one female member on the Board. Although 
there are no females on the Executive team, there 
were three (2016: four) female members out of 17 
(2016: 24) on the senior management team as at 
31 July 2017. Women constituted 24% (2016: 24%) 
of the Group’s employees as a whole at that date. 
The Group is committed to providing flexible working 
arrangements for employees and to providing equal 
access to opportunities for employees, regardless 
of gender.
Racial and geographical diversity
The Group’s employees are from many different 
backgrounds and represent 14 different nationalities: 
British, American, Australian, Chinese, German, 
Indian, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, 
Portuguese, Syrian and Vietnamese. 
The Board itself comprises three different 
nationalities, being British, American and Irish. 
In addition, Group employees come from a range 
of business backgrounds, not purely research 
and development. Indeed, of the Board members, 
previous roles and responsibilities include those 
in the supply of chemicals and engineering, 
electronics, fast-moving consumer goods, 
publishing and financial industries. 
Nanoco has business development people in 
America, Taiwan, Korea and the UK, also covering 
Europe and China. Increasingly Nanoco seeks 
individuals with experience in the business and 
geographic markets in which the Group operates 
in order to support its strategic objectives. 
Equal opportunities
Nanoco is committed to a policy of treating all 
its employees and job applicants equally. Nanoco 
will appoint, train, develop, reward and promote 
on the basis of merit and ability. Nanoco’s equal 
opportunities policy states that employees will not 
receive less favourable treatment or consideration 
on the grounds of age; disability; gender or gender 
reassignment; marriage or civil partnership status; 
pregnancy or maternity; race; religion or belief; sex; 
sexual orientation; or part-time status, nor will they 
be disadvantaged by any conditions of employment 
that cannot be justified as necessary on operational 
grounds relevant to the performance of the job.
The Group’s equal opportunities policy is reviewed 
annually and is available to employees on the 
Group intranet. A copy can be obtained upon 
request from the Company Secretary.

Committee and Executive Directors, as appropriate. 
The Group attracts and retains employees of high 
calibre by offering remuneration that is in line with 
that offered by industry competitors and local 
practice in the countries in which it operates. 
A Group share option LTIP scheme was launched 
during the previous financial year. Grants under 
this scheme were made in November 2016. Some 
employees also hold options from the legacy 
Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) scheme which 
was operational before the main listing. There are 
a significant number of employee shareholders 
as a result of the LTIP scheme.
Employee wellbeing
Nanoco recognises that it has a duty to ensure the 
health, safety and welfare of its employees as far as 
reasonably practicable. This includes physical, mental 
and social wellbeing. It is also required to have in 
place measures to mitigate as far as practicable 
factors that could harm employees’ physical and 
mental wellbeing, which includes work related stress. 
Nanoco introduced an Employee Wellbeing Policy 
and Employee Assistance Programme in May 2017. 
The Wellbeing Policy extends our employer’s duty 
of care by taking action to reduce stressors associated 
with the way work is organised at Nanoco that are 
under our control.
The Employee Assistance Programme offers support 
to help people cope and build resilience. Telephone 
counselling (UK based) and face-to-face counselling 
are available to all employees through the programme.

Risk assessment
Nanoco’s performance on wellbeing and stress 
management will be assessed in the context 
of the HSE Management Standards.
This will involve HR and the EHS Committee 
developing an institution-level risk assessment via 
an employee survey, management focus groups 
and HSE assessment tools. Results will be presented 
to the Executive team so any necessary action can 
be taken where required.

CADMIUM
The European Commission has, 
subject to passing into law , decided 
to prohibit cadmium from TVs 
and displays sold in Europe from 
31 October 2019 under its Restriction 
of Hazardous Substances directive.
 
Nanoco makes quantum dots - a semiconductor crystal used in 
applications like television displays - that are free of the heavy 
metal cadmium, meaning the prohibition of cadmium in these 
products is a boon for Nanoco’s business.
Cadmium is one of six substances banned from use in Europe in 
electrical and electronic equipment by this directive, and is 
recognised as the most hazardous heavy metal.

Communication 
HR will communicate/provide training on agreed 
good management practice (knowledge, skills 
and behaviours framework).
HR will facilitate consultation with employees 
on the Wellbeing Policy via surveys and the EHS 
Committee meetings and feature wellbeing topics 
in employee communications.
HR will publish the policy in the Employee Handbook.
Monitoring and review
HR will collate management information which will 
enable Nanoco to measure its performance in relation 
to stress management and employee wellbeing.
The Wellbeing Policy will be reviewed every three years 
by HR and the EHS Committee using management 
information, staff survey feedback, senior management 
team (“SMT”) and EHS Committee feedback and 
results of risk assessments.
The three-year review will be reported to the 
Nanoco Board EHS Committee to approve any 
revisions or amendments to the policy.
Ethics
Nanoco aims to demonstrate and promote high 
standards of honest and ethical conduct throughout 
the Group. Formal policies and procedures are 
reviewed annually and the policies listed below are 
available on the Group intranet or upon request 
from the Company Secretary. All Group employees 
are required to adhere to specified codes of conduct, 
policies and procedures, including, but not limited 
to, the:
 •
anti-bribery and corruption policy;
 •
whistleblowing policy; and
 •
equal opportunities policy.
Nanoco is a member of the Chemical Industries 
Association (“CIA”) and applies the principles of 
Responsible Care

Feel better, work better, live better
Nanoco’s wellbeing policy aims to enhance 
organisational performance by engaging all 
employees at all levels:
 •
to take responsibility for creating a working environment 
where potential work related stressors as far as 
practicable are avoided, minimised or mitigated; and
 •
to take responsibility for their own work and 
effectiveness and their own health and wellbeing.
It is managed by HR in conjunction with EHS and will 
assess Nanoco’s working practices against the HSE 
Management Standards.
The introduction of an Employee Assistance Programme 
as part of the wellbeing policy provides counselling 
support that helps to reduce absence and improve 
wellbeing by addressing issues head-on, reducing 
their impact.
Training
Nanoco believes in high standards. This includes 
a commitment to giving our employees training 
and development opportunities. We are committed 
to developing positive working relationships and 
providing support for people to do their jobs

Board and Committee evaluation
Regular and appropriate Board and 
Committee evaluation is vital to improving 
Board effectiveness. This year I conducted 
a thorough internal Board evaluation 
process, which was discussed in detail by 
the Board. Overall, it was concluded that 
the Board and Committees functioned 
effectively, with Directors feeling free to 
voice their differing opinions, but that 
there were areas of potential improvement.
It was felt that the balance of time allocated 
to strategy, operations and functional areas 
and governance was broadly correct, 
although, as last year, it was decided that 
additional time should be spent discussing 
strategy. We are addressing the strategy 
by allocating additional time outside of the 
regular Board meetings to ensure that this 
area is properly addressed in future. The 
Chairs of both the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees changed during the year as 
a result of resignations from the Board. The 
new Chairs have settled in well to their roles 
and next year the performance of those 
Committees will be reviewed formally. 
Whilst in compliance with the Code, we 
believe that the ratio of Non-executive 
I am pleased to present the Corporate 
governance report for the year ended 
31 July 2017 .
As I said in my letter to shareholders in last 
year’s report, the Board believes that good 
governance is fundamental to the successful 
growth of our business. The Board and its 
Committees play a central role in the Group’s 
governance by providing an external and 
independent perspective on matters material 
to Nanoco’s stakeholders, and by seeking to 
ensure that effective internal controls and 
risk management measures are in place.
The Board also promotes a culture 
of good governance throughout the 
Group by creating an environment of 
openness, transparency, accountability 
and responsibility.
This section of the Annual Report describes 
our corporate governance structures and 
processes and how they have been applied 
throughout the year ended 31 July 2017.
My role as Chairman
My role is to ensure that Nanoco has 
an effective Board which is collectively 
responsible for the long-term success 
of the Group and that all Board Directors 
play an active part in all meetings, in an 
open environment in which everyone 
expresses their opinions in pursuit of the 
best conclusions for the Group. One of my 
most important jobs is to ensure that the 
Board and its Committees have the right 
balance of skills, experience and knowledge 
Directors to Executive Directors is not ideal 
and we will look to appoint another 
Non-executive Director in due course.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee’s key work during 
the period was detailed work in supporting 
the going concern assessment, the detailed 
disclosures that we made in our interim results 
and improving the risk management process. 
Further details can be found on page 38.
Longer-term viability statement
The Group utilised the first two years 
of its five-year forecast to assess its long-
term viability. The two-year period was 
chosen due to the inherent difficulty and 
uncertainties in preparing forecasts for the 
Group at its current stage of development. 
Further details are provided on page 20.

Nanoco Group plc – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
This section contains the Group’s reporting 
disclosures on corporate governance required 
by the Companies Act 2006, the 2016 UK 
Corporate Governance Code of the Financial 
Reporting Council (“the Code”) and the UKLA’s 
Disclosure and Transparency Rule 7 including 
the required statement of compliance. 
A copy of the Code is publicly available at 
www.frc.org.uk/directors/corporate-
governance-and-stewardship/uk-
corporate-governance-code.
The Board is committed to ensuring that 
high standards of corporate governance 
appropriate for the Group’s size are 
maintained by Nanoco.
Statement of compliance 
with the Code
I am pleased to confirm that the Board 
considers that it has been in compliance 
with the Code throughout the year ended 
31 July 2017. We did not comply with the 
requirement in E.2.4 to give 14 clear working 
days’ notice of the general meeting we 
held on 14 November 2017. The reason for 
the non-compliance was the desire to 
conclude the meeting as early as possible 
as completion of the fundraising had a 
direct impact on the publication of the 
Company’s preliminary results announcement 
and its report and accounts for the year 
ended 31 July 2017 as the proceeds of the 
fundraising were relevant in assessing the 
going concern status of the Company. The 
Directors strongly believed that it was in 
the best interests of the Company for the 
going concern status of the Company to 
be secured prior to the publication of the 
Company’s preliminary results announcement 
and its report and accounts for the year 
ended 31 July 2017, which were required to 
be published by 30 November 2017. Whilst 
in compliance with the Code, we believe 
that the ratio of Non-executive Directors 
to Executive Directors is not ideal and we 
will look to appoint another Non-executive 
Director in due course.
Disclosure and Transparency Rule 7
This statement complies with sub-sections 
2.1, 2.2(i), 2.3(i), 2.5, 2.7 and 2.10 of Rule 7 of 
the UK Listing Authority’s Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules. The information 
required to be disclosed by sub-section 
2.6 of Rule 7 is shown in the Statement of 
Directors’ responsibilities on page 64 and 
is incorporated in this section by reference.
The Board
The Group is controlled through its Board of 
Directors. The Board’s main roles are to 
provide overall strategy and direction for 
the Group and to ensure that the necessary 
financial and other resources are made 
available to enable those objectives to be 
met. It has a schedule of matters reserved 
for its approval, including, but not limited to, 
decisions on strategy and risk management, 
approval of budgets, acquisitions and 
disposals, major capital expenditure, legal 
and insurance issues, Board structure and 
the appointment of advisers. In some areas 
responsibility is delegated to Committees 
of the Board within clearly defined terms 
of reference.
Once the strategic and financial objectives 
of the Group have been set by the Board 
it is the role of the Chief Executive Officer 
to ensure that through the day-to-day 
management of the Group’s business 
they are achieved.
All Directors are subject to election by the 
shareholders at the next general meeting 
following appointment to the Board and to 
re-election at intervals of not more than 
three years.
As at 31 July 2017, the Board comprised the 
Non-executive Chairman, two independent 
Non-executive Directors and four 
Executive Directors.
The names of the current Directors together 
with their biographical details and any other 
directorships are set out on pages 32 and 33.
The contracts of the Directors are available 
for inspection by shareholders at the AGM.
The Board considers its independent 
Non-executive Directors to be independent in 
character and judgement. No Non-executive 
Director has been an employee of the Group; 
has had a material business relationship 
with the Group; receives remuneration other 
than a Director’s fee; has close family ties 
with any of the Group’s advisers, Directors or 
senior employees; or holds cross-directorships.
The Non-executive Directors constructively 
challenge and help develop proposals on 
strategy and bring strong, independent 
judgement, knowledge and experience 
to the Board’s deliberations.
The Directors are given access to independent 
professional advice at the Group’s expense, 
when the Directors deem it is necessary in 
order for them to carry out their responsibilities.
The Board meets at least eight times a 
year and the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nominations Committees meet at least 
twice a year. Additional Board calls may 
be held to address specific issues as they 
arise. During this year, one Board meeting 
was cancelled and combined with another 
meeting so the Board met seven times in 
this financial year.
The Board receives appropriate and timely 
information prior to each meeting, with a 
formal agenda and Board and Committee 
papers being distributed several days before 
meetings take place. Any Director may 
challenge Group proposals, and decisions 
are taken democratically after discussion. 
Any Director who feels that any concern 
remains unresolved after discussion may ask 
for that concern to be noted in the minutes of 
the meeting. Any specific actions arising from 
such meetings are agreed by the Board 
and then followed up by management.
The Group maintains, for its Directors and 
officers, liability insurance for any claims 
against them in that capacity.
There is a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for the appointment of new 
Directors to the Board, which is led by 
the Nominations Committee.
The Board has carried out a thorough 
evaluation each year of its own performance 
and that of its Committees and individual 
Directors. The Chairs of both the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees have been in 
place for only part of the year and their 
performance will be reviewed fully next year. 
The Board considers that the Committees 
have performed effectively throughout 
the year.
The Board will not take significant risks 
to achieve its strategic objectives and 
indeed endeavours to limit the risks to the 
business in the achievement of its strategic 
objectives by partnering with a number of 
organisations in a number of areas.
The Group has effective procedures in place 
to deal with conflicts of interest. The Board is 
aware of other commitments of its Directors 
and changes to these commitments are 
reported to the Board.
The number of Board and Committee 
meetings attended by each of the Directors

Corporate governance
The Board continued
During the year, the Board has maintained 
responsibility for: the overall management 
of the Group, which included review and 
development of the Group’s focus and 
business partnerships; approval of the 
annual operating and capital expenditure 
budgets and any material changes to them; 
and approval of the half-yearly report, 
interim management statements or trading 
updates, the preliminary announcement of 
results and the Annual Report and Accounts.
Each full Board meeting considers, as a 
matter of course, the operational, technological 
and financial performance of the Group 
against its strategic goals and annual 
budget; reports from the Chairs of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nominations Committees 
(if applicable); important forthcoming events; 
and reports on investor relations, legal affairs, 
the environment, and health and safety. 
Additionally, Directors are required to confirm 
any potential conflicts of interest arising 
from the proposed business of the meeting 
and any changes in their commitments or 
other appointments. Certain key senior 
management members are invited to give 
presentations at Board and Committee 
meetings where appropriate.
Other areas, including the review of the 
Group risk register, the strategic plan, 
litigation matters, contentious matters, 
succession planning, IT strategy and 
the need for a quality and compliance 
committee and strategic advisory 
committee are reviewed by the 
Board during each year at intervals 
commensurate with their importance.
The roles of the Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer
The division of responsibilities between 
the Chairman of the Board and the 
Chief Executive Officer is clearly defined. 
The Chairman leads the Board in the 
determination of its strategy and in the 
achievement of its objectives. The Chairman 
is responsible for organising the business 
of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness 
and setting its agenda. The Chairman 
is a Non-executive Director and has no 
involvement in the day-to-day business 
of the Group. The Chairman facilitates the 
effective contribution of Non-executive 
Directors and constructive relations between 
Executive and Non-executive Directors, 
ensures Directors receive accurate, timely 
and clear information and facilitates 
effective communication with shareholders.
The Chief Executive Officer has direct charge 
of the Group on a day-to-day basis and is 
accountable to the Board for the financial 
and operational performance of the Group.
Commitments and performance 
of the Chairman
The Chairman has sufficient time to devote 
to his duties as Chairman and this has been 
demonstrated by his active participation in 
the Group’s activities. His performance is 
reviewed annually by the Non-executive 
Directors and led by the Senior Non-executive 
Director, Brendan Cummins. In this regard, 
the experiences, input and recommendations 
of all Board Members was solicited via 
confidential interviews and discussions. 
The evaluation, for the most part, focused 
on the Chair’s leadership effectiveness in 
managing the Board/managing relationships 
with all stakeholders, the extent to which 
the Chair effectively leads and develops 
the Board and promotes solid participation 
leading to sound decision making and the 
conducting of meaningful performance 
evaluation. The Chair was evaluated on the 
effectiveness of the overall governance 
process, the cohesion of our strategic 
management system and recommendations 
were given as to how we could further 
develop all these aspects.
Professional development
On appointment, each Director takes part in 
an induction programme in which they 
receive comprehensive information about 
the Group; the role of the Board and the 
matters reserved for its decision; the terms of 
reference and membership of the Board and 
Committees and the powers delegated to 
those Committees; the Group’s corporate 
governance practices and procedures, 
including the powers reserved to the Group’s 
most senior Executives; and the Group’s 
latest financial information. Throughout their 
period in office the Directors are updated 
on the Group’s business, the competitive 
environment in which it operates, corporate 
social responsibility matters and other 
changes affecting the Group and the 
industry it operates in as a whole.
Performance evaluation
The Board has established a formal 
process for the annual evaluation of the 
performance of the Executive Directors. 
This evaluation is based on a performance 
evaluation questionnaire completed by 
each Executive Director. The evaluation of 
the Chief Executive Officer is performed 
by the Chairman and the evaluation of 
the other Executive Directors is performed 
by the Chief Executive Officer.
Information
Board reports and papers are circulated 
to the Directors in advance of the relevant 
Board or Committee meeting. The Board 
papers include management accounts, 
regular management reports and 
information which enables the Board to 
scrutinise the Group’s and management’s 
performance against agreed objectives.
These papers are supplemented by 
information specifically requested by the 
Directors from time to time. Minutes of 
Board and Committee meetings are 
circulated to all Board members.
Director dealings in Company shares
In addition, the Company has adopted 
a model code for Directors’ dealings 
in securities of the Company which is 
appropriate for a company quoted on 
the premium list of the London Stock 
Exchange. The Directors comply with the 
rules relating to Directors’ dealings and 
also take all reasonable steps to ensure 
compliance by the Group’s “applicable 
employees” as defined in the rules.
Investor relations
Meetings with analysts and institutional 
shareholders are held following the interim 
and preliminary results announcements 
and on an ad hoc basis. These are usually 
attended by the Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer. Feedback from 
these meetings and regular market updates 
are prepared by the Company’s broker and 
by the Company’s internal and external 
investor relations advisers and are presented 
to the Board. The Chairman and other 
Non-executive Directors are available 
to shareholders to discuss strategy and 
governance issues at a shareholder’s request. 
There is an investors section on the Company’s 
website, www.nanocotechnologies.com, 
which is kept up to date.
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”)
At the AGM, separate resolutions will 
be proposed for each substantially 
different issue. The outcome of the 
voting on AGM resolutions is disclosed 
by means of an announcement on the 
London Stock Exchange.
Relations with shareholders and 
other stakeholders
Nanoco recognises the importance of 
good and timely communication. Its 
primary communication channel is the 
internet. All press releases are published on 
the Company’s website shortly after they 
are issued via the regulatory news service 
in the United Kingdom.
The majority of shareholders receive most 
of their information about the Company, 
including the annual and half-yearly 
reports, via the website.
All shareholders are encouraged to attend 
the Annual General Meeting and talk to the 
Directors there. In addition, shareholders are 
able to contact the Company via email at 
info@nanocotechnologies.com.
The Board takes steps to ensure that the 
views of major shareholders are considered 
through regular contact. As appropriate, the 
Board takes due note of their views insofar 
as these are relevant to the Company’s 
overall approach to corporate governance. 
This is achieved through feedback from 
meetings with significant shareholders and 
feedback from the Company’s brokers.
In addition, capital market events are held 
to inform financial analysts, shareholders 
and the press about the Company’s activities.

The Board strongly believes that good 
governance and strong, responsible, 
balanced leadership are critical to creating 
long-term shareholder value and business 
success. The Committee met three times 
during the year.
Roles and responsibilities
Under normal circumstances, the 
Nominations Committee will meet not less 
than twice a year to assist the Board in 
discharging its responsibilities relating 
to the composition and make-up of the 
Board and any Committees of the Board. 
It is also responsible for periodically reviewing 
the Board’s structure and identifying 
potential candidates to be appointed as 
Directors or Committee members as the 
need may arise. The Nominations Committee 
is responsible for evaluating the balance 
of skills, knowledge and experience and 
the size, structure and composition of the 
Board and Committees of the Board, and 
retirements and appointments of additional 
and replacement Directors and Committee 
members, and makes appropriate 
recommendations to the Board on 
such matters.
Committee membership
In accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code the Nominations 
Committee consists of Non-executive 
Directors. It is chaired by Dr Christopher 
Richards since his appointment as a 
Non-executive Director in November 2015. 
The Committee’s other members are 
Brendan Cummins and Dr Alison Fielding. 
Gordon Hall and Robin Williams were 
members of the Committee prior to their 
resignation from the Board. There have not 
been any other changes to the Committee 
membership during the year.
Committee activities during 
the year
The Nominations Committee met three times 
during the financial year to discuss Board 
structure and independence, its skillset 
and the appointment of Dr Alison Fielding 
as a Non-executive Director and Audit 
Committee Chair. The recruitment firm used 
to assist the Committee in the selection 
process which led to the recruitment of 
Dr Alison Fielding was The Miles Partnership, 
which is the only connection that the 
Miles Partnership has with the Company.
Whilst in compliance with the Code, we 
believe that the ratio of Non-executive 
Directors to Executive Directors is not ideal 
and we will look to appoint another 
Non-executive Director in due course.
Diversity
The Group pursues diversity, including 
gender diversity, throughout the business. 
When recruiting at Board level, the 
Nominations Committee requires that 
executive search firms have signed up to 
their industry’s voluntary code of conduct 
(prepared in response to the Davies Review 
of Women on Boards). The Group follows 
a policy of appointing talented people 
on merit at every level and does not have 
a specific target for numbers of female 
Directors. The Board will also ensure 
that its own development in this area 
is consistent with its strategic objectives 
and enhances Board effectiveness.

Corporate governance
The Audit Committee plays a central role 
in the review of the Group’s financial 
reporting and internal control processes. 
Its aim is to ensure that these processes 
deliver high quality and timely information. 
The Audit Committee continues to be 
vigilant in its monitoring of internal and 
external risk factors and to assist the 
Board in its development of a risk register 
and the introduction of the viability report. 
As a Committee it seeks not just to respond 
to external factors but to endeavour to 
support and challenge management to 
anticipate future risks and opportunities.
The Committee remains committed 
to helping the Board ensure that the 
Annual Report, as a whole, is fair balanced 
and understandable.
The specific duties of the Committee, 
how it operates and the key areas of focus 
are detailed in the review below. It is very 
conscious of increasing shareholder 
expectation and scrutiny of its work 
and would welcome feedback.
Roles and responsibilities
The Audit Committee assists the Board in 
discharging its responsibilities with regard to:
 •
financial reporting, including reviewing 
and monitoring the integrity of the Group’s 
annual and interim financial statements. 
The Board has also requested that the 
Committee advise them in ensuring that 
the financial statements, when taken 
as a whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy. The ultimate 
responsibility for reviewing and approving 
the Annual Report and Accounts and the 
half-yearly reports remains with the Board;
 •
the external auditor, including reviewing 
and monitoring the extent of the non-audit 
work undertaken by the external auditor, 
advising on the appointment of the 
external auditor, overseeing the Group’s 
relationship with its external auditor and 
reviewing the effectiveness of the 
external audit process;
 •
internal controls and consideration of 
the potential need for an internal audit 
function, including reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
control review function;
 •
the appropriateness of accounting 
policies and the critical judgements 
and estimates;
 •
the relevance of developments in 
accounting and reporting requirements;
 •
the effectiveness of internal controls 
and risk management systems;
 •
the auditor’s plan for the year-end audit;
 •
the formal engagement terms, 
performance, objectivity and 
independence of the auditor, including 
the extent of non-audit work undertaken 
by the auditor; and
 •
the audit and non-audit fees of the 
auditor. These are set out in note 6 
to the financial statements.
The Audit Committee will give due 
consideration to laws and regulations, 
the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and the requirements 
of the Listing Rules.
The Audit Committee continues to 
be vigilant in its monitoring of internal 
and external risk factors.

Nanoco Group plc – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Committee membership
The composition of the Committee 
currently comprises Dr Alison Fielding 
and Brendan Cummins. Dr Alison Fielding 
became Chair of the Committee following 
the resignation of Robin Williams on 13 July 
2017. Gordon Hall was also a member of the 
Committee until his resignation. In accordance 
with the provisions of the Code, the 
Committee is made up of independent 
Non-executive Directors. The Board considers 
that Dr Alison Fielding, by virtue of her former 
executive and current non-executive roles, 
has recent and relevant financial experience 
to act as Chair of the Committee. Details 
of relevant experience of all members of 
the Committee are detailed on pages 32 
and 33. Other Directors and representatives 
of the external auditor attend by invitation.
Activities of the Audit Committee
The Committee met five times during the 
financial year. The meetings were held to 
review the results of the external audit for 
the previous financial year and discuss 
and agree the scope of the external audits 
and internal reviews for the year, including 
the review of key areas of judgement 
and improvements to the risk 
management process.
The Committee discharged its obligations 
in response to the financial year as follows:
External audit
During the year the Committee reviewed 
and approved the scope and timetable 
for the interim review and final audit. The 
Committee also reviews the policies to 
ensure ongoing compliance with the Code. 
This includes the policy against which to 
consider the independence of the external 
auditor consistent with the ethical standards 
published by the Audit Practices Board 
and a policy on the engagement of the 
external auditor for the provision of 
non-audit services.
The Committee has considered the 
independence requirements, including 
that the rotation policy has been complied 
with. Furthermore, the only fees paid for 
non-audit services related to a review of 
the interim results in the current year and 
a review of working capital forecasts 
required for an anticipated fundraise 
and therefore do not jeopardise their 
independence. A separate external firm is 
engaged for taxation advice. However, in 
view of the period which has elapsed since 
the appointment of its current auditor in 
2008, the Committee will consider the need 
for a re-tender following the finalisation 
of this year’s audit and in any case will 
put the audit out to tender following 
the 2018 audit.
Independence safeguards
In accordance with best practice and 
professional standards, the external auditor 
is required to adhere to a rotation policy 
whereby the audit engagement partner is 
rotated after five years. Ernst & Young LLP 
has been in tenure for nine years and the 
current audit engagement partner was 
appointed in 2016. The external auditor is 
also required periodically to assess whether, 
in its professional opinion, it is independent 
and those views are shared with the Audit 
Committee. The Committee has authority 
to take independent advice as it deems 
appropriate in order to resolve issues on 
auditor independence. No such advice 
has to date been required.
Non-audit services provided 
by the external auditor
During the financial year the non-audit 
services provided to the Group by the 
auditor (£52,000, 2016: £8,000) comprised 
a review of the interim results and, in the 
current year only, a review of working 
capital forecasts required for an anticipated 
fundraise. Since the year end non-audit 
services provided to the Group by the 
auditor amounted to £25,000 (2016: £nil) 
and comprised a further review of the 
working capital statement required 
to be given in relation to the fundraise 
in November 2017.
Independence assessment 
by the Audit Committee
The Committee was satisfied that 
safeguards were maintained regarding 
the independence and objectivity of 
the external auditor.
Financial reporting
The Committee reviewed the interim and 
annual financial statements. As part of 
that review process, the members of the 
Committee were provided with a draft of 
the full Annual Report enabling them to 
ensure that the numbers therein are 
consistent with those in the financial 
statements, their knowledge gained from 
the monthly management accounts or are 
sourced from appropriate data. More 
importantly, the Committee assessed 
whether the words used were consistent 
with their understanding of the Group’s 
business obtained through Board and 
Audit Committee meetings and other 
interaction they had with management, 
using their experience to assess whether 
the Annual Report taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable. This 
additional review by the Committee, 
supplemented by advice received from 
external advisers during the drafting 
process, assisted the Board in determining 
that the report is fair, balanced and 
understandable at the time that it was 
approved. The Committee considered the 
appropriateness of preparing the accounts 
on a going concern basis, including 
consideration of forecast plans and 
supporting assumptions and concluded 
that the Group’s financial position was 
such that it continued to be appropriate 
for accounts to be prepared on a going 
concern basis. Emphasis was placed on 
the detailed going concern disclosures 
which were subject to detailed scrutiny as 
part of the preparation of the interim results.
The Committee, together with the Board, 
considered what were the significant risks and 
issues in relation to the financial statements 
and how these would be addressed.
(i)  The Committee reviewed the revenue 
recognition policies adopted in these 
accounts and determined that the 
treatment was appropriate as it 
reflects the substance of the licence 
agreements. There were no new 
licence agreements in this year. 
(ii)  The Committee considered the use of 
the going concern basis, due to the 
continued losses being incurred. This 
involved extensive scenario planning 
and full disclosure in the interim results.
(iii)  The Committee reviewed the need for 
an impairment of the carrying value of 
tangible and intangible fixed assets as 
the Group incurred losses during year 
and concluded that an impairment 
provision of £77,000 should be made. 
 (iv)  The Committee has overseen the 
preparation of the viability statement 
produced for this year’s Annual Report 
and has conducted a robust 
examination of the risks identified, the 
resultant actions that may be required 
and the projected outcomes. 40
Corporate governance
Internal controls 
and risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for 
the Group’s system of internal controls, 
including reviewing the effectiveness of 
these controls and the processes in place 
for risk management. The role of the 
Executive Directors is to implement the 
Board’s policies on risk and control and 
provide assurance on compliance with 
these policies. The processes and 
procedures in place are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate risk and can 
therefore only provide a reasonable and 
not an absolute assurance against 
material misstatements or losses.
Executive Directors have a close 
involvement with all day-to-day operations 
and also meet with staff on a regular basis 
to identify and review business risks, the 
controls needed to minimise those risks 
and the effectiveness of controls in place. 
Business risks are monitored and updated 
on a regular basis. Insurance is in place 
where appropriate.
Some key features of the internal control 
system are that:
(i)  annual budgets and rolling forecasts 
are reviewed and approved by 
the Board;
(ii)  monthly management accounts 
information is compared and 
reconciled with budgets;
(iii)  the Group has written operational, 
accounting and employment policies 
in place;
(iv)  the Board actively identifies and 
evaluates the risks inherent in the 
business and ensures that appropriate 
controls and procedures are in place 
to manage these risks;
(v)  the Group has well established 
financial reporting and approval 
systems and procedures which cover 
all key transactional processes and 
Group commitments; and
(vi)  the Group has a uniform system 
of investment appraisal.
The Group has quality assurance 
processes in place by virtue of its internal 
quality assurance department, which 
audits non-financial processes and 
procedures, although this department 
does not report to the Audit Committee.
As a result of deficiencies identified last 
year, additional procedures have been 
introduced by the Audit Committee to 
ensure that revenue recognition is 
correctly determined as part of the 
process of agreeing new licences and 
other technical areas of IFRSs are properly 
applied. These additional procedures 
include review and approval of the 
proposed treatment by the Board.
The Committee considers that the need 
for an internal audit function is not currently 
warranted due to the size and complexity 
of the business but will reconsider this 
need not less than annually.
Internal accountability
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s system of risk management and 
internal control. The Audit Committee 
reviews the effectiveness of the system at 
least annually on behalf of the Board and, 
having carried out this review, the Board 
continues to believe that the system is 
effective in safeguarding shareholders’ 
interests and the Group’s assets. Such a 
system can only provide reasonable and 
not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss, nor can it eliminate 
the risk of failure.
In accordance with the Internal Control 
Guidance for Directors issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council, there is an 
ongoing process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the significant risks faced 
by the Group. This process was introduced 
during 2015 and is being reviewed and 
improved upon.
The Group operates, and attaches 
importance to, clear principles and 
procedures designed to achieve the 
accountability and control appropriate 
to a science-based business operating 
internationally in the research business 
sector. Nanoco has established an 
organisational structure with clearly 
drawn lines of accountability and 
delegation of authority.
Financial results and key operational 
and financial performance indicators are 
reported regularly throughout the year 
and variances from plans and budgets are 
investigated and reported. The Group has 
a system of high level financial control 
procedures which are supplemented by 
detailed procedures at each operating 
entity. Compliance with these procedures 
is monitored by the Audit Committee 
through its reviews of internal and 
external audit findings, its reviews of 
exceptions, and regular management 
and financial reporting.
Details of the technical, product, market 
and operational risks of the business are 
disclosed in the Strategic report.
Details of the Group’s financial risk 
management objectives and policies 
are disclosed in note 26 to the 
financial statements.
The Directors do not consider that the 
business is, at this time, significantly 
exposed to credit or interest risk and, as 
such, these risks are not considered to be 
material for an assessment of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and results.
The Group seeks to manage liquidity by 
ensuring funds are available to meet 
foreseeable needs and to invest cash 
assets safely and profitably. The Group 
had cash, cash equivalent and deposit 
balances of £5.7 million as at 31 July 2017 
(2016: £14.5 million). 
The Group manages its cash deposits 
prudently. The net placing proceeds of 
£8.0 million and other cash balances will 
be invested across a number of financial 
institutions which have investment-grade 
credit ratings. The deposits will range from 
instant access to six-month term deposits. 
Cash deposits are regularly reviewed by 
the Board and cash forecasts are updated 
monthly to ensure that there is sufficient cash 
available for foreseeable requirements.

Nanoco Group plc – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Dear shareholder
As the Chairman of Nanoco’s Remuneration 
Committee (“the Committee”), I am pleased 
to present our Directors’ remuneration report 
for the year ended 31 July 2017. The terms 
of reference of the Remuneration Committee 
can be found in the Investor section of the 
Group’s website. Our Directors’ remuneration 
policy was approved by shareholders at 
the AGM on 10 December 2015 and has 
been applied throughout the year ended 
31 July 2017. Transitioning to a commercial 
organisation presents many challenges to 
a remuneration process. It is not always 
possible during such transitions to fully 
reward individual effort and individual 
performance. The developing of a market 
takes time and the resulting financial 
achievement reflecting all the effort 
only comes in the future. The Committee 
would like to acknowledge and thank the 
organisation for the excellent work over 
the years, in driving our organisation 
forward. The Committee considers that the 
policy remains appropriate for the Group 
in the coming year and it will continue to 
apply for the year ending 31 July 2018. 
The full Directors’ remuneration policy 
as approved can be found in the Annual 
Report and Accounts for the year ended 
31 July 2015 on the Group’s website at 
www.nanocotechnologies.com. 
The Annual report on remuneration section 
of this report provides details of the amounts 
earned by Directors in respect of the year 
ended 31 July 2017 and how the Directors’ 
remuneration policy will be operated for 
the year commencing 1 August 2017. This 
will be subject to an advisory vote at the 
AGM on 12 January 2018.
Our approach to remuneration
Our remuneration policy is designed to 
promote the long-term success of the 
business by ensuring a focus on performance 
related pay that drives our transformation 
to a commercial proposition and provides 
a clear emphasis on long-term 
sustainable performance. 
A key part of our remuneration policy is our 
incentive arrangements, which are aligned 
to the strategic direction of the Group and 
our stakeholder philosophy. Our incentive 
arrangements comprise a Deferred Bonus 
Plan (“DBP”) and a Long Term Incentive 
Plan (“LTIP”). 
Our remuneration policy is designed to promote 
the long-term success of the business by 
ensuring a focus on performance related pay 
that drives our transformation to a commercial 
proposition and provides a clear emphasis 
on long-term sustainable performance.

Corporate governance
Our approach to remuneration 
continued
The share plans are designed to:
 •
be simple and transparent to 
participants and our shareholders;
 •
engage employees and appropriately 
motivate and incentivise our senior leadership 
team to deliver the long-term strategy;
 •
reflect our stakeholder philosophy by 
enabling employees at all levels to share 
in the success of the Group and by 
encouraging the senior leadership team 
to build meaningful shareholdings in the 
Company; and
 •
provide a flexible framework which 
reflects the stage of the Group’s 
development, which is perceived 
as valuable and a fair reflection 
of performance and is aligned with 
sustainable shareholder value creation.
Remuneration decisions in respect 
of the year ended 31 July 2017
As referred to in the 2016 Directors’ 
remuneration report, our Executive Directors’ 
salaries for the year ended 31 July 2017 were 
increased by 0.5%, below the increases 
for the wider workforce.
The 2017 bonus opportunity for the Executive 
Directors was based on a combination 
of financial and corporate measures 
and challenging personal objectives. 
Notwithstanding the commitment of the 
Executive Directors and the excellent 
performance against personal objectives, 
the Remuneration Committee determined 
that the company could not justify awarding 
any bonuses to the Executive Directors 
due to affordability and the lack of 
achievement of financial targets. 
Long-term incentive awards were granted 
in the year under the LTIP, and further 
information is given on pages 53 and 54.
Remuneration in the year 
commencing 1 August 2017
The approved Directors’ remuneration 
policy will be applied as follows in the 
year commencing 1 August 2017:
 •
Executive Directors will not receive 
a salary increase. 
 •
Consideration is to be given to awarding 
the workforce below Executive and senior 
management a base salary increase of 
1 to 2% to be applied based on individual 
merit and performance level.
 •
For the year commencing 1 August 2017, 
employer pension contributions above 
the amount of any salary sacrifice (and 
the associated employer National 
Insurance contributions savings) will 
continue to be capped at 5% of salary. 
 •
Annual bonus opportunity for Executive 
Directors will remain at 100% of salary, 
subject to the achievement of stretching 
performance conditions. Half of any 
bonus earned will be delivered via an 
award of deferred shares under the DBP; 
further information is given on page 57. 
 •
LTIP awards for the year commencing 
1 August 2017 will be granted at the 
usual policy level of 100% of salary.
 •
LTIP awards will continue to be subject 
to stretching share price and revenue 
targets with an underpin applying to 
both elements. Further information is 
given on page 58.
 •
In line with best practice, clawback will 
continue to apply to any cash bonus 
paid and malus provisions to any 
unvested deferred bonus awards and 
awards granted under the new LTIP.
 •
No increases to the Non-executive 
Director fee levels are proposed.
As a Committee, we believe that ongoing 
dialogue with our major shareholders is of 
key importance. Should you have any queries 
or feedback in relation to the Directors’ 
remuneration report, please contact 
me through the Company Secretary.

Nanoco Group plc – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
This Directors’ remuneration report for the year ended 31 July 2017 complies with the requirements of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing 
Authority, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (September 2016). The Regulations require the auditor to report to the Company’s 
members on certain parts of the Directors’ remuneration report and to state whether, in its opinion, those parts of the report have 
been properly prepared in accordance with the accounting regulations.
Items that are audited throughout this report are clearly marked as audited in the heading of the section.
Directors’ remuneration policy
This part of the report sets out the Company’s Directors’ remuneration policy as approved at the December 2015 AGM, except that we have 
updated the scenario charts on page 46 to reflect the application of the policy in 2017/18. The Directors’ remuneration policy is not audited. 
The table below describes each of the elements of the remuneration package for the Executive Directors.
Element and purpose Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures
Base salary
Core element of fixed 
remuneration that 
provides the basis to 
recruit and retain talent 
necessary to deliver the 
business strategy.
Normally reviewed annually, any increases 
generally apply from 1 August (but may be 
reviewed more frequently if required).
When determining base salary levels, 
consideration is given to the following:
 •
the role, responsibility and experience 
of the individual;
 •
corporate and individual performance;
 •
market conditions, including typical pay levels for 
comparable roles in companies of a similar size 
and complexity; and
 •
the range of salary increases awarded across 
the Group.
Whilst there is no maximum salary, 
salary increases will normally be in line 
with the wider workforce, with the 
following exceptions:
 •
where an Executive Director has 
been promoted or their role has had 
a change in scope or responsibility;
 •
due to an individual’s development 
or performance in their role (e.g. a 
newly appointed Executive Director 
being moved to be aligned with the 
market over time);
 •
where there has been a change 
in market practice; or
 •
where there has been a change 
in the size and/or complexity 
of the business.

Benefits
Provide a market-
competitive benefits 
package and promote 
the wellbeing of 
employees.
Directors are entitled to receive reimbursement 
for out-of-pocket expenses incurred on Company 
business. Where tax is payable in respect of expenses 
incurred by Directors wholly and necessarily for 
business purposes, the Board has agreed that 
the relevant tax will be paid by the Company.
The Company provides benefits, principally life 
assurance, for all Directors. Directors’ business 
expenses are reimbursed on submission of an 
authorised expense claim.
The benefits provided would be reviewed 
periodically, taking individual circumstances into 
consideration. Benefits provided may include, for 
example, medical expenses, relocation expenses, 
expatriate allowances and travel expenses.
Whilst the Committee has not set 
an absolute maximum on the level 
of benefits Executive Directors may 
receive, the value of benefits is set 
at a level which the Committee 
considers to be appropriately 
positioned taking into account 
relevant market levels based on the 
nature and location of the role, the 
level of benefits provided to other 
employees in the Group and 
individual circumstances.
n/a
Retirement benefits
Provide market-
competitive post-
employment benefits 
to recruit and retain 
Directors of the calibre 
required for the business.
The Company currently operates a salary sacrifice 
pension arrangement under which Executive Directors 
may elect to sacrifice salary and the Company 
pays an amount equal to the amount of the salary 
sacrifice, together with the employer National 
Insurance saved, into a private pension scheme.
Executive Directors are also eligible to participate 
in the Company’s defined contribution scheme (or 
such other pension plan as may be deemed 
appropriate). In appropriate circumstances, such 
as where contributions exceed the annual or 
lifetime allowance, Executive Directors may be 
permitted to take a cash supplement instead of 
contributions to a pension plan (this would not 
count towards the bonus or LTIP opportunity).
For the year commencing 1 August 2017, 
employer pension contributions above 
the amount of any salary sacrifice 
and employer NIC saved will be 
capped at 5% (2016: 5%) of salary.
An overall contribution limit of up to 
10% of base salary may be made in 
future years (in addition to the 
amount of any salary sacrifice and 
employer NIC saved) to take account 
of a change in the scope of the role, 
increase in responsibility and/or a 
change in the size and/or complexity 
of the business.

Corporate governance
Element and purpose Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures
Annual bonus
Rewards and incentivises 
the achievement of 
annual objectives which 
are aligned with key 
financial and strategic 
goals and supports the 
enhancement of 
shareholder value.
Performance targets are set annually and payout 
levels are determined after the year end following 
the Committee’s assessment of actual 
performance against set targets.
At least 50% of any bonus earned is paid in cash 
and 50% is awarded in shares under the DBP which 
vest after two years. The Committee may decide 
not to operate deferral if it is determined that the 
amount to be deferred is too small to warrant the 
administrative burden.
Deferred share awards may incorporate the right 
to receive (in cash or shares) the value of the 
dividends that would have been paid on the 
shares that vest. 
Maximum annual bonus opportunity 
is 100% of salary.
The percentage of maximum 
bonus payable for the different 
levels of performance would be 
no greater than:
Below threshold 0%
On-target 60%
Maximum 100%
Stretching performance 
targets are set each year, 
reflecting the business 
priorities that underpin 
Group strategy.
Ordinarily, up to 60% will be 
subject to achievement of 
a combination of financial 
and corporate measures 
and the balance will be 
based on challenging 
personal objectives. 
The Committee retains 
discretion to apply 
different weightings in 
relevant circumstances. 
Long Term Incentive 
Plan (“LTIP”)
To reflect stakeholder 
philosophy, provide a 
longer-term retention 
mechanism and provide 
alignment with 
shareholders.
The Committee intends to make long-term 
incentive awards under the 2015 LTIP scheme 
as approved at the 2015 AGM.
Under the LTIP, awards of conditional shares, 
restricted stock or nil-cost options (or similar cash 
equivalent) can be made with vesting dependent 
on the achievement of performance conditions, 
normally, over a three-year performance period.
Under the LTIP , there will be no retesting of performance 
following the end of the performance period.
After the end of the performance period the 
vested awards would normally be subject to a 
two-year holding period.
LTIP awards may incorporate the right to receive 
(in cash or shares) the value of the dividends that 
would have been paid on the shares that vest. 
The maximum value of shares over 
which an individual can be granted 
an award in respect of a financial 
year is normally 100% of base salary, 
although this limit may be increased 
to 250% of base salary in exceptional 
circumstances.
25% of awards will vest for threshold 
levels of performance, rising to 100% 
for maximum performance.
The vesting of LTIP awards 
is subject to the satisfaction 
of performance targets set 
by the Committee.
The performance measures 
are reviewed regularly to 
ensure they remain relevant 
but will be based on financial 
measures (which may 
include, but are not limited 
to, Group revenue targets 
and EPS) and/or share 
price related measures.
The relevant metrics and the 
respective weightings may 
vary each year based on 
Company strategic priorities.
Shareholding 
requirement
To align Directors to 
shareholder interests.
A requirement to build up over a five-year period 
and hold a shareholding of at least 200% of base 
salary for the CEO and 100% of base salary for 
other Executive Directors.
50% of vested shares under the DBP or LTIP 
(post-tax) are to be retained until the shareholding 
requirement has been met.

Under the DBP, during the two-year deferral period, the Committee has the right to reduce any deferred bonus awards which have 
not yet been released in the event of a material misstatement of the Group’s financial results, material misconduct on the part of the 
participant or a material failure of risk management by the Group (i.e. a malus provision). For up to two years following the payment 
of a cash bonus award, the Committee may also require the repayment of some or all of the award in these circumstances 
(i.e. a clawback provision).
Under the 2015 LTIP scheme, at any time prior to the end of the holding period for LTIP awards the Committee in its discretion may reduce, 
cancel or impose further conditions on LTIP awards which have not yet been released in the event of a material misstatement of the 
Group’s financial results, material misconduct on the part of the participant or a material failure of risk management by the Group.

Explanation of performance measures chosen
Selected performance measures for the annual bonus and LTIP awards reflect the Group’s strategy. Stretching performance targets 
are set each year by the Committee taking into account a number of different factors.
Annual bonus
Up to 60% of the potential maximum annual bonus will be subject to achievement of a combination of financial and corporate 
measures, whilst the balance will be based on challenging personal objectives. The Committee will disclose the metrics and 
performance against these on a retrospective basis to the extent that these are not commercially sensitive.
LTIP
The Company has historically used commercial revenue targets as its primary measure for LTIP awards for Executive Directors. 
Recognising that the Company’s transition from a research and development company to a commercial, product-driven organisation 
presents a number of challenges to defining meaningful and appropriate performance metrics and targets. The awards granted 
under the LTIP will be a combination of share price growth for 50% of the award; and Group revenue targets for 50% of the award. Both 
of these metrics will be subject to a performance underpin to ensure that the share price and revenue metrics for the LTIP do not lead 
to behaviours that are divergent from the core commercialisation strategy and that appropriate developments are made in all areas 
of the business. It is the Committee’s view these are the most appropriate performance measures for determining LTIP vesting for the 
awards on the basis that:
 •
share price growth is a key measure of value delivered to shareholders and should reflect the achievement of commercial milestones. 
This ensures that this element only vests where significant value is delivered to shareholders;
 •
Group revenue is a core metric for measuring the successful growth of the Group and development of new commercial products; and 
 •
the performance underpin ensures that the share price and revenue metrics for the LTIP do not lead to behaviours that are divergent 
from the core commercialisation strategy and that appropriate development is made in all areas of the business.
The Committee intends to review the performance metrics for future awards taking into account the business priorities and strategy. 
Whilst it is recognised that EPS is not an appropriate metric for the awards given the current negative earnings of the Group, as the 
Group moves towards positive EPS, it may be considered an appropriate metric once the Group has developed a history of earnings.
The Committee also retains the discretion to adjust or set different performance measures or targets where it considers it appropriate 
to do so (for example, to reflect a change in strategy, a material acquisition and/or a divestment of a Group business or a change in 
prevailing market conditions) and to assess performance on a fair and consistent basis from year to year.
Operation of the LTIP and DBP
The LTIP and DBP are operated by the Committee in accordance with their respective rules, including the ability to adjust the number 
of shares subject to awards in the event of a variation of share capital, demerger, delisting, special dividend, rights issue or other event 
which may, in the opinion of the Company, affect the current or future value of shares.
Early vesting of awards
As described on page 48, awards under the DBP and LTIP may vest earlier than anticipated in “good leaver” circumstances.
On a change of control of the Company or other relevant corporate event (such as a demerger, delisting, special dividend or other 
event which may affect the value of an award), the extent to which unvested awards will vest will be determined in accordance with 
the rules of the relevant plan.
Awards under the DBP will vest in full in the event of a takeover, merger or other relevant corporate event.
Awards under the LTIP will vest early on a takeover, merger or other relevant corporate event. The Committee will determine the level 
of vesting taking into account the extent to which the performance conditions are satisfied. Such vesting would ordinarily be on a time 
pro-rata basis, although the Committee has discretion not to apply time pro-rating.
How the Executive Directors’ remuneration policy relates to the Group
The remuneration policy summarised above provides an overview of the structure that operates for the Executive Directors. The same 
broad structure also operates for the members of the senior management team, although with lower levels of participation in the 
annual bonus, DBP and/or the LTIP. For other employees, the same remuneration principles are applied and the Company aims to 
provide a remuneration package that is competitive in an employee’s country of employment and which is appropriate to promote 
the long-term success of the Group. 46

Remuneration policy for Non-executive Directors
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Other items
To enable the Company 
to attract and retain 
Non-executive Directors 
of the required calibre 
by offering market-
competitive rates.
The Chairman’s fee is determined by the Committee 
and the fees of the other Non-executive Directors are 
determined by the Board.
Fees are set taking into account several factors, including 
the size and complexity of the business, fees paid to 
chairmen and non-executive directors of companies 
of a similar size and complexity and the expected time 
commitment and contribution for the role.
Overall fees paid to Non-executive Directors will remain 
within the limits set by the Company’s Articles of Association.
Non-executive Directors are provided with 
directors’ and officers’ insurance and indemnity 
protection and may be eligible to be reimbursed 
any reasonable hotel and travelling expenses 
and other reasonable expenses incurred in 
the performance of their duties.
The Non-executive Directors do not 
participate in the Company’s annual bonus, 
share plans or pension schemes.
Remuneration policy on recruitment
When hiring a new Executive Director, the Committee will seek to align the remuneration package with the above policy.
When determining appropriate remuneration arrangements, the Committee may include other elements of pay which it considers are 
appropriate and necessary to recruit and retain the individual. However, this discretion is capped and is subject to the limits referred 
to below:
 •
base salary will be set at a level appropriate to the role and the experience of the Director being appointed. This may include 
agreement on future increases up to a market rate, in line with increased experience and/or responsibilities, subject to good 
performance, where it is considered appropriate;
 •
benefits will only be provided in line with the above policy;
 •
pension contributions will only be provided in line with the above policy;
 •
the Committee will not offer non-performance related incentive payments (for example a “guaranteed sign-on bonus” or “golden hello”);
 •
other elements may be included in the following circumstances:
 •
an interim appointment being made to fill an Executive Director role on a short-term basis;
 •
if exceptional circumstances require that the Chairman or a Non-executive Director takes on an Executive function on a short-term basis;
 •
if an Executive Director is recruited at a time in the year when it would be inappropriate to provide a bonus or long-term incentive 
award for that year as there would not be sufficient time to assess performance. Subject to the limit on variable remuneration set 
out below, the quantum in respect of the months employed during the year may be transferred to the subsequent year so that 
reward is provided on a fair and appropriate basis; and
 •
if the Director will be required to relocate in order to take up the position, it is the Company’s policy to allow reasonable relocation, 
travel and subsistence payments. Any such payments will be at the discretion of the Committee;
 •
the Committee may also alter the performance measures, performance period and vesting period of the annual bonus or LTIP, 
if the Committee determines that the circumstances of the recruitment merit such alteration. The rationale of any such alterations 
will be clearly explained in the next Directors’ remuneration report; and
 •
the maximum level of variable remuneration which may be granted (excluding “buyout” awards as referred to below) is 350% 
of salary, in line with the policy set out on pages 43 to 47.
The Committee may make payments or awards in respect of hiring an employee to “buy out” remuneration arrangements forfeited on 
leaving a previous employer. In doing so, the Committee will take account of relevant factors, including any performance conditions 
attached to the forfeited arrangements and the time over which they would have vested or been paid. The Committee will generally 
seek to structure buyout awards or payments on a comparable basis to the remuneration arrangements forfeited. Any such payments 
or awards are excluded from the maximum level of variable remuneration referred to above. “Buyout” awards will ordinarily be granted 
on the basis that they are subject to forfeiture or “clawback” in the event of departure within twelve months of joining the Company, 
although the Committee will retain discretion not to apply forfeiture or clawback in appropriate circumstances.
Any share awards referred to in this section will be granted as far as possible under the Company’s existing share plans. If necessary, 
and subject to the limits referred to above, recruitment awards may be granted outside of these plans.
Where a position is filled internally, any ongoing remuneration obligations or outstanding variable pay elements shall be allowed 
to continue in accordance with their terms.
Fees payable to a newly appointed Chairman or Non-executive Director will be in line with the policy in place at the time of appointment. 48
Corporate governance
External appointments
The Company recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that 
this can help broaden the skills and experience of a Director. Subject to the approval of the Board, Executive Directors are normally 
permitted to accept external appointments and may retain fees for such appointments where no significant actual or potential 
conflict of interest arises and provided that the Director is able to maintain his time commitment to the Company.
None of the Executive Directors currently have an external appointment.
Payment for loss of office
The principles on which the determination of payments for loss of office will be approached are set out below:
Policy
Payment in lieu of notice The Company has discretion to make a payment in lieu of notice. Such a payment would include base 
salary and compensation for benefits for the unexpired period of notice, up to a maximum of twelve 
months’ notice. 
Annual bonus This will be at the discretion of the Committee on an individual basis and the decision as to whether or not 
to award an annual bonus award in full or in part will be dependent on a number of factors, including the 
circumstances of the individual’s departure and their contribution to the business during the annual bonus 
period in question. Any annual bonus award amounts paid will normally be pro-rated for time in service 
during the annual bonus period and will, subject to performance, be paid at the usual time (although the 
Committee retains discretion to pay the annual bonus award earlier in appropriate circumstances). 
Any such bonus can, at the discretion of the Committee, be paid wholly in cash.
DBP The extent to which any unvested award will vest will be determined in accordance with the rules of the DBP.
Unvested awards will normally lapse on cessation of employment. However, if a participant leaves due to 
death, ill health, injury, disability, the sale of his employer or any other reason at the discretion of the 
Committee, the Committee shall determine whether any unvested award will vest at cessation or at the 
normal vesting date. In either case, the extent of vesting will be determined by the Committee, taking into 
account, unless the Committee determines otherwise, the period of time elapsed from the date of grant to 
the date of cessation relative to the deferral period. Awards may then be exercised during such period as 
the Committee determines.
Awards (in the form of nil-cost options) which have vested but remain unexercised at the date of cessation 
may be exercised if a participant leaves due to death, ill health, injury, disability, the sale of his employer or 
any other reason at the discretion of the Committee. Awards may then be exercised for such period as the 
Committee determines. 
LTIP The extent to which any unvested award will vest will be determined in accordance with the rules of the LTIP.
Unvested awards will normally lapse on cessation of employment. However, if a participant leaves due 
to death, ill health, injury, disability, the sale of his employer or any other reason at the discretion of the 
Committee, the Committee shall determine whether the award is released on the normal release date or 
the date of cessation (or on some other date). In any case, the extent of vesting will be determined by the 
Committee taking into account the extent to which the performance condition is satisfied and, unless the 
Committee determines otherwise, the period of time elapsed from the date of grant to the date of cessation 
relative to the performance period. Awards may then be exercised during such period as the 
Committee determines.
If a participant leaves for any reason (other than summary dismissal) after an award has vested but before 
it has been released (i.e. during the holding period), his award will ordinarily continue to the normal release 
date when it will be released to the extent it vested. The Committee retains discretion to release awards 
when the participant leaves. If the participant is summarily dismissed, his award will lapse. Awards (in the 
form of nil-cost options) which have vested and been released but remain unexercised at the date of 
cessation may be exercised if a participant leaves due to death, ill health, injury, disability, the sale of his 
employer or any other reason at the discretion of the Committee. Awards may then be exercised for such 
period as the Committee determines. 
Other payments In appropriate circumstances, payments may also be made in respect of accrued holiday, outplacement 
and legal fees.
Where a buyout award is made, the leaver provisions would be determined at the time of the award.
The Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge 
of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation) or by way of settlement or compromise 
of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a Director’s office or employment.
Where the Committee retains discretion it will be used to provide flexibility in certain situations, taking into account the particular 
circumstances of the Director’s departure and performance.
There is no entitlement to any compensation in the event of Non-executive Directors’ fixed-term agreements not being renewed 
or the agreement terminating earlier.

Nanoco Group plc – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Consideration of employees’ pay
The Committee generally considers pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Company when considering the Directors’ 
remuneration. When considering base salary increases, the Committee reviews overall levels of base pay increases offered to other 
employees. Employees are not actively consulted on Directors’ remuneration. Employee share ownership is fundamental to the 
Company’s culture and is reflected in the wide participation in our share incentive plans.
Existing contractual arrangements
The Committee retains discretion to make any remuneration payment or payment for loss of office outside the policy in this report:
 •
where the terms of the payment were agreed before the policy came into effect;
 •
where the terms of the payment were agreed at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the 
opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration of the individual becoming a Director of the Company; and
 •
to satisfy contractual commitments under legacy remuneration arrangements (including the jointly owned EBT share scheme for 
senior management under which the trustee of the Group-sponsored EBT has acquired shares in the Company jointly with a number 
of employees, the Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan adopted in 2009, and any other share plan in place prior to admission).
For these purposes, “payments” includes the satisfaction of awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, 
the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
Consultation with shareholders
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received on remuneration matters, as well as any additional comments received 
during any other meetings with shareholders. Major shareholders were consulted on the introduction of the new DBP and LTIP which 
shareholders approved at the 2015 AGM and the Committee intends to consult with shareholders in respect of any significant changes 
to the Executive Directors’ remuneration arrangements.
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
This report sets out details of the amounts earned during 2017 and provides details as to how the Committee intends to implement the 
policy during 2018. This part of the report will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM. This report contains 
unaudited information except where stated that it is audited.
Remuneration Committee
The Committee comprises Brendan Cummins, who is Chairman of the Committee, and Dr Alison Fielding, each of whom is considered 
to be independent. Dr Alison Fielding and Brendan Cummins joined the Committee during the year. Gordon Hall (Chairman) and Robin 
Williams were members of the Committee until their resignations. The Committee may invite anyone it deems appropriate to attend 
and advise at meetings, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, although no Director is present when his 
own remuneration is being discussed. The Committee is responsible for establishing a formal and transparent procedure for developing 
policy on executive remuneration and for setting the remuneration of the Directors and certain senior management, as well as 
reviewing the performance of the Executive Directors of the Company.
The Committee met four times during the year, its meetings are minuted and its recommendations are presented to the Board.
Policy on other appointments
The Board believes that Directors should be able to accept other appointments where no significant actual or potential conflicts of 
interest arise and provided that the Director is able to maintain his time commitment to the Company. These other appointments enable 
Directors to accrue further skills and experience from which the Company benefits. This policy is reviewed annually. None of the 
Executive Directors currently have any other external appointments.
Advisers to the Committee
The Chief Executive Officer is consulted on the remuneration of those who report directly to him and also of other senior executives. 
No Executive Director or employee is present or takes part in discussions in respect of matters relating directly to their own remuneration. 
During the year, the Committee was assisted in its work by the following external consultants:

Additional disclosures in relation to single figure table (audited information)
The figures in the single figure table above are derived from the following:
(a) Salary and fees The amount of salary/fees received in the year. A salary sacrifice arrangement is operated under which 
executives may elect to sacrifice salary and the Company pays an amount equal to the amount of the 
salary sacrifice, together with the employer National Insurance saved, into a private pension scheme. 
Directors’ salaries are shown before the salary sacrifice pension contributions. 
(b) Benefits The taxable value of benefits received in the year. 
(c) Bonus The cash value of the bonuses and the market value of awards to be made under the DBP earned in respect 
of the financial year. Further information in relation to the 2017 bonus is provided on pages 51 to 53.
(d) Long-term incentives None. 
(e) Pension The pension figure represents the cash value of Company pension contributions and/or cash in lieu 
of pension contributions paid to the Executive Directors. This does not include the amount of the salary 
sacrifice paid as a pension but does include the employer National Insurance saved that is paid into 
a private pension scheme.
Individual elements of remuneration for the year ended 31 July 2017
Base salary
As referred to in the 2016 Directors’ remuneration report our Executive Directors’ salaries for the year ended 31 July 2017 were $400,744 
in the case of our Chief Executive Officer, £172,559 in the case of our Chief Technology Officer, £192,860 for our Chief Operating Officer 
and £180,900 for our Chief Financial Officer.
Annual bonus
For the year ended 31 July 2017, the maximum bonus for Dr Michael Edelman, Dr Nigel Pickett, Keith Wiggins and David Blain was 
100% of salary. The annual bonuses comprise two elements: achievement of financial and corporate measures (60% of salary) and 
achievement of personal objectives (40% of salary). The Remuneration Committee determined that 0% of salary should be awarded 
as a bonus for each Director in relation to achievement of corporate objectives (compared to a maximum of 60%). The Remuneration 
Committee also determined that each Director should not receive a bonus regardless of performance in relation to personal 
objectives due to failure to achieve corporate targets and affordability. 
The financial and corporate measures and their weighting as a percentage of salary for the year ended 31 July 2017 were:

Given the Group is entering a new stage in its development, the Directors consider that the Group revenue targets are matters which 
are commercially sensitive; they provide our competitors with insight into our business plans and expectations and should therefore 
remain confidential to the Group. However, in order to maintain transparency, the Committee will disclose the Group revenue targets 
and how the Group has performed against the targets set following the end of the performance period.
A core strategy of the business is to continue the Lighting and Bio-imaging developments with a long-term aim of transforming them into 
profitable businesses shipping commercial quantities of product. Under the performance underpin if the Committee is not satisfied 
that appropriate progress has been made across the business it will have the discretion to cancel all or some of the LTIP award.

Statement of Directors’ shareholding and share interests (audited information) continued
In order to align the interests of Executive Directors with those of shareholders and to demonstrate the Executive Directors’ ongoing 
personal financial commitment to the business, Executive Directors will be expected to build up a shareholding of 100% of salary (200% 
of salary for the CEO). Executive Directors are expected to retain 50% of any post-tax shares that vest under any share incentive plans 
until this shareholding is reached. The Committee expects Executive Directors to have met the shareholding guideline policy by the 
fifth anniversary of their appointment as an Executive Director.
Both Dr Michael Edelman and Dr Nigel Pickett hold shares substantially in excess of the shareholding guideline (607% and 2,378% 
of salary respectively using the three-month average closing share price to the end of July 2017). 
Non-executive Directors are not subject to the shareholding requirement.

employee share plan adopted by the Company. Including only option grants post-admission to AIM and excluding any awards that 
have lapsed, the current dilution is 6.85%.

Historical comparative TSR performance graph
The performance graph below shows the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) against the FTSE SmallCap over the period from 
1 August 2010 to 31 July 2017. In the opinion of the Board, the FTSE SmallCap is the most appropriate index against which the TSR of the 
Company should be measured because it represents a broad equity market index of which the Company is a constituent member.

Pension
The Company operates a salary sacrifice pension arrangement. For the year commencing 1 August 2017, employer pension 
contributions above the amount of any salary sacrifice (and the associated employer National Insurance contributions savings) 
will be capped at 5% of salary.
Annual bonus
For the year ending 31 July 2018, the maximum annual bonus potential will be 100% of base salary for Executive Directors. 50% 
of any such bonus earned will be paid in cash, whilst the remainder is paid as deferred shares under the DBP vesting after two years, 
in accordance with the policy adopted at the 2015 AGM. This reflects our stakeholder philosophy, provides a longer-term retention 
mechanism and provides alignment with shareholders.
Consistent with the 2017 annual bonus, performance will be assessed on the basis of a balanced scorecard approach in respect 
of performance measures; however, the emphasis on achievement of corporate goals is changed compared to 2017. Up to 80% of 
the potential maximum annual bonus will be subject to achievement of a combination of financial and corporate measures, whilst 
the remaining 20% will be based on challenging personal objectives. The financial/corporate measures for FY18 will include annual 
revenue and EBITDA weighted at 60% and 20% of potential maximum annual bonus respectively. The Committee will disclose the 
metrics and performance against these on a retrospective basis to the extent that these are not commercially sensitive.
Clawback will apply to any cash bonus paid and malus provisions to any unvested deferred bonus award. 58

Additional information for shareholders
With regard to the appointment and replacement of Directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of Association, the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2016, the Companies Act 2006 and related legislation.
The Articles themselves may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders. The Articles provide that Directors may be 
appointed by an ordinary resolution of the Company’s members or by a resolution of the Directors, provided that, in the latter 
instance, a Director appointed in this way retires and stands for election at the first Annual General Meeting following his appointment.
The Articles also provide that at every Annual General Meeting at least one-third of the Directors retire by rotation and set out the 
circumstances in which and how they may be re-elected. The Company’s members may remove a Director by passing an ordinary 
resolution of which special notice has been given. The office of a Director shall be vacated in any of the following events: (a) if (but in 
the case of a Director holding any executive office subject to the terms of any contract of service between him and the Company) 
notification in writing, signed by the Director or otherwise authenticated in such manner as the other Directors may accept, is received 
by the Company from the Director that he is resigning or retiring from office as a Director, and such resignation or retirement has taken 
effect in accordance with its terms, or if he shall in writing offer to resign or retire and the Directors shall resolve to accept such offer; 
(b) if he becomes bankrupt or has a receiving order made against him or makes any arrangement or composition with his creditors 
generally in satisfaction of his debts or shall apply to the court for an interim order under section 253 of the Insolvency Act 1986; (c) if 
a registered medical practitioner who is treating the Director gives a written opinion to the Company stating that he has become physically 
or mentally incapable of acting as a Director and may remain so for more than three months; (d) if he is absent from meetings of the 
Directors for six successive months without leave, and his alternate Director (if any) shall not during such period have attended in his 
stead, and the Directors resolve that his office be vacated; (e) if he shall be removed from office by notice in writing served upon him 
signed by all his co-Directors, but so that if he holds an appointment to an executive office which automatically determines as a 
result, such removal shall be deemed an act of the Company and shall have effect without prejudice to any claim for damages for 
breach of any contract of service between him and the Company; or (f) if he ceases to be a Director by virtue of any provision of the 
Companies Act or becomes prohibited by law from being a Director.
The powers of the Directors are determined by applicable legislation and the Company’s Articles of Association. As provided in those 
Articles, the Directors may exercise all the Company’s powers provided that the Articles or applicable legislation do not stipulate that 
any such powers must be exercised by the Company’s members. The Directors have been authorised to issue and allot ordinary shares, 
pursuant to the Articles and have authority to make market purchases of shares. These powers are referred to shareholders at each 
Annual General Meeting for renewal. Any shares purchased may be cancelled or held as treasury shares.

Corporate governance
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the Group financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare Group financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law, the 
Directors are required to prepare Group 
financial statements under IFRS as 
adopted by the European Union.
Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the Group financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and of the profit or loss of the 
Group for that period. In preparing the 
Group financial statements the Directors 
are required to:
 •
present fairly the financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows of the Group;
 •
select suitable accounting policies 
in accordance with IAS 8: Accounting 
Policies, Changes in Accounting 
Estimates and Errors and then apply 
them consistently;
 •
present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information;
 •
make judgements that are reasonable;
 •
provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific requirements 
in IFRS as adopted by the European Union 
is insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the Group’s 
financial position and financial 
performance; and
 •
state whether the Group financial 
statements have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Group’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the Group financial 
statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for 
preparing the Directors’ report, the 
Directors’ remuneration report and the 
corporate governance statement in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 
and applicable regulations, including the 
requirements of the Listing Rules and the 
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.
The financial statements for the year 
ended 31 July 2017 are included in the 2017 
Annual Report, which is published by the 
Company in hardcopy printed form and 
available to download on the Group’s 
website on the internet. The maintenance 
and integrity of the Nanoco website is 
the responsibility of the Directors; the work 
carried out by the auditor does not involve 
consideration of these matters and, 
accordingly, the auditor accepts no 
responsibility for any changes that may 
have occurred to the financial statements 
since they were initially presented on the 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ remuneration
The Directors’ remuneration report on 
pages 43 to 59 sets out the remuneration 
policies operated by the Company and 
disclosures on Directors’ remuneration and 
other disclosable information relating to 
Directors and officers and their interests.
Internal control
The Board, through the Audit Committee, 
has reviewed the assessment of risks 
and the internal control framework that 
Nanoco operates and has considered the 
effectiveness of the system of internal control 
in operation in the Group for the year covered 
by this report and up to the date of its 
approval by the Board of Directors. The 
Board has concluded that, given the size 
of the organisation, appropriate controls 
have been established and complied with.
The UK Corporate Governance Code
The Board considers that the Company 
applies the principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code of the Financial Reporting 
Council, as described under “Corporate 
governance” on pages 34 to 36 and has 
complied with all relevant principles and 
provisions of the Code. We did not comply 
with the requirement in E.2.4 to give 14 clear 
working days’ notice of the general meeting 
we held on 14 November 2017. The reason for 
the non-compliance was the desire to 
conclude the meeting as early as possible as 
completion of the fundraising had a direct 
impact on the publication of the Company’s 
preliminary results announcement and its 
report and accounts for the year ended 
31 July 2017 as the proceeds of the fundraising 
were relevant in assessing the going concern 
status of the Company. The Directors strongly 
believed that it was in the best interests of 
the Company for the going concern status 
of the Company to be secured prior to the 
publication of the Company’s preliminary 
results announcement and its report and 
accounts for the year ended 31 July 2017, 
which were required to be published by 
30 November 2017. As required by the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, 
the auditor has considered the Directors’ 
statement of compliance in relation to 
those points of the Code which are 
specified for their review.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report 
and financial statements, taken as a whole, 
are fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
and the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy.
Auditor
Each of the persons who is a Director at 
the date of approval of this Annual Report 
confirms that:
 •
so far as the Director is aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which 
the Group’s auditor is unaware; and
 •
the Director has taken all the steps 
that he or she ought to have taken as a 
Director in order to make himself or herself 
aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Group’s auditor 
is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be 
interpreted in accordance with the 
provisions of section 418 of the Companies 
Act 2006.
Ernst & Young LLP has expressed its 
willingness to continue in office as auditor 
and a resolution to re-appoint them will be 
proposed at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting.
Directors’ responsibility statement
In accordance with the FCA’s Disclosure 
Guidance and Transparency Rules, the 
Directors listed on pages 32 and 33 confirm, 
to the best of their knowledge, that:
1.  the financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the European Union and 
give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit 
or loss of the Group and Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
2.  the management report, which is 
incorporated into the Directors’ report, 
includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business 
and the position of the Group and 
the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties faced by the Group.
Annual Report
The Annual Report for the year ended 
31 July 2017, comprising the Strategic report, 
the Directors’ remuneration report, the 
Directors’ report, the financial statements 
and additional information for investors, has

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the annual report, in relation to which the ISAs(UK) require us to 
report to you whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to:
 •
the disclosures in the annual report set out on pages 18 and 19 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated;
 •

principal risks facing the entity, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
 •
the directors’ statement set out on page 21 in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the entity’s ability 
to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;
 •
whether the directors’ statement in relation to going concern required under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) 
is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or 
 •
the directors’ explanation set out on pages 20 and 21 in the annual report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the entity, 
over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they

Financial statements
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. 
These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements 
as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations 
communicated to the 
Audit Committee 
Revenue recognition - occurrence of revenue 
under supply and licence agreements (royalties 
and licence revenue £615,000 and products sold 
£470,000) (2016: £156,000 and £204,000)
Refer to the Audit Committee report (page 38); 
accounting policies (page 76); and note 4 of the 
Consolidated financial statements (page 82).
All revenue streams are susceptible to manipulation by 
management in order to improve reported performance 
or success.
Supply and licence agreements with partners can be 
significant in delivering the Group’s revenue during its 
pre-commercialisation phase. There is a risk of inappropriate 
revenue recognition if the treatment of payments received 
does not reflect the substance of each agreement. 
Inappropriate judgements applied by management could 
result in material misstatement in the income statement. 
In the prior year the risk relating to the occurrence of 
revenue did not include revenue from products sold as 
there had been no sales of materials under the new 
supply and license agreements and the amount of 
revenue from other sources was not material. 
We understood and assessed the design and implementation 
of the key controls around the revenue recognition process. 
We did not seek to obtain reliance on the control framework.
We agreed invoiced amounts to contract terms and receipt of 
payment and, as applicable, to evidence supporting shipment or the 
achievement of any performance obligations under the contracts, 
notably the transfer of technology and sharing of intellectual property. 
We focused on evaluating whether the allocation of revenues 
between the different components of the supply and license 
agreements reflected the substance of the agreement in 
accordance with IAS 18. The value of revenue recognised would 
be different if the components were deemed to be economically 
linked and thus the attributed amounts per the contract would 
require re-allocation in order to reflect appropriately the fair value 
consideration for services rendered or goods delivered. We compared 
the terms of different contracts, made inquiries of management, 
compared to other revenues derived from similar sources pre and 
post-year end, and evaluated the differences in licence fees, 
royalties and prices of materials under those contracts. Based on 
these procedures, we concluded that royalties and the pricing of 
materials supplied under the agreements were not economically 
linked to the upfront licence fee and that the recognition of 
revenue in the period was appropriate.
We tested adjustments recorded in revenue, such as releases 
of deferred licence revenue, for evidence of management bias or 
override of controls.
There were no new licence agreements in the current year. We read 
minutes of Board meetings and other committee meetings for 
evidence of changes in contractual terms in existing agreements.
Based on the procedures 
performed, we did not 
identify any evidence of 
material misstatement in 
the revenue recognised in 
the year.
Going concern
Refer to the Strategic report (page 21); Audit Committee 
report (page 38); Statement of financial position (page 73); 
and accounting policies (page 75). 
At 31 July 2017 the Group had cash, cash equivalents and 
short-term investments and cash on deposit of £5.7 million 
(2016: £14.5 million) and incurred an operating loss of 
£10.9 million (2016: £12.8 million).
The Strategic Report on pages 18 and 19 identifies 
the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties. Judgement 
is required by the directors in assessing whether any 
material uncertainties exist which cast significant 
doubt as to the Group’s ability to meet its liabilities 
and whether the mitigating actions identified by 
management are achievable.
Judgement is also required in assessing whether the 
disclosures provided in the financial statements adequately 
describe the risks and underlying assumptions.
This risk is consistent with the previous year.
We understood and assessed the design and implementation of the 
key controls around management’s assessment of the going concern 
basis. We did not seek to obtain reliance on the control framework.
We obtained and reviewed the going concern assessment prepared 
by management including financial forecasts. We tested the financial 
forecasts to ensure integrity of the model, that they reflected an 
accurate starting position and that they were consistent with the 
budget that had been approved by the directors. 
We tested the sensitised forecasts prepared by management in 
which there were no revenues during the forecast period and which 
incorporated the proceeds of the placing which was completed 
prior to the approval of the financial statements. We evaluated the 
headroom under these sensitised forecasts which formed the basis 
of management’s conclusions regarding going concern, and also 
ran further sensitivities in relation to the cost base to test the impact 
of changes in certain forecast costs on the going concern assumption.
We inspected the approval of the placing by the shareholders and 
tested the proceeds to subscription agreements or to the Company’s 
bank statements.
We compared the costs reported in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income with those that had been budgeted by 
management to evaluate the accuracy of previous financial forecasts 
and management’s ability to control the Company’s cost base.
We read board minutes and the Company’s risk register 
for inconsistencies with the risks considered in the going 
concern assessment.
We read the disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts to 
confirm that they were consistent with our understanding of the 
going concern assessment that had been undertaken by the 
directors and that they appropriately reflected the risks and 
mitigating actions that had been considered.
We concluded that 
we concurred with 
management’s view 
that it is appropriate to 
adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial 
statements.
We concluded that 
adequate disclosure has 
been provided in the 
financial statements.

Key audit matters continued
Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations 
communicated to the 
Audit Committee 
Carrying value of intellectual property 
(£2,619,000; 2016: £2,423,000), tangible fixed 
assets (£865,000; 2016: £1,260,000) and assets 
held for sale (£535,000; 2016: £nil)
Refer to the accounting policies (page 79); note 11 (page 
86); note 12 (page 86) and note 13 (page 87).
At 31 July 2017 the carrying value of the Group’s non-current 
assets, excluding assets held for sale, was £3.5 million 
(2016: £3.7 million). The Group’s operating loss for the year 
then ended was £10.9 million (2016: £12.8 million). There is a 
risk that the carrying value of the Group’s non-current 
assets might not be recoverable.
In the year ended 31 July 2017 the Company recorded an 
impairment loss of £77,000 in respect of intangible fixed 
assets and has presented assets with a carrying value 
of £535,000 at 31 July 2017 as assets held for sale.
Any inappropriate judgements in measuring the recoverable 
amount of the non-current assets and assets held for sale 
could result in a material misstatement in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income and in the statement 
of financial position.
This risk area is consistent with the prior year except 
that it also now includes assets held for sale of £535,000 
(2016: £nil).
We understood and assessed the design and implementation of the 
key controls around management’s assessment of the carrying value 
of intellectual property and tangible fixed assets. We did not seek to 
obtain reliance on the control framework.
We tested the completeness of management’s impairment review 
by reading Board minutes and minutes of other committee meetings, 
making inquiries of management regarding the registration and 
protection of patents and checking for consistency with other 
judgements such as going concern and capitalisation of development 
costs and our understanding of the Company’s licence agreements.
We made inquiries of management to understand the process by 
which patents that were of no value to the Company and which 
should be allowed to lapse were identified.
We obtained the financial forecasts prepared by management and 
tested the integrity of the forecasts, consistency with the budget 
approved by management and those forecasts used in the going 
concern assessment and that the calculation of recoverable amount 
had been performed in accordance with the accounting framework. 
We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact on the 
recoverable amount of delays in forecast revenues by a year and 
increases in the discount rate applied to forecast cash flows. We also 
assessed the carrying balance if only guaranteed revenues under the 
licence agreements materialised. None of the scenarios that we tested 
resulted in a forecast impairment loss.
We compared the carrying value of non-current assets with the 
market capitalisation of the Company and we evaluated the 
results of the placing that was completed prior to the approval 
of the financial statements.
We made inquiries of management, read board minutes and made 
inquiries of the corporate finance specialists engaged to support 
the disposal of the assets that are presented as assets held for sale 
to evaluate the directors’ commitment to completing the divestment 
and their expectation that proceeds less cost to sell will exceed 
the carrying amount.
We concluded 
that we agreed with 
management’s judgement 
that the carrying value 
of the non-current assets 
and assets held for sale 
at 31 July 2017 were 
not impaired.

Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope 
for each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take 
into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls and changes in the business 
environment when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
The Group’s subsidiaries are described in note 14 to the financial statements. We view the Group as having two components based on 
geographical location, being the UK and US. The Group’s processes and controls are consistent across the Group and lie primarily in 
one location, Manchester, with responsibility being with Group management for the preparation of financial information and for 
judgemental processes and significant risk areas. The US-based subsidiary predominantly provides management and technical 
expertise to the Group. All of our audit procedures were performed by the group audit team.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage 
of significant accounts in the financial statements, we performed full scope audit procedures in respect of the UK component. For the 
US component we performed specific scope audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had 
the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts 
or their risk profile. This was consistent with the approach that we followed in the previous year.
The reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 100% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s operating expenses, 100% 
(2016: 100%) of the Group’s revenue, 100% (2016: 100%) of loss before taxation and 100% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s total assets. For the current 
year, the full scope component contributed 96% (2016: 92%) of the Group’s operating expenses, 100% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s revenue and 
100% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s total assets. The specific scope component contributed 4% (2016: 8%) of the Group’s operating expenses, 0% 
(2016: 0%) of the Group’s revenue and 0% (2016: 0%) of the Group’s total assets. The audit scope of this component may not have included 
testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group. 68

Involvement with component teams 
All audit work performed for the purposes of the audit was undertaken by the group audit team.
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the 
audit and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £216,000 (2016: £236,000), which is 2% (2016: 2%) of operating expenses, which we measured 
using the basis described in the table below. It was considered inappropriate to calculate materiality using Group profit before tax due 
to the loss-making position of the Group. It was also considered inappropriate to use revenue to calculate materiality as revenue reported 
by the Group relates to its pre-commercialisation activities. Operating expenses represent a measure of the rate at which the Group is 
using its cash resources in reaching its strategic objective of commercialising its technology. We therefore considered operating expenses 
to be the most appropriate performance metric on which to base our materiality calculation as we considered that to be the most 
relevant performance measure to the stakeholders of the entity. 
STARTING BASIS
 •
Research and development expenses of £5,508,000 (2016: £5,995,000)
 •
Administrative expenses of £6,784,000 (2016: £7,367,000)
 •
Totals £10,827,000 operating expenses (2016: £11,768,000)
 •
Materiality of £216,000 (2% of operating expenses) (2016: £236,000; 2%)
ADJUS TMENT S

Exclude non-cash items:
 •
Depreciation – decrease basis by £741,000 (2016: £991,000)
 •
Amortisation – decrease basis by £405,000 (2016: £298,000)
 •
Impairment expense – decrease basis by £77,000 (2016: £nil)
 •
Share-based payments – decrease basis by £242,000 (2016: £270,000)
MA TERIALIT Y
Our initial materiality was based on forecast operating expenses. We reassessed initial materiality as actual operating expenses were 
lower than forecast operating expenses.
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level 
the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that 
performance materiality was 50% (2016: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely £108,000 (2016: £177,000). Our objective in adopting this 
approach was to ensure that total uncorrected and undetected audit differences in all accounts did not exceed our materiality level.

Our application of materiality continued
Performance materiality continued
We have reduced the performance materiality from 75% to 50% as a result of audit findings in the previous year in relation to 
deficiencies in the effectiveness of controls designed to prevent or correct material errors in respect of revenue recognition. 
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is 
undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on 
the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. 
In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was £22,000 to £103,000 (2016: £36,000 to £168,000).
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £10,800 (2016: £11,800), which 
is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of 
other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Other information 
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report set out on pages 1 to 64, including the strategic report, 
the corporate governance statement, the Remuneration Committee report, the Directors’ remuneration report, the Audit Committee 
report, the Nomination Committee report, the Directors’ report and the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set out on page 64, 
other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in 
this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears 
to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine 
whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the 
work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following items in the other information 
and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those items meet the following conditions:
 •
Fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 64 – the statement given by the directors that they consider the annual report 
and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit; or 
 •
Audit Committee reporting set out on page 38 – the section describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee; or
 •
Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code set out on page 35 – the parts of the directors’ 
statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a 
departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 •
the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
 •
the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
 •
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 •
the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
 •
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 •
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 70
Financial statements
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 64, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group and parent company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
The objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are: to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements 
due to fraud; to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud, 
through designing and implementing appropriate responses; and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected fraud identified 
during the audit. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with 
governance of the entity and management. 
Our approach was as follows: 
 •
We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the 
most significant are the UK Companies Act 2006, the UK Corporate Governance Code and the UK Listing Rules.
 •
We understood how Nanoco Group plc is complying with those frameworks by the oversight of those charged with governance 
(i.e. considering the potential for override of controls or other inappropriate influence over the financial reporting process, such as 
efforts by management to manage earnings in order to influence the perceptions of analysts as to the entity’s performance and 
profitability), the culture of honesty and ethical behaviour and whether a strong emphasis is placed on fraud prevention, which may 
reduce opportunities for fraud to take place, and fraud deterrence, which could persuade individuals not to commit fraud because 
of the likelihood of detection and punishment.
 •
We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur 
by misreporting of revenue, management’s journal entries or bias in the use of judgements and estimates. 
 •
Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. 
Our procedures involved making enquiries of the Group’s legal advisers, reading the minutes of the Board of Directors and Audit 
Committee, testing manual journal entries and testing estimates for unexpected changes in assumptions.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at https:/ /www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Other matters we are required to address 
 •
We were appointed by management on 13 August 2008 to audit the financial statements of the company for the year ending 
31 July 2008 and subsequent financial periods. Our appointment was subsequently ratified at the annual general meeting of 
the company. 
  The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is 10 years, covering the years 
ending 2008 to 2017. Within this time period, the initial year was prior to the company’s shares being listed.
 •
The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the parent company 
and we remain independent of the Group and the parent company in conducting the audit. 
 •
The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.

Nanoco Group plc – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
1. Reporting entity
Nanoco Group plc (“the Company”), a public company limited by shares, is on the premium list of the London Stock Exchange. 
The Company is incorporated and domiciled in England, UK. The registered number is 05067291 and the address of its registered 
office is 46 Grafton Street, Manchester M13 9NT.
These Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group” 
and individually as “Group entities”) for the year ended 31 July 2017.
The financial statements of Nanoco Group plc and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) for the year ended 31 July 2017 were authorised for 
issue by the Board of Directors on 16 November 2017 and the statements of financial position were signed on the Board’s behalf by 
Dr Michael Edelman.
The Company has elected to take the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present the Parent Company’s 
income statement. 
The significant accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 3.
2. Basis of preparation
(a) Statement of compliance
The Group’s and Parent Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations as they apply to the 
financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 July 2017.
(b) Basis of measurement 
The Parent Company and Group financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. There were no assets or 
liabilities that were measured at fair value at 31 July 2017.
(c) Going concern 
In assessing whether the going concern basis is an appropriate basis for preparing the 2017 Annual Report, the Directors have utilised 
their detailed forecasts for the period to 31 July 2019 which take into account the Group’s current and expected business activities, its 
cash balance of £5.7 million as shown in its balance sheet at 31 July 2017, the cash raised of £8.0 million following shareholder approval 
of the placing on 14 November 2017, the principal risks and uncertainties it faces and other factors impacting its future performance.
The key assumptions underpinning the assessment during the period cover the following areas:
 •
commercialisation of CFQD
®
 products through existing contractual arrangements;
 •
ability to manufacture and supply sufficient CFQD
®
 products to meet partner demand; and
 •
continued investment in research and development.
The principal, plausible downside stress tests in accordance with the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties are:
 •
a significant reduction in projected CFQD
®
 sales volumes due to either a reduction in demand from the Group’s partners or an 
inability to supply; 
 •
lower selling prices and higher manufacturing costs; 
 •
can Wah Hong produce final products that meet our quality standards; 
 •
can Wah Hong generate sufficient demand at attractive price levels to generate sufficient operating margins for the Group and 
achieve targets for future milestone payments;

Various sensitivity analyses have been performed to reflect possible downside scenarios as referred to above. Even in the worst case 
scenario whereby the Group achieves no cash revenues for the twelve months following the date of this Annual Report, the Company 
and the Group have sufficient resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
At the time of approving the financial statements the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the 2017 Annual Report.

2. Basis of preparation continued
(e) Use of estimates and judgements 
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the amounts reported 
for assets and liabilities as at the reporting date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year. The nature of 
estimation means that actual amounts could differ from those estimates. Estimates and judgements used in the preparation of the 
financial statements are continually reviewed and revised as necessary. While every effort is made to ensure that such estimates 
and judgements are reasonable, by their nature they are uncertain and, as such, changes in estimates and judgements may have 
a material impact on the financial statements.
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
Equity-settled share-based payments
The determination of share-based payment costs requires: the selection of an appropriate valuation method; consideration as 
to the inputs necessary for the valuation model chosen; and judgement regarding when and if performance conditions will be met. 
Inputs required for this arise from judgements relating to the future volatility of the share price of Nanoco and comparable companies, 
the Company’s expected dividend yields, risk-free interest rates and expected lives of the options. The Directors draw on a variety of 
sources to aid in the determination of the appropriate data to use in such calculations. The share-based payment expense is most 
sensitive to vesting assumptions (below) and to the future volatility of the future share price factor. Further information is included in 
note 3.
Outlook
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, which have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are 
those relating to the estimation of the number of share options that will ultimately vest (note 22). The Group based its assumptions and 
estimates on parameters available when the consolidated financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions 
about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the 
Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
Impairment of intellectual property and tangible fixed assets
Management judgement is required to determine the carrying value of these assets. As the Group has not, to date, made a profit the 
carrying value of these assets may need to be impaired. During the year an extensive review was undertaken to identify which patents 
are of no further value to Nanoco and should be allowed to lapse. As a consequence, patents with a value of £77,000 (2016: £nil) have 
been fully impaired in these financial statements. Judgements are based on the information available at each reporting date, which 
includes the progress with testing and certification and progress on, for example, establishment of commercial arrangements with 
third parties. Management has adopted the prudent approach of amortising patent registration costs over a ten-year period, which 
is substantially shorter than the life of the patent. For external patents acquired the same rule is adopted unless the remaining life of 
the patent is shorter, in which event the cost of acquisition is amortised over the remaining life of the patent.
Taxation 
Management judgement is required to determine the amount of tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing 
and level of future taxable profits together with an assessment of the effect of future tax planning strategies. Further information 
is included in note 9.
Research and development
Careful judgement by the Directors is applied when deciding whether the recognition requirements for development costs have been 
met. This is necessary as the economic success of any product development is uncertain until such time as technical viability has been 
proven and commercial supply agreements are likely to be achieved. Judgements are based on the information available at each 
reporting date which includes the progress with testing and certification and progress on, for example, establishment of commercial 
arrangements with third parties. In addition, all internal activities related to research and development of new products are 
continuously monitored by the Directors. Further information is included in note 3.
Revenue recognition
Judgements are required as to whether and when contractual milestones have been achieved and in turn the period over which 
development revenue should be recognised. Management judgements are similarly required to determine whether services or rights 
under licence agreements have been delivered so as to enable licence revenue to be recognised. Further information is included in 
note 3.
3. Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below are consistent with those of the previous financial year and are applied consistently by 
Group entities.
(a) Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Nanoco Group plc and the entities it controls (its subsidiaries) 
drawn up to 31 July each year.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to 
direct the relevant activities of the investee), exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and ability to 
use its power over the investee to affect its returns. All Nanoco Group plc’s subsidiaries are 100% owned. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated 
from the date control passes.

Nanoco Group plc – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
3. Significant accounting policies continued
(a) Basis of consolidation continued
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The costs of an acquisition 
are measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, 
plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a 
business combination are initially measured at fair value at acquisition date irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The 
difference between the cost of acquisition of shares in subsidiaries and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is capitalised 
as goodwill and reviewed annually for impairment. Any deficiency in the cost of acquisition below the fair value of identifiable net 
assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is recognised directly in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
In the consolidated financial statements, income and cash flow statement items for Group entities with a functional currency other 
than Sterling are translated into Sterling at monthly average exchange rates, which approximate to the actual rates, for the relevant 
accounting periods.
All intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. 
Subsidiaries’ accounting policies are amended where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
(b) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot rate ruling at the date of 
the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies (including those of the Group’s US subsidiary) are 
retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. All differences are taken to the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as 
at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
(c) Segmental reporting
An operating segment is a component of an entity that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about 
resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. As at 
the reporting date the Company operated with only a single segment, being the research, development and manufacture of products 
and services based on high performance nanoparticles.
(d) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods or services, 
excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes or duties.
The Group’s revenues to date comprise amounts earned under joint development agreements, individual project development 
programmes and material supply and licence agreements and revenue from the sale of quantum dot products.
Revenues received in advance of work performed from development programmes are recognised on a straight-line basis over the 
period that the development work is being performed as measured by contractual milestones. Revenue is not recognised where there 
is uncertainty regarding the achievement of such milestones and where the customer has the right to recoup advance payments.
Contractual payments received from licence agreements are recognised as revenue when goods, services or rights and entitlements 
are supplied. Upfront licence fees, where control over the intellectual property has been retained by the Group, are taken to income 
on a straight-line basis over the initial period of the contract in accordance with the continuing obligations under the contract.
Revenue from the sale of products is recognised at the point of transfer of risks and rewards of ownership, which is generally on 
shipment of product.
(e) Government grants
Government grants are recognised when it is reasonable to expect that the grants will be received and that all related conditions are 
met, usually on submission of a valid claim for payment.
Government grants of a revenue nature are recognised as other operating income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Government grants relating to capital expenditure are deducted in arriving at the carrying amount of the asset.
(f) Cost of sales
Cost of sales comprises the labour, materials and power costs incurred in the generation of revenue from products sold.
Revenue from royalties and licences and revenue from the rendering of services, which comprise payments from customers to gain 
preferential treatment in terms of supply or pricing, do not have an associated cost of sale.
(g) Operating loss
Operating losses are stated after research and development and administration expenses but before finance charges and taxation. 78
Financial statements
3. Significant accounting policies continued
(h) Research and development
Research costs are charged in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as they are incurred. Development costs will 
be capitalised as intangible assets when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. Such intangible assets 
will be amortised on a straight-line basis from the point at which the assets are ready for use over the period of the expected benefit, 
and will be reviewed for impairment at each reporting date based on the circumstances at the reporting date.
The criteria for recognising expenditure as an asset are:
 •
it is technically feasible to complete the product;
 •
management intends to complete the product and use or sell it;
 •
there is an ability to use or sell the product;
 •
it can be demonstrated how the product will generate probable future economic benefits;
 •
adequate technical, financial and other resources are available to complete the development, use and sale of the product; and
 •
expenditure attributable to the product can be reliably measured.
Development costs are currently charged against income as incurred since the criteria for their recognition as an asset are not met, 
the exception being the costs of filing and maintenance of intellectual property as these are considered to generate probable future 
economic benefits and are capitalised as intangible assets (see note 12).
(i) Lease payments
Rentals payable under operating leases, which are leases where the lessor retains a significant proportion of the risks and rewards of 
the underlying asset, are charged in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the expected 
lease term.
Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease.
(j) Finance income and expense
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Interest income is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest 
rate method.
Finance expense comprises interest expense on borrowings. All borrowing costs are recognised using the effective interest method.
(k) Income tax
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current income tax assets (including research and development income tax credit) and liabilities for the current and prior periods are 
measured at the amount expected to be recovered from, or paid to, the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute 
the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the financial statements with the following exceptions:
 •
where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not 
a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss; and
 •
in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis using the tax rates and tax laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and which are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset 
is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
differences can be utilised. An asset is not recognised to the extent that the transfer of economic benefits in the future is uncertain.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits the Group to make 
a single payment.

Nanoco Group plc – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
3. Significant accounting policies continued
(l) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment assets are recognised initially at cost. After initial recognition, these assets are carried at cost less any 
accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of 
any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating 
as intended.
Depreciation is computed by allocating the depreciable amount of an asset on a systematic basis over its useful life and is applied 
separately to each identifiable component.
The following bases and rates are used to depreciate classes of assets:
Laboratory infrastructure – straight line over remainder of lease period (two to ten years)
Fixtures and fittings – straight line over five years
Office equipment – straight line over three years
Plant and machinery – straight line over five years
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount. Useful lives and residual values 
are reviewed annually and where adjustments are required these are made prospectively.
A tangible fixed asset item is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued 
use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the derecognition of the asset is included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income in the period of derecognition.
(m) Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired either as part of a business combination or from contractual or other legal rights are recognised separately 
from goodwill provided they are separable and their fair value can be measured reliably. This includes the costs associated with 
acquiring and registering patents in respect of intellectual property rights.
Where consideration for the purchase of an intangible asset includes contingent consideration, the fair value of the contingent 
consideration is included in the cost of the asset.
Where intangible assets recognised have finite lives, after initial recognition their carrying value is amortised on a straight-line basis 
over those lives. The nature of those intangibles recognised and their estimated useful lives are as follows:
Patents –  straight line over ten years
(n) Impairment of assets
At each reporting date the Group reviews the carrying value of its plant, equipment and intangible assets to determine whether there 
is an indication that these assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for 
an asset is required, the Company makes an assessment of the asset’s recoverable amount.
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and 
is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other 
assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and 
is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, an appropriate valuation model is used and these calculations are corroborated 
by valuation multiples or other available fair value indicators. Impairment losses on continuing operations are recognised in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses 
may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount 
since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable 
amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a valuation increase. After such a 
reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount, less any residual value, 
on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
The carrying values of plant and equipment as at the reporting date have not been subjected to impairment charges.
An impairment loss in the year in respect of intangible fixed assets is described in note 12.  80
Financial statements
3. Significant accounting policies continued
(o) Assets held for sale
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction, 
rather than through continuing use. They are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, which are 
incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of the asset. The carrying value is assessed at each reporting period.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not amortised once classified as held for sale. Assets classified as held for 
sale are presented separately as current assets in the statement of financial position.
(p) Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated in the Company statement of financial position at cost less provision for any impairment.
(q) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost based on latest contractual prices includes all costs incurred 
in bringing each product to its present location and condition. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any further 
costs expected to be incurred to disposal. Provision is made for slow-moving or obsolete items.
(r) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the relevant 
instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be party to such provisions. Such assets and liabilities are classified as current if they 
are expected to be realised or settled within twelve months after the balance sheet date. Financial assets and liabilities are initially 
recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at either fair value or amortised cost including directly attributable transaction costs.
The Group has the following categories of financial assets and liabilities:
Loans and receivables
(i) Trade and other receivables
 Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 60-day terms, are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value 
and recoverable amount. The time value of money is not material.
 Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full. Significant financial 
difficulties faced by the customer, probability that the customer will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default in 
payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. 
The carrying value of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income within administrative expenses.
When a trade receivable is uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
(ii) Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at hand and deposits with maturities of three months or less. Short-term investments 
comprise deposits with maturities of more than three months, but no greater than twelve months.
Financial liabilities at amortised cost
(i) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are non-interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value. They are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
(ii) Loans
Obligations for loans and borrowings are measured initially at fair value and subsequently interest-bearing loans are measured at 
fair value.
(s) Share capital
Proceeds on issue of shares are included in shareholders’ equity, net of transaction costs. The carrying amount is not re-measured in 
subsequent years.
(t) Shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”)
Following the exercise on 2 August 2016 upon which jointly owned shares were transferred to the sole beneficiary, there are no further 
shares held in the EBT.

Nanoco Group plc – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
3. Significant accounting policies continued
(u) Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payment transactions are measured with reference to the fair value at the date of grant, recognised 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Fair value is 
measured using a suitable option pricing model.
At each reporting date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous reporting date is recognised in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, 
the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is 
recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference 
between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the 
modification. No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where awards are granted to the employees of the subsidiary company, the fair value of the awards at grant date is recorded in 
the Company’s financial statements as an increase in the value of the investment with a corresponding increase in equity via the 
share-based payment reserve.
(v) Defined contribution pension scheme
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company 
in an independently administered fund. The amounts charged against profits represent the contributions payable to the scheme in 
respect of the accounting period.
(w) New accounting standards and interpretations
The following amendments to IFRS became mandatory in this reporting period. The Group has applied the following standards and 
amendments for the first time for the reporting period commencing 1 August 2016:
 •
Disclosure initiative – amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements;
 •
Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation – amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and 
IAS 38 Intangible Assets;
 •
Accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations – amendments to IFRS 11; and
 •
Annual improvements to IFRS 2012-2014 cycle.
The adoption of these amendments did not have an impact on the current period or any prior period. 
New standards not yet adopted
The IASB has published three new accounting standards relevant to the Group that will be mandatory in future periods. These 
standards have not been early adopted in these consolidated financial statements. The Group’s initial assessment of the future 
impact of these new standards is as follows:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018)
The new financial instruments standard introduces changing to accounting for credit losses, including related disclosures. The new 
standard also introduces changes to how financial assets are measured on an ongoing basis to align with the asset’s cash flow 
characteristics and the business model in which the asset is held. In addition the Company will be required to measure expected 
losses in respect of balances due from other Group companies.
As the Group does not have any complex financial instruments, this is not expected to impact on reported performance. 82
Financial statements
3. Significant accounting policies continued
(w) New accounting standards and interpretations continued
New standards not yet adopted continued
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018)
The new revenue standard provides a clearer and more detailed five-step model for revenue recognition and disclosure in a 
framework that is designed to improve comparability of revenue amounts over a range of industries, companies and geographical 
boundaries. The standard can significantly change an issuer’s timing of recognition of revenue, among other changes.
Revenue is often not only a key performance measure in its own right, but also a starting point for other performance measures, such 
as operating income, net income and earnings per share; key analytical ratios, such as margins, return on equity and return on assets; 
and valuation metrics, such as revenue multiples and price-to-earnings ratios.
The standard is effective for Nanoco in the year ending 31 July 2019. The new standard provides enhanced detail and a five-step 
revenue recognition approach to reflect the transfer of goods and services to customers. 
IFRS 15 requires the identification of deliverables in contracts with customers that qualify as performance obligations. The transaction 
price receivable from customers must be allocated between the Company’s performance obligations under contracts on a relative 
stand-alone basis. Where goods or services sold together are concluded to be distinct performance obligations, revenue allocated 
to such goods or services is recognised when the control of goods passes to the customer or as the service is delivered. 
Detailed reviews of revenue arrangements are under way and will continue into 2017/18 as we finalise our assessment of the impact 
of the new standard. Key matters arising from the assessment relate to the identification of performance obligations and determining 
when they are satisfied. 
Based on work to date we expect that one contract will be impacted by IFRS 15 in that an upfront licence fee, currently recognised 
over the life of the agreement (seven and a half years) under IAS 18, will be recognised over time, based on the number of units of 
product sold under IFRS 15 thereby deferring revenues and profits recognised under IAS 18 in the early years of the agreement. We 
continue to work on other agreements but we do not expect them to be significantly impacted by the implementation of IFRS 15. 
When IFRS 15 is adopted, it can be applied either on a fully retrospective basis, requiring the restatement of the comparative periods 
presented in the financial statements, or with the cumulative retrospective impact of IFRS 15 applied as an adjustment to equity on the 
date of adoption. When the latter approach is applied it is necessary to disclose the impact of IFRS 15 on each line item in the financial 
statements in the reporting period. A cumulative retrospective approach as modified in accordance with the standard is expected 
to be taken.
IFRS 16 Leases (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019)
The new leases standard changes the previous lease accounting model so a lessee will now reflect more assets and liabilities arising 
from leases on its balance sheet. This can substantially affect key financial ratios, including ratios related to debt covenants or 
debt-to-equity ratios.
The Group expects to recognise certain assets and liabilities (as outlined in note 25) on initial recognition of this standard, although it is 
not expected to have a major impact on the consolidated income statement as the Group only has a limited number of off-balance 
sheet leases classified as operating leases under current lease accounting requirements per IAS 17 Leases.
4. Segmental information
Operating segments
At 31 July 2017 the Group operated as one segment, being the research, development and manufacture of products and services 
based on high performance nanoparticles. This is the level at which operating results are reviewed by the chief operating decision 
maker (i.e. the Chief Executive Officer) to make decisions about resources, and for which financial information is available. All revenues 
have been generated from continuing operations and are from external customers.

12. Intangible assets continued
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over ten years. Amortisation provided during the period is recognised 
in administrative expenses. The Group does not believe that any of its patents in isolation are material to the business. The 
aggregate original cost of intangible assets now fully depreciated but considered to be still in use is £161,000 (2016: £154,000). 
During the year an extensive review was undertaken to identify which patents are of no further value to Nanoco and should be 
allowed to lapse. As a consequence, patents with a value of £77,000 (2016: £nil) have been fully impaired in these financial statements. 
This impairment charge is recognised within administrative expenses.

from the Group’s studies on solar power generation using CIGS (copper indium gallium selenide) materials. The Directors consider that 
these assets will be disposed of within twelve months through a sale transaction. Upon reclassification no re-measurement was 
necessary and therefore there have been no gains or losses recognised. All of the assets are held by the one operating segment.

carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value and that no impairment is required at the reporting 
date. Therefore there is no provision for impairment at the balance sheet date (2016: £nil).

The balances classified as share capital and share premium include the total net proceeds (nominal value and share premium 
respectively) on issue of the Company’s equity share capital, comprising ordinary shares.
The retained loss and other equity balances recognised in the Group financial statements reflect the consolidated retained loss and 
other equity balances of Nanoco Tech Limited immediately before the business combination which was reported in the year ended 
31 July 2009. The consolidated results for the period from 1 August 2008 to the date of the acquisition by the Company are those of 
Nanoco Tech Limited. However, the equity structure appearing in the Group financial statements reflects the equity structure of the 
legal parent, including the equity instruments issued under the share-for-share exchange to effect the transaction. The effect of 
using the equity structure of the legal parent gives rise to an adjustment to the Group’s issued equity capital in the form of a reverse 
acquisition reserve. 90

Share option schemes
The Group operates the following share option schemes, all of which are operated as Enterprise Management Incentive (“EMI”) 
schemes insofar as the share options being issued meet the EMI criteria as defined by HM Revenue & Customs. Share options issued 
that do not meet EMI criteria are issued as unapproved share options, but are subject to the same exercise performance conditions.
Nanoco Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
Grant in November 2011
Share options were granted to staff and Executive Directors on 25 November 2011. The options granted to Executive Directors were 
subject to commercial targets being achieved. The exercise price was set at 50 pence, being the average closing share price on the 
day preceding the issue of the share options. The fair value benefit is measured using a binomial model, taking into account the terms 
and conditions upon which the share options were issued. Share options issued to staff vest over a three-year period from the date of 
grant and are exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the award, but are not subject to performance conditions.
Grant in October 2012
Share options were granted to staff and Executive Directors on 22 October 2012. The options granted to Executive Directors were 
subject to commercial targets being achieved. The exercise price was set at 57 pence, being the average closing share price on the 
day preceding the issue of the share options. The fair value benefit is measured using a binomial model, taking into account the terms 
and conditions upon which the share options were issued. Share options issued to staff vest over a three-year period from the date of 
grant and are exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the award, but are not subject to performance conditions.
Grant in May 2014
Share options were granted to certain staff on 23 May 2014. The exercise price was set at 89 pence, being the average closing share 
price on the day preceding the issue of the share options. The fair value benefit is measured using a binomial model, taking into 
account the terms and conditions upon which the share options were issued. The options vest at the end of three years from the date 
of grant and are exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the award. The awards are not subject to performance conditions. Vesting 
of the award is subject to the employee remaining a full-time member of staff at the point of vesting. No options were granted to 
Executive Directors.
Grant in October 2014
Share options were granted to an Executive Director on 14 October 2014. The exercise price was set at 10 pence, being the nominal 
value of the share. The fair value benefit is measured using a binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon 
which the share options were issued. The options vest at the end of three years from the date of grant and are exercisable until the 
tenth anniversary of the award. The awards are subject to performance conditions which were amended during the year so as to be 
in line with the 2015 LTIP scheme. As a result of the modification, the fair value of the award was reduced. However, in accordance with 
IFRS 2 no change was made to the charge in the financial statements. Vesting of the award is subject to the employee remaining a 
full-time member of staff at the point of vesting.

Grant in December 2015
Following approval of the new scheme at the 2015 AGM, share options were granted to four Executive Directors at nil cost. The fair 
value benefit is measured using a stochastic model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the share options were 
issued. The options vest at the end of the three-year performance period subject to meeting the performance criteria (as detailed in 
the Directors’ remuneration report on page 53) and are exercisable after a two-year holding period until the tenth anniversary of the award.
Grant in April 2016
Share options were granted to an employee on 12 April 2016 at nil cost. The fair value benefit is measured using a stochastic model,

performance period subject to meeting performance criteria and are exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the award.
Grant in November 2016
Options were granted to the Executive Directors and all eligible staff on 22 November 2016 at nil cost. The fair value benefit is

subject to a two-year holding period. The options vest at the end of a three-year performance period subject to meeting 
performance criteria and are exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the award.
Other awards
Share options are awarded to management and key staff as a mechanism for attracting and retaining key members of staff. The 
options are issued at either market price on the day preceding grant or, in the event of abnormal price movements, at an average 
market price for the week preceding grant date. On 14 October 2015, unapproved options were granted to a member of staff with an 
exercise price of 56.5 pence. These options vest over a three-year period from the date of grant with performance conditions and are 
exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the award. Vesting of the award is subject to the employee remaining a full-time member of 
staff at the point of vesting. The fair value benefit is measured using a binomial valuation model, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the share options were issued.
Shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”)
The Group operates a jointly owned EBT share scheme for senior management under which the trustee of the Group-sponsored EBT 
acquired shares in the Company jointly with a number of employees. The shares were acquired pursuant to certain conditions set out 
in jointly owned agreements (“ JOA”). Subject to meeting the performance criteria conditions set out in the JOA, the employees are able 
to exercise an option to acquire the trustee’s interests in the jointly owned EBT shares at the option price. The jointly owned EBT shares 
issued on 1 September 2006 had met the option conditions on 1 August 2010 and the option to gain sole ownership was exercised by 
the option holder on 2 August 2016.
The fair value benefit is measured using a binomial valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the 
jointly owned shares were issued.

The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. 
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily 
be the actual outcome.
Certain awards are subject to a holding period after vesting. A Finnerty model has been used to determine a discount for the lack 
of marketability of the shares.

26. Financial risk management
Overview
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to various kinds of financial risks, the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group’s management of capital.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. 
The Executive Directors report regularly to the Board on Group risk management.
Capital risk management
The Company reviews its forecast capital requirements on a half-yearly basis to ensure that entities in the Group will be able 
to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders.
The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to equity holders of the Parent, comprising issued share capital, 
reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 21 to 24 and in the Group statement of changes in equity. At 31 July 2017 total 
equity was £10,447,000 (2016: £18,763,000).
The Company is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that, as far as possible, it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its 
liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the 
Group’s reputation.
The Group manages all of its external bank relationships centrally in accordance with defined treasury policies. The policies include 
the minimum acceptable credit rating of relationship banks and financial transaction authority limits. Any material change to the 
Group’s principal banking facility requires Board approval. The Group seeks to mitigate the risk of bank failure by ensuring that it 
maintains relationships with a number of investment-grade banks.
At the reporting date the Group was cash positive with no outstanding borrowings, apart from a long-term loan which is being repaid 
on a quarterly basis in line with the terms of the loan agreement. 94

The values disclosed in the above table are carrying values. The Board considers that the carrying amount of financial assets 
and liabilities approximates to their fair value.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are credit risk and foreign currency risk. The Board of Directors reviews 
and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are summarised below.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash, cash equivalents and deposits. The Group seeks to limit the level of credit risk on the 
cash balances by only depositing surplus liquid funds with multiple counterparty banks that have investment-grade credit ratings.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the 
result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Group’s maximum exposure is the carrying amount as disclosed 
in note 16, which was neither past due nor impaired. All trade receivables are ultimately overseen by the Chief Financial Officer and 
are managed on a day-to-day basis by the UK credit control team. Credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer.
The maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to cash, cash equivalents and deposits is the carrying value at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency risk 
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional 
currency of the Company. These are primarily US Dollars (“USD”) and Euros. Transactions outside of these currencies are limited.
Almost all of the Company’s revenue is denominated in USD. The Group purchases some raw materials, certain services and some 
assets in USD which partly offsets its USD revenue, thereby reducing net foreign exchange exposure.
The Group may use forward exchange contracts as an economic hedge against currency risk, where cash flow can be judged with 
reasonable certainty. Foreign exchange swaps and options may be used to hedge foreign currency receipts in the event that the 
timing of the receipt is less certain. There were no open forward contracts as at 31 July 2017 or at 31 July 2016.

Sensitivity analysis to movement in exchange rates
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the Sterling rate against other currencies used 
within the business, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s loss before tax (due to foreign exchange translation of 
monetary assets and liabilities) and the Group’s equity.

Interest rate risk
As the Group has no significant borrowings the risk is limited to the reduction of interest received on cash surpluses held at bank which 
receive a floating rate of interest. The principal impact to the Group is to interest-bearing cash and cash equivalent balances held, 
which are as set out below:
