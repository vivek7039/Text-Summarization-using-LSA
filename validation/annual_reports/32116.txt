Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 “Over the last few years a great deal of work has been done to make the company 
stronger, lower risk and more resilient. We are seeing the upside of these efforts now as 
we declare record headline profits before tax of over half a billion pounds – up 10%. More 
importantly, the improvement in our cost base, the strong leadership position that we 
have built, the investment that we have made in our digital business and, above all, the 
enormous shift in customer satisfaction and price competitiveness that we have driven 
leave us well positioned to flourish in the years ahead.
While the UK consumer environment seems to be holding up for us, there will 
undoubtedly continue to be changes in the way people buy all of the products that we 
sell from phones to washing machines. Change always represents opportunity, and our 
job is to find the propositions that keep us compelling to our customers forever. We are 
excited about our plans in services and about the myriad of initiatives that will drive long-
term relationships with our customers.
In short, it has been a good year for Dixons Carphone and it gives me great pleasure 
once again to thank my 43,000 colleagues for the work that they have done to deliver so 
well and so energetically for our customers.”

Chairman’s Statement
Strategic Report
 
I am delighted to be reporting to you as the newly appointed Chairman 
of Dixons Carphone plc. It is great to be back at a business I served for 
more than a decade. Importantly, I would like to pay tribute to the 
achievements of my predecessor, Sir Charles Dunstone, one of the UK’s 
great entrepreneurs, who founded half of this business that has gone on 
to be one of the world’s major retailers, serving millions of customers 
every year in 10 countries and employing more than 43,000 people.
It has been a remarkable and sometimes challenging year. 
In the days after the referendum on the UK’s membership of 
the EU, the Company’s share price fell by as much as 34%, 
as retailers were considered vulnerable to a post Brexit 
slowdown. In this environment and despite the uncertainty, 
the team got on with their job of making the business 
stronger by serving our customers better. 
In the UK & Ireland our new 3-in-1 stores bring together 
Currys, PC World and Carphone Warehouse in an exciting 
shopping environment and we are very pleased with the 
initial results of these stores. We have also improved 
our online capabilities, particularly with a new Carphone 
Warehouse web platform and we have experienced strong 
online sales growth across all our brands. 
And it’s not just about great products. Team Knowhow, our 
new services brand, is piloting a range of expanded services 
in the Leeds and London conurbations. We think that this 
support will be ever more important to help customers 
to get the best from the amazing world which modern 
technology can offer. 
We also have become an important centre to help 
customers choose the best providers of other services. 
We successfully integrated Simplifydigital into the Group 
and both in store and online made switching your energy, 
broadband or TV service easy. Go to one of our stores and 
try our 30 second challenge to save you money!
In the Nordic region, our expanded distribution centre in 
Jönköping, Sweden, one of the largest in Northern Europe, 
was completed to time and on budget with its own railway 
station inside the centre. It distributes across the Nordics 
and we expect to see benefits in stock availability and 
efficiency. 
We continue to gain market share across our businesses. 
A particular mention should be made of Kotsovolos in 
Greece which further enhanced its position as market leader 
with 3ppts market share growth against a clearly difficult 
economic environment.
The hard work of all our people and the management team 
led by Seb – and a huge thank you to all of them - have 
helped deliver a 10% growth in headline profit before tax 
on 9% higher revenue with total profit before tax increasing 
£123 million. This is an excellent achievement at a time 
when many retailers are struggling. This has allowed 
the Company to announce a dividend of 7.75 pence per 
share for the full year, an increase of 19%, to be paid on 
22 September 2017. 5 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
 
Strategic Report
In business, it is not just what a company does but how it 
does it that matters and we are proud of our contribution 
to the societies in which we operate. Our relationship with 
our key stakeholders and the way we manage the business 
in a sustainable manner are set out in our Corporate 
Responsibility Statement on pages 28 to 35. We believe 
that our unique expertise in technology can be used to 
help tackle social issues and we are hugely supportive 
of our colleagues’ roles in contributing to good causes. 
Dixons Carphone is proud to be a founding partner of 
Heads Together, which seeks to support those with mental 
health issues. We are also a Charity Partner of the Mix 
which supports the physical and mental wellbeing of young 
people. This was recognised when Dixons Carphone were 
shortlisted for Charity Partnership of the Year.
The future holds many opportunities and a few challenges 
and uncertainties. But we are well positioned. We have 
invested to make our stores best in class. We are market 
leaders in our key markets. We believe that the future 
will become more connected and more complicated. 
Customers will choose and buy through a mix of online 
and offline. We will be there with them providing technical 
knowhow and unbiased independent advice together with 
the ever important great prices, excellent service and great 
choice. Our job is to provide great value for customers and 
shareholders alike. 
Finally I would like to take this opportunity to express 
my thanks to not only Sir Charles but also Tim How and 
Baroness Sally Morgan who will both be stepping down 
from the Board following the 2017 Annual General Meeting. 
Tim and Sally have been long-serving members of the Board 
and have provided invaluable support and guidance during 
their terms. I wish them both all the very best in their future 
activities. I am also pleased to welcome Fiona McBain to 
the Board; Fiona’s business leadership, in particular in the 
financial services sector, will be a great asset as we evolve 
our consumer services propositions.

Group Chief Executive’s Statement
Strategic Report
I am very pleased to be reporting another set of strong numbers for the 
Group. In what continues to be a lively political environment, in particular 
in the UK, it has been good to see the business deliver a good year for 
Dixons Carphone both financially and operationally.
Dixons Carphone has had another strong year financially; 
Group like-for-like revenues were up 4% over the year, 
with growth in every region in the Group leading to a 
10% increase in Group headline PBT from £457 million to 
£501 million, slightly above the guidance we gave, resulting 
in an increase in headline basic EPS from 30.2p to 33.8p. 
At the same time, it is pleasing to see – across the Group 
– sustained high levels of customer satisfaction and Net 
Promoter Scores driven by our continued relentless focus 
on improving our proposition for our customers. Total 
reported profit before tax has increased by £123 million 
driven by the increase in headline EBIT and a reduction 
in year on year non-headline costs, principally those 
associated with our ‘big-box’ property plan, the costs of 
which were fully recognised in FY16.
Our business in the UK & Ireland enjoyed a good year 
despite some headwinds in particular within phone, with 
like-for-like revenues up 4% over the year and headline 
EBIT up 4% to £385 million. This sales growth was driven 
in large part by growth in electricals in a flat overall market. 
This was somewhat tempered by a more challenging phone 
sector which was impacted by product safety issues, a 
limited supply in the market of some key lines and some 
changing trends in SIM-only. Against this backdrop, the 
team have delivered good profit growth underpinned by 
solid cost control across the business. 
Over the course of the year we all but completed our 
‘big-box’ property plan, closing 80 stores, and providing 
a consistent experience with the latest categories and 
look-and-feel now right across our estate. Virtually all 
of our CurrysPCWorld stores now offer a fully-fledged 
embedded Carphone Warehouse shop-in-shop. Separately 
we have trialled a new format for our standalone Carphone 
Warehouse stores; we now have 9 open and will continue to 
open more during the course of the year. The performance 
of these stores has been highly encouraging, in particular 
for sales of accessories and insurance. In addition we have 
launched a new Carphone Warehouse web platform which 
is trading well.
Price competitiveness continues to be an area of real focus; 
our customers are – rightly – savvy, and we need to be both 
competitive and transparent - not only on the products 
themselves, but also on the cost and availability of delivery 
and services. Today, we show competitor prices on our 
websites so that customers can feel confident at all times 
that they are getting a great deal from us. We continue to 
be at parity or better versus our most aggressive pure-
play competitors on pretty much all of our products, pretty 
much all of the time and we are transparent about our 
delivery availability versus our main competitors. Our free 
app ‘Compare Prices’ is a great tool for colleagues and 
customers to check prices themselves. 
iD mobile operations in the UK continue to grow from 
strength to strength since launch in May 2015. iD allows 
us to offer highly differentiated propositions to customers, 
supported by an innovative IT platform, enabling us to tailor 
plans, for example, with the ability to transfer data between 
friends and family, as well as being at the vanguard of 
free roaming. These propositions are proving to be very 
successful and I am very pleased that the active customer 
base is now more than 600,000, making iD one of the 
fastest growing postpay MVNOs (Mobile Virtual Network 
Operator) in UK mobile history.  7 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
 
Strategic Report
Multi-play has had a great year. The proposition was re-
launched and supercharged a little over a year ago and we 
have more than doubled our market share of the fixed line 
switching market. We are the only place where a customer 
can compare, discuss, choose and switch – from a wide 
choice of national providers – the broadband and TV 
package that is perfect for them, expanding the expertise 
we have developed in mobile to all telecommunications 
and TV content needs, but we will not stop there. We have 
ambitious plans for the business including our innovative 
energy switching proposition in the coming year.
Both our Dixons Travel business and Harrods Technology 
have had a very strong year, benefiting from an influx 
of visitors post the EU referendum. In Dixons Travel we 
opened new stores in Heathrow Terminal 2 and at London 
City Airport as well as in Oslo, all trading well. In Harrods, 
while sales have been good across the board the sales 
of mobile phone hardware has been particularly strong. 
While we do not expect to see the currency benefit extend 
indefinitely in these stores, we have been pleased to be able 
to take advantage of the increased demand.
Our new Team Knowhow proposition has had a promising 
start, including our Leeds and London pilots. This has 
focused initially on phone and white goods repairs and 
NPS levels have been very encouraging indeed. Repair is 
a critical first step, but we think that finance, protection 
and support and services will all be strong elements of the 
expanded proposition and we have put in place a strong 
team, led by Feilim Mackle, to drive this business forward. 
We believe passionately that customers will increasingly 
want somebody to take responsibility for keeping the 
dozens of devices and appliances in their homes working, 
always on and upgraded and that we are uniquely placed to 
do that cost-effectively and well.
Our Nordics business, against, again, a relatively tough 
market backdrop, had a very respectable year with like-
for-like revenues up 1% over the year and 2% in the fourth 
quarter, and headline EBIT increased 13% to £89 million. 
Operationally the region has delivered some positive 
improvements including the building and commissioning of 
the new small-product warehouse in Sweden, creating the 
most efficient and modern operation of its type in Europe, 
integrating InfoCare, the largest computer repair company 
in the region, developing its digital infrastructure, improving 
its online proposition and integrating the Fona business 
in Denmark. The business is also implementing electronic 
shelf-edge ticketing and a new merchandising model which 
will drive cost and stock out and improve margins.
Our Southern European business had a very good year in 
the face of ongoing political and economic turbulence and 
I am pleased it has reported Group leading 6% rise in like-
for-like revenues over the year with headline EBIT growing 
from £17 million to £22 million. I am particularly proud of 
the team in Greece; our Greek business has increased 
profitability in 2016/17 against what continues to be a tough 
operating environment on the back of continued innovation 
and vigour. In the last year the team has opened new stores, 
grown market share, radically improved delivery options 
for customers across the country and developed a new 
digital agenda including a new e-commerce platform due to 
launch in the coming year. In Spain, we have continued to 
be agile in tough, albeit improving, economic conditions. We 
continue to move to a more flexible franchise approach, and 
to pivot the model to offer multi-play, SIM-only and handset 
only, as well as gaining traction with our new SmartHouse 
proposition.
Our Connected World Services division has also had a 
good year, generating £21 million of headline EBIT, driven 
by deepening our existing partnerships. Our relationship 
with Sprint continues to evolve and we are currently in the 
process of rolling-out our IT platform, honeybee, across 
their estate. In light of very volatile US market situations 
and responding to Sprint’s desire to accelerate its own 
distribution platform we have agreed to sell our share of the 
joint venture that we built together back to them. honeybee, 
our unique software platform, continues to push forward, 
and we have signed an agreement with WebHelp, a large 
French outsourcer for our Contact Centre product.
Finally, the political sands in the UK continue to shift. We 
have, I believe, been able to manage the immediate fallout 
of the referendum result without significant issues and our 
proposition remains as competitive and attractive as ever. 
Nevertheless, we will remain vigilant as the questions arising 
out of the recent election ebb and flow and look, as always, 
to turn changes in the market to our advantage.
In short, it has been another year of strong delivery within 
the business and I feel pleased to be ending the year well-
positioned for the year ahead. I am also acutely aware that 
we are only in this position thanks to our more than 43,000 
colleagues operating in 10 countries across the Group 
and my sincere thanks go out to them all. I am constantly 
impressed by the passion and commitment of the men and 
women who make up the Dixons Carphone family, and am 
very proud to work alongside them.

Our markets
The Group’s core retail focus is the sale of consumer 
electricals and mobile phone products and connectivity. 
The Group also has a significant services infrastructure 
focused on maintenance, support, repairs, delivery and 
installation of hardware and services. In addition, the Group 
has developed a business-to-business operation via its 
Connected World Services division which leverages the 
specialist skills, operating processes and technology of the 
business to provide services to third parties.
Product
CurrysPCWorld Carphone Warehouse is the only nationwide 
consumer electricals and mobile phone retailer in the UK & 
Ireland. The Elkjøp Group in the Nordics and Kotsovolos in 
Greece are the largest consumer electrical retailers in their 
respective markets. 
The consumer electricals retail market can be split between 
specialist electrical retailers, such as CurrysPCWorld, 
and general retailers which sell electrical goods as part 
of a wider offering. The market can also be broken down 
into two distinct distribution channels: ‘assisted’ and 
‘unassisted’. In the assisted channel, specialist retailers 
help customers through the buying process in the form of 
product advice, add-on services, delivery and installation. 
The unassisted channel, which includes single channel 
internet retailers as well as general retailers, tends not to 
offer all of these services.
Specialist electrical retailers are the predominant destination 
for customers in the European consumer electrical market. 
Buying groups, general merchants and independents also 
have a retail presence through stores and / or online. The 
market is served by a relatively small number of global 
manufacturers supplying goods to local, regional, national 
and international electrical retailers.
In each of our markets there are varying numbers of specialist 
retailers who compete in the assisted market. Whilst we do 
compete against general retailers, this is usually limited to 
certain lower price categories and we consider that these 
retailers do not offer the full range of products, assisted sale 
or the other services that we are able to provide.
In mobile phone retailing, Carphone Warehouse as the only 
nationwide independent channel is uniquely placed to offer 
impartial advice over the vast array of network, handset and 
operating platform propositions available in the market. 
In addition to Carphone Warehouse, the mobile phone 
market is served by Mobile Network Operators (‘MNOs’), 
with whom the Group has long and well-established 
relationships, as well as independent and generalist 
retailers. The MNOs will offer propositions for their own 
networks, whilst independent and generalist retailers will 
provide a greater variety of propositions on one or multiple 
networks. Furthermore there are online-only retailers 
providing a variety of these services. This market is also 
served by MVNOs as well as a relatively small number of 
global manufacturers supplying goods to local, regional, 
national and international MNOs / MVNOs and retailers. 
The sophistication of mobile phones continues to grow, 
from simple mobile devices to sophisticated hardware with 
advanced functionality. There is a wide choice of operating 
platforms and network options for customers, which makes 
the Group’s expert and impartial advice, simplified by the 
tablet based tool, Pin Point, particularly relevant.
Customers continue to use ever increasing levels of data. 
As MNOs roll out their 4G networks and begin to trial 5G 
technology, quality and speeds improve, facilitating much 
faster downloads and providing levels of performance 
comparable to many Wi-Fi networks, enabling a much better 
platform for streaming, in particular for video content. 
We have seen some significant shifts in capacity in many of 
our markets in recent years; in consumer electricals some 
mass merchandisers have been reducing space for electrical 
products, some single channel internet operators have 
de-emphasised certain segments, and in some specialists 
have exited the market entirely. These shifts have helped us 
to gain market share and it underpins our view that a strong 
service-led multi-channel operation satisfies both customer 
and supplier needs while delivering a sustainable business 
as customer shopping habits continue to evolve. We believe 
further consolidation will occur in some of our markets.
The internet has established itself as an important part 
of the retail landscape. It supports enhanced product 
information as well as price comparability. It is an essential 
part of the buying process for customers, particularly for 
large ticket discretionary products. However, the expert 
advice provided by well-informed sales advisors within 
stores is highly valued by customers and manufacturers. 
Larger retailers, with an integrated multi-channel offer, with 
scalable distribution and systems, together with proven 
after-sales service and support are increasingly attractive to 
customers. 
The increase in online penetration provides us with the 
opportunity to increase both the range of goods on offer 
and the availability of product information. Our multi-
channel approach is well placed to exploit synergies 
between our internet sites and stores. 
Our reserve&collect service (collect@store in the Nordics), 
where customers can order on the internet and collect 
from a convenient store at a time to suit them is proving 
to be increasingly attractive to customers. Similarly, our 
pay&collect service, where customers can access a wider 
range of products than is typically available in their local 
store for either home delivery or later collection from the 
store, is also increasingly popular. Over the course of 
the year we have greatly extended this option, enabling 
customers to collect smaller electrical products in over 500 
Carphone Warehouse stores, providing a more convenient 
collection point in high streets across the country.
Innovation brings new products with improved functionality 
that drives sales growth. These include 4K Ultra High 
Definition (‘UHD’) and smart TVs, wearable technology, 
connected products for the home such as heating and 
lighting and the latest smartphones. Content, such as social 
media, apps, camera picture quality, digital media and  11 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17

cloud storage, also help to drive hardware innovation and 
replacement. 
The economic backdrop determines whether customers 
trade up or down. The consumer electricals market tends to 
grow at a rate that is at or exceeding the economy during 
years of economic growth. The effects of an economic 
downturn may be mitigated by innovation. The mobile 
market is less cyclical and mobile phones are considered an 
essential part of modern life.
The rapid innovation cycle may lead to price deflation, but 
also drives volumes as products become more affordable 
and replacement cycles accelerate. For larger ticket items, 
the low frequency of purchases limits the impact of price 
deflation on total market sales as consumers typically trade 
up to higher specification products. Our ‘Customer Journeys’ 
are designed to explain the features and benefits of the latest 
technology to customers and help them understand the 
reasons for trading up to these newer technologies.
The sale of white goods is also driven by the dynamics of 
the housing market as new construction, house sales and 
refurbishment trigger new purchases. 
Services
Everyday technology, whether smart TVs, computing, 
mobile phones or kitchen appliances, is becoming more 
complicated with connectivity and inter-operability becoming 
increasingly necessary. Families are dependent on this 
technology for keeping in touch with friends and family, 
entertainment, work, finances and school homework.
In addition, innovation drives new service requirements, 
including TV installation, data backup, computer set up and 
instructional Showhow teach-ins. In this complex world 
we believe our assisted sales model is best placed to help 
customers navigate the market and to help them choose a 
complete solution that best meets their needs.
Most homes in markets in which we operate have more 
than ten connected devices, and this is expected to grow 
dramatically over the near term, creating more demand for 
home technology support services.
We believe the market for home technology support to be 
already large, worth around £5bn in the UK alone, of which 
we estimate to hold a c. 10% share. Despite the significant 
demand and a large market, the supply of services is highly 
fragmented.
There is a major opportunity to grow our share in these 
valuable and growing markets more closely to match our 
share of product sales. Our aim is for Team Knowhow to be 
the leader in technology support.
Importantly we start from a position of real strength; our 
services capabilities and operating platform developed to 
support our product sales business is already class-leading 
and at real scale. We are the UK’s leading technology 
support business with: over 11m warranty and insurance 
customers; 1.1m mobile repairs per year; 4.2m home visits 
per year; 700,000 computer and TV repairs per year; and over 
400,000 finance customers.
We have Europe’s largest tech and white goods repair 
facility in Newark with more technical support agents than 
any other business providing a nationwide solution. This is a 
complex business to replicate. 
We have put in place a new leadership team dedicated 
to this division and developed a commercial model with 
refreshed and innovative propositions that we will roll-out 
during 2017 and 2018. Our revised service propositions 
will be accessed and delivered by customers through an 
increasingly digital interface with highly responsive care 
around the clock, easily accessed at home or on the move. 
Once fully executed we expect our services business 
to provide long-term sustainable revenues in attractive, 
growing markets.
Connected World Services (‘CWS’)
Connected World Services aims to leverage the specialist 
skills, operating processes and technology of the business 
to provide services to third parties looking to develop their 
own connected world solutions. CWS already provides 
managed services to a number of major international 
businesses and has a significant pipeline of active 
opportunities. The current focus is on delivering value and 
growth from two specific areas, Value Chain Services and 
our proprietary IT software, honeybee. 
Value Chain Services
Value chain services leverages the end-to-end capabilities 
of Dixons Carphone to provide a full suite of services that 
enable the sale and support of connected devices. We run 
the largest mobile phone repair centre in Europe, operate 
the biggest handset sourcing operation in Europe, are 
proven experts in this complex and regulated industry 
and we already have a significant established client base, 
including TalkTalk, RBS and EE. We provide the following 
services to our clients: connectivity, insurance services in 
partnership with Aviva, device supply, sales operations, 
forward and reverse logistics, software platforms, and 
customer service.
honeybee
honeybee is our proprietary IT software, developed in-
house initially to serve our mobile phone customers. It is a 
unique omni-channel, multi-industry software that simplifies 
the delivery and management of complex digital customer 
journeys. The software has been developed through 
25 years’ experience of complex digital journey innovation 
and today enables multi-country carrier activations which 
can revolutionise customer journey development tools. 
honeybee’s use is not limited to mobile phone retailing and 
we have recently signed an agreement with WebHelp to 
trial the platform to improve the efficiency of its call centre 
operations for a leading European MNO. 12 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Business model and strategy
Strategic Report
Business model
Our core retail business model, driven by customer insight, 
comprises three pillars underpinned by a low-cost operating 
model. 
In order to ensure we understand what products and 
services our customers want, how they use the products 
they buy from us and what they think of the service they get 
from us, we use extensive customer insights. This includes 
customer panels, interviews, home visits and detailed 
surveys. We use this information to build our ranges, 
improve our stores and services and for other business 
decisions. This is supported by mystery shoppers, exit 
surveys and customer feedback. During the year our UK & 
Ireland and Nordics businesses continued to sustain high 
levels of customer satisfaction.
Taking each of the three pillars in turn, our model can be 
described as follows:
Multi-channel retailing
The shopping trip for customers is constantly evolving. 
Our objective is to provide our customers with a seamless 
and personalised experience where convenience, ease of 
navigation and simplicity are key in attracting customers to 
shop with us whether it is online, in store or a combination 
of both. 
We constantly aim to develop and improve our customer 
journey whether via our assisted sales tool Pin Point or by 
improving stores, making them easier to shop in, with, for 
example, improved navigation, better signage, and enabling 
customers to interact with products before they buy. Within 
our recently refitted stores, the TV and audio category is 
set up to resemble a living room enabling customers to 
experience the full sensation of a large wall-mounted 4K 
television with surround speakers. These journeys are 
supported by product specialists providing expert advice on 
the products’ features and benefits. 
Our websites are a crucial and fundamental part of the 
customer shopping journey. A customer’s initial interaction 
is often online as is more and more of the customer’s 
journey. In recognition of how customer trends are evolving 
we have made it easier for our colleagues, in particular 
within our CurrysPCWorld stores, to access products and 
extended ranges in store.
Our training programmes, combined with our product 
learning centres and customer journeys, provide our 
colleagues with the right tools to understand customers’ 
needs and to provide them with the complete solution to 
properly meet those needs. We will continue to improve the 
training of our colleagues and the ways in which we can 
make them experts in the products we sell. For example 
we have in the year recruited and trained colleagues in 
the selling of multi-play, helping to double our share of 
the broadband switching market. In the Nordics we have 
launched a new e-learning management system.
We constantly review our store portfolio to ensure we 
have the right store for customers in the most competitive 
locations. Over the course of 2016/17 we have all but 
completed the roll-out of Carphone Warehouse SWAS 
(‘stores-within-a-store’) and the transformation of our stores 
to the 3-in-1 format. These stores allow us to offer the best 
of both worlds to customers, attracting new footfall and 
often at a lower cost. 
In the Nordic region as well as Greece and Spain we also 
operate a number of franchise stores. This arrangement 
allows our brands to be present in a wider range of 
catchments, while increasing the volume of purchases 
and therefore buying power of the Group and reducing our 
capital requirements.
The Group sees distribution as one of the keys to success 
in maintaining highly competitive margins and delivering 
outstanding, market-beating service to customers. We 
operate a centralised system of distribution centres for each 
of the regions in which we operate. This delivers significant 
competitive advantages, including reduced operating costs, 
reduced supplier delivery costs, reduced stock volumes in 
store, increased flexibility as to where to deliver and when, 
and a more efficient home delivery network for both us and 
our customers. 
While continuing to reduce costs, we are also constantly 
raising the bar, both in terms of successful delivery and 
installation rates, but also the range and quality of services 
we offer customers nationwide. In our Nordic operations 
(Jönköping, Sweden) and the UK (Newark), we operate two 
of the largest distribution centres of their kind in Europe. 
The Jönköping site is also expanding to incorporate an up-
to-date automated ‘small box’ operation. In the UK alone we 
now make more than 50,000 deliveries per week, including 
some 600,000 installations per year.
Products
Combining our customer insight with our market-leading 
presence we can make sure we have the right range of 
products and services in our stores to suit customers’ 
needs. Our scale and relationships with suppliers mean that 
we can work with them to showcase the latest technology, 
connectivity and products in our stores with areas dedicated 
to key suppliers.
As market leader with an excellent reputation in the 
consumer electricals market we have exceptional 
relationships with suppliers. In a complex multi-channel 
environment, suppliers trust us with their new product 
releases and stock allocations, as they appreciate the 
service and advice offered by our stores and indeed our 
websites, as well as the exciting environments offered by 
our transformed stores in which customers can experience 
their brands and products.
In consumer electricals, own-brand products enable us 
to offer customers greater choice and access to a range 
of products at competitive prices. We have defined a 
clear ‘good, better, best’ brand range including: Currys 
and PC World Essentials, Logik, iWantit, Advent, Goji and 
Sandstrøm brands. We see particular opportunities in the 
area of accessories and essentials with, for example, our 
own range of Sandstrøm cables. In addition, we continue to 
focus on the roll-out of our kitchen furniture brand, Epoq, in 
the Nordics. 13 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Strategic Report
After-sales services and support
Our customers need help with their products, whether it 
be maintenance and repair or delivery and installation, help 
keeping their products up and running or repair should 
things go wrong. Our business in the UK & Ireland sets 
the benchmark for our services infrastructure under our 
Geek Squad and Team Knowhow brands; the latter is also 
available across the Nordics.
We operate the largest network of two-man deliveries in the 
UK with an average of 50,000 deliveries per week enabling 
us to provide customers with the convenience of next-
day delivery in a four-hour time slot or the option of a free 
delivery at a later date. We repair more than 1m handsets 
per year and provide over 11m insurance or service 
agreements, carry out approximately 500,000 computing 
set-ups per year and take over 40,000 technical support 
calls each week.
Our Geek Squad and Team Knowhow teams in stores, in 
our call centres as well as field technicians, can provide 
set-up and upgrade services and online fix and backup 
services. Our market-leading range of help and support 
services ensure a customer, both business-to-customer 
(B2C) and business-to-business (‘B2B’), has the backing of 
expertise and support that keeps their technology up and 
running. Our state-of-the-art repair facility in Newark is able 
to repair and return a laptop in seven days. Our network 
of field technicians offer white goods repair in a market we 
estimate to be worth around £700 million a year. 
Through ownership of the service infrastructure we can 
ensure the quality of service delivered to customers. This, 
we believe, provides us with a significant competitive 
advantage in meeting the needs of our customers, as well 
as a revenue stream not readily available to single channel 
online and mass market competitors.
Strategy
Dixons Carphone is Europe’s leading specialist electrical 
and telecommunications retailer and services company, 
employing more than 43,000 people in 10 countries. 
Focused on helping customers navigate the connected 
world, Dixons Carphone offers a comprehensive range of 
electrical and mobile products, connectivity and expert 
after-sales services from the Geek Squad and Team 
Knowhow. The Group’s core retail focus is the sale of 
consumer electrical and mobile phone products. The Group 
also has a significant services infrastructure focused on 
maintenance, support, repairs, delivery and installation. In 
addition, the Group has developed a business-to-business 
operation via its Connected World Services division which 
leverages the specialist skills, operating processes and 
technology of the business to provide services to third 
parties.
The Group’s primary brands include CurrysPCWorld 
Carphone Warehouse in the UK & Ireland, Elkjøp and Elkjøp 
Phonehouse, Elgiganten and Elgiganten Phone House, 
Gigantti and Lefdal in the Nordic countries, Kotsovolos in 
Greece, Dixons Travel in a number of European airports 
albeit predominantly in the UK and Phone House in Spain. 
Our key service brands include Team Knowhow in the UK, 
Ireland and the Nordics, and Geek Squad in the UK, Ireland 
and Spain. 
B2B services are provided through CWS, PC World 
Business, Elkjøp Business and Carphone Warehouse 
Business. Connected World Services aims to leverage 
the Group’s existing expertise, operating processes 
and technology to provide a range of services to other 
businesses.
We continue to drive the Group forward from a position 
of strength with a focus on three strategic priorities. By 
focusing on these we can deliver not only a better business 
for our customers and colleagues, but also better returns for 
our shareholders. 
The strategic priorities are:
1.  Continue to enhance and drive successful and 
sustainable retail business models in a multi-channel 
world;
2.  Leverage our scale, our knowhow, and our unique 
infrastructure to drive growth in value added consumer 
services; and
3.  Continue to develop the CWS B2B division.
Looking at each of these in turn:
1.  Continue to enhance and drive 
successful and sustainable retail 
business models in a multi-channel 
world
Our customers tell us that when buying consumer electricals 
they want advice to ensure they are making the right 
choices, particularly as these are often major purchases 
that customers will own for several years. The growth of 
the internet has empowered customers, providing instant 
access to information including product knowledge and 
price transparency. 
In mobile, we are uniquely positioned in the UK & Ireland 
and the Nordics to provide independent advice and meet 
customer requirements for impartiality, comparability and 
flexibility, both online and in store with the Pin Point tool 
in the UK. In consumer electricals, single channel internet 
operators have a different model whose principal advantage 
is structurally lower costs and which have historically 
been able to offer competitive prices versus store-based 
operators. By focusing on the advantages that we, as a 
multi-channel specialist, can offer customers and suppliers 
we can eliminate the cost advantage that pure-play internet 
operators have historically enjoyed. As a result we are able 
to offer customers very competitive prices against our 
competitor set and still be more profitable. 
There are four distinct activities that we believe are the key 
strengths of our multi-channel, service-based model and 
which will support our competitive advantage going forward:
1.  Work closely with suppliers to harness benefits available 
to our business model: Suppliers want to ensure that  14 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Business model and strategy
Strategic Report
customers not only choose their brands, but also 
experience the benefits of the latest products. As a 
multi-channel operator we work with our suppliers to 
ensure we can explain the benefits of these products 
and demonstrate them to customers in our stores and 
our suppliers support us in this work in a variety of ways.
2. Ensure a seamless and personalised multi-channel 
experience for customers: We are indifferent whether 
our customers buy in store and / or click ‘Buy’ online, 
but the experience across these channels must be 
joined-up and consistent. Today all our stores are 
equipped with Beacon devices and we are increasingly 
able to gain a better understanding of consumer activity 
to improve their shopping experience as well as tailoring 
more focused customer orientated marketing activity.
3. Reduce costs: The scale of our operations across 
stores, ranges, logistics, distribution, repairs and 
services means that we can continually improve 
processes to reduce costs. We have removed a 
considerable amount of cost from the business over the 
last few years by making the business simpler, easier 
to operate and more efficient; we remain relentlessly 
focused on managing costs to make our business more 
efficient. Over the course of 2016/17 we have all but 
completed our UK & Ireland property plan, right sizing 
and revamping of ‘big-box’ estate into a best-in class 
3-in-1 format.
4.  Drive our service proposition: We need to be able to 
stand shoulder to shoulder with our customers and 
for them to know they can come to our stores and get 
knowledgeable advice and great service to help them 
buy the right product. They need to be confident that 
we will solve their problem quickly and efficiently. Geek 
Squad in the UK & Ireland and Team Knowhow in the 
UK & Ireland and in the Nordics offer customers services 
and technical support that can help them with their 
product throughout its lifetime. This is expanded in our 
second strategic priority. In consumer electricals, we 
do more than simply sell the product; we will also get it 
working and keep it working, as well as delivering it, and 
providing peace of mind through product support and 
after-sales services. The conversations our colleagues 
have in store with customers give us an opportunity to 
explain the benefits of these solutions and sell more of 
them than our single-channel competition. 
2.  Leverage our scale, our knowhow, 
and our unique infrastructure 
to drive growth in value added 
consumer services
We continue to expand and strengthen our proposition to 
customers, our service capability and our relationship with 
suppliers to underpin and drive even greater advantage in 
the markets in which we operate.
Growing complexity and interconnectivity of products 
means that customers are increasingly demanding help 
and support, not just in choosing the right product, but 
also installation, connection, support and repair. Our Geek 
Squad and Team Knowhow services are at the forefront 
of this in the UK and we have introduced our Knowhow 
services across the Nordics. 
We must continue to innovate new services to help 
customers and to remain relevant to the way products and 
connectivity is evolving. Behind our end-to-end service 
operation we have a comprehensive infrastructure, including 
technical phone support, delivery, installation, repair and 
recycling. We can leverage this infrastructure to widen 
our customer base either to customers who bought their 
products through a third party (for example, our fault&fix 
computer service), or for business customers. By doing this 
we can increase the efficiency of using this infrastructure 
and deliver even better value services to our customers. 
We are driven to provide unparalleled expertise and services 
to help our customers navigate the new digital era. We are 
focused on improving every possible aspect of the shopping 
journey. We want our colleagues to become famous for 
service and we want to retain customers for life by having 
exciting new stores, with the best range at great prices and 
providing excellent after-sales support and service. We are 
making excellent progress; however, we can continue to 
make improvements to delight customers and to outpace 
the competition.
3.  Develop the Connected World 
Services division
Building on the success of PinPoint, which has been 
transformational in our Carphone Warehouse stores, we 
are now seeking to expand our honeybee platform into 
new categories and across all brands. Good progress has 
also been made in securing honeybee software contracts 
in the US, with Sprint and a leading device manufacturer 
in Canada. The honeybee proposition of simplifying the 
delivery and management of complex digital customer 
journeys has resonated well across several industries and 
we now have an active pipeline in the travel, general retail 
and finance sectors, alongside significant opportunities in 
our mobile heartland. To achieve global scale quickly and 
access new industry verticals, we have agreed partnerships 
with both Accenture and PwC who bring industry 
experience, global scale and delivery credibility. 15 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17

Headline results
The performance review below refers, unless otherwise 
stated, to headline information for continuing businesses. 
Prior year comparatives have been restated to remove the 
results of businesses to be exited as disclosed in note 32 to 
the Group financial statements.
Group
Group headline revenue increased 3% on a local currency 
basis and 9% in Sterling terms to £10,580 million (2015/16: 
£9,736 million)  . Like-for-like revenue growth was 4%, 
reflecting growth across all divisions.
Headline EBIT was up 8% to £517 million (2015/16: 
£478 million)  .
Headline profit before tax was £501 million (2015/16: 
£457 million)  , with a reduced year-on-year interest charge.
UK & Ireland
Revenue in the UK & Ireland increased by 2% to 
£6,550 million (2015/16: £6,402 million)  , with like-for-like 
revenue for the year up 4%, benefiting by approximately 3% 
as a net result of sales transferred from closed stores and 
sales disruption. The electricals business delivered a solid 
result with market share gains across consumer electronics, 
white goods, computing and multiplay.  23 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Strategic Report
The mobile market was more challenging due to product 
safety and supply issues, limited product innovation, 
delays in product launches and more competitive SIMO 
propositions. iD in the UK continues to benefit from its 
differentiated proposition and innovative tariffs with the 
number of active customers increasing to more than 
600,000 from 325,000 in the prior year.
Headline EBIT has increased 4% to £385 million. Electricals 
profitability growth has reflected revenue growth with 
margins remaining relatively flat year on year. There has 
been an in-year benefit of £28 million from changes in the 
cost profile of services provided under long-term customer 
support agreements
(a)
.
Electricals growth has offset lower mobile margin caused 
by higher handset costs. In addition we have seen lower out 
of bundle spend (partly due to new EU roaming legislation) 
but have experienced higher average customer contract 
life
(b)
 (net impact positive £21 million; 2015/16: £32 million). 
Changes in contractual terms for the sale of third party 
insurance contracts have benefited headline EBIT by 
£22 million
(c)
.
We have made the decision to exit our iD mobile operations 
in the Republic of Ireland. The iD mobile operations in the 
Republic of Ireland represent a different business model to 
the UK, as it is a capacity MVNO with options for expanding 
its spectrum. This brings with it excellent control, but that 
comes with upfront costs and increased administration, and 
we believe the business will flourish faster under dedicated 
ownership.
Nordics
The Nordic business delivered 5% revenue growth on 
a local currency basis with growth across all countries. 
Reported revenues increased 20% to £3,156 million 
(2015/16: £2,632 million)   benefiting from the weakness of 
Sterling.
Like-for-like revenue was up 1% with the difference 
between like-for-like growth and local currency growth 
predominantly reflecting new store openings, FONA store 
acquisitions and the contribution of Infocare, which was 
acquired in the prior year. Like-for-like revenue growth 
was helped by strong audio and mobile sales more than 
offsetting a decline in tablet sales.
Headline EBIT in local currency remained broadly flat 
year on year. Reported headline EBIT growth of 13% to 
£89 million reflects the translation benefit of weaker Sterling.
Southern Europe
Southern Europe had strong underlying results with like-for-
like revenue up 6%, and revenue on a local currency basis 
up 4%. The increase was driven by the business in Greece 
which delivered excellent growth. Our Spanish business 
continues to evolve to offer multi-play, sim-only and 
handset propositions and move to a more flexible franchise 
approach in a changing market.
Southern Europe headline EBIT was £22 million (2015/16: 
£17 million)    , up 29% benefiting from the increased revenue 
noted above and the relative strengthening of the Euro 
against Sterling.
Connected World Services
Connected World Services (‘CWS’)   has continued to grow, 
delivering revenue of £213 million, up from £152 million 
in the prior year with headline EBIT growth of £10 million 
to £21 million. Year-on-year revenue and profit growth is 
driven by contracts with EE and TalkTalk for mobile phone 
insurance and the distribution of mobile, TV and broadband 
connectivity, as well as the honeybee platform development 
contract with Sprint.
On 9 June the Group announced that in light of the 
changing US mobile market landscape and Sprint’s review 
of its own distribution strategy, the companies have reached 
mutual agreement that CWS will focus on the deployment 
of the honeybee platform across the entire Sprint estate 
and that Sprint will acquire the CWS 50% share of the 
distribution joint venture. The Group’s share of joint 
venture losses (£17 million, 2015/16: £4 million)  , have been 
classified as non-headline items in accordance with the 
Group policy for businesses to be exited.
We continue to develop the honeybee pipeline, and 
have signed an agreement with WebHelp, a large French 
outsourcer, and a pilot call centre agreement with Capita, 
both of which we anticipate will deliver further agreements 
with new customers.
Net finance costs
Headline net finance costs were £16 million (2015/16: 
£21 million)    . The reduction in net financing costs reflects 
the full year benefit of lower margin on the revolving credit 
facility negotiated in October 2015 coupled with reduced 
LIBOR rates and finance income received from the loan with 
the Group’s investment in the Unieuro operations.
Tax
The headline effective tax rate for the full year is 22% 
(2015/16: 24%). The rate is higher than the UK statutory rate 
of 20% due mainly to higher statutory rates in the Nordics, 
certain non-deductible items mainly in the UK and a net 
increase in tax related provisions in the year.

Performance review
Strategic Report
Free Cash Flow before restructuring was an inflow of 
£230 million (2015/16: £245 million)    , a decrease of 6%. 
The Group experienced a working capital outflow of 
£104 million (2015/16: £80 million)    , largely as a result 
of increased receivables balances relating to network 
commissions in the UK and changes in contractual terms 
for the sale of third party insurance contracts coupled with 
lower deferred income as a result of changes to the cost 
profile of services provided under long-term customer 
support agreements as discussed earlier in this report.
Capital expenditure in the period was £242 million (2015/16: 
£221 million)    . The year-on-year increase reflected spend 
on SWAS stores and the refit of the stores as part of the 
property rationalisation programme announced in the prior 
year, together with further investment in IT platforms and 
continued development in both our retail and Connected 
World Services businesses.
The reduction in interest paid is as a result of facility fees 
that were paid in H1 2015/16 and the reduction in financing 
costs explained above.
Restructuring costs primarily comprise the cash costs 
associated with the Merger, transformation activities and 
the property rationalisation programme noted below within 
non-headline items.
A reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flow from 
operations is presented in note 27c)   to the Group financial 
statements.

At 29 April 2017 the Group had net debt of £271 million, 
broadly flat year-on-year to net debt of £267 million in the 
prior year. Free Cash Flow was an inflow of £160 million 
(2015/16: £202 million)     for the reasons described above.
Net cash outflows from acquisitions and disposals in the 
current year represents cash outflows relating to the Sprint 
joint venture, the acquisition of Simplifydigital and the FONA 
stores in Denmark, offset by cash receipts in relation to the 
Group’s previously disposed retail operations in Germany.
The increase in pension contributions reflects the agreed 
deficit reduction plan following the 2016 triennial valuation. 
Other items primarily relate to foreign exchange movements

Revenue increased 9% to £10,585 million due to the 
reasons discussed earlier in this report.
Earnings before interest and tax increased from £304 million 
to £418 million in the current period, largely due to the 
reasons discussed earlier in this report and a reduction in 
non-headline costs incurred in the current year which are 
explained later in this report.
Net finance costs have decreased by £9 million due to 
reduced interest on borrowings reflecting the full year 
benefit of lower interest rates on amounts drawn under 
the revolving credit facility as described above and prior 
year non-headline costs relating to the write off of deferred 
facility fees incurred as disclosed below.
The tax charge increased from £84 million to £95 million 
reflecting higher statutory profit in the year partially offset by 
the impact of the lower effective tax rate discussed above. 
Tax credits on non-headline items reduced as a result of 
lower non-headline costs incurred in the year.
Basic EPS has increased from 15.6p to 25.3p for the period 
due to the higher reported profit after tax. Diluted EPS has 
increased from 15.1p to 25.2p reflecting the increase in the 
reported profit after tax and the lower number of potentially 
dilutive shares following the post-Brexit decline in the Group 
share price. 25 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17

iD mobile operations in the Republic of Ireland of £10 million 
(2015/16: £6 million)  , and the share of trading losses from 
joint ventures of £18 million (2015/16: £4 million)   (including 
segmental allocation of central costs of £1 million (2015/16: 
£nil)  )   for which an agreement has been reached to sell the 
Group’s 50% interest to Sprint.
Costs incurred in relation to the Merger relate to integration 
costs of £18 million (2015/16: £48 million)   and functional 
transformation costs of £13 million (2015/16: £nil)  . Integration 
costs primarily reflect professional fees, employee severance 
and incentive costs associated with the initial integration 
of the two merged businesses. During the current period 
functional transformation projects have commenced across 
the finance, procurement and human resources functions 
to rationalise shared service centre activities and harmonise 
policies and procedures across key support functions of 
the business. During 2015/16, Merger-related costs also 
included the write-off of £4 million deferred facility fees 
which were incurred as a result of the Merger and the 
financing required to facilitate the Merger at short notice.
The charge for the amortisation of acquisition intangibles 
was £34 million (2015/16: £40 million)   with the decrease due 
to some of the acquisition intangibles arising on the CPW 
Europe Acquisition being fully amortised during the prior 
period.
In the prior year the Group initiated a reorganisation of 
its property portfolio. The costs associated with this 
programme recognised in the prior year of £70 million 
related to committed property exit costs, asset write-downs 
and operational costs associated with the 3-in-1 store 
concept roll-out across the UK & Ireland.
Acquisition-related costs in the prior period related to 
professional fees incurred as a result of the acquisition of 
Simplifydigital in the UK and Infocare in the Nordics and the 
revaluation of deferred consideration payable to the former 
shareholders of the Epoq kitchen business in the Nordics.
As discussed in the Remuneration Committee Chairmen’s 
statement on page 61, in the event of non-vesting, 
compensation will be paid to participants of the Share Plan 
for any tax charges arising from taxable benefits from the 
waiver of any portion of loans granted under the scheme. 
Based on the current share performance it is considered 
probable that this liability will crystallise and therefore a 
provision of £11 million has been made during 2016/17.
Unieuro income relates to a special dividend to the Group to 
distribute the proceeds raised through the 31.8% IPO of its 
investment in Unieuro on the Milan stock exchange.
Net pension interest was £16 million reflecting the charge 
incurred in relation to the Dixons Retail UK pension scheme.
Discontinued operations
A loss of £18 million  was recognised during the prior year 
in relation to the disposal of the Group’s retail operations in 
Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal. In the current year, 
£4 million income principally relates to the write back of the 
previously impaired loan to Unieuro which was repaid during 
the year. Consistent with the original impairment this income 
is treated as discontinued operations.

The movement in goodwill is primarily due to the 
retranslation of currency denominated balances largely in the 
Nordics. Other fixed assets have increased, with the higher 
capital expenditure during the year exceeding amortisation 
and depreciation. Negative working capital has reduced 
in the year largely as a result of network commission 
receivables increasing due to favourable assumptions over 
future contractual receipts, increased consumer insurance 
commission receivables following changes in contractual 
terms for the sale of third party insurance contracts, 
a reduction in provisions due to utilisation of property 
related provisions in the year and increases in stock offset 
by increases in trade payables. Net debt has marginally 
increased as described above. Other net liabilities (tax, 
pension & other) have increased primarily as a result of the 
increase in the IAS 19 accounting deficit described below 
offset by the increase in carrying value of the joint venture 
and recognition of the investment in the remaining interest in 
Unieuro.  26 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17

cash equivalents (39)  53
The statutory EBIT increase and working capital outflow 
increase in the year are for those reasons outlined above.
Acquisition cash outflows in the current period of £46 million 
relate to £29 million further capital injected into the US 
joint venture with Sprint, £10 million deferred consideration 
payment for the prior year acquisition of Simplifydigital, 
£2 million in the Nordics in relation to the ‘Epoq’ kitchen 
business acquired in 2011/12 and £5 million for the 
acquisition of ten FONA stores in Denmark. The prior 
year reflected the final CPW Europe Acquisition deferred 
payment and the acquisitions of Simplifydigital and 
InfoCare. The increase in capital expenditure reflects those 
reasons outlined above.
The increase in other financing outflows is due to interest 
paid on and reduction in year end amounts drawn under the 
revolving credit facilities.
Comprehensive income / changes in equity
Total equity of the Group has increased from £2,860 million 
to £3,055 million primarily reflecting the total statutory 
profit of £295 million, the gain on retranslation of overseas 
operations of £76 million offset by the payment of dividends 
of £115 million and actuarial loss (net of taxation)   relating to 
the defined benefit pension scheme of £123 million.
Other matters
Pensions
The IAS 19 accounting deficit of the defined benefit section 
of the UK pension scheme of Dixons Retail amounted to 
£589 million at 29 April 2017 compared to £472 million at 
30 April 2016. Contributions during the period under the 
terms of the deficit reduction plan amounted to £43 million 
(2015/16: £35 million)    . The deficit has increased during 
the year as a result of changes in financial assumptions, 
primarily the discount and inflation rates, which determine 
liabilities, partially offset by an increase in underlying asset 
values.
Dividends
The Board declared an interim dividend of 3.5p per share, 
up from 3.25p per share last year. The interim dividend was 
paid on 27 January 2017.
We are proposing a final dividend of 7.75p per share, 
taking the total dividend for the year to 11.25p per share, 
a 15% increase on the previous year (2015/16: 9.75p)    . 
The final dividend is subject to shareholder approval at the 
Company’s forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The 
ex-dividend date is 24 August 2017, with a record date of 
25 August 2017 and an intended final dividend payment 
date of 22 September 2017.
Going concern
A review of the Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position, are set out within this Strategic 
Report, including the risk management section. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are shown in the balance sheet, cash 
flow statement and accompanying notes to the Annual 
Report and Accounts.
The directors have reviewed the future cash and profit 
forecasts of the Group, which they consider to be based 
on prudent assumptions. Based on these forecasts, the 
Directors consider that it is appropriate to prepare the 
Group financial statements on the going concern basis.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014, the Directors have assessed 
the viability of the Group over a period longer than the 
12 months covered by the “Going Concern” provision 
above.
In assessing the viability of the Group, the Directors have 
considered the Group’s current position and prospects, risk 
appetite, and those principal risks and mitigating actions as 
described on pages 16 to 21 of the Strategic Report. 27 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Strategic Report
The Board concluded that a period of three years was 
appropriate for this assessment as it is consistent with the 
period of focus of the annual strategic plan and reflects a 
period of greater certainty over forecasting assumptions.
The strategic plan considers the forecast revenue, EBITDA, 
working capital, cash flows and funding requirements 
on a business by business basis as well as the available 
borrowing facilities to the Group over the assessment period 
and the financial covenants to which those facilities need 
to comply. The strategic plan has been subject to robust 
stress-testing, modelling the impact of a combination of 
severe but plausible adverse scenarios based on those 
principal risks facing the group. Examples include the 
impact of regulation or information security incidents and 
reduced forecast profitability and cash flow as a result in 
a significant change in consumer behaviour. The model 
assumes no further funding facilities are required over and 
above those currently committed to the Group as disclosed 
in note 18 to the Annual Report and Accounts.
Based on the results of this analysis, the Directors have 
an expectation that the Company will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the three year period of their assessment. In doing so, it is 
recognised that such future assessments are subject to a 
level of uncertainty and as such future outcomes cannot be 
guaranteed or predicted with certainty.

Corporate Responsibility
Strategic Report
Dixons Carphone is committed to the highest standards of 
corporate and social responsibility (CSR) across the Group. 
It is our ambition to understand how technology can be 
used to tackle social issues and then leverage our skills, 
experience and position to support communities, connected 
homes and the families within them. We will do this by 
helping to ensure occupants are properly equipped, safe 
and confident to explore the connected world.
We are building a sustainable, responsible and ethical 
business by listening to customers, shareholders, 
employees and wider communities to understand 
expectations and make sure they are reflected in our 
business decisions. We recognise good sustainability 
practices make sound business sense, not only to benefit 
the environment, stakeholders and the communities 
in which we operate, but also to achieve our strategic 
priorities.
We are improving the visibility of our work across our CSR 
principles of people, connected community, environment 
and supply chain by enhancing our website, responding 
again to the CDP Climate Change programme and updating 
and making available several of our key policies.
Dixons Carphone is a member of the Government’s All Party 
Corporate Responsibility Group and for 2017/18 we joined 
Business in the Community to explore and share the role of 
business in creating a fairer society and more sustainable 
future. 
We are reviewing our overall long-term commitment to CSR 
so we focus on areas where we have the most impact as a 
Group. As part of this review we will be:
•  Engaging more deeply with stakeholders;
•  Benchmarking ourselves against our peers and best 
practice leaders;
•  Determining what is material to us as a business; and
•  Developing an approach to long term targets, strategy 
and reporting through a new sustainability programme 
called Live Earth Neutral.
We are committed to creating a great place to work 
and making a positive social impact, while building trust 
and brand loyalty across all our brands. We strive for a 
sustainable environment, minimal waste and optimum 
efficiency and operate an ethical business, valuing rights 
and prosperity across our value chain.
We aim to deliver transformative change through innovation, 
collaborate with stakeholders as partners, and directly or 
indirectly invest in initiatives which benefit the communities 
in which we operate.
Integrated activity
Our approach to corporate responsibility means taking 
business decisions guided by our values and code of 
ethics. Throughout our business, dedicated personnel drive 
and deliver our sustainability activities, with our Head of 
Corporate Responsibility helping to co-ordinate and report 
on progress while strategising and delivering our social 
impact agenda. CSR is approved and represented at Senior 
Management then Board level by the IR, PR and Corporate 
Affairs Director, where the Strategy is reviewed annually, 
with specific issues and activity discussed whenever 
necessary throughout the year.
People
Our people make us who we are, and as a business we are 
passionate about attracting, recruiting and retaining the best 
talent to help drive our growth and keep us at the forefront 
of innovation and outstanding customer experience.
In 2016 we launched our Graduate Scheme which saw 15 
university leavers given the opportunity to establish their 
careers with bespoke training, on-the-job experience and 
management coaching. The scheme continues in 2017 with 
an increased intake of 19 graduates.
Our Apprentice scheme also goes from strength to strength. 
This year we recruited 135 new apprentices through learning 
providers, colleges and social media. Working across 
different roles, brands and functions our apprentices are 
providing us with a pipeline of talent and demonstrating 
improved rates of retention, engagement and performance.

Investing in colleague expertise
As part of our learning strategy, formal and informal training 
and management coaching is available to all employees 
to help them grow their careers. Training is in line with our 
business strategy and designed to create reliable experts 
our customers can trust.
All new colleagues follow a 90-day induction plan and 
every employee has regular one to one meetings with their 
managers, as well as twice yearly formal performance 
reviews where future development and career plans are 
considered. 
In 2016/17 we recorded over 220,000 learning hours with 
over 80% of this completed digitally. We also run talent 
and leadership development programmes to develop high 
achievers and hone management leadership skills. 
In 2017/18 we will increase volunteering opportunities 
through an initiative with social housing charity, Abbeyfield, 
so employees so can build their communication and team 
work skills to benefit local communities.
To strengthen trust we expect high standards in 
employment practices. We regularly review our 
comprehensive suite of employment policies and 
procedures, which includes anti-corruption and bribery, 
guidance on being family friendly, colleague dispute 
management, as well as diversity and equal opportunities. 
All employees are required to read and digitally 
acknowledge key company policies. 29 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Strategic Report
Engaging our colleagues 
We are committed to communicating openly and honestly 
with colleagues across the Group and listen to their views. 
All employees are asked to participate in our annual 
engagement survey, Make a Difference. Administered 
externally and in confidence, this balanced scorecard 
gauges how people feel about working for Dixons Carphone 
and is used to monitor and improve performance, help us 
make decisions, and recognise success. 88% of colleagues 
gave their feedback in the 2017 survey, an increase of 
5 percentage points from 2016.
Our people have access to innovative information channels, 
with an emphasis on collaboration and peer-to-peer 
communication. In 2016/17 we introduced two new HR 
platforms and following a successful launch in the Nordics, 
rolled out ‘Workplace’ by Facebook to 12,000 colleagues 
in the UK & Ireland. We are an early adopter of Workplace, 
which provides colleagues with an intuitive mechanism 
to engage and collaborate on projects, partake in social 
activities and share best practice. We plan to roll-out 
Workplace across the Group in 2017/18.
We will also continue to produce 360 Magazine specifically 
for Team Knowhow and Connected, a magazine 
available online and in hard copy to all colleagues. This 
communication channel consistently receives positive 
feedback from recipients and holds the title of ‘Best New 
Publication’ from the Institute of Internal Communications. 
Employee Benefits
Our employee benefits packages are periodically reviewed 
to remain attractive and conducive to the recruitment and 
retention of talented individuals. Colleagues are encouraged 
to participate in our SAYE Scheme to build a personal stake 
in the business. 25% of our UK & Ireland workforce are 
signed up to this scheme. As part of the harmonisation of 
benefits across the organisation, we are implementing a 
new benefits platform during 2017 that all UK colleagues will 
be able to access and see the value of the core company 
benefits – such as life assurance - and choose additional 
benefits suited to their personal needs and lifestyle, such 
as childcare vouchers, eye care vouchers, cycle to work 
scheme and dental plans. 
Minimum Wage
We pay a minimum hourly rate of £7 to all colleagues in the 
United Kingdom under 21 + location allowance + bonus. 
Colleagues aged 21 and over in the United Kingdom are 
paid a minimum hourly rate of £7.50. In addition to basic 
pay we pay location allowance, where applicable, and 
bonus.
Equal opportunities 
We are committed to equality of opportunity across all of 
our employment practices throughout the Group. We strive 
to prevent unlawful discrimination in the workplace on the 
grounds of sex, race, disability, sexual orientation, religion 
or religious belief, age, marriage and civil partnership, 
gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity. We 
promote an honest and open environment and encourage 
colleagues with concerns to report issues to us either 
directly through line managers or via an independent, 
confidential integrity line. 
Rainbow Award (Nordics)  
In the Nordics, we were proud to win the Danish Rainbow 
Awards for supporting LGBT through our Valentines 
Campaign.
Diversity 
We value the benefits a diverse workplace brings, and the 
importance diversity plays in achieving the right mix of skills, 
knowledge and experience our organisation needs to reach 
its potential. Diversity in terms of age and gender remains a 
key priority.

Health, Safety and Wellbeing
Our Group Health and Safety (‘H&S’)   Policy sets control 
standards for key risks as well as responsibilities to our 
customers, colleagues and other stakeholders (franchisees, 
agency workers, supply chain and contractors)  . This Policy 
is widely displayed on noticeboards and acknowledged in 
our statutory H&S training. Our compliance with this policy 
is regularly audited.
Health and Safety Award 2017
We are proud to have received awards from The 
Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents for our 
management of Retail Health and Safety and Health and 
Safety in our Newark Distribution Centre.
Through our employee wellbeing strategy, we aim to create 
a happier, healthier and more productive workforce, while 
reducing time off through sickness and ensuring optimum 
levels of energy and resilience. Employee turnover across 
the Group was broadly flat at 29% in 2016/17. 30 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Corporate Responsibility
Strategic Report
Healthy living is encouraged through corporate challenge 
initiatives, while on-site fitness facilities include a gym in 
our main support centre, shower facilities, secure bicycle 
storage and restaurants offering a balanced menu and 
range of healthy nutritionist-approved foods. 
Dixons Carphone Race to the Stones 2016
Since our initial sponsorship in 2014, we have led the 
way in the corporate challenge space, collaborating with 
organisers, Threshold Sports, to transform the positioning 
and purpose of ultra-events into accessible ultra-
experiences, attracting a diverse range of participants: 
from people who want to get fit, socialise, take on a new 
challenge or strengthen their mental wellbeing, to charities 
looking for a demanding and rewarding addition to their 
fundraising portfolio. 
In 2016/17 over 2,500 participants chose to run, trek or 
walk 100 km along the ancient Ridgeway to Avebury Stone 
Circle, generating over three million Facebook impressions. 
130 employees took part, raising over £36,000 for our 
charity partner, The Mix. Overall, £108,027 was raised 
for a variety of good causes and 100% of participating 
employees agreed our sponsorship was positive. 
For 2017 we have donated 100 places to Heads Together, 
providing the opportunity for people affected by mental 
health issues to benefit from the positive aspects of 
participating in an endurance challenge. We are also 
working with our suppliers to further enhance the event 
experience through free demonstrations of wellness related 
tech and household health-related electrical items along 
the route. 
Average to Awesome 2016
This UK wellbeing initiative focused on transforming 
employees’ attitude to health and fitness as they prepared 
for the Dixons Carphone Race to the Stones. Thirteen 
sedentary employee volunteers were given the support of 
a personal trainer, nutrition plan and Fitbit accessories. 
After 12 weeks, we recorded their combined weight loss 
at 104 kg. The team all completed the 100km event and 
developed a strong bond. They continue positive changes 
to their lifestyle habits and there is evidence of wider health 
benefits to families and co-workers.
An Employee Assistance Programme operates 24/7 offering 
support for a range of issues such as stress, smoking 
cessation and debt management. 
We participated in Mercer’s 2016 Britain’s Healthiest 
Workplace with approximately 500 UK employees 
responding to this comprehensive company-wide online 
survey. The results provided a benchmark for improvement 
for our 2017/18 workplace mental wellbeing strategy and 
helped us to identify further actions to protect employee 
welfare and improve our ranking.
Mental health management training has been introduced 
for HR Business Partners and all colleagues receive regular 
updates and information on health, resilience and wellbeing. 
In addition, ergonomics advice and equipment is provided 
to prevent musculoskeletal injuries, along with training and 
protective equipment for installers and delivery teams. 
Ultimate Workforce 
We gave specialist military units the mission to recruit, 
train and up-skill eleven employee volunteers during a 
cutting-edge wellbeing programme designed to create the 
Ultimate Workforce. Run with support from SONYXperia 
and GARMIN, this programme combined latest tech with 
elite military training and insights to equip participants 
with key skills such as first aid, influence and persuasion, 
weightlifting, ergonomics and orienteering. 
As well as the physical health gains (the team lost 
27.9 kg / 18.1% body fat and grew 17.4% muscle)  , 
their strengthened mental resilience has prepared them 
to be effective in any Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and 
Ambiguous (‘VUCA’)   market place. Feedback from 
managers and participants has been remarkable, with 
demonstrable improvements to posture, confidence, overall 
outlook, interaction with stakeholders, team working, 
problem solving and leadership.
Connected community 
Every decision we make is driven by insights and our 
ambition to provide unparalleled expertise and services to 
help customers and businesses navigate the digital era, 
while building brand loyalty and trust. We are committed 
to being a responsible member of every community we 
do business in: whether it’s by match-funding employee 
fundraising, community initiatives or charity partnerships, 
we implement new ideas to make a positive impact locally. 
Founding Partner of Heads Together
Dixons Carphone is proud to be a Founding Partner of 
Heads Together, a campaign spearheaded by the Duke 
and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Throughout 
2016/17 Heads Together made ground breaking progress in 
helping to end the stigma around mental health and change 
the conversation around mental health from fear and shame 
to confidence and support. Our long-term charity partner, 
The Mix, is one of eight charities that comprise Heads 
Together. 31 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Strategic Report
#Thereforme 
This Dixons Carphone social media initiative paid tribute to 
individuals who had ‘been there’ for people during tough 
emotional times. Co created by Dixons Carphone and 
promoted in-store across the UK, it became of one Heads 
Together’s most successful campaigns, with over 3.5 million 
impressions and a ‘sentiment score’ of 99 out of 100. 
Mental Health Marathon
13 Dixons Carphone colleagues completed the London 
Marathon as part of #TeamHeadsTogether. Led by our 
Group Finance Director, Humphrey Singer, their efforts 
raised £33,783 for The Mix.
#DCTaking Steps
To involve all employees in our work with Heads Together, 
we launched Dixons Carphone Taking Steps, inviting them 
to pledge one positive step towards tackling the wider 
mental health issue – from identifying when a colleague 
needs someone to talk to, to volunteering or sponsoring 
colleagues taking physical steps to help support young 
people with mental health issues in corporate challenges. 
Charity partnership
We continued our support of The Mix (registered charity 
number 1048995)  . Just as Dixons Carphone matches 
customers with the most suitable equipment and services 
for their needs, The Mix supports the physical and mental 
wellbeing of young people under 25 across the UK, 
whatever their issue, through the technology of their choice. 
The Mix operates a free, confidential support service, 
available 24/7, 365 days a year, via phone, text, web, social 
media and counselling.
In 2016/17 we gave a total of £623,723 to The Mix, 
including gift in kind office and helpline accommodation and 
fundraising through employee events and initiatives such 
as our charity dinner, treks and challenges and a tennis 
tournament held at Queens. 
Our sixteen-year support of The Mix received recognition in 
April 2017 when we were shortlisted for Charity Partnership 
of the Year in the Business Charity Awards. Plans to develop 
the partnership in 2017/18 include expanding corporate 
volunteering opportunities and offering an employee 
assistance programme for colleagues aged 25 and under. 
Pennies
Pennies is a digital upgrade of the traditional charity 
collection box which offers customers the opportunity 
to make a 25p charitable donation when they pay by 
card at point of sale. We successfully trialled this tech 
in 2016/17 and anticipate a wider roll-out in 2017/18. 
We conservatively estimate a charitable revenue of 
£100,000 per annum across 300 stores (Phase 1 roll-out)   
and £520,000 per annum across 1,000 outlets.
 
Internet Matters
We joined forces with the online child safety experts to 
host free advice workshops on how to keep families and 
children safe on the internet. A series of ‘Digital Drop In’ 
events for parents were hosted in our top 70 stores and 
200,000 information leaflets were distributed by our delivery 
drivers. This activity featured in national and local media 
including the Evening Standard. Google, BT, TalkTalk, Sky, 
BBC and Virgin Media are also partners.
 
Project BluPoint
This groundbreaking solar powered device transmits digital 
content to areas without reliable or affordable connectivity, 
on any handset using Wi-Fi, FM Radio or Bluetooth. We 
sent two teams of employee volunteers to South Africa to 
deploy this new invention in 16 locations where it continues 
to make a significant impact on the lives of over 50,000 
learners and educators.
The Dixons Carphone Foundation 
(‘Foundation’)  
The Group operates two charitable foundations, The DSG 
International Foundation, registered with the Charities 
Commission, and a Dixons Carphone Foundation 
fundraising account established under the Charities Aid 
Foundation (‘CAF’) for the benefit of the charity or charities 
selected by Dixons Carphone and approved by CAF. The 
Dixons Carphone fundraising account was set up post-
Merger to deliver our ambition of improving lives through 
technology and facilitates employee match-funding 
applications and one-off donations to emergencies and 
disaster funds. In 2016/17 we donated £15,950 through 
the Charities Aid Foundation to a variety of causes. We did 
not transact through the DSG International Foundation in 
2016/17.
Kode (Greece)  
Kotsovolos is the first and only Greek retailer to create an 
online learning platform teaching kids how to code, ‘the 
language of today’. With nine out of ten parents wanting 
their children to study programming, but only one in four 
schools offering this service, Kotsovolos offers an amazing 
opportunity for children and teens to learn to code and 
fulfill the growing demand for programmers.
Other charitable support 
During 2016/17 employees donated £35,281 through Give 
As You Earn, benefiting 78 local and national causes. 
Colleagues also raised thousands of pounds for good 
causes via a variety of fundraising events and activities, 
which the business supports through match-funding up to 
£100 or £300 for teams fundraising for the same event. 
Outside the UK, Elkjøp and Lefdal continued to support the 
Red Cross Water for Life (Vann for Livet)   project, raising 
780,000 NKR (£71,968). In Denmark, 65000 DKK (£8,400) 
raised during a Christmas Foundation was donated to local 
organisations chosen by employees.  32 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Corporate Responsibility
Strategic Report
Environment
We are fully committed to meeting our environmental 
responsibilities and limiting the impact of our operations 
in a way that is both practically and economically feasible. 
Our environmental policy, endorsed by the Board, covers 
material issues including energy consumption, carbon 
emissions, supply chain and operational waste. We conduct 
activities to address each of these areas and our progress 
this year is presented below.
We have established a formalised enterprise risk 
management process that operates at business unit and 
Group level and includes climate change as a risk category. 
At asset (store)   level, climate change risks are identified 
as part of business contingency / continuity processes – 
with the identified risks mainly relating to extreme weather 
events.
Energy management
We recognise that the operation of our retail stores is one of 
our major environmental impacts and have set ourselves an 
ambitious energy and CO
2
 reduction target to help mitigate 
this.
UK Energy Consumption Reduction target
Dixons Carphone has an agreed target of reducing its UK 
energy consumption by 30% by 2020, and corresponding 
CO2 emissions by 35%.
(Measured from a 2013/14 baseline, the year prior to the 
merger between Dixons Retail and Carphone Warehouse)  
As part of our long-term review we are considering what 
our longer term targets will be and whether to adopt a 
science-based target. To ensure we meet our reduction 
target by 2020, Dixons Carphone has a structured energy 
management programme within the UK & Ireland that 
provides an overarching framework of activities and projects 
to manage and reduce our consumption while maximising 
our efficiency.
The energy consumption and corresponding CO2 emissions 
of our business have reduced year on year. For the UK & 
Ireland portfolio in isolation, we have achieved a reduction in 
electricity usage of 1.7% on a like-for-like basis and 10.3% 
on an absolute basis.

Total 309,621,812 340,494,005 (9.1%)    To continue to drive down consumption we embrace the 
opportunities of improving our efficiency through property 
development, disposals, acquisitions, our own internal 
energy efficiency programme and, where financially viable, 
utilising products, equipment and suppliers with the least 
environmental impact.
In 2015/16 we combined the energy management reporting 
platform and processes of the legacy Dixons Retail and 
Carphone Warehouse businesses which has delivered great 
results for Dixons Carphone through 2016/17. This helps 
us manage our energy consumption through the collection 
and analysis of half-hourly data at individual site level and 
ensures optimum efficiency with minimal wastage. Through 
2016/17 this work has helped mitigate consumption by 
approximately 1,834 MWh.
In the UK, part of our programme to drive down energy 
consumption in our stores includes the use of energy 
dashboards at site level. Both our legacy Dixons Retail and 
Carphone Warehouse retail sites now have access to energy 
dashboards as a visual display of their consumption profiles. 
Financial incentives are offered to business unit, facility and 
energy managers for meeting their energy consumption 
budgets or targets.
Dixons Carphone remains an active member of the Retail 
Energy Forum and the British Retail Consortium engaging 
on areas such as enhanced capital allowances for energy-
efficient technologies and the Government’s Electricity 
Demand Reduction (‘EDR’) scheme.
Capital Expenditure Projects
As with previous years, Dixons Carphone has invested 
significant sums in projects to ultimately reduce our energy 
consumption and improve our efficiency. LED lighting 
again features heavily in our 2016/17 energy efficiency 
programme which has seen c. £2 million invested in this 
technology. This year we have converted 42 large stores 
to LED lighting alongside a selection of large car parks and 
Building 2 (750,000 sq ft) of our   National Distribution Centre 
in Newark.
Solar Photovoltaic Schemes
Following last year’s successful installation of two Solar PV 
schemes at Coventry and Southampton, our largest roof-
mounted installation to date was completed in June 2017. 
A 1 MWp solar scheme (over 3,600 panels)   will generate 
approx. 940,000 kWh of electricity for our Newark National 
Distribution Centre, reducing the site’s CO2 emissions by 
over 500 tonnes per annum.  33 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17

Notes
(1)  ‘Emissions from combustion of fuel’ includes a proportion of 
private cars being used for business travel, which would be 
classified as Scope 3. It is not practical to exclude this data from 
the company’s expense records so in keeping with the previous 
years it has been included to provide a conservative view of 
emissions. For a proportion of our company cars, we have moved 
from using claimed business mileage to fuel card purchases (litres 
of fuel) this year. This is more accurate but has led to a small 
increase in overall emissions.
(2) Refrigerant data processing methodology and exclusions:
 a.  Where refrigerant top-ups are reported, we assume this 
covers all leakage across the area of the estate under that 
contractor’s responsibility, so have not estimated leakage 
from other units where no top-ups were carried out.
 b.  Refrigerant data from the Wednesbury Carphone Warehouse 
site is not included as the data was not available for 2015/16 
and 2016/17 (although this is estimated to be significantly less 
than 1% of total emissions for the Group).
 c.  Refrigerant top-ups across the Nordics has been estimated 
for 2016/17 based on the top-ups reported in 2015/16 as the 
data was unavailable.
 d.  In previous years, some refrigerant charges for new 
installations were reported as leakage which has been 
amended for 2016/17 onwards. This accounts for most of the 
reduction compared to 2015/16.
(3)  The electricity consumption figure includes Scope 2 generation 
emissions but not Scope 3 transmission and distribution losses.
(4)  Electricity and gas usage is based on supplier bills. Manual gap 
filling was conducted for April 2017 in the UK & Ireland for smaller 
electricity supplies, using an average of the consumption year to 
date. This is because this report was due before some electricity 
bills had been provided by the suppliers.
(5)  Overall floor area of the Dixons Carphone business is estimated 
to be 21,111,540 sq ft. This is split between the Dixons Retail 
business which is estimated to be 19,390,570 sq ft and the 
overall floor area of the Carphone Warehouse business which is 
estimated to be 1,720,970 sq ft. Carphone Warehouse floor space 
now includes back of house areas, contributing to the increase 
in this division’s floor area of approximately 135,000 sq ft since 
2015/16
The calculations use the methodology set out in Defra’s updated 
greenhouse gas reporting guidance, Environmental Reporting 
Guidelines (ref. PB 13944), issued in June 2013 and is being 
independently assured.
Supply Chain
At Dixons Carphone, we work hard to understand and 
manage our impact in our supply chain and customer use of 
products. We have a strong focus on ensuring our products 
are sourced ethically and are taking action to address the 
risk of modern slavery in our supply chain.
We also see our supply chain as an opportunity to help 
consumers reduce their environmental footprint, offering 
energy-saving products such as Hive and Nest. 
Ethical sourcing
We have an Ethical Sourcing Policy which reflects our 
commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our 
business relationships. Our Ethical Sourcing Policy is based 
on the Social Accountability 8000 standard, FTSE4Good 
criteria and takes into account the Modern Slavery Act. We 
also work closely with organisations such as SEDEX and 
the British Retail Consortium to ensure our policies and 
procedures remain relevant.
Our Original Equipment Manufacturer (‘OEM’) in Hong 
Kong sources many product types that are sold under our 
own or licensed brand names. This part of our operation is 
well established and has been actively engaging in ethical 
auditing / risk assessment for many years. We require our 
OEM suppliers to comply with our strict trading terms and 
operational procedures, and to implement and enforce 
effective systems and controls to meet our minimum 
standards in respect of Health and Safety, wages, working 
hours, equal opportunities, freedom of association, 
collective bargaining and disciplinary procedures. It is 
against our terms of operation to employ any forced or child 
labour. 34 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Corporate Responsibility
Strategic Report
We monitor adherence to our policies by auditing our 
suppliers prior to selection and on an ongoing basis. Where 
working practice failures have been identified, we work with 
suppliers to help them improve their working practices. 
Where this is not possible or no improvements are made, 
they will not be approved as a supplier, or will be delisted. 
During the year under review, 15 of the 25 suppliers 
classified as red failed to make improvements and therefore 
the Group did not approve them to supply our branded 
products or they were delisted.
The results of ethical supply chain audits carried out during 
the period under review are detailed below:

Modern Slavery
Our Board fully supports the aims of the Act and is 
committed to combatting slavery and human trafficking in 
our business.
In the past twelve months we have made progress to map 
our own business and key suppliers to identify those more 
at risk from Modern Slavery, not just in the UK but also in all 
countries where the Company and its subsidiaries conduct 
their business.
The Board have also agreed our Modern Slavery Policy and 
the Company have commenced a process to introduce it to 
our businesses, suppliers, agents and partners.
Our Statement and Policy on Modern Slavery can be found 
on www.dixonscarphone.com.
Waste and recycling 
We strive to deliver continuous improvements to our 
recycling and sustainability programme. All recyclables from 
our stores are backhauled to our national recycling facility at 
Newark. Across our estate, our 16 customer service centre 
depots have standardised equipment to deliver consistent 
grades of cardboard, plastic and expanded polystyrene to 
our recyclers in order to ensure we utilise the transport to a 
maximum and obtain the best value we can achieve for our 
material.
We actively encourage our employees to recycle through 
communication campaigns and the provision of recycling 
facilities at all sites.
Product responsibility 
We continually pursue ways to help our customers reduce 
their environmental impact through providing low carbon 
products and offering Waste Electrical and Electronic 
Equipment (‘WEEE’) re-use schemes.
In 2017/18 we will introduce a new OEM LED light bulb 
range. LED bulbs use 90% less energy than traditional 
Incandescent bulbs and last up to 15 years so customers 
can save over £100 per year on their energy bills (based on 
2.5 hours’ per day).
Following our acquisition of Simplifydigital we now offer our 
customers energy switching services, including our Voltz 
App, which saves them money and reduces their energy 
consumption. We are also collaborating with SSE to support 
the roll-out of their smart metering to six million customers 
in the UK.
We have several schemes in place to encourage and enable 
WEEE recycling. Online customers buying white goods 
or a TV larger than 39” are prompted with the option to 
have an old appliance collected for recycling. At this point, 
customers can also click through to our recycling page 
which gives details of our free in-store take back which 
covers smaller electronics too. In store, our sales teams 
inform customers about our collection and recycling service.
This has resulted in WEEE tonnage of 67,000 tonnes being 
collected in 2016/17 (7.8% increase on 2015/16)   which is an 
estimated 75,000 tonnes of CO2 saved.
We also work with 11 UK charities who select unwanted 
WEEE from our Customer Service Centres  which they 
repair and reuse to sell. This has helped households save 
an estimated £2,342,250 and 1,275 tonnes of CO2 during 
2016/17. This translates to a reuse percentage of 8% 
(1% increase on 2015/16).
In total, over 14,000 tonnes of packaging recycled (3% less 
than 2015/16, driven by lighter and less packaging used 
around products)   which is an estimated 16,000 tonnes of 
CO2 saved (figures from our waste management agency 
responsible for all cardboard, plastic, polystyrene and wood 
recycled across our estate).
We are also currently working on a project to improve the 
wood recycling process for the business and enable us to 
sell fuel into the UK biomass market.
Second Home (Greece)  
Kotsovolos has launched a successful recycling scheme 
which places unwanted or used electrical appliances and 
devices in new homes among families who can’t afford 
to buy new ones. The retailer collects, refurbishes and 
delivers devices to local authorities who redistribute them 
to those families in need, recycling any appliances unable 
to be repaired. 35 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Strategic Report
Re-use Innovation with HM Prisons
A three-way partnership between Dixons Carphone, DHL 
EnviroSolutions and WasteCare in collaboration with 
National Offenders Management Service (‘NOMS’) sees 
unwanted large appliances repaired in a HM Prison within 
purpose-built rooms. Inmates are trained in the necessary 
skills and then refurbish the appliances, which are sent for 
sale to charities and social housing projects. The prisoners 
are paid a weekly wage to do this. The overall objective 
will see an increase in the re-use rate of WEEE and reduce 
reoffending rates by giving inmates purposeful skills which 
they can use to gain employment upon release.
We actively engage to achieve a more resource-efficient 
economy. This year we worked with WRAP, the Waste and 
Resources Action Programme to support their Electrical and 
Electronic Equipment Sustainability Action Plan to improve 
business efficiency and gain greater value from re-use and 
recycling by setting up a WEEE trial in Cardiff.
We are also working in collaboration with Axion Consultancy 
to offer collection points at CurrysPCWorld stores in 
Stockport, White City, Bury, Bolton and Cheetham Hill. This 
collection accepts broken or working IT equipment, e.g. 
laptops, smartphones, desktop PCs, gaming devices and 
tablets. This is an EU-funded trial to increase the recovery 
of Critical Raw Materials from WEEE. The information and 
evidence gathered through the trials will contribute towards 
the development of a European-wide infrastructure plan and 
policy recommendations to support the increased recovery 
of critical and valuable materials from WEEE.

Corporate Governance Report
38 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Chairman’s introduction
I am pleased to present my introduction to the Corporate 
Governance section of the Annual Report and Accounts 
2016/17. We continue to devote time and effort to ensuring 
that our corporate governance practices and procedures 
remain ‘fit for purpose’. I set out below how the Company 
is committed to good corporate governance practice 
and effective stewardship as the foundation of long-term 
shareholder value creation.
Corporate governance
Good corporate governance is at the heart of any well-
run business. We review and update our Group policies 
and procedures regularly to ensure that they comply with 
best practice. Our Board policies, such as diversity, time 
commitment, the role descriptions of the Chairman, Group 
Chief Executive and Senior Independent Director, external 
appointments and external advice are reviewed and refreshed 
annually. The Board has reviewed our policies and practices 
against the 2016 UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
‘Code’), ensuring continuing alignment with best practice.
Changes to the Board
On 1 March 2017 Fiona McBain joined the Board as a Non-
Executive Director. Fiona brings a wealth of experience from 
her career in financial services and will undoubtedly be an 
asset to the Board. On 27 April 2017 Graham Stapleton left 
the Board to become Chief Executive Officer of honeybee, 
the Group’s software division, which will benefit greatly from 
his entrepreneurial leadership and expertise. On 30 April 
2017 Sir Charles Dunstone stepped down as Chairman of 
the Board. On the same day, I was appointed Chairman 
of the Board and the Nominations Committee, and Tony 
DeNunzio CBE became Deputy Chairman and Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee, in addition to his role 
as Senior Independent Director. The Board would like to 
take this opportunity to thank Charles for his enormous 
contribution to the Board and the business as a whole since 
he founded Carphone Warehouse in 1989. Tony DeNunzio, 
who has already made a valuable contribution to the Board, 
is sure to provide continued strong leadership for the next 
stage of the Company’s success.
Role and composition of the Board
The members of the Board are as set out on pages 36 and 
37 of this Report. 
The Nominations Committee reviews each year the 
composition of the Board, including the independence and 
commitment to the Company shown by the non-executive 
directors during the year. That review encompasses 
all forms of diversity, including gender, professional, 
international and ethnic diversity. At 29 April 2017, the 
Board had four female directors, one of whom is based 
outside the UK and who provides strong support on matters 
relating to the European business environment. 
After this year’s review, it was again concluded that the Board 
possessed the necessary skills and experience to discharge 
its duties fully and to challenge management effectively. 
As part of the annual reviews, the non-executive directors 
were asked to confirm that they continue to have enough time 
to dedicate to Company business and all have formally done 
so. As a unitary Board, the directors acknowledge their joint 
responsibility for the business’s success. We have clearly 
differentiated the roles between executive management 
running the business and our non-executives, who provide 
the appropriate level of scrutiny and oversight. In this way, 
the directors work together to challenge as well as support 
each other, with the aim being effective decision-making, 
leadership and accountability for all aspects of the business. 
Induction
The directors have continued to widen their knowledge of 
the business as a whole through formal presentations, visits 
to stores and facilities, and informal discussions. Fiona 
McBain participated in a tailored induction programme upon 
joining the Board, including meetings with key Company 
executives.
Board evaluation
The triennial external Board evaluation last year was 
followed by an internal Board evaluation this year. This 
evaluation involved an in-depth review of the Board’s 
activities, the directors’ interaction and their effectiveness in 
carrying out their roles. Further information can be found on 
pages 43 and 60.
Committee structure
The main committees of the Board are the Audit, Disclosure, 
Nominations and Remuneration committees. Each has a 
dedicated section in this Report. Beneath Board level there 
are further management level committees which report back 
to the Board as necessary.
Conclusion
We possess a strong, balanced and diverse Board supported 
by sound policies and procedures. This provides us with a 
good platform to grasp the opportunities that the future will 
bring. My fellow directors and I look forward to meeting you 
at this year’s Annual General Meeting in September.

Corporate Governance statement
The Board confirms that throughout the year ended 29 
April 2017 and as at the date of this Annual Report and 
Accounts, the Company has been fully compliant with The 
UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’).
This Report, together with the Directors’ Report and the 
reports from the Audit, Disclosure, Nominations and 
Remuneration committees provide details of how the 
Company has applied the principles and complied with the 
provisions of the Code during the year. The Code can be 
obtained from the Financial Reporting Council’s website, 
www.frc.org.uk.
Board responsibilities
The overriding responsibility of the Board is to provide clear, 
entrepreneurial and responsible leadership to the Group 
within a framework of efficient and effective controls so as 
to allow the key issues and risks facing the business to be 
assessed and managed.
Composition of the Board
At 29 April 2017, the Board comprised 13 members: the 
Chairman, four executive directors and eight non-executive 
directors, each of whom is determined by the Board to be 
independent in character and judgement and who provide 
effective challenge to the Board and the business. These 
independent non-executive directors are Tony DeNunzio 
CBE, Andrea Gisle Joosen, Tim How, Jock Lennox, Lord 
Livingston of Parkhead, Baroness Morgan of Huyton, Fiona 
McBain and Gerry Murphy. More than half the directors 
(excluding the Chairman, who at 29 April 2017 was Sir 
Charles Dunstone) are considered to be independent in 
accordance with the Code.
The Board recognises that Baroness Morgan has been a 
non-executive director of Carphone Warehouse since 2005 
and Tim How has been a non-executive director of Dixons 
Retail since 2009. The Board subjected the independent 
status of these two directors to further and specific 
scrutiny. Having witnessed their continuing commitment 
and independent stance in their dealings with the business 
and their fellow directors throughout the year, the Board 
concluded that their lengths of tenure do not affect their 
independence. Nevertheless, as part of succession planning 
and the periodic refreshing of the Board, Baroness Morgan 
and Tim How will both be stepping down at this year’s 
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’).
Fiona McBain was appointed as a Non-Executive Director 
on 1 March 2017. She will stand for election at this year’s 
AGM and, subject to her election by shareholders, will 
replace Baroness Morgan on the Audit Committee at the 
conclusion of the AGM.
In accordance with the Code, all directors, with the 
exception of Baroness Morgan and Tim How, will stand for 
election or re-election at the Company’s AGM. Biographical 
information is shown on pages 36 and 37.
The division of responsibility between the Chairman and 
the Group Chief Executive is formally defined, set out in 
writing and is reviewed by the Board on an annual basis, 
as it was in May 2017. The Chairman is responsible for the 
overall operation, leadership and governance of the Board. 
The Group Chief Executive is responsible for the executive 
management of the Group’s business and for implementing 
the Group’s strategic and commercial objectives.
The role of the Senior Independent Director (‘SID’), set out 
in writing and reviewed annually by the Board, is to support 
the Chairman, be available to any shareholders who feel 
they are unable to raise issues with the Chairman directly, 
and to discuss with the Chairman the results of the latter’s 
performance review.

Board governance matters
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that all directors 
are properly briefed on issues arising at Board meetings and 
that they have full and timely access to relevant information. 
The Company uses an electronic board paper system 
which enables the safe and secure dissemination of quality 
information to the Board. All Board and committee papers 
are sent out on a timely basis with sufficient information 
for the directors to be able to discharge their duties. The 
format, content and timely production of Board papers is 
a continually evolving process to ensure relevance and 
clarity of communication. Formal minutes of the Board 
and committee meetings are prepared by the Company 
Secretary, and / or his nominee, and approved by the Board 
and committees at their next meeting.
The Chairman meets regularly with all the non-executive 
directors, usually on an evening prior to a Board meeting 
when Board dinners are held. This provides the opportunity 
to discuss, amongst other matters, corporate strategy and 
business performance.
The Board holds meetings at a variety of the Group’s 
locations to assist all Board members in gaining a deeper 
understanding of the business. This also provides senior 
management across the Group with the opportunity to meet 
the Board. This year, Board meetings were held in Sheffield, 
UK and Jönköping, Sweden. Visiting our various operational 
locations also enables the Board to meet other members 
of the team, and to visit stores throughout the business’s 
portfolio.
New directors appointed to the Board receive a personal 
induction programme, together with guidance and training 
appropriate to their level of previous experience. Each 
director is given the opportunity to meet with senior 
management and store colleagues and to visit the Group’s 
key sites. This enables familiarisation with the businesses, 
operations, systems and markets in which the Group 
operates. New directors are also encouraged to meet with 
the Group’s auditor and advisors.
As a newly appointed Non-Executive Director, Fiona McBain 
was given an individual induction programme tailored to her 
specific responsibilities and past experience. These include 
her role in providing regulatory oversight to the operating 
board of the FCA-regulated entity and her eventual 
appointment as a member of the Audit Committee, subject 
to her election by shareholders at the AGM on 7 September 
2017.
In accordance with the Code’s requirement for directors 
to regularly update and refresh their skills and knowledge, 
training is provided as appropriate to individual directors 
and to the Board as a whole. The Board receives regular 
updates on governance, compliance and company 
knowledge in the form of training sessions from external 
advisors and in-house briefings from senior management. 
The Board has set aside time on the current Board agenda 
as appropriate for these training and briefing sessions to 
occur. Corporate Governance
43 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Succession planning
Last year, succession planning was identified as an area 
where greater focus was required. This was addressed 
by the refreshing of the Board and the appointment of a 
new Board member, Fiona McBain, with financial services 
experience. Planning continues for the future. In seeking 
an optimal balance of skills, experience, independence, 
knowledge and diversity required at Board level, the 
directors endeavour to satisfy themselves that adequate 
plans are in place to ensure an orderly succession of 
appointments to the Board and senior management. The 
Board reviewed in detail succession and talent management 
plans for senior management at the January 2017 Board 
meeting. 
Performance evaluation 
The Code recommends that the performance of the 
Board be reviewed externally every three years. The 
last external evaluation of the Board was carried out in 
2015/16. This year, the Company Secretary facilitated an 
internal evaluation of Board performance and that of the 
Audit, Nominations and Remuneration committees. It was 
not considered appropriate to evaluate the Disclosure 
Committee because it was established in June 2016 and 
had not held its first meeting at the time the evaluation was 
carried out.
The review examined the level of skills, knowledge and 
experience of the Board which involved all directors 
responding to questionnaires about themselves, the Board, 
and its committees. A summary of the results, together with 
anonymised comments, was collated into a comprehensive 
report. The Company Secretary submitted the draft 
report to the Chairman and presented it to the Board for 
consideration at its May 2017 meeting.
The report addressed all matters relating to the performance 
of the Board which included, but were not limited to, the 
roles of the executive and non-executive directors, the 
Board, Board committees, preparation for and performance 
at meetings, the effectiveness of each director, leadership, 
culture, strategy and corporate governance. Due to the 
timing of the change in Chairmanship, the Board focused 
its time and attention on the role of the future Chairman 
and the main Board committees, succession planning and 
strategy planning.
The Board is of the opinion that the Chairman had no other 
significant commitments during the year that adversely 
affected his performance in his role, his effectiveness in 
leading the Board was not impaired and that he cultivated 
an atmosphere for positive, challenging and constructive 
debate. 
Following the results of the evaluation, the Board confirms 
that all directors continue to be effective and demonstrate 
commitment to the role, including having time to attend 
all necessary meetings and to carry out other appropriate 
duties. 
The conclusion of the evaluation was that there were no 
major areas for action. Some of the themes identified for 
further improvement, together with agreed associated 
actions, are set out in the table below:
Key areas of focus Actions
1.  Boar d composition,

Risk and internal controls
Committed to effective risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system 
of risk management and internal control and for reviewing 
its effectiveness. 
• The Board and its various committees have defined 
financial authorities and operational responsibilities, which 
are designed to enable effective decision-making and 
organisational control.
• The Board has agreed a risk appetite that provides 
the reference point against which to benchmark risk 
management reviews and risk mitigation activity within 
the organisation. The risk appetite defines the boundaries 
within which risk-based decision-making can occur and 
outlines the expectations for the operation of the control 
environment.
• The Board establishes an organisation and management 
structure which operates across the business to enable 
the delivery of products and services to our customers 
and operational control of business activities in 
accordance with the risk appetite.
• The Board’s composition is reviewed periodically and 
Board effectiveness is assessed annually in line with the 
Code requirements. 
Effective risk management requires collective responsibility 
and engagement across the entire business. Dixons 
Carphone’s senior management team, operating through 
the Group Risk & Compliance Committee, are accountable 
for:
• identifying, mitigating and managing risk in their areas of 
responsibility; and
• implementing and monitoring controls which are designed 
to mitigate the risks to which their area of the business 
is exposed. The controls by their nature are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate risk and can only provide 
reasonable but not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.

Assurance provision 
Our Three Lines of Defence
The system of risk management and internal control is built 
around a Three Lines of Defence model:
First Line Business units and operations that 
own and manage risk
Second Line Central functions that oversee or 
specialise in risk management and 
compliance
Third Line Assurance functions that provide 
independent assurance
First line of defence – Business units and operations
• Undertakes annual objective setting and performance 
reviews to evaluate the performance of individuals and 
teams against the objectives and expected standards of 
conduct. 
• A ‘How We Do Business’ framework that outlines the 
requirements for each business unit to follow, in order 
to operate a control environment that satisfies legal, 
regulatory, Group and customer requirements in line with 
the corporate cultural values set by the Board.
• A minimum control environment which defines detailed 
financial, supplier funding, purchasing, payroll, capital 
expenditure, treasury, B2B, information systems, stock  Corporate Governance
45 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
management, merchandise revenue and service revenue 
controls to be applied by all business operations. 
• Operates Health and Safety standards in line with Group 
policy and procedures.
• An ongoing programme of control improvement is 
underway in each business unit to enhance control 
operation. 
• Additional targeted internal control improvement initiatives 
to enhance risk management over key risks. 
• Control processes govern the Company’s retail, 
wholesale, logistics, distribution and service operations. 
The operation of these processes provides comfort on the 
standard of our customer and service delivery.
• Each business unit maintains a risk register. Action plans 
are determined to enhance risk mitigation if required.
• Each business unit has a risk committee which identifies 
risk in accordance with the Group Risk Management 
Framework. These committees meet to consider risk 
and internal control matters for their respective areas of 
responsibility. 
• A system of quarterly business reviews covering financial 
and operational reporting by each business unit, which 
involves comparison of actual results with the original 
budget and the updating of a full year forecast.
• Appropriate training is provided to colleagues as required 
to cover risk and compliance obligations.
Second line of defence – Central functions 
• Undertakes the annual strategic planning and budgeting 
processes. 
• Defines a delegation of authorities that cascades 
throughout the Group. 
• Establishes a Group policy framework which contains the 
core compliance policies that all employees are required 
to observe.
• Under the direction of the Group Director of Risk, 
establishes a risk management policy and framework 
which outlines the principles and approach to risk 
management within the business.
• Undertakes a formal risk identification process to 
evaluate and manage the significant risks faced by 
the Group in accordance with the requirements of the 
Code and Financial Reporting Council Guidance on 
Risk Management and Internal Control. Risk is broadly 
identified against strategic, operational, technological, 
financial, people, regulatory and hazard / external 
categories. Details of the principal risks and examples of 
mitigating actions can be found on pages 16 to 21 of the 
Strategic Report.
• Maintains a Group risk register, which identifies the risks 
faced by each of the businesses, including regulated 
business, their potential impact and likelihood of 
occurrence (assessed on a gross and net basis), together 
with an evaluation of the key controls and management 
processes established to mitigate these risks. 
• The Group Risk & Compliance Committee reports to 
the Audit Committee and meets quarterly to review the 
management of risk arising out of the Group’s activities 
and to monitor the status of key risks and actions at 
Group and business unit level.
Third line of defence – Assurance
• An internal audit function provides the Audit Committee 
with an independent assessment of the Group’s system 
of internal control, through reviewing how effectively key 
risks are being managed, and assists management in the 
effective discharge of its responsibilities by carrying out 
independent appraisals and making recommendations for 
improvement. 
Sources of assurance external to the three lines of 
defence
• External audit conducts statutory audits of the Group and 
many of its subsidiary financial statements.
• Some of the Group’s activities are subject to regulatory 
control by external bodies such as the FCA.
• The operation of a 24/7 whistleblowing hotline to enable 
reporting of breaches of ethical or policy requirements.
Statement on risk management and internal control 
The system of risk management and internal control 
described in this Report was in place and effective 
throughout the period under review and up to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17.
The effectiveness of these systems is regularly monitored 
and reviewed by the Audit Committee and the systems 
refined as necessary to meet changes in the Group’s 
business and associated risks. 
The Audit Committee is supported by the internal audit 
function which provides an independent opinion on the 
operation of controls through the delivery of its audit 
programme. The system of risk management and internal 
control can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material errors, losses, fraud or breaches 
of laws and regulations.
The Board has carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Company, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. A description of these risks, together 
with details of how they are managed or mitigated, is set 
out on pages 16 to 21. The Board also monitored the 
Company’s system of risk management and internal control 
and has, at least once a year, conducted a review of its 
effectiveness. The review covered all material controls 
during the year and up to the date of approval of the Annual 
Report and Accounts 2016/17 which was approved by the 
Audit Committee and the Board.  Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Report
46 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Risk appetite
Dixons Carphone faces a broad range of risks reflecting the 
business environment in which it operates and the risks that 
can arise from the operating model. Successful financial 
performance for the business is achieved by managing 
these risks through intelligent decision-making and an 
effective control environment that details the processes and 
controls required to mitigate risk.
Dixons Carphone’s general risk appetite is a balanced one 
that allows taking measured risk as it pursues its strategic 
objectives whilst aiming to manage and minimise risk in its 
operations. The Company recognises that it is not possible 
or necessarily desirable to eliminate all of the risks inherent 
in its activities. Acceptance of some risk is necessary to 
foster innovation and growth within its business practices. 
Internal audit 
The Group has an internal audit department which conducts 
reviews of selected business processes each year. The 
internal audit programme for 2016/17 consisted of reviews 
across a range of areas documented and prioritised in the 
Group’s internal audit plan, which was prepared taking into 
account the principal risks across the Group and approved 
with input from management and the Audit Committee. The 
three-year rolling assurance plan is designed each year 
to test the robustness of mitigating controls and ensure 
procedures are designed and operating effectively. Part 
of the approval process of this plan involves the Audit 
Committee’s consideration of alignment of the plan with the 
principal risks faced by the Group. 
The Audit Committee Chairman receives and reviews 
all reports from the internal audit department detailing 
its material findings from testing performed and any 
recommendations for improvement. The Audit Committee 
receives a summary of these reports at each meeting, with 
the full reports available to all members on request. The 
internal audit team tracks and reports on the progress and 
implementation of action plans agreed with management, 
and follow-up procedures are performed once these actions 
and additional controls have been put in place to ensure 
that the new controls and / or procedures have been 
implemented effectively. 
The Audit Committee considered the effectiveness of the 
internal audit department through holding discussions 
with management, considering the quality of reports 
submitted, the timeliness of the clearance of action points 
and the perceived impartiality of the audit team itself. The 
Committee concluded that the internal audit department has 
in all respects been effective during the period under review.
Authorisation of conflicts of interest
The Company has procedures in place to identify, 
authorise and manage conflicts of interest, and these 
procedures have operated effectively. Potential conflicts are 
approved by the Board, or by two independent directors 
if authorisation is needed quickly, and then reported to 
the main Board at its next meeting. A register of directors’ 
conflicts is maintained. 
Communication with investors
The Board supports the initiatives set out in the Code and 
the Stewardship Code and actively encourages engagement 
with major institutional investors and other stakeholders. 
It believes that it is important to explain business 
developments and financial results to the Company’s 
shareholders and to understand shareholder concerns. The 
principal communication media used to impart information 
to shareholders are news releases (including results 
announcements), investor presentations and Company 
publications.
The Group Chief Executive has principal responsibility for 
investor relations. He is supported by a dedicated investor 
relations department that, amongst other matters, organises 
presentations for analysts and institutional investors. 
There is a full programme of regular dialogue with major 
institutional shareholders and potential shareholders as well 
as sell-side analysts. In all such dialogue, care is taken to 
ensure that no price-sensitive information is released. 
The Chairman ensures that the Board receives updates 
on investor relations matters at each Board meeting. The 
Board also receives periodic reports on investors’ views 
of the performance of the Company. The Chairman and 
non-executive directors are available to meet with major 
shareholders if such meetings are required, and the 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee communicates 
with major shareholders on matters of remuneration.
The Company is committed to fostering effective 
communication with all of its members, be they institutional 
investors, private or employee shareholders. The Company 
communicates formally to its members when its full year 
and half year results are published. These results are posted 
on the investor relations part of the corporate website, as 
are other external announcements and press releases. 
The annual general meeting is an important medium by 
which the Company communicates with shareholders, at 
which an account of the progress of the business over the 
last year, along with a review of current issues facing the 
business, is given. Shareholders are encouraged to ask 
questions and the directors, including the Chairmen of 
the Board committees, are in attendance to answer them. 
In accordance with the Code, formal notification of the 
Company’s annual general meeting is sent to shareholders 
at least 20 working days in advance of the meeting. 
Further financial and business information is available on the 
Group’s corporate website, www.dixonscarphone.com.

Audit Committee Report
50 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Chairman’s statement
Introduction
I am pleased to present the Report of the Audit Committee 
for the year ended 29 April 2017. In this covering letter I set 
out our key areas of activity in delivering on our objective of 
ensuring that Dixons Carphone’s financial reporting and risk 
management systems of internal control are effective and 
appropriate.
This year the Committee has continued to oversee 
the improvement of reporting and controls as well as 
responding to specific matters that have arisen. The 
assurance activities encompass, in proportionate measure, 
non-regulated and regulated operations, the international 
footprint and the risk profile of the Group. We have also 
considered the Terms of Reference and workings of the 
Risk & Compliance Committee.
Key activities
The Committee’s work, carried out during the year, 
included:
• fully considering the requirements of the Code and its 
application to the Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17;
• considering significant accounting and reporting 
judgements, including the appropriateness of the 
Group’s going concern position and longer term viability 
statement, more information on which can be found on 
pages 26 and 27;
• considering and recommending that the Annual Report 
and Accounts 2016/17, when taken as a whole, are fair, 
balanced and understandable;
• reviewing the effectiveness of the risk management 
system and internal controls, operated by management;
• reviewing all correspondence from and to the Financial 
Reporting Council (‘FRC’) following a request for further 
information on certain aspects of the annual report and 
accounts for 2014/15. Further information can be found 
on page 52;
• providing oversight of the businesses regulated by 
the FCA, including reviewing reports from the FCA 
Compliance Committee (‘FCACC’);
• considering internal audit reports;
• receiving presentations and subsequent updates from 
management on such matters as finance transformation 
programme, UK & Ireland vendor management, data 
protection, and IT strategy and governance; and
• monitoring the robustness of the information security 
environment and its vulnerabilities, and the longer term 
strategic transformation of the Company’s information 
security capabilities.
Looking ahead
Fiona McBain was appointed as a Non-Executive Director 
on 1 March 2017. As you will note from her biography 
on page 37, Fiona brings a wealth of regulated sector 
experience, as well as significant general management 
and finance expertise. The Company also announced 
that Baroness Morgan will be stepping down as a Non-
Executive Director at the Company’s AGM in September 
2017, to be succeeded by Fiona on the Company’s Audit 
Committee. I wanted to take the opportunity to thank Sally 
for her valuable contributions to the Audit Committee and to 
welcome Fiona.
As the Group continues to develop the business in line with 
its strategy and business plans, the Committee continues 
to adapt its focus in providing support and oversight in 
key and evolving areas of financial reporting and risk 
management and has requested management to prepare 
and present its assessment of the structure, governance 
and control environment of the Services business.
The work programme will be responsive to the changing risk 
landscape, the developing business model, the regulatory 
environment, and the changing shape of the systems 
(including IT) architecture. The risk assessment has been 
prepared and updated by the Group’s management at all 
levels. We are mindful of the need to remain vigilant as we 
know that not all risks can be eliminated, as articulated in 
the risk appetite statement.
I will be in attendance at the forthcoming AGM and will be 
available to talk to you then. In the meantime, if you have 
any questions, please do get in touch. 
 
Jock Lennox
Chairman of the Audit Committee

The Board continues to be satisfied that the Chairman of the 
Committee, a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of Scotland, and Gerry Murphy, a member of the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, both meet 
the requirement for recent and relevant financial experience. 
The Company Secretary, or his nominee, acts as Secretary 
to the Committee and attends all meetings. The Committee’s 
deliberations are reported by its Chairman at the subsequent 
Board meeting and the minutes of each meeting are circulated 
to all members of the Board following approval.
In order to allow discussion of private matters, which the 
auditor may wish to raise, at each meeting, discussion may 
be held between the Committee members and the external 
auditor without the presence of management. If appropriate, 
a discussion may be held between Committee members, 
the external auditor and the Group Director of Internal Audit.
In undertaking its duties the Committee has access to the 
services of the Group Director of Internal Audit, the Group 
Finance Director, the Company Secretary, and their respective 
teams, as well as external professional advice as necessary. 
In addition the Chairman meets separately with the external 
auditor and the Group Director of Internal Audit outside of 
formal meetings and without management present.

Director at the Company’s AGM in September 2017. Fiona 
McBain, the Company’s new Non-Executive Director, will be 
joining the Company’s Audit Committee, subject to her election 
by shareholders at the AGM. Fiona McBain is a member of the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.
External advice
The Board makes funds available to the Committee to 
enable it to take independent legal, accounting or other 
advice when the Committee believes it necessary to do so.
Responsibilities
The Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight 
responsibilities by acting independently from the executive 
directors. There is an annual schedule of items which are 
allocated to the meetings during the year to ensure the 
Committee covers fully those items within its Terms of 
Reference. These items are supplemented throughout the 
year as key matters arise.
The principal duties of the Audit Committee are:
Accounting and financial reporting matters
• monitoring the integrity of the interim statement 
and annual report and accounts and any formal 
announcements relating to the Group’s financial 
performance;
• reviewing significant financial reporting judgements 
and accounting policies;
• advising the Board on whether, as a whole, the 
annual report and accounts are fair, balanced and 
understandable;
• considering the going concern statement;
• considering and reviewing the statement of the 
Company’s viability over a specified period;
Risk management and internal control
• reviewing the Group’s financial controls and internal 
control effectiveness and maturity;
• reviewing the Group’s risk management systems and 
risk appetite;
Internal audit
• monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal audit function;
• considering whistleblowing arrangements by which 
employees may raise concerns about possible 
improprieties in financial reporting or other matters;
• considering the major findings of internal 
investigations;
External audit
• considering recommendation of the external auditor’s 
appointment to the shareholders in general meeting 
and approving their remuneration;
• reviewing the results and conclusions of work 
performed by the external auditor;
• reviewing and monitoring the relationship with the 
external auditor, including their independence, 
objectivity, effectiveness and terms of engagement;
General matters
• any specific topics as defined by the Board; and
• referring matters to the Board which, in its opinion, 
should be addressed at a meeting of the Board.
The Terms of Reference of the Committee were last 
reviewed and adopted by the Board in May 2017 and are 
available on the Group’s corporate website, 
www.dixonscarphone.com. The Terms of Reference reflect 
all the recent legislative and regulatory changes as well as 
recently published best practice guidance.
Members
In compliance with the Code, the Committee continues 
to consist exclusively of independent non-executive 
directors, who, along with their attendance at scheduled 
meetings, are set out in the table below. Biographical 
details on each member can be found on pages 36 
and 37.
Meetings
The Committee met four scheduled times during the 
period under review. Since the year end there have been 
two further meetings. All eligible members attended each 
of the meetings during which they were a member of the

Key matters considered during the year
Accounting and financial reporting matters
The Committee is responsible for considering reports from the external auditor and monitoring the integrity of the interim 
statement and annual report and accounts in conjunction with senior management. During the year ended 29 April 2017, 
consideration was given to the suitability and application of the Group’s accounting policies and practices, including areas 
where significant levels of judgement have been applied or significant items have been discussed with the external auditor.
Accounting and 
financial reporting 
matters
Matters considered and how the Committee discharged its duties
Going concern and 
viability statements
• The Committee reviewed the processes and assumptions underlying both the going concern and 
longer term viability statements made on pages 26 and 27 of the Annual Report and Accounts. 
• In particular the Committee considered:
 — management’s assessment of the Group’s future cash forecasts, profit projections, available 
financing facilities, facility headroom and banking covenants;
 — the appropriateness of the three-year time period under assessment, noting the alignment of the 
period with the Company’s strategic planning process, as well as the shorter-term nature of the 
retail market which the Company operates in; and
 — the robustness and severity of the stress-test scenarios with reference to the Group’s risk 
register, those principal risks and mitigating actions as described on pages 16 to 21 to the 
Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17, the latest Board-approved budgets, and indicative 
headroom under the current facilities available – examples of which included the impact of 
regulatory or information security incidents, and reduced forecast profitability and cash flow as 
a result of a significant change in consumer behaviour.
• The Committee concurred with management’s conclusions that the viability statement, including the 
three-year period of assessment, disclosed on pages 26 and 27 of the Annual Report and Accounts 
2016/17 is appropriate. The Board was advised accordingly.
FRC review • In March 2016 the Group received a letter from the FRC requesting further information following 
a review by the FRC of the 2014/15 annual report and accounts. The questions raised principally 
related to certain aspects of accounting and disclosure arising from the Merger of Dixons Retail and 
Carphone Warehouse in August 2014 and revenue recognition associated with network commission 
receivable. 
• The Audit Committee reviewed and approved the Group’s responses to the FRC. The Group’s 
correspondence with the FRC closed satisfactorily with agreement on enhanced disclosures but 
no changes to the reported results or changes in the valuation or timing of revenue recognition. 
The Group included further information in relation to the Merger, including enhanced pro forma 
reconciliations and key judgements, in the annual report and accounts 2015/16.
• Notes 26h), 1e) and 1t) in this year’s Annual Report and Accounts further build on the enhanced 
disclosure in relation to the judgements, estimates and risks associated with the valuation of 
network commission receivable provided in the annual report and accounts 2015/16.
Fair, balanced and 
understandable
• In ensuring that the Group’s reporting is fair, balanced and understandable, the Committee reviewed 
the classification of items between headline and non-headline, including consideration of the 
£115 million pre-tax non-headline charges disclosed in note 4 in the Group financial statements, 
including tax impact thereon. The assessment considered whether items fell within the Group’s 
definition of non-headline as well as the consistency of treatment of such items year on year.
• In addition the Committee gave due consideration to the integrity and sufficiency of information 
disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 along with other relevant matters to 
ensure that they explained the Group’s position, performance, business model and strategy. An 
assessment of narrative reporting was included to ensure consistency with the financial reporting 
section, including appropriate disclosure of material one-off items, and appropriate balance and 
prominence of statutory and non-statutory performance measures. In response to the guidelines 
on Alternative Performance Measures (‘APMs’) issued by the European Securities and Markets 
Authority (‘ESMA’) the Committee considered the use of such measures and the additional 
information on those APMs used by the Group provided in the glossary on pages 156 to 158.
• The Committee concluded that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced 
and understandable, and that the measures used and disclosures provided were appropriate to 
provide users of the Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 with a meaningful assessment of the 
performance of the underlying operations of the Group; the Board was advised of the conclusion. Corporate Governance
53 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Matters of significance and areas of judgement
The Committee received reports and recommendations from management and the external auditor setting out the 
significant accounting issues and judgements applicable to the following key areas. These were discussed and challenged, 
where appropriate, by the Committee. Following debate, the Committee concurred with management’s conclusions.
Matters of significance and 
areas of judgement
Matters considered and how the Committee discharged its duties
Revenue recognition • Revenue recognition is considered to be a critical accounting policy and the judgements 
are set out in notes 1e) and 1t) of the Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17. Key 
components of judgement are largely in relation to the recognition of network 
commission receivable.
• The Committee reviewed management’s assessment of these policies with reference 
to contractual terms, the Group’s historical experience of customer behaviour and 
information received from MNOs. Particular attention was paid to the consistency of 
application of the underlying assumptions used, significant changes in inputs to the 
valuation model, historical forecasting accuracy and the sensitivity to the carrying 
value of ongoing network receivables recognised to changes in key assumptions and 
the disclosure of the impact of changes in assumptions as presented in note 26h) in 
the Group financial statements. The carrying value of ongoing network commission 
receivables at the balance sheet date was £1,014 million (2015/16: £904 million).
Supplier funding • A number of arrangements exist relating to supplier funding across the Group, including 
promotional support and volume rebates. The Committee has continued to challenge 
and debate with management its approach to supplier funding, and its recognition and 
accounting treatment. In addition the Committee continues to monitor the effectiveness 
of the controls in place to mitigate the risk of material misstatement of supplier funding 
recognition; no major issues were noted. Further information in relation to supplier 
funding can be found in note 1d) in the Group financial statements.
Level at which goodwill is 
monitored and impairment 
testing performed
• During the year, management has reassessed the level at which the goodwill previously 
related to the UK & Ireland operations of Carphone Warehouse and Dixons is monitored, 
and therefore under IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ the level at which groups of cash 
generating units (‘CGUs’) have been aggregated for goodwill impairment testing. The 
Committee reviewed a detailed paper prepared by management outlining the rationale 
for the change in the current year, which included the impact of the continued integration 
activities within the UK & Ireland following the Merger, roll-out of ‘store-within-a-store’ 
operations, the integration of finance and operational management, and the combined 
reporting of results for management reporting purposes.
• The Committee concurred with management that the aggregation of CGUs at the UK & 
Ireland level is appropriate for goodwill impairment testing purposes. Total goodwill and 
intangibles allocated to the UK & Ireland group of CGUs amounted to £2,066 million at the 
balance sheet date (2015/16: £2,065 million).
Taxation • The Group operates across multiple tax jurisdictions. The complex nature of tax 
legislation in certain jurisdictions can necessitate the use of judgement.
• The Committee reviewed the judgements and assumptions concerning any significant tax 
exposures, including progress made on matters being discussed with tax authorities and 
where applicable advice provided by external advisors. The total provisions recognised at 
the balance sheet date amounted to £66 million (2015/16: £54 million). Corporate Governance

Risk management and internal control
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the Group’s risk management and internal control systems. Details of 
the overall risk management and governance policies and procedures are given in the Corporate Governance Report 
on pages 38 to 46 of this Annual Report and Accounts. The Committee reviewed management’s assessment of risk 
and internal control, results of work performed by the second lines of defence and internal audit, and the results and 
controls observations arising from the annual audit and interim review procedures performed by the external auditor. The 
Committee also ensures that all topics are appropriately covered, as defined by its Terms of Reference, with deep-dives 
of risk topics scheduled throughout the year to ensure good visibility of any potential areas of concern. Specific matters 
considered by the Committee to discharge its duties are detailed below: 
Risk management 
and internal control
Matters considered and how the Committee discharged its duties
Regulated activities • The Committee reviewed the nature of financial services regulated activities across the global 
business operations and the governance and oversight arrangements for the operation of an 
effective FCA compliance regime in the business. The Committee considered compliance 
and regulatory reports prepared by the FCA Compliance Committee and monitored key 
developments and ongoing activities for the compliance team in areas of governance, policy and 
compliance monitoring.
• The Committee was reassured that the compliance programme was being embedded throughout 
the Group, noted current arrangements at both Group and local levels and concurred with the 
business plans for further investment in centralised compliance capability.
Information security 
and IT controls 
framework
• The Committee regularly reviews the progress of the ongoing information security improvement 
programme and periodically considers and reviews the IT controls framework and related 
improvement initiatives progressed by the management team, in order to ensure that appropriate 
actions were taken. An update of the progress made against this programme has been 
requested by the Committee in 2017/18.
Data protection • The Committee reviewed data protection throughout the Group, particularly the implementation 
of the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’).
• The Committee concurred with the business’s plans to undertake a comprehensive GDPR 
Readiness Assessment and has requested management to present their findings and 
recommendations in the coming year.
Whistleblowing 
arrangements
• The Committee reviewed twice yearly a summary of all whistleblowing calls received by the 
Group, both through the independently operated hotline and other channels.
• The Committee confirmed that the calls had been appropriately dealt with (both individually and 
in aggregate) in accordance with the Group’s Whistleblowing Policy.
Internal controls • As per the obligations placed on the Audit Committee under the Code, the Committee formally 
considered a review of the system of risk management and internal control. The Committee 
noted developments in the system of risk management and internal control, management plans 
for 2017/18 and agreed the statements contained in the Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17. Corporate Governance

Internal audit
Internal audit represents an independent assurance function within Dixons Carphone, providing services to the Audit 
Committee and senior management. Its remit is to provide independent and objective advice to facilitate, influence 
and assist the organisation. It does this by evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk management, control and 
governance processes.
Whilst management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an appropriate system of risk identification and internal 
control, and for the prevention and detection of irregularities and fraud, internal audit supports management in the assessment 
and mitigation of risks, as well as reporting on the effectiveness of the systems of internal control as operated by management.
Internal audit Matters considered and how the Committee discharged its duties
Audit reviews of 
significant risk areas
• During the period the following significant risk areas of the business were included within internal 
audit reviews:
 — Health and Safety;
 — information security and data protection;
 — IT resilience, integrity and disaster recovery; and
 — regulatory compliance.
• The Committee considered the key trends and major findings of internal audit’s work and the 
adequacy of management’s proposed actions in relation to those findings.
• The Committee concurred with management’s assessment that the actions were both adequate 
and achievable.
Assurance 
programme
• As part of the three-year rolling assurance programme, audits were performed over the following 
financial processes to provide assurance to the Committee that controls were operating within

External audit
The external auditor is appointed by shareholders to provide an opinion on the annual report and accounts and certain 
disclosures prepared by Group management. Deloitte LLP acted as the external auditor to the Group throughout the 
year. The Committee is responsible for oversight of the external auditor, including approving the annual audit plan and all 
associated audit fees. The key matters in relation to external audit that were considered by the Committee were:
External audit Matters considered and how the Committee discharged its duties
Effectiveness of the 
external auditor
•  The Committee reviewed and agreed the annual audit plan, specifically considering the 
appropriateness of the key risks identified and proposed audit work, the scope of the audit and 
materiality levels applied which are detailed in the Independent Auditor’s Report on pages 88 to 
94.
•  As part of the reporting of the half year and full year results the Committee reviewed the reports 
presented by Deloitte in assessing the Group’s significant accounting judgements and estimates 
and considered the audit work undertaken, level of challenge and quality of reporting.
• Feedback on the effectiveness of the audit process in addressing areas of key audit risk was 
obtained from members of the Committee and regular attendees, members of the finance team 
and senior management within the businesses via a specifically designed questionnaire. The 
responses were then considered by the Committee in conjunction with the outputs received and 
responsiveness of the auditor during the audit process. The results showed a favourable view 
of the audit process and of Deloitte LLP as the external auditor, specifically in relation to the 
consistent performance noted for quality of audit delivery, integrity and service of the team, the 
constructive relationship and the effectiveness of the communication.
• Following due consideration of the above, the Committee continues to be satisfied with the quality 
and effectiveness of the audit.
Auditor 
independence
• The Committee considered the external auditor’s assessment of and declaration of independence 
presented in the annual audit plan and final audit report, and those safeguards in place to make 
such declarations. 
• The Committee considered the annual audit fee and fees for non-audit services, with due regard 
to the balance between audit and non-audit fees and the nature of non-audit fees undertaken in 
accordance with the policy as set out on the facing page.
• The Committee has reviewed the Group policy on the employment of former employees of the 
external auditor. Corporate Governance
57 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Policy on provision of non-audit 
services provided by the external 
auditor
Under the Company’s policy on auditor independence, 
auditors may only provide services which include:
a) audit services comprising issuing audit opinions on the 
Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the 
statutory financial statements of subsidiaries and joint 
ventures;
b) audit-related services comprising review of the 
Company’s consolidated interim financial statements, 
and opinions / audit reports on information provided by 
the Company upon request from a third party such as 
prospectuses, comfort letters and rent certificates, etc; and
c) services otherwise required of the auditor by local law or 
regulation. 
Any exceptions are subject to pre-approval by the Group 
Finance Director, and such permission is only granted 
in exceptional circumstances. Where the non-audit 
assignment is expected to generate fees of over £100,000, 
prior approval must be obtained from the Committee.
During the period under review, the non-audit services 
performed by the external auditor primarily arose from the 
interim financial review procedures and the requirement in 
Greek law for the external auditor of the company to provide 
certain taxation services. The Committee has reviewed the 
services performed by the external auditor during the year 
and is satisfied that these services did not prejudice the 
external auditor’s independence and that it was appropriate 
for them to perform these services.
The level of non-audit fees paid to the external auditor, 
which was approved by the Committee, is set out in 
note 3 of the Group’s financial statements and amounted 
to £0.3 million (2015/16: £0.4 million) compared with 
£1.8 million (2015/16: £1.5 million) of audit fees. The 
non-audit fees as a percentage of audit fees was 17% 
(2015/16: 28%), which reflects the restrictive policy 
governing the use of Deloitte LLP for non-audit services.
Consideration of auditor appointment 
and independence
The Committee continues to consider the appropriateness 
of the re-appointment of the external auditor, including 
rotation of the audit partner. Deloitte LLP has been the 
Company’s external auditor since August 2002, prior to 
Carphone Warehouse’s demerger from TalkTalk. Deloitte 
LLP was also the external auditor of Dixons Retail. The lead 
audit partner, John Adam, completed his five-year term last 
year and was succeeded by Stephen Griggs, in accordance 
with the Auditing Practices Board Ethical Standards. 
Stephen Griggs shadowed John Adam and attended the 
Audit Committee meetings prior to the start of his term to 
allow for a smooth transition.
The Company’s policy is to comply with the Code, which 
includes a requirement to put the external audit out to 
tender at least once every ten years. In accordance with the 
Competition and Markets Authority (‘CMA’) Statutory Audit 
Services Order, which is designed to align with provisions 
of the EU Regulations on external audit tender and rotation, 
and current guidance, the Company is required to conduct 
a competitive audit tender by June 2023. This will be the 
latest period that Deloitte LLP may remain as auditor. 
The Committee will continue to evaluate annually the 
performance of the auditor, in particular at each five-year 
rotation of the lead audit partner, and will recommend a 
tender for this service if the circumstances so warrant.
In accordance with International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland) 260 and Ethical Standard 1 issued by 
the Accounting Practices Board, and as a matter of best 
practice, at year end Deloitte LLP formally confirmed to the 
Board its independence as auditor of the Company.
In determining whether to recommend the auditor for 
re-appointment this year, the Committee considered the 
firm’s internal control procedures, the most recent audit 
effectiveness review and the new tenure of the lead audit 
partner, and thereby affirmed that the audit processes are 
effective and that the appropriate independence continues 
to be met. Accordingly, the Company confirms that it 
complied with the provisions of the CMA Statutory Audit 
Services Order for the financial year under review and the 
Committee concluded that it was in the best interests of 
the Company’s shareholders to re-appoint Deloitte LLP as 
the independent auditor of the Company. The Committee’s 
recommendation, that a resolution to re-appoint Deloitte 
LLP be proposed at this year’s AGM, was accepted and 
endorsed by the Board.

Nominations Committee Report
59 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Chairman’s overview
The Nominations Committee has an important role in the 
Dixons Carphone governance structure, evaluating the skills 
required to lead the business effectively and ensuring the 
right talent and experience is available. In order to ensure 
continuity of purpose and effective leadership, it is important 
to ensure succession planning obligations are met. 
The Committee regularly reviews its obligations under 
governance guidelines; the last review was in May 
2017, which included an appraisal of Board experience, 
composition, diversity, time commitments of each director, 
director independence and a review of the Committee’s 
Terms of Reference.
The Company announced in early February 2017 that Sir 
Charles Dunstone was stepping down as Chairman, and 
that I would be appointed as Chairman with effect from 
30 April 2017 from my previous role as Deputy Chairman, 
and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. Tony 
DeNunzio CBE became Deputy Chairman, and Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee, also with effect from 
30 April 2017, in addition to his previous role as Senior 
Independent Director. We are delighted that Charles will 
remain connected to the business as a senior advisor. The 
Company will continue to benefit from his experience and 
support.
On 1 March 2017 the leadership of the business was 
also significantly strengthened by the appointment of 
Fiona McBain as Non-Executive Director. The Company 
also announced that Tim How and Baroness Morgan 
will be stepping down as Non-Executive Directors at the 
Company’s AGM in September 2017, when Fiona McBain 
will be joining the Company’s Audit Committee. Graham 
Stapleton resigned as a director to become Chief Executive 
Officer of honeybee, the Group’s software division, on 
27 April 2017. As a result of these changes, the Board is 
expected to reduce in size from 13 members at the end of 
the financial year to 10 members following the AGM.

Nominations Committee Report
60 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
The Committee’s Terms of Reference are reviewed 
annually. The last review was in May 2017 and the Terms 
of Reference were subsequently approved by the Board. 
The Committee’s Terms of Reference are available on the 
Group’s corporate website, www.dixonscarphone.com.
Key matters considered
In addition to the principal duties noted above, the 
Committee (excluding any member whose potential 
appointment was being discussed) also considered the 
appointments of Lord Livingston, Tony DeNunzio and Fiona 
McBain, and the resignations of Sir Charles Dunstone, Tim 
How, Baroness Morgan and Graham Stapleton. 
The Committee also considers these matters periodically:
• an evaluation of the size, composition and structure of the 
Board and its committees;
• the Company’s diversity policy;
• time commitments of the directors;
• the external appointments policy;
• the Committee’s performance and Terms of Reference; 
and
• a review of the role descriptions of the Chairman, Senior 
Independent Director and the Group Chief Executive.
Board evaluation
During 2016/17 the Board evaluation was conducted 
internally following the 2015/16 review which was 
undertaken by an independent external company. The 
internal review included the Board and the Audit, Disclosure, 
Nominations and Remuneration committees and examined 
all aspects of the Board’s procedures and activities. Further 
details of the evaluation process can be found on page 43.
Appointments to the Board
The Committee has a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for the appointment of new directors. 
Appointments are made to the Board based on objective 
criteria and with due regard to the benefits of diversity and 
the leadership needs of the Company. External search 
consultancies are usually retained when recruiting non-
executive directors. 
Candidate profiles were developed indicating the skills, 
knowledge and experience required for each role, taking 
into account the Board’s existing composition and skill sets. 
The Committee, led by the Chairman, relied on the specific 
candidate profile developed. The Committee undertook a 
search process for the most appropriate candidates. Given 
the specific set of requirements, including FCA and financial 
services experience, there was only a very select field of 
candidates. After interviewing Fiona McBain, the Committee 
considered and recognised that she was the right fit for the 
specific candidate profile and criteria set. The Committee 
agreed that there was no further need to undertake 
additional expense in appointing a global executive search 
firm to conduct an extended search for the new non-
executive appointment. The Committee and the Board were 
unanimous in their decisions to appoint her.
Succession planning
The business requires a talented Board with appropriate 
experience and expertise. This year, the Board has relied on 
previous succession planning with Lord Livingston and Tony 
DeNunzio stepping up to their new roles and placed further 
emphasis on succession planning and Board composition 
with Fiona McBain’s appointment in March 2017. The Board 
considers no additional appointment is necessary at this 
time but remains mindful of each of the Board members’ 
tenures. Board succession and composition will remain a 
priority, as the Board is conscious that it must look further 
and wider for the leaders of the future. In securing the 
long-term prosperity of the business, the Board must look 
deeper into the pool of talent that currently exists within 
the organisation, identifying new talent and casting the net 
wider, with a longer horizon, for potential directors with the 
appropriate skill-sets to meet the demands of an ever more 
complex business environment.
Diversity
The Board recognises the importance of diversity in 
achieving the right mix of skills, knowledge and experience 
to help the organisation reach its full potential. The Board 
acknowledges the November 2016 Hampton-Alexander 
Review on FTSE Women Leaders (‘Review’), which 
recommends a voluntary target of 33% female directors 
in FTSE 350 companies by 2020. Currently 33% of the 
Board, and 25% of the Group senior management team, are 
female. 
Whilst noting the recommendations of the Review, the 
Board does not establish targets on gender balance or 
ethnicity as it believes that candidates should be appointed 
on merit. Our Board supports the benefits of greater 
diversity, which is not just gender or ethnicity-specific 
but also encompasses age, background and diversity of 
thought. The Board is conscious of the need to give weight 
to these factors in future appointments. More information on 
employee diversity can be found on page 29.
In performing its annual review the Board also looked at 
other aspects of diversity relevant to the Group. With a 
large proportion of the business in the Nordics, we have a 
Swedish Non-Executive Director on the Board to provide 
knowledge of these international markets.
Election and re-election
At the forthcoming AGM, all directors, except Tim How 
and Baroness Morgan, will present themselves for election 
or re-election. Each of the directors is being unanimously 
recommended by the other members of the Board due 
to their experience, knowledge and wider management 
and industry experience, continued effectiveness and 
commitment to their role. Corporate Governance
Remuneration Report
61 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Chairmen’s statement
On behalf of the Board, we are pleased to present the 
2016/17 Directors’ Remuneration Report which sets out our 
philosophy and policy for directors’ remuneration, together 
with the activities of the Remuneration Committee for this 
financial year ended 29 April 2017. As this Remuneration 
Report looks both back at the activities of the Committee 
for the last financial year and also forward, we have 
chosen that this statement should be from both Ian, as 
the Remuneration Committee Chairman for the 2016/17 
financial year, and Tony, as the new Committee Chairman.
Policy review
At the annual general meeting in September 2016, 
shareholders approved both our new Remuneration Policy 
and our new Long Term Incentive Plan with 98.9% and 
99.2% of votes in favour, respectively. We were pleased 
that shareholders felt positively about the proposals 
that we put forward and recognise the importance of 
the consultation process that we went through with 
shareholders and the valuable feedback they provided on 
our proposals. First awards were made under the new Long 
Term Incentive Plan shortly after the annual general meeting 
in 2016 and we plan to make a further set of awards in June 
this year, following the announcement of the preliminary 
results for 2016/17. Full details of the awards made in 2016 
and the targets for the 2017 awards, based once again on 
relative TSR and adjusted EPS, are contained in the Annual 
Remuneration Report on pages 76 and 81.
The Share Plan
The previous long term plan (the ‘Share Plan’) was a major 
element of the previous remuneration policy which sought 
to incentivise management to deliver superior shareholder 
returns through the Merger and integration of our two 
businesses. The performance of the Share Plan is due to be 
measured in July this year when, subject to the satisfaction 
of the performance conditions, 60% of the shares will vest, 
with the remaining 40% vesting 12 months later.
Given the performance of the share price over the last 
12 months, particularly the fall which occurred after the 
Brexit referendum, it has become increasingly likely that 
either or both awards may not vest. In this event, the loans 
that were provided by the Group to participants in order 
to purchase participation shares in a subsidiary company 
would be repayable. Under the Share Plan rules, repayment 
of 90% of the loan (plus accrued interest) for the Dixons 
awards and 80% of the loan (plus accrued interest) for the 
Carphone awards would be an obligation of the Group (and 
not the individual participants). The maximum loan amount 
that the individual participants would have to repay would 
be the remaining 10% or 20% of the loan (plus accrued 
interest), the percentage dependant on the terms of the 
individual’s award.
The Committee took detailed advice from both Aon 
Hewitt and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP during 
the year on the position of the Company in the event that 
the performance conditions were not met. That advice 
concluded that the satisfaction by the Group of the loans 
would trigger a benefit in kind income tax charge and social 
security contributions for the participants on the portion of 
the loan met by the Group. The Committee has determined, 
on the basis of this advice, that as participants were not 
informed of this possible outcome at the time the loans 
were taken out, and as they were advised that the maximum 
they would have to repay would be 10% or 20% of the loan 
(plus accrued interest), the Company should compensate 
them for any tax charge and social security contributions. 
Otherwise participants could claim against the Group for 
losses arising out of this unforeseen set of circumstances, 
which according to the legal advice would have a strong 
likelihood of success.
Directors who participate in the Share Plan would still be 
required to pay back the remainder of the loans (10% in 
the case of the Dixons awards and 20% for the Carphone 
awards).
Information on the vesting of the awards will be provided 
in next year’s Remuneration Report, as the vesting date is 
after the latest practicable date for this Annual Report and 
Accounts.
The new Long Term Incentive Plan operates on a basis that 
is more closely aligned with market practice, by making an 
annual award of nil-priced options. It was clear from the 
consultation process last year that shareholders welcomed 
the introduction of a more typical plan, with performance 
measures that focus on the long-term growth of the 
business and on shareholder value creation.
Pay and performance for 2016/17
This has been a challenging year for the business with 
both economic and political uncertainty. The Committee is 
very aware that much of the success of the Group is due 
to the dedication and hard work of all our employees. The 
Committee is also mindful of the current environment in 
executive remuneration. Consequently, base pay increases 
for 2017 for the executive directors will be in line with the 
wider workforce. In spite of the challenges, the Group has 
delivered a strong performance and the Committee has 
approved annual bonus payments of 103.6% of base salary, 
being 82.9% of maximum opportunity reflecting this. Full 
details of the performance targets and actual performance 
are provided in the Annual Remuneration Report on 
pages 81 to 82. No payments relating to long term incentive 
plans have been made to Directors since the Merger in 
2014.
Other matters
Graham Stapleton’s remuneration for 2016/17 is included 
in this Report as he resigned as a director on 27 April 2017. 
Graham has taken up the very important role of leading the 
development of our honeybee business and by enabling 
him to focus on this responsibility alone, we will allow one 
of our most entrepreneurial senior leaders to seek to build a 
valuable business.
We are pleased that Tony has been able to take over 
from Ian as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, 
having served as a member of the Committee since his 
appointment to the Board in December 2015, as this has  Corporate Governance

ensured a smooth transition. We would like to thank Tim 
How for his service on the Committee and as a Non-
Executive Director. With Tim leaving the Committee, when 
he steps down from the Board in September, Gerry Murphy 
has joined the Committee in his place.
As always, we would welcome any feedback or comments 
on this Report. The Remuneration Committee remains firmly 
committed to the principle of pay for performance, ensuring 
that rewards to the senior leadership team are aligned with 
the experience of long-term shareholders.

Remuneration Report – Remuneration Policy
63 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Introduction
The purpose of this Report is to inform shareholders of the 
Company’s directors’ remuneration for the year ended 
29 April 2017. This Report is divided into two sections:
• the Remuneration Policy; and
• the Annual Remuneration Report.
The current Remuneration Policy was approved by 
shareholders at the annual general meeting on 8 September 
2016 and was effective from that date. The Annual 
Remuneration Report will be put to an advisory vote at the 
Annual General Meeting on 7 September 2017.
The role of the Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) 
is to determine on behalf of the Board a remuneration policy 
for executive directors and senior management which 
promotes the long-term success of the business through the 
attraction and retention of executives who have the ability, 
experience and dedication to deliver outstanding returns for 
our shareholders.
The Committee has adopted the principles of good 
governance relating to directors’ remuneration as enshrined 
in section D of the Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) 
and has complied with those principles in the year under 
review.
These reports have been prepared by the Committee on 
behalf of the Board in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006, Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008 (as amended) and the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Conduct Authority. The Remuneration Policy (which is 
not subject to audit) details the role of the Committee, the 
principles of remuneration and other matters. The Annual 
Remuneration Report (elements of which are audited) details 
the directors’ and former directors’ fixed and variable pay, 
share awards, share options and pension arrangements.
Remuneration Policy – 
unaudited information
The Remuneration Policy was approved overwhelmingly by 
shareholders at the annual general meeting on 8 September 
2016. In line with the authority given by shareholders, the 
Policy may remain in force for up to three years.
Remuneration Committee objectives
The Board has delegated to the Committee responsibility for 
determining policy in relation to the remuneration packages 
for executive directors and other senior management. 
This delegation includes their terms and conditions of 
employment in addition to the operation of the Group’s 
share-based employee incentive schemes. The Terms 
of Reference of the Committee were last reviewed and 
adopted by the Board in June 2017 and are available on 
the Group’s corporate website, www.dixonscarphone.com. 
The Terms of Reference reflect all the recent legislative 
and regulatory changes as well as recently published best 
practice guidance.
Remuneration strategy
Put simply, our aim is to generate superior returns for our 
shareholders and the key to achieving this is our people. 
Our remuneration strategy is therefore designed to motivate 
high-performing people to deliver our business strategy.
The objectives of our remuneration strategy are to:
• attract, motivate and retain high quality talent;
• be transparent and align the interests of senior 
management and executive directors with those of 
shareholders, by encouraging management to have a 
significant personal stake in the long-term success of the 
business;
• weight remuneration to variable pay that incentivises 
outperformance particularly over the long term whilst 
discouraging inappropriate risk-taking;
• ensure that superior rewards are only paid for exceptional 
performance against challenging targets;
• apply policies consistently across the Group to promote 
alignment and teamwork;
• recognise the importance of delivering across a balanced 
set of metrics to ensure the right behaviours are adopted 
and the long-term health of the business is protected; and
• avoid rewarding failure.
In developing its policy the Committee has regard to:
• the performance, roles and responsibilities of each 
executive director or member of senior management;
• arrangements which apply below senior management 
levels, including average base salary increases across the 
workforce;
• information and surveys from internal and independent 
sources;
• the economic environment and financial performance of 
the Company; and
• good corporate governance practice.
Guidelines on responsible investment disclosure
In line with the Investment Association Guidelines on 
responsible investment disclosure, the Committee is 
satisfied that the incentive structure and targets for 
executive directors do not raise any environmental, social or 
governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible 
or reckless behaviour. The Committee considers that 
no element of the remuneration package will encourage 
inappropriate risk-taking by any member of senior 
management. Corporate Governance
Remuneration Policy
64 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Remuneration Policy table
The individual elements of the remuneration packages offered to executive directors are summarised in the following table:
Base salary (fixed pay)
• Purpose and link to strategy To aid the recruitment, retention and motivation of high-performing people.
To reflect their skills, experience and importance to the business.
• Operation Normally reviewed annually.
The review reflects a range of factors including merit levels, internal relativity, 
external market data and cost. Our overall policy, having due regard to the factors 
noted, is normally to target salaries up to the mid-market level.
Salaries for new appointments as executive directors will be set in accordance with 
the Recruitment Policy set out on pages 70 to 71 of this Remuneration Policy.
The Committee takes into consideration the impact of base salary increases on the 
package as a whole, as other elements of pay (such as pension contributions) are 
generally based on a percentage of salary.
• Maximum opportunity Ordinarily, increases for executive directors will be in line with increases across 
the Group. Increases beyond those granted across the Group may be awarded in 
certain circumstances such as changes in responsibilities, progression in the role 
and significant increases in the size, complexity or value of the Group.
Salary levels for current directors are shown in the Annual Remuneration Report.
• Performance assessment / targets Salaries are normally reviewed annually by the Committee at the appropriate 
meeting having due regard to the individual’s experience, performance and added 
value to the business.
Benefits (fixed pay)
• Purpose and link to strategy In line with the Company’s strategy to keep remuneration weighted to variable pay 
that incentivises outperformance, a modest range of benefits is provided.
Benefits may vary based on the personal choices of the director.
Provision of relocation or other related assistance may be provided to support the 
appointment or relocation of a director.
• Operation Executive directors are entitled to a combination of benefits which include, but are 
not limited to:
• car allowance;
• private medical cover;
• long-term incapacity cover;
• life assurance;
• holiday and sick pay; and
• a range of voluntary benefits including the purchase of additional holiday.
Executive directors will be eligible for other benefits which are introduced for the 
wider workforce on broadly similar terms.
Any reasonable business-related expenses (including the tax thereon) can be 
reimbursed if determined to be a taxable benefit.
Should an executive director be recruited from or be based in a non-UK location, 
benefits may be determined by those typically provided in the normal country of 
residence and / or reflect local market legislation.
Relocation or other related assistance could include, but is not limited to, removal 
and other relocation costs, tax equalisation, tax advice and accommodation costs.
• Maximum opportunity The cost to the Group of providing such benefits will vary from year to year in 
accordance with the cost of providing such benefits, which is kept under regular 
review.
• Performance assessment / targets Not applicable. Corporate Governance
65 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Pension (fixed pay)
• Purpose and link to strategy A pension is provided which is consistent with that provided to managers across the 
Group and in line with our strategy to keep remuneration weighted to variable pay 
that incentivises outperformance.
• Operation Defined contribution plans are offered to all employees. A defined benefit pension 
plan continues in operation for Dixons’ longer-serving employees, which is now 
closed to new participants and future accrual.
Executive directors may choose to receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension 
contributions.
• Maximum opportunity Normal Company pension contribution of up to 10% of base salary, which can be 
taken in whole or in part as a cash allowance in lieu of pension. However, a greater 
contribution of up to 20% may be made where necessary to recruit or retain an 
executive director.
• Performance assessment / targets Not applicable.
Annual performance bonus (variable pay)
• Purpose and link to strategy Annual performance bonuses are in place to incentivise the delivery of stretching, 
near-term business targets based on our business strategy.
These bonuses provide a strong link between reward and performance and drive the 
creation of further shareholder value.
The principles and approach are consistently applied across the Group ensuring 
alignment to a common vision and strategy.
They are based on a balanced approach ensuring appropriate behaviours are 
adopted and encouraging a longer-term focus.
• Operation Bonus payments are determined after the year end and subject to a minimum profit 
threshold being achieved before payment is due.
For threshold level of performance a bonus of up to 25% of base salary is payable. 
A sliding scale determines payment between the minimum and maximum bonus 
payable.
The annual bonus is typically paid in July / August in cash and is non-pensionable, 
based on the audited performance over the previous financial year.
The annual bonus can instead be settled in shares or a mixture of cash and shares 
which could be deferred, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Performance is reviewed by the Committee using its judgement where necessary 
to assess the achievement of targets. The Committee retains the discretion to 
adjust downwards bonus payments where achievement of targets would result in 
a payment of a bonus at a level which would not be consistent with the interests of 
the Company and its shareholders.
Recovery and withholding provisions apply for material misstatement, misconduct 
and reputational damage enabling performance adjustments and / or recovery of 
sums already paid. These provisions will apply for up to three years after payment.
• Maximum opportunity Maximum annual bonus potential for all executive directors is 125% of base salary. 
No bonus is payable if the minimum profit threshold is not achieved.
• Performance assessment / targets All measures and targets are reviewed and set by the Committee at the beginning of 
the financial year with a view to supporting the achievement of the Group strategy.
The bonus scheme has targets based on a balanced scorecard. The balanced 
scorecard may include both financial and non-financial measures, such as 
employee, customer and strategic measures. The weighting of measures will be 
determined by the Committee each year. Financial measures (such as profit and 
cash) will represent the majority of the bonus opportunity, with other measures 
representing the balance. Corporate Governance
Remuneration Policy
66 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Long term incentive scheme (variable pay): Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
• Purpose and link to strategy Long term incentive schemes are transparent and demonstrably aligned with the 
interests of shareholders over the long term.
The LTIP is designed to reward and retain executives over the longer term whilst 
aligning an individual’s interests with those of shareholders and in turn delivering 
significant shareholder value.
• Operation Discretionary awards of nil-priced options or conditional share awards are granted 
over Dixons Carphone shares.
Awards will be granted annually and will usually vest after three years subject to 
continued service and the achievement of performance conditions.
The level of vesting is dependent on achievement of performance targets, usually 
over a three-year period.
The post-tax number of share awards vesting will be subject to a further two 
year holding period, during which they cannot be sold, unless in exceptional 
circumstances and with the Committee’s permission.
Dividend equivalents may be accrued on the shares earned from any award.
Awards will be subject to recovery and withholding provisions for material 
misstatement, misconduct and reputational damage enabling performance 
adjustments and / or recovery of sums already paid. These provisions will apply for 
up to three years after vesting.
If employment ceases during the vesting period, awards will ordinarily lapse in full, 
unless the Committee exercises its discretion.
The Committee has the discretion in certain circumstances to grant and / or settle 
an award in cash. For the executive directors this would only be used in exceptional 
circumstances.
In the event of a change of control, any unvested awards will vest immediately, 
subject to satisfaction of performance conditions and reduction on a time-
apportioned basis.
• Maximum opportunity Grants under the LTIP are subject to overall dilution limits.
The normal maximum grant per participant in any financial year will be a market 
value of 275% of base salary, with up to 375% in exceptional circumstances, 
e.g. recruitment.
More details on the award levels for executive directors in 2017/18 are set out 
in the Annual Remuneration Report on page 76.
• Performance assessment / targets Performance targets are reviewed by the Committee prior to each grant and are set 
to reflect the key priorities of the business at that time.
The Committee determines the metrics from a range of measures, including but 
not limited to, market-based performance measures such as TSR and internal 
financial metrics such as EPS. The Committee retains the flexibility to introduce 
new measures in the future if considered appropriate given the business context, 
although TSR will not be weighted any less than 40% of the total award. Material 
changes will be subject to consultation with major shareholders.
The actual metrics for awards will be set out in the Annual Remuneration Report. Corporate Governance
67 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
All employee share plans
• Purpose and link to strategy Encourages employees to make a long-term investment in the Company’s shares 
and therefore be aligned to the long-term success of the Company.
• Operation Executive directors are eligible to participate in any all employee share plans 
operated by the Company which have been approved by shareholders on the same 
terms as other eligible employees.
Currently share options are granted under the Dixons Carphone HMRC-approved 
SAYE scheme, subject to three- or five-year vesting periods.
• Maximum opportunity Participants can save up to £500 per month for either three or five years, and in 
return receive a share option granted at up to 20% discount to the market price at 
the time of the invitation.
The Committee reserves the right to increase this savings limit for future schemes in 
accordance with the statutory limits in place from time to time.
• Performance assessment / targets The SAYE scheme is not subject to any performance conditions.
Share ownership guidelines
• Purpose and link to strategy Provides close alignment between the longer-term interests of executive directors 
and shareholders in terms of the Company’s long-term success.
• Operation The Company requires executive directors to retain a certain percentage of base 
salary in the Company’s shares. Executive directors have a five-year period to reach 
these limits.
The shares which count towards this requirement are beneficially-owned shares 
(both directly and indirectly).
• Maximum opportunity Not applicable.
• Performance assessment / targets The Company requires all executive directors to retain 200% of base salary in the 
Company’s shares.
Details of the directors’ shareholdings are shown in the table on page 85. Corporate Governance
Remuneration Policy

Non-executive directors and Chairman / Deputy Chairman fees
• Purpose and link to strategy To provide a competitive fee for the performance of non-executive director duties, 
sufficient to attract high calibre individuals to the role.
• Operation The fees are set to align with the duties undertaken, taking into account 
market rates, and are normally reviewed on an annual basis. Factors taken into 
consideration include the expected time commitment and specific experience.
Additional fees are payable for acting as the Senior Independent Director or 
for acting as Chair of any Board committee, and for membership of a Board 
Committee.
Non-executive directors do not participate in the annual performance bonus or the 
long term incentive plans or pension arrangements.
Any reasonable business-related expenses (including the tax thereon) can be 
reimbursed if determined to be a taxable benefit.
For material, unexpected increases in time commitments, the Board may pay extra 
fees on a pro-rated basis to reflect additional workload.
• Maximum opportunity Aggregate annual limit of £2,000,000 imposed by the Articles of Association for 
directors’ fees (not including fees in relation to any executive office or Chairman, 
Deputy Chairman, Senior Independent Director or Committee Chair fees).
• Performance assessment / targets Not applicable.
Notes:
(1)  The Committee intends to honour all commitments previously provided to executive directors and current employees, including the terms 
and conditions of outstanding long term incentives such as those previously approved by shareholders under the Dixons Carphone Share 
Plan. Details of these awards for executive directors are set out on pages 82 to 83. Corporate Governance

Fixed Pay Bonus LTIP 
Notes:
(1)  Fixed pay is based on the basic salary payable as at the start of the current year, taxable benefits and pension contributions.
(2)  Annual variable pay represents the annual bonus entitlement. No bonus is assumed at the minimum performance level. Target performance 
assumes a payment of 75% of salary (i.e. 60% of maximum) and at maximum performance a payment of 125% of base salary.
(3)  Long term incentives relate to the Long Term Incentive Plan, in which the executive directors started to participate in 2016. These are 
illustrative amounts and the actual outcomes may differ depending on share price growth. No awards vest at the minimum performance 
level. Target performance assumes a vesting of 151% of salary (i.e. 55% of maximum award) and maximum performance vesting of 275% 
of salary. Corporate Governance
Remuneration Policy
70 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Remuneration Committee discretions
The Committee operates the annual bonus plan, long term 
incentive and all-employee plans in accordance with their 
respective rules, the Listing Rules and HMRC rules (or 
overseas equivalent) where relevant. The Committee retains 
discretion, consistent with market practice, over a number 
of areas relating to the operation and administration of these 
plans. These include but are not limited to:
• entitlement to participate in the plan;
• when awards or payments are to be made;
• size of award and / or payment (within the rules of the 
plans and the approved policy);
• determination of a good leaver for incentive plan purposes 
and the appropriate treatment based on the rules of each 
plan;
• discretion as to the measurement of performance 
conditions and pro-rating in the event of a change of 
control;
• any adjustment to awards or performance conditions for 
significant events or exceptional circumstances; and
• the application of recovery and withholding provisions.
Shareholder and employee consultation
The Committee has a policy to consult with its major 
shareholders when making any significant changes to 
the Remuneration Policy of the Company. Any feedback 
received is taken into consideration when determining 
future policy. For example, consultation took place with 
major shareholders last year in relation to the Committee’s 
proposed new Long Term Incentive Plan.
The Committee also takes into consideration remuneration 
guidance issued by large investor bodies, in addition to 
the principles of good governance relating to directors’ 
remuneration as set out in the Code.
Whilst employees are not formally consulted on executive 
remuneration, a number of them are shareholders and as 
such are able to exercise their influence. We also monitor 
our employee discussion boards and employee forums to 
ensure employee feedback in general is considered in all 
our strategy execution. The Company also conducts regular 
employee surveys throughout the business. The Committee 
is kept informed of general employment conditions across 
the Group, including the annual pay review outcomes.
Remuneration policy for the wider workforce
Dixons Carphone employs a large number of people across 
different countries. Our reward framework is structured 
around a set of common principles with adjustments made 
to suit the needs of the different businesses and employee 
groups. Reward packages differ for a variety of reasons 
including the impact on the business, local practice, custom 
and legislation.
In determining salary increases to apply across the wider 
workforce, the Company takes into consideration Company 
performance and other market metrics as necessary. When 
setting the policy for executive directors the Committee 
takes into consideration salary increases throughout the 
Company, as a whole.
Discretionary share plans are extended to both senior 
management and other key members of the workforce, as 
the Company feels that it is important to incentivise and 
retain these employees over the longer term in order for the 
Company to continue to grow.
The Company encourages wide employee share ownership, 
and as such the Group’s UK & Irish employees, who meet 
the eligibility criteria, are also invited to join the Company’s 
UK & Ireland approved SAYE.
Recruitment or promotion policy
On appointment or promotion, base salary levels will be 
set taking into account a range of factors including market 
levels, experience, internal relativities and cost. If an 
individual is appointed on a base salary below the desired 
market positioning, the Committee retains the discretion to 
re-align base salary over one to three years, contingent on 
individual performance, which may result in a higher rate of 
annualised increase above ordinary levels. If the Committee 
intends to rely on this discretion, it will be noted in the first 
Remuneration Report following an individual’s appointment. 
Other elements of annual remuneration will be in line with 
the policy set out in the Remuneration Policy table. As such, 
variable remuneration will be capped as set out in the Policy 
table.
The following exceptions will apply:
• in the event that an internal appointment is made or 
an executive director joins as a result of a transfer 
of an undertaking, merger, reconstruction or similar 
reorganisation, the Committee retains the discretion to 
continue with existing remuneration provisions, including 
pension contributions and the provision of benefits;
• as deemed necessary and appropriate to secure an 
appointment, the Committee retains the discretion to 
make additional payments linked to relocation (including 
any tax thereon);
• for an overseas appointment, the Committee will have 
discretion to offer cost-effective benefits and pension 
provisions which reflect local market practice and 
relevant legislation;
• the Committee may set alternative performance 
conditions for the remainder of the initial annual 
bonus performance period, taking into account the 
circumstances and timing of the appointment; and
• the Committee retains the discretion to provide an 
immediate interest in Company performance by making 
a long term incentive award on recruitment (or shortly 
thereafter if in a prohibited period) in accordance with 
the Policy Table under its existing long term incentive 
schemes or such future schemes as may be introduced 
by the Company with the approval of its shareholders. 
The Committee will determine the level of the award, 
the performance conditions and time horizon that would 
apply to such awards at the time of award, taking into 
account the strategy and business circumstances of the 
Company. Corporate Governance
71 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Service contracts will be entered into on terms similar to 
those for the existing executive directors, summarised in 
the recruitment table below. However, the Committee may 
authorise the payment of a relocation and / or repatriation 
allowance, as well as other associated international mobility 
terms and benefits, such as tax equalisation and tax advice.
In addition to the annual remuneration elements noted 
above, the Committee may consider buying out, on a like-
for-like basis, bonuses and / or incentive awards that an 
individual forfeits from a previous employer in accepting the 
appointment. The Committee will have the authority to rely 
on Listing Rule 9.4.2(2) or exceptional limits of awards of up 
to 375% of base salary within the Long Term Incentive Plan. 
If made, the Committee will be informed by the structure, 
time horizons, value and performance targets associated 
with any forfeited awards, while retaining the discretion 
to make any payment or award deemed necessary and 
appropriate. The Committee may also require the appointee 
to purchase shares in the Company in accordance with its 
shareholding policy.
With respect to the appointment of a new Chairman or non-
executive director, terms of appointment will be consistent 
with those currently adopted. Variable pay will not be 
considered and as such no maximum applies. With respect 
to non-executive directors, fees will be consistent with the 
policy at the time of appointment. If necessary, to secure 
the appointment of a new Chairman not based in the UK, 
payments relating to relocation and / or housing may be 
considered.
Elements of remuneration on appointment are set out in 
the Recruitment table below.
A timely announcement with respect to any director’s 
appointment and remuneration will be made to the 
regulatory news services and posted on the Company’s 
corporate website.

Remuneration Policy
72 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Policy on loss of office
Service contracts contain neither a liquidated damages nor 
a change of control clause.
The Company shall have a right to make a payment in 
lieu of notice in respect of basic salary, benefits, including 
car allowance and pension contributions, only for the 
director’s contractual period of notice or, if termination is 
part way through the notice period, the amount relating to 
any unexpired notice to the date of termination. There is 
an obligation on directors to mitigate any loss which they 
may suffer if the Company terminates their service contract. 
The Committee will take such mitigation obligation into 
account when determining the amount and timing of any 
compensation payable to any departing director.
A director shall also be entitled to a payment in respect of 
accrued but untaken holiday and any statutory entitlements 
on termination. No compensation is paid for dismissal, save 
for statutory entitlements.
A director shall be entitled to receive a redundancy payment 
in circumstances where in the judgement of the Committee 
they satisfy the statutory tests governing redundancy 
payments. Any redundancy payment shall be calculated 
by reference to the redundancy payment policy in force 
for all employees in the relevant country at the time of the 
redundancy and may include modest outplacement costs.
If a director’s employment terminates prior to the relevant 
annual bonus payment date, ordinarily no bonus is payable 
for that financial year. The Committee shall retain discretion 
to make a pro-rated bonus payment in circumstances where 
it would be appropriate to do so having regard to the 
contribution of the director during the financial year, the 
circumstances of the departure and the best interests 
of the Company.
Any entitlements under long term incentive schemes 
operated by the Company shall be determined based on 
the rules of the relevant scheme. The default position under 
the Dixons Carphone Share Plan is that awards will lapse 
on the termination of employment unless the Committee 
exercises the discretion set out in the scheme rules. The 
Committee retains the discretion to prevent awards from 
lapsing depending on the circumstances of the departure 
and the best interests of the Company. The default position 
of the Long Term Incentive Plan is that awards will lapse 
on termination of employment, except where certain good 
leaver circumstances exist (e.g. death, ill-health, injury, 
disability, redundancy, transfer of an undertaking outside 
of the Group or retirement or any other circumstances at 
the Committee’s discretion) whereby the awards may vest 
on cessation, or the normal vesting date, in both cases 
subject to performance and time pro-rating. Although, the 
Committee can decide not to pro-rate an award (or pro-rate 
to a lesser extent) if it regards it as appropriate to do so in 
the particular circumstances.
The Committee shall be entitled to exercise its judgement 
with regard to settlement of potential claims, including but 
not limited to wrongful dismissal, unfair dismissal, breach of 
contract and discrimination, where it is appropriate to do so 
in the interests of the Company and its shareholders.
In the event that any payment is made in relation to 
termination for an executive director, this will be fully 
disclosed in the following Annual Remuneration Report.
A timely announcement with respect to the termination of 
any director’s appointment will be made to the regulatory 
news service and posted on the Company’s corporate 
website.
Service agreements
Service agreements for executive directors
Each of the executive directors’ service agreements 
provides for:
• the reimbursement of expenses incurred by the executive 
director in performance of their duties;
• 25 days’ paid holiday each year for Sebastian James, 
Humphrey Singer and Katie Bickerstaffe (full time 
equivalent); 27 days for Andrew Harrison;
• sick pay; and
• notice periods whereby Sebastian James, Humphrey 
Singer and Katie Bickerstaffe each have a notice period 
of 12 months from the Company and six months from 
the director. Andrew Harrison has a notice period of 
12 months from either party.
In situations where an executive director is dismissed, 
the Committee reserves the right to make additional exit 
payments where such payments are made in good faith, 
such as:
• in discharge of a legal obligation; and
• by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising 
in connection with the termination of the director’s office 
and employment. Corporate Governance
73 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Letters of appointment
Each of the non-executive directors has a letter of 
appointment. The Company has no age limit for directors. 
Non-executive directors derive no other benefit from their 
office, except that the Committee retains the discretion to 
continue with existing remuneration provisions, including 
pension contributions and the provision of benefits, where 
an executive director becomes a non-executive director. It is 
Company policy not to grant share options or share awards 
to non-executive directors. The Chairman, Deputy Chairman 
and the other non-executive directors have a notice period 
of three months from either party.
Appointments are reviewed annually by the Nominations 
Committee and recommendations made to the Board 
accordingly.
External appointments
The Board supports executive directors taking non-
executive directorships as a part of their continuing 
development, and has agreed that the executive directors 
may retain their fees from one such appointment. Further 
details on current external directorships and fees can be 
found in the Annual Remuneration Report on page 75.
Availability for inspection
The service agreements for the executive directors and 
the letters of appointments for the non-executive directors 
are available for inspection during business hours at the 
Company’s registered office and at the venue for the AGM, 
15 minutes prior to and during the meeting.
Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving the Remuneration 
Policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any 
commitments previously entered into with the current 
or former directors.
Dilution Limits
All the Company’s equity-based incentive plans incorporate 
the current Investment Association Share Capital 
Management Guidelines (‘Guidelines’) on headroom 
which provide that overall dilution under all plans should 
not exceed 10% over a ten-year period in relation to the 
Company’s issued share capital (or reissue of treasury 
shares). In addition, the Long Term Incentive Plan operates 
with a 5% in ten-year dilution limit (excluding historic 
discretionary awards). The Company regularly monitors 
the position and prior to making any award the Company 
ensures that it will remain within these limits. Any awards 
which will be satisfied by market purchase shares are 
excluded from such calculations. As at 27 June 2017, the 
Company’s dilution position, which remains within the 
current Guidelines, was 2.5% for all plans (against a limit of 
10%) and 1% for the Long Term Incentive Plan (against a 
limit of 5%). Corporate Governance

(1)  Tony DeNunzio succeeded Ian Livingston as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee on 30 April 2017, having previously 
served as a member. Tony DeNunzio was unable to attend 
one meeting due to a commitment that was planned before he 
joined the Board and could not be changed.
(2)  Ian Livingston was a member and Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee until 30 April 2017.
Only members of the Remuneration Committee are 
entitled to attend Committee meetings but the Group Chief 
Executive and Group Finance Director (or other senior 
management)   may attend meetings by invitation in an 
advisory capacity only. Meetings are also regularly attended 
by the Company Secretary (who acts as Remuneration 
Committee secretary)  , Deputy Company Secretary, Group 
Human Resources Director and Group Reward Director.
No director participates in discussions about their own 
remuneration.
Responsibilities
Responsibility for the establishment of an overall 
remuneration policy for the Group lies with the Board. The 
Remuneration Committee has the following principal duties:
• making recommendations to the Board on the Company’s 
framework of executive remuneration;
• determining the fees of the Chairman and Deputy 
Chairman; Corporate Governance
75 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
• considering and making recommendations to the Board 
on the remuneration of the executive directors and senior 
management relative to performance and market data;
• approving contracts of employment which exceed defined 
thresholds of total remuneration or have unusual terms or 
termination periods;
• considering and agreeing changes to the Remuneration 
Policy or major changes to employee benefit structures; 
and
• approving and operating employee share-based 
incentive schemes and associated performance 
conditions and targets.
Activities during the year
The principal activities of the Committee during 2016/17 
included:
• reviewing and approving the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report;
• approving share awards to senior management under 
the new Long Term Incentive Plan after shareholders had 
approved the plan at the annual general meeting in 2016;
• approving the Sharesave grant;
• assessing the performance of executive directors against 
pre-determined targets set for the 2015/16 annual bonus 
and approving the payments;
• agreeing design of the 2016/17 annual bonus including 
performance measures and targets;
• reviewing the current Share Plan and agreeing what 
actions to take in the event that the awards under the 
Share Plan do not vest in 2017;
• monitoring the developments in the corporate governance 
environment and investor expectations; and
• noting remuneration practices across the Group.
Advice
The Committee appointed Aon Hewitt in April 2016 as 
independent advisors, having used Towers Watson prior 
to this. Aon Hewitt is engaged to provide advice to the 
Committee and to work with the directors on matters 
relating to the Group’s executive remuneration and its long 
term incentives. They are members of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and operate under its code of conduct in 
relation to the provision of executive remuneration advice in 
the UK and have confirmed that they adhered to the Code 
during 2016/17 for all remuneration services provided to 
the Group. Aon Hewitt received fees of £92,000 (2015/16: 
£26,000 to Towers Watson) in relation to the provision of 
those services. In addition, during the year, the Committee 
took external legal advice from Aon Hewitt and Freshfields 
Bruckhaus Deringer LLP with respect to the awards under 
the Share Plan. Aon Hewitt also provided advice to the 
Company in respect of remuneration for the honeybee 
business, but the Committee is satisfied that Aon Hewitt 
continues to provide independent and objective advice to 
the Committee.
External directorships
The policy relating to external directorships is outlined in the 
Remuneration Policy; the following external directorships 
were undertaken and the fees retained by the executive 
directors:
• Andrew Harrison has been a non-executive director 
of Ocado Group plc during 2016/17 and was paid a fee of 
£50,000 for the year to 29 April 2017.
• Sebastian James has been a non-executive director of 
Direct Line Insurance Group plc during 2016/17 and was 
paid a fee of £90,000 for the year to 29 April 2017.
• Katie Bickerstaffe has been a non-executive director of 
Scottish and Southern Energy plc during 2016/17 and 
was paid a fee of £79,500 for the year to 29 April 2017.
• Humphrey Singer has been a non-executive director 
of Taylor Wimpey plc during 2016/17 and was paid 
a fee of £59,000 for the year to 29 April 2017.
How the Remuneration Policy will be applied in 2017/18

year, with effect from 29 April 2017:

Andrew Harrison 561 11 572
Humphrey Singer 485 9 494
Katie Bickerstaffe 510 10 520
ii)   Pension Contributions
Company pension contributions or allowance in lieu will 
continue in 2017/18 at their current levels of 10% for 
Sebastian James, Humphrey Singer and Katie Bickerstaffe 
and 5% for Andrew Harrison.
iii)   Annual performance bonus
The maximum annual bonus for 2017/18 will be 125% of 
base salary and will operate on a similar basis as in the 
previous year. The measures have been selected to reflect 
the Group’s key objectives and are aligned to the Group’s 
balanced scorecard, with a minimum profit gate that must 
be achieved before any bonus is paid out. The proposed 
target levels for the year have been set to be challenging 
relative to the business plan. The Committee feels that 
specific targets relating to the 2017/18 bonus scheme 
are currently commercially sensitive and as such will not 
be disclosed. Retrospective disclosure of the targets and 
performance against them will be provided in next year’s 
Remuneration Report. Corporate Governance
Annual Remuneration Report
76 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
The performance metrics and their weightings for 2017/18 
are shown in the table below:
 
Weighting (as a percentage of 
maximum bonus 
opportunity)  
EBIT 60%
Net debt 10%
ROCE 10%
Customer Net Promoter Score 10%
Employee engagement 10%
Recovery and withholding provisions apply for material 
misstatement, misconduct and reputational damage 
enabling performance adjustments and / or recovery of 
sums already paid. These provisions will apply for up to 
three years after payment.
iv)   L TIP
In line with the new LTIP as approved by shareholders 
at the annual general meeting on 8 September 2016, the 
Committee intends to make an award of 275% of base 
salary to each of the executive directors shortly after the 
announcement of the results for the 2016/17 financial year. 
These awards will vest after three years based on continued 
service and the achievement of the performance measures 
noted below.
These awards will be subject to a further two-year post 
vesting holding period, during which the executive director 
is not permitted to sell any shares vesting, other than those 
required to settle any tax obligations.
For 2017/18 these awards will be subject to two equally 
weighted performance conditions. Half of the awards 
will be subject to the achievement of a relative TSR 
performance condition, measured against the companies 
ranked FTSE 51-150 at the start of the performance period. 
The remaining half of the awards will be subject to the 
achievement of adjusted EPS growth targets.
The relative TSR condition will be assessed over a three-
year period, with vesting determined as follows:
Rank of Company TSR against Comparator 
Group TSR
 
% of TSR element vesting
Below Median 0%
Median 25%
Between Median and Upper-
Quartile
Pro rata between 25% 
and 100% on a straight-
line basis
Upper Quartile or above 100%
EPS growth will be assessed over a three-year period with 
vesting to be determined as follows:
Three-year adjusted EPS growth to the end of 
the 2019/20 financial year
 
% of EPS element vesting
Below 7.5% 0%
7.5% 25%
Between 7.5% and 20% Pro rata between 25% 
and 100% on a straight-
line basis
20% or above 100%
The EPS growth targets take into account a number of 
inputs including market consensus at the time of the award, 
the market within which the Company is operating and the 
higher starting EPS than the previous award. Calculations of 
the achievement against the targets will be independently 
performed and approved by the Committee. The Committee 
will retain discretion to adjust for material events which 
occur during the performance period and will make full and 
clear disclosure of any such adjustments in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, together with details of the achieved 
levels of performance, as determined by the above 
definitions at the end of the performance period.
Awards will be subject to recovery and withholding 
provisions for material misstatement, misconduct and 
reputational damage enabling performance adjustments and 
/ or recovery of sums already paid. These provisions will 
apply for up to three years after vesting.

Percentage change in remuneration
The table below provides the percentage change in remuneration for the Group Chief Executive and the percentage 
change for all UK head office-based employees as this group provides the best like-for-like comparison. The majority of the 
UK head office-based employees (c. 94%) work for the UK & Ireland business and are bonused against the performance 
of that business, which for 2016/17 had a lower level of payout compared with those bonused on Group performance. 
Changes in salary relating to changes in roles and / or responsibilities have been excluded from the increase presented for 
the wider Group.

(5)    The taxable benefits of Graham Stapleton includes the waiver of a loan, together with accrued interest, of £880,268 relating to a long term 
incentive scheme of Carphone Warehouse that he took part in prior to him becoming a director of the Company. The scheme vested 
following the sale of the Best Buy Europe business and awards became exercisable during 2013, but all shares awarded were subject to 
a sales restriction until 2015. At the time of exercise Graham Stapleton, along with the other participants, was provided with a company 
loan to be used to settle the outstanding tax liabilities that were created at the point of exercise. During 2015, the sales restrictions elapsed 
and at that time the Company confirmed the writing off of the outstanding loan. This decision reflected the treatment afforded to other 
participants of this plan and the past practice used by Carphone Warehouse. This is a legacy, pre-Merger obligation made before Graham 
Stapleton was appointed to the Board.

Long term incentive plans (LTIP)  
Awards made under the legacy Share Plan will vest in July 2017 (60%)   and July 2018 (40%), subject to satisfaction of 
performance conditions  .
Details of the awards made and the loans granted to the directors to enable them to subscribe for shares under the Share 
Plan are detailed later in this Report. The Chairmen’s Statement at the start of the Report explains the steps that will be 
taken in the event that either or both the awards do not vest.
LTIP Awards made during 2016/17
Nil cost option awards were made to executive directors in September 2016 following approval of the new LTIP 
by shareholders at the annual general meeting. Half of each award is subject to the achievement of a relative TSR 
performance condition, measured against the companies ranked FTSE 51-150 at the start of the performance period. The 
remaining half of each award will be subject to the achievement of adjusted EPS growth targets.
The vesting level of the relative TSR condition will be determined as follows:
Rank of Company TSR against Comparator Group TSR % of TSR element vesting
Below Median 0%
Median 25%
Between Median and Upper Quartile Pro rata between 25% and  
100% on a straight-line  
basis
Upper Quartile or above 100%
 
The vesting level of the EPS condition will be determined as follows:
Three-year adjusted EPS growth to the end of the 
2018/19 financial year
 
% of EPS element vesting
Below 10% 0%
10% 25%
Between 10% and 30% Pro rata between 25% and

The maximum bonus opportunity for all executive directors is 125% of base salary based on performance in the 12-month 
period to the end of the financial year.
The Committee determined at the beginning of the year that the disclosure of performance targets were commercially 
sensitive and therefore these were not disclosed in last year’s directors’ remuneration report. This was because targets 
were set within the context of a longer term business plan and this disclosure could give information to competitors to 
the detriment of business performance. The Committee has, however, disclosed in the table overleaf the targets on a 
retrospective basis and the actual performance against these. Corporate Governance
Annual Remuneration Report
82 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
The maximum annual bonus of 125% of base salary is payable at the maximum level of performance, 25% of base salary 
on achievement of threshold performance and 75% of base salary on achievement of target performance.

Overall bonus payments reflect strong business performance paying out at 82.9% of maximum opportunity and will be 
paid in cash. The Committee is comfortable that the result is an appropriate reflection of overall performance during the 
year under review. The bonus amounts to be paid to the executive directors in respect of 2016/17 are set out in the single 
figure of directors’ remuneration table on page 79.
Non-executive directors’ and Chairman’s fees
The fees for the independent non-executive directors, including the Deputy Chairman, are determined by the Board 
(excluding non-executive directors)   after considering external market research and are reviewed on an annual basis. 
Factors taken into consideration include the required time commitment, specific experience and / or qualifications. A base 
fee is payable and additional fees are paid for chairing and membership of committees. The Chairman is not involved in the 
setting of his own salary which is dealt with by the Remuneration Committee annually. Non-executive directors receive no 
variable pay and receive no additional benefits, except in situations where an executive director becomes a non-executive 
director and benefit and pension arrangements continue.
The Chairman, and Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Director receive all-inclusive fees reflecting their duties. 
Other independent non-executive directors received a basic fee of £60,000 (2015/16: £60,000)   and additional fees as set 
out in the table below for chairing or membership of committees. Fees will remain unchanged for 2017/18, other than the 
increase in fee for the Chairman as detailed earlier in this Report.

Directors’ interests in the Share Plan
The executive directors participate in the Dixons Carphone (formerly Carphone Warehouse Group plc)   Share Plan approved 
by Carphone Warehouse shareholders. Participants acquired at market value participation shares in a subsidiary company 
that holds the Company’s interests in the Group’s main operating businesses. The Group granted loans to participants at a 
commercial rate of interest to acquire the shares. Loans are ordinarily repayable in full if performance conditions are met.
The performance of the plan will be measured at the end of the performance period in July 2017 and subject to satisfaction 
of the performance conditions, 60% of the shares vest, with 40% deferred for a further year. If the awards vest, the value of 
the shares held by participants will be based on the incremental value (if any)   of Dixons Carphone in excess of the opening 
valuation together with the minimum return on invested capital. These shares would then be purchased by the Company 
for cash and / or the Company’s ordinary shares.
The total pool for distribution to participants is subject to a cap of 4% of the total issued share capital of the Company 
on the measurement date. Under the Share Plan there are now two pools, one for the original grant in December 2013 
and one for the second grant in October 2014, each being subject to a cap of 2% of the total issued share capital of the 
Company. Corporate Governance
83 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
The Share Plan is designed to share 10% of the incremental value created in Dixons Carphone in excess of an opening 
valuation (assessed over an appropriate period)   and beyond an annual rate of return of 7% on invested capital. The plan 
is also underpinned by a minimum annual compound TSR growth of 5% and outperformance of the median TSR of the 
constituents of the FTSE 250 Index.
The table below shows the allocation to the executive directors of participation shares in the subsidiary, Dixons Carphone 
Holdings Limited (previously known as New CPW Limited)  , in relation to the Share Plan, together with details of the loans

87 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are 
required to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with Financial 
Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. Under company law the directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the 
profit or loss of the Company and the Group for that period. 
In preparing the Company financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ has been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ requires that directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and 
the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Group’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole;
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of 
the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face; and
• the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and the Company’s performance, business model and 
strategy.

Opinion on the financial statements of Dixons Carphone plc
In our opinion, 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 
29 April 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRSs’)   as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice, including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise:
• the Consolidated income statement;
• the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, 
• the Consolidated balance sheet, 
• the Consolidated statement of changes in equity, 
• the Consolidated cash flow statement, 
• the Company balance sheet, the Company statement of changes in equity; and
• the related notes 1 to 33 and C1 to C10. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable 
law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice)  , including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’.
Summary of our audit approach
Key risks The key risks that we identified in the current year were:
• impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;
• revenue recognition – UK network commissions;
• UK supplier funding;
• inventory provisioning; and
• tax provisioning.
Last year our report included an additional risk in relation to property rationalisation 
provisioning. This related to a non-recurring charge in the prior year, and, as there has been 
no equivalent restructuring charge in the current year, is no longer significant to our audit 
approach. We have included an additional risk this year in relation to tax provisioning given 
the increase in quantum of the provision for uncertain tax positions in the year.
Materiality The materiality that we used in the current year was £21.5 million which was determined on 
the basis of 5% of adjusted headline profit before tax, consistent with the previous year. 
Scoping Our full scope audit procedures provided coverage at the Group’s key locations, being the 
retail operations in the UK and Nordics, representing 90% of the Group’s revenue and 85% 
of profit before tax.
Significant change in 
our audit approach
There have been no significant changes in our audit approach in the current year other than 
the removal of property rationalisation provisioning risk and addition of tax provisioning risk 
as mentioned in the key risks section above. 
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB 
As explained in note 1a)   to the Group financial statements, in addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs  
as adopted by the European Union, the Group has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (‘IASB’)  . Financial Statements
89 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
Going Concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement 
regarding the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting 
contained within note 1a)   to the financial statements and the directors’ 
statement on the longer-term viability of the Group contained within the 
strategic report.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to:
• the directors’ confirmation on page 45 that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity;
• the disclosures on pages 16-21 that describe those risks and explain 
how they are being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ statement in note 1a)   to the financial statements about 
whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material 
uncertainties to the Group’s ability to continue to do so over a period 
of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements; and
• the directors’ explanation on pages 26-27 as to how they have assessed 
the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why 
they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We confirm that we have nothing 
material to add or draw attention to in 
respect of these matters.
We agreed with the directors’ 
adoption of the going concern basis 
of accounting and we did not identify 
any such material uncertainties. 
However, because not all future events 
or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors and confirm that we are independent of the Group 
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
those standards.
We confirm that we are independent 
of the Group and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with those standards. We 
also confirm we have not provided any 
of the prohibited non-audit services 
referred to in those standards.
Our assessment of the risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, 
the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. Financial Statements
Independent Auditor’s report
90 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Last year our report included an additional risk in relation to property rationalisation provisioning which was announced 
and commenced in that year and is no longer significant to our audit approach in the current year. We have included 
an additional risk this year in relation to tax provisioning given the increase in quantum of the provision for uncertain tax 
positions in the year. The other risks set out below are consistent with those identified in the previous year. 
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk Key observations
Impairment of goodwill and other 
acquisition intangibles 
The Group has significant acquisition 
related intangible assets, including 
goodwill, (£3,433 million at 29 April 
2017 comprising £3,111 million of 
goodwill and £322 million of acquisition 
intangibles)   primarily related to the 
CPW Europe and Dixons Retail plc 
acquisitions in previous years. The 
Group’s assessment of impairment of 
acquisition related intangible assets is 
a judgemental process which requires 
estimates concerning the future cash 
flows and associated discount rates and 
growth rates based on management’s 
projections of future business 
performance and prospects. The key 
judgements and estimates involved are 
described in more detail in the Audit 
Committee report and in notes 1k), 1l) 
and 9 to the Group financial statements.
We evaluated the design and implementation of 
controls around the preparation of the impairment 
models prepared by management. We also 
assessed the identification of group’s of cash 
generating units at which the level of goodwill is 
monitored.
We assessed the assumptions used by 
management in the impairment models for 
goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets, 
including specifically the cash flow projections, 
discount rates (utilising the assistance of our 
valuation specialists)  , and long term growth 
rates used against historical performance, our 
understanding of the future prospects of the 
business and comparison against market rates at 
the year end. 
We also considered the appropriateness of the 
sensitivities applied by management.
We audited the mechanics of the impairment 
models prepared by management.
We concur with the 
treatment adopted in relation 
to the impairment of goodwill 
and other acquisition 
intangibles and are satisfied 
that the assumptions in 
the impairment model are 
within an acceptable range. 
We are satisfied with the 
sensitivities applied by 
management and concur 
that headroom remains 
following the application of 
these sensitivities.
Revenue recognition – UK network 
commissions 
The monetary value of commission 
receivable on sales (£1,014 million at 
29 April 2017)  , being commission for 
which there is a contractual entitlement 
based on mobile phone connections 
already made, and for which there are 
no ongoing performance obligations, 
is dependent on consumer behaviour 
beyond the point of sale. Management 
is therefore required to exercise 
judgement in respect of the level of 
consumer default within the contract 
period, consumer renewals, expected 
levels of consumer spend and 
consumer behaviour beyond the initial 
contract period and recognise network 
commissions when they are considered 
to be reliably measurable. The key 
judgements and estimates involved are 
described in more detail in the Audit 
Committee report and in notes 1e), 
1t) and 26h) to the Group financial 
statements.
We evaluated the design and implementation of 
both the relevant manual and automated controls 
over the revenue recognition process in respect 
of commission receivable, utilising IT specialists 
to assist with testing of automated controls. In 
addition we tested whether these controls were 
operating effectively throughout the period.
We tested the valuation of revenue recognised 
through review of the contractual arrangements, 
substantive testing of management assumptions 
including tenure, line rental, and churn to data 
received from networks and testing of cash 
receipts.
We reviewed management’s assessment of 
the accuracy of historical estimates against 
subsequent cash received to consider the 
appropriateness of the historical data as a 
measure of expected future behaviours. We also 
assessed any changes in estimate in comparison 
to the prior year and reviewed year on year 
movement in key assumptions.
We concur with the 
treatment adopted in relation 
to revenue recognition of UK 
network commissions and 
the assumptions applied by 
management are considered 
to be appropriate. In 
particular we are satisfied, 
based on management’s 
assessment and our testing, 
that historical data reflects 
the directors’ best estimate 
of expected future trends 
and, as a result, we consider 
that the revenue recognised 
meets the IAS 18 Revenue 
requirement of being reliably 
measurable. We also agree 
that the disclosures relating 
to network commissions, 
including disclosure of 
the change in estimate 
made during the year of 
£21 million, provide an 
appropriate understanding 
of the estimates taken by 
management. Financial Statements

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk Key observations
UK supplier funding
The Group holds a number of 
significant funding arrangements with 
suppliers, primarily relating to the 
UK retail operations. Agreements in 
relation to supplier funding are based 
predominantly on volume related 
targets, for both purchases and sales, 
and are most commonly agreed as a 
fixed percentage of target purchases 
up front. These targets are generally a 
mix of quarterly and annual targets. The 
timing of recognition of this income is 
sometimes judgemental, in particular 
where the target period for measuring 
target achievements spans the year 
end and it is necessary to ensure 
there is sufficient evidence justifying 
recognition. The key judgements and 
estimates involved are described in 
more detail in the Audit Committee 
report.
We updated our understanding of the Group’s 
key supplier funding arrangements. As part of 
this, we met with the key individuals responsible 
for the supplier funding accounting process, we 
evaluated the design and implementation of the 
key controls in operation, principally focused on 
those that determine the appropriate timing of 
recognition for supplier funding balances, and, 
for certain key controls, tested the operating 
effectiveness of these throughout the year. In 
addition, we performed an analytical assessment 
of movements in supplier funding throughout the 
current year to historical trends.
To ensure there is sufficient evidence to support 
the recognition of supplier funding, our sample 
procedures have comprised a mixture of 
obtaining confirmations directly from suppliers 
and recalculating amounts with reference to 
signed supplier contracts.
We also considered the adequacy of the supplier 
funding related disclosure within the Group’s 
financial statements.
We concur with the 
treatment adopted and 
amounts recognised in 
relation to UK supplier 
funding. We consider that 
the disclosure provided with 
respect to supplier funding 
provides an appropriate 
understanding of the types 
of income received and 
the impact on the Group’s 
balance sheet as at 29 April 
2017.
Inventory provisioning
Inventory is a significant balance for the 
Group (£1,101 million at 29 April 2017)   
and there are a number of judgemental 
areas around valuation based on 
estimates including obsolescence 
and shrinkage provisioning. This risk 
has a significant effect on our audit 
strategy, the allocation of resources in 
the audit and directing the efforts of 
the engagement team in the consumer 
electronics side of the business 
only, given the nature and relative 
significance of the inventory balances 
within each part of the Group. Further 
information in relation to this area is 
discussed in note 1p) to the Group 
financial statements.
We evaluated the design and implementation, and 
performed testing of the operating effectiveness, 
of controls around the inventory business cycle 
and attended a sample of inventory counts at 
35 stores and the distribution centres across the 
UK and Nordics consumer electricals businesses, 
including visiting the Group’s main distribution 
centre in Newark on 5 separate occasions, which 
enables us to assess management’s processes 
for monitoring inventory. 
We verified a sample of inventory to assess 
whether it is valued at the lower of cost and 
net realisable value. We reviewed, recalculated 
and assessed the inventory provisioning for 
reasonableness, including challenging the 
appropriateness of provisioning with reference 
to inventory ageing, both historical and post year 
end performance and a review of the provision 
as a percentage of gross stock year-on-year. We 
also considered the impact of range changes and 
other specific known areas of overstock on the 
required provision calculation.
We concur with the 
treatment adopted in 
relation to inventory 
provisioning, and believe 
that management’s inventory 
provision methodology 
includes a reasonable 
consideration of the ageing 
of inventory and the 
recoverable amount of the 
inventory value. Financial Statements

Tax provisioning
The Group operates in a number of 
different tax jurisdictions. The nature 
of the Group’s operations and related 
transactions can give rise to uncertain 
tax treatments, including with respect 
to transfer pricing, thereby requiring 
the use of estimates and assumptions 
which may be subsequently challenged 
by the relevant tax authorities. The 
Group has recognised provisions in 
relation to uncertain tax positions of 
£66 million at 29 April 2017. 
Further information in this area is 
discussed in the Audit Committee 
report and in note 1t) to the financial 
statements.
We used our internal tax specialists to evaluate 
and test management’s assumptions in respect 
of tax related provisions, including assessment 
against local tax legislation and review of 
supporting documentation. 
In assessing the provisions we have considered 
the tax environment in which the Group operates, 
the outcome of past settlements and the status 
of matters being discussed with tax authorities. 
Our tax specialists reviewed correspondence with 
tax authorities as well as reviewing the opinions 
or other support received from external advisors 
which management has utilised in calculating the 
provisions.
We concur with the 
treatment adopted and 
amounts recognised 
in relation to taxation 
provisioning, and believe 
that management’s 
provisioning methodology 
includes a reasonable 
consideration of all uncertain 
positions.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the 
economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in 
planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work. Based on our professional judgement, we 
determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality £21.5 million (2015/16: £17.5 million)  
Basis for determining 
materiality
We have determined materiality on the basis of 5% of adjusted headline profit before tax. In 
using adjusted headline profit before tax we have followed the Group’s definition of headline 
results in note 1a) and adjusted this to add back the amortisation of acquisition intangibles 
and pension finance costs due to their recurring nature. We have calculated materiality on a 
consistent basis with the previous year and the increase in materiality in the current year is 
due to the increase in the Group’s headline profit before tax.
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
We have assessed the use of a headline measure to be appropriate as this continues to be 
a key driver of business value, is a critical component of the financial statements, and the 
main measure which management uses to monitor the performance of the business and 
communicate this to shareholders.
Significant change in 
our audit approach
There have been no significant changes in our audit approach in the current year other than 
the removal of property rationalisation provisioning risk as mentioned in the key risks section 
above. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £1.0 million 
(2015/16: £0.6 million)  , as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide 
controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our 
Group audit scope primarily on the audit work of the retail operations in the UK and the Nordics, which is consistent with 
the previous year. Each of these components requires a local statutory audit. 
These locations represent the principal business units and account for approximately 90% of the Group’s revenue from 
continuing operations (2015/16: 94%)   and 87% of the Group’s headline profit before tax (2015/16: 84%)  . Each location 
was selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement 
identified above. Our audit work at these locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity 
which were lower than group materiality and ranged from £11.8 million to £12.9 million (2015/16: £3 million to £10 million)  .  Financial Statements
93 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
At the Dixons Carphone plc parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical 
procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated 
financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances.
The Group audit team is closely involved in the audit of the UK components, being the largest part of the Group, 
throughout the year including attendance at key audit planning and closing meetings. In addition, the Group audit team 
continued to follow a programme of planned visits to overseas components that has been designed so that a senior 
member of the group audit team visits the most significant locations where the Group audit scope was focused at least 
once each year. For the year ended 29 April 2017, senior members of the Group audit team, including the senior statutory 
auditor, visited Norway, where the Nordics head office is located and a sub consolidation is performed, on two occasions. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006;
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we have not identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns.
We have nothing to 
report in respect of 
these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain 
disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns.
We have nothing to 
report arising from 
these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
We have nothing to 
report arising from our 
review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland)  , we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of 
the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies 
between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the directors’ statement that they 
consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual 
report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee 
which we consider should have been disclosed.
We confirm that we 
have not identified any 
such inconsistencies or 
misleading information. Financial Statements

Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland)  . We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland)  . Our audit methodology and 
tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and 
systems include our dedicated professional standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the 
financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

1 Accounting policies
a)   Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
on a going concern basis in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the EU, IFRS issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board, those parts of the Companies 
Act 2006 applicable to those companies reporting under 
IFRS and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been presented in UK 
Sterling, the functional currency of the Company, and on 
the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of certain 
financial instruments, as explained below. All amounts have 
been rounded to the nearest £1 million, unless otherwise 
stated. The principal accounting policies adopted are set 
out below.
The Group’s income statement and segmental analysis 
identify separately headline performance and non-headline 
items. Headline performance measures reflect adjustments 
to total performance measures. The directors consider 
‘headline’ performance measures to be an informative 
additional measure of the ongoing trading performance 
of the Group and believe that these measures provide 
additional useful information for shareholders on the 
Group’s performance and are consistent with how business 
performance is measured internally.
Headline results are stated before the results of 
discontinued operations or exited / to be exited businesses, 
amortisation of acquisition intangibles, acquisition related 
costs, any exceptional items considered so one-off and 
material that they distort underlying performance (such 
as reorganisation costs, impairment charges, property 
rationalisation costs and other non-recurring charges)  , 
income from previously disposed operations and net 
pension interest costs. Businesses exited or to be exited 
are those which the Group has exited or committed to or 
commenced to exit through disposal or closure but do not 
meet the definition of discontinued operations as stipulated 
by IFRS and are material to the results and operations of the 
Group.
Non-headline items in the current and prior periods 
comprise businesses to be exited, amortisation 
of acquisition intangibles, Merger integration and 
transformation costs, property rationalisation costs, 
acquisition related costs, net interest on defined benefit 
pension schemes, share plan tax claims and discontinued 
operations. A reconciliation of headline profit and losses to 
total profits and losses is shown in note 2. Items excluded 
from headline results can evolve from one financial year 
to the next depending on the nature of exceptional items 
or one-off type activities described above. Headline 
performance measures and non-headline performance 
measures may not be directly comparable with other 
similarly titled measures or ‘adjusted’ revenue or profit 
measures used by other companies.
The accounting policy for the use of these measures is 
outlined in the ‘Alternative Performance Measures’ section 
of the Glossary.
Going concern
The Group’s funding arrangements and processes for 
managing its exposure to liquidity risk are set out in notes 
18 and 26.
In their consideration of going concern, the directors 
have reviewed the Group’s future cash forecasts and 
profit projections, which are based on market data and 
past experience. The directors are of the opinion that the 
Group’s forecasts and projections, which take into account 
reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show 
that the Group is able to operate within its current facilities 
and comply with its banking covenants for the foreseeable 
future. In arriving at their conclusion that the Group has 
adequate financial resources, the directors were mindful of 
the level of borrowings and facilities as set out in note 18 
to the Group financial statements and that the Group has a 
robust policy towards liquidity and cash flow management.
Accordingly the directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operation for the foreseeable future and 
consequently the directors continue to apply the going 
concern basis in the preparation of the financial statements.
The principal accounting policies are set out below.
b)   Accounting convention and basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the 
financial statements of the Company and entities controlled 
by the Company (its subsidiaries)  . Control is achieved where 
the Company has the power over the investee; is exposed, 
or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with 
the investee; and has the ability to use its power to affect its 
returns.
The results of subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired or 
sold during the year are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the 
effective date of disposal as appropriate, which is the date 
from which the power to control passes. Where necessary, 
adjustments are made to the financial statements of 
subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line 
with those used by the Group. All intercompany transactions 
and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
c)   Foreign currency translation and transactions
Material transactions in foreign currencies are hedged using 
forward purchases or sales of the relevant currencies and 
are recognised in the financial statements at the exchange 
rates thus obtained. Unhedged transactions are recorded 
at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. 
Material monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are hedged, mainly using forward foreign 
exchange contracts to create matching liabilities and assets, 
and are retranslated at each balance sheet date. Hedge 
accounting as defined by IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement’ has been applied by 
marking to market the relevant financial instruments at 
the balance sheet date and recognising the gain or loss in 
reserves in respect of cash flow hedges, and through profit 
or loss in respect of fair value hedges. Financial statements
101 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
The results of overseas operations are translated each 
month at the monthly rate, and their balance sheets are 
translated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. 
Goodwill and acquisition intangible assets are held in the 
currency of the operation to which they relate. Exchange 
differences arising on the translation of net assets, goodwill 
and results of overseas operations are recognised in the 
translation reserve. All other exchange differences are 
included in profit or loss in the year in which they arise 
except where the Group designates financial instruments 
held for the purpose of hedging the foreign currency 
exposures that result from material transactions undertaken 
in foreign currencies as cash flow hedges, hedge 
accounting as defined by IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement’ is applied. The effective 
portion of changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
that are designated as cash flow hedges is recognised 
in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating 
to the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss. 
Amounts previously recognised in equity are reclassified 
to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is 
recognised in profit or loss.
Where a foreign operation is disposed of, the gain or loss 
on disposal recognised in profit or loss is determined after 
taking into account the cumulative currency translation 
differences that are attributable to the operation. The 
principal exchange rates against UK Sterling used in these 
financial statements are as follows:
 Average  Closing
 2017 2016 2017 2016
Euro 1.18 1.36 1.18 1.28
Norwegian Krone 10.86 12.51 11.11 11.77
Swedish Krona 11.32 12.65 11.47 11.74
US Dollar 1.29 1.49 1.29 1.46
d)   Revenue and supplier income
Revenue
Revenue comprises sales of goods and services excluding 
sales taxes. The following accounting policies are applied 
to the principal revenue generating activities in which the 
Group is engaged:
• network commission revenue is recognised with 
reference to the stage of completion of the service under 
the individual contract with the MNO, as outlined in 
section (e)  ;
• revenue from the sale of goods is recognised at the point 
of sale or, where later, upon delivery to the customer and 
is stated net of returns;
• revenue earned from the sale of customer support 
agreements is recognised over the term of the contracts 
when the Group obtains the right to consideration as 
a result of performance of its contractual obligations. 
Revenue in any one year is recognised by reference to 
the stage of completion of the contractual terms at the 
balance sheet date. The stage of completion is estimated 
with reference to the proportion of the expected costs 
of fulfilling the Group’s total obligations under the 
agreements, determined by reference to extensive 
historical claims data. Reliance on historical data assumes 
that current and future experience will follow past trends. 
The directors make an annual assessment of this data 
to ensure this continues to reflect the best estimate of 
expected future trends;
• revenue arising on services (including delivery and 
installation, product repairs and product support)  , is 
recognised when the relevant services are provided;
• insurance revenue relates to the sale of third-party 
insurance products. Sales commission received from third 
parties is recognised when the insurance policies to which 
it relates are sold, to the extent that it can be reliably 
measured and there are no ongoing service obligations. 
Revenue from the provision of insurance administration 
services is recognised over the life of the relevant policies. 
Changes in contractual terms for the sale of third party 
insurance contracts resulted in additional revenue 
recognised of £22 million in the current year (2015/16: 
£nil);
• for MVNO operations where the Group is the principal, 
revenue is recognised in the period in which the 
telecommunication service, such as airtime or data, is 
provided;
• revenue from the sale of prepaid credits is deferred until 
the customer uses the airtime or the credit expires; and
• revenue generated from the provision of fixed and mobile 
network services is recognised as it is earned over the 
lives of the relevant customers.
Income received from suppliers such as volume rebates
The Group has provided enhanced disclosure on supplier 
funding following guidance issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council in December 2015. This disclosure is 
aimed at assisting the users of the financial statements 
in understanding the judgements and estimates made in 
the recognition of supplier funding in the Group’s financial 
statements.
The Group’s agreements with suppliers contain a price for 
units purchased as well as other rebates and discounts 
which are summarised below:
Volume Rebates: This income is linked to purchases made 
from suppliers and is recognised as a reduction to cost 
of goods sold as inventory is sold. Unearned rebates that 
relate to inventory not sold are recognised within the value 
of inventory at the period end. Where an agreement spans 
period ends, judgement is required regarding amounts to be 
recognised. Forecasts are used as well as historical data in 
the estimation of the level of income recognised. Amounts are 
only recognised where the Group has a clear entitlement to 
the receipt of the rebate and a reliable estimate can be made.
Discounts: This income is received from suppliers on a price 
per unit basis. The level of estimation is minimal as amounts 
are recognised as a reduction to cost of goods sold based 
on the agreement terms and only once the item is sold.
Marketing income: This income is received in relation 
to marketing activities that are performed on behalf of 
suppliers. Judgement is required to ensure that income is 
only recognised when all performance obligations within the  Financial statements
Notes to the Group financial statements
102 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
contract have been fulfilled and the income is expected to 
be collected.
Supplier funding amounts that have been recognised and 
not invoiced are shown within accrued income on the 
balance sheet.
e)   Network commissions
The Group operates under contracts with a number of 
Mobile Network Operators (‘MNOs’)  . Over the life of these 
contracts the service provided by the Group to each MNO 
is the procurement of connections to the MNOs’ networks. 
The individual consumer enters into a contract with the 
MNO for the MNO to supply the ongoing airtime over that 
contract period.
The Group earns a commission for the service provided to 
each MNO (‘network commission’)  . Revenue is recognised 
with reference to the stage of completion of the service 
under the individual contract with each MNO. A key 
judgement associated with this recognition is the unit of 
account used in recognition. The Group has determined 
that the number and value of consumers provided to 
each MNO in any given month (a ‘cohort’)   represents 
the best output measure of stage of completion of each 
contract. As invoices to MNOs are raised on a monthly 
basis, the monthly billing cycle has been deemed to be the 
appropriate unit of account for the purposes of applying 
IAS 39 to the financial assets arising from the provision of 
services.
The level of network commission earned is based on a share 
of the monthly payments made by the consumer to the 
MNO. The total consideration receivable is determined by 
both fixed (monthly line rental)   and variable elements and is 
therefore subject to significant judgement and is dependent 
on consumer behaviour after the point of recognition. See 
note 26 for further information around this judgement.
The method of measuring the fair value of the revenue and 
associated receivables in the month of connection is to 
estimate all future cash flows that will be received from the 
network and discount these based on their timing of receipt.
The determined commission is recognised in full in the 
month of connection of the consumer to the MNO as this is 
the point at which we have completed the service obligation 
relating to the consumer connection.
Commission revenue is only recognised to the extent it 
can be reliably measured for each cohort of consumers. 
Estimates are based on extensive historical evidence 
obtained from the networks. Reliance on historical data 
assumes that current and future experience will follow past 
trends. Management make a quarterly, and the directors 
a twice-yearly assessment of this data to ensure this 
continues to reflect the best estimate of expected future 
trends.
The associated receivables are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost with remeasurements due to changes in 
consumer behaviour recognised in the income statement. 
Assumptions are therefore required, particularly in relation 
to levels of consumer default within the contract period, 
expected levels of consumer spend, and consumer 
behaviour beyond the initial contract period. Further details 
of estimates used to initially value revenue recognised and 
subsequently value commission receivable at the balance 
sheet date, effects on the current year income statement of 
changes in estimates and sensitivity analysis of the carrying 
value can be found in note 26.
In addition to remeasurement due to changes in consumer 
behaviour, changes to revenue may also be made, where 
for example, more recent information becomes available 
enabling the recognition of previously unrecognised 
commission. Any such changes are recognised in the 
income statement. See note 26 for further detail of these 
changes recognised in the current period.
In addition to the above, the Group may also receive 
marketing support and volume incentives from the MNO, 
which are recognised when the income becomes highly 
probable.
f)    Discontinued operations and assets and liabilities 
held for sale
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group 
which represents a significant separate line of business, 
either through its activity or geographical area of operation, 
which has been sold, is held for sale or has been closed.
Where the sale of a component of the Group is considered 
highly probable at the balance sheet date and the business 
is available for immediate sale in its present condition, it is 
classified as held for sale. Such classification assumes the 
expectation that the sale will complete within one year from 
the date of classification. Assets and liabilities held for sale 
are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value 
less costs to sell. Once classified as held for sale, intangible 
assets and property, plant & equipment are no longer 
amortised or depreciated.
g)   Share-based payments
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant, and expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the 
number of shares that will eventually vest.
Where share-based payments are subject only to service 
conditions or internal performance criteria (such as EPS 
targets)  , fair value is measured using either a Binomial 
model or a Black Scholes model. Where share-based 
payments have external performance criteria (such as TSR 
targets)   a Monte Carlo model is used to measure fair value.
For all schemes, the number of options expected to vest 
is recalculated at each balance sheet date, based on 
expectations of leavers prior to vesting. For schemes 
with internal performance criteria, the number of options 
expected to vest is also adjusted based on expectations 
of performance against target. No adjustment is made for 
expected performance against external performance criteria. 
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous 
balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, 
with a corresponding entry in reserves. Financial statements
103 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
h)   Retirement benefit obligations
Company contributions to defined contribution pension 
schemes and contributions made to state pension schemes 
for certain overseas employees are charged to the income 
statement on an accruals basis when employees have 
rendered service entitling them to the contributions.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the difference 
between the market value of the assets and the present 
value of the accrued pension liabilities is shown as an asset 
or liability in the consolidated balance sheet. The calculation 
of the present value is determined using the projected unit 
credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in actuarial 
assumptions together with experience adjustments and 
actual return on assets are recognised in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income and expense as they 
arise. Such amounts are not reclassified to the income 
statement in subsequent years.
Defined benefit costs recognised in the income statement 
comprise mainly net interest expense or income with such 
interest being recognised within finance costs. Net interest 
is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined 
benefit liability or asset taking into account any changes in 
the net defined benefit obligation during the year as a result 
of contribution or benefit payments.
i)   Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the 
terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership to the lessee. The determination of 
the classification of property leases is made by reference 
to the land and buildings elements separately. All leases 
not classified as finance leases are classified as operating 
leases.
The Group as a lessor
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on 
a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. 
Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an 
operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the 
leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term.
The Group as a lessee
Finance leases
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at their 
fair value on acquisition or, if lower, at the present value 
of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the 
inception of the lease and depreciated over their estimated 
useful lives or the lease term if shorter. The corresponding 
obligation to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a 
liability. Lease payments are apportioned between finance 
charges and reduction of the lease obligation. Finance 
charges are charged to the income statement over the term 
of the lease in proportion to the capital element outstanding.
Operating leases
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of 
the lease. Contingent rentals arising under operating leases 
are recognised as an expense in the period in which they 
are incurred.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter 
into operating leases are amortised through the income 
statement over the period of the lease.
j)   T axation
Current tax
Current tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or 
recovered using the prevailing tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet 
date and adjusted for any tax payable in respect of previous 
years.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary 
differences between the carrying amount of an asset or 
liability in the balance sheet and the tax base value and 
represent tax payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets 
are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except 
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the 
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. No 
provision is made for tax which would have been payable on 
the distribution of retained profits of overseas subsidiaries 
or associated undertakings where it has been determined 
that these profits will not be distributed in the foreseeable 
future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that 
it is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which the asset can be utilised. Current and 
deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except 
where it relates to an item recognised directly in other 
comprehensive income or reserves, in which case it is 
recognised directly in other comprehensive income or 
reserves as appropriate.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the years in which the timing 
differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted, or substantially enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each 
other when they relate to income taxes levied by the same 
tax jurisdiction and when the Group intends to settle its 
current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. Deferred tax 
balances are not discounted.
k)   Goodwill
On acquisition of a subsidiary or associate, the fair value of 
the consideration is allocated between the identifiable net 
tangible and intangible assets and liabilities on a fair value 
basis, with any excess consideration representing goodwill. 
At the acquisition date, goodwill is allocated to each group 
of Cash Generating Units (‘CGUs’)   expected to benefit from  Financial statements
Notes to the Group financial statements
104 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
the combination and held in the currency of the operations 
to which the goodwill relates.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed annually for 
impairment, or more frequently where there is an indication 
that goodwill may be impaired. Impairment is assessed 
by measuring the future cash flows of the group of CGUs 
to which the goodwill relates, at the level at which this is 
monitored by management. Where the future discounted 
cash flows are less than the carrying value of goodwill, an 
impairment charge is recognised in the income statement.
On disposal of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, the 
relevant goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit 
or loss on disposal.
l)   Intangible assets
Acquisition intangibles
Acquisition intangibles comprise brand names and 
customer relationships purchased as part of acquisitions 
of businesses and are capitalised and amortised over 
their useful economic lives on a straight-line basis. These 
intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and, where appropriate, provision for 
impairment in value or estimated loss on disposal.
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost of assets on a 
straight-line basis on the following bases:
Brands 7% – 20% per annum
Customer relationships 13% – 50% per annum
This amortisation is recognised in non-headline 
administrative expenses.
Software and licences
Software and licences include costs incurred to acquire the 
assets as well as internal infrastructure and design costs 
incurred in the development of software in order to bring the 
assets into use.
Internally generated software is recognised as an intangible 
asset only if it can be separately identified, it is probable 
that the asset will generate future economic benefits 
which exceed one year, and the development cost can be 
measured reliably. Where these conditions are not met, 
development expenditure is recognised as an expense 
in the year in which it is incurred. Costs associated 
with developing or maintaining computer software are 
recognised as an expense as incurred unless they increase 
the future economic benefits of the asset, in which case 
they are capitalised.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, 
direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it 
increases the future economic benefits embodied in the 
specific asset to which it relates.
Software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and, where appropriate, provision for impairment in value or 
estimated loss on disposal. Amortisation is provided to write 
off the cost of assets on a straight-line basis between three 
and eight years, and is recorded in administrative expenses.
m)   Property, plant & equipment
Property, plant & equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment 
losses.
With the exception of land, depreciation is provided to write 
off the cost of the assets over their expected useful lives 
from the date the asset was brought into use or capable of 
being used on a straight-line basis.
Rates applied to different classes of property, plant & 
equipment are as follows:
Land and buildings 1
2
⁄3% – 4% per annum
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 10% – 33
1
⁄3% per annum
Assets capitalised as finance leases are depreciated over 
the term of the lease.
Property, plant & equipment are assessed on an ongoing 
basis to determine whether circumstances exist that 
could lead to the conclusion that the net book value is not 
supportable. Where assets are to be taken out of use, an 
impairment charge is levied. Where the property, plant & 
equipment form part of a separate CGU, such as a store 
or group of stores, and business indicators exist which 
could lead to the conclusions that the net book value is 
not supportable, the recoverable amount of the CGU is 
determined by calculating its value in use. The value in use 
is calculated by applying discounted cash flow modelling 
to management’s projection of future profitability and any 
impairment is determined by comparing the net book value 
with the value in use.
n)   Financial assets and investments
Financial assets are recognised in the Group’s balance 
sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual 
provisions of the investment. The Group’s financial assets 
comprise cash and cash equivalents, receivables which 
involve a contractual right to receive cash from external 
parties, and investments classified as available-for-
sale. Financial assets comprise all items shown in notes 
14 and 15 with the exception of prepayments. Under 
the classifications stipulated by IAS 39, cash and cash 
equivalents and derivative financial instruments, which are 
further described in notes 1r)   and 26, are classified as ‘loans 
and receivables’ and ‘held for trading unless designated 
in a hedge relationship’, respectively. Financial assets are 
derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows 
from the financial asset expire or the Group has substantially 
transferred the risks and rewards of ownership.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables (excluding derivative financial 
assets)   are classified as ‘loans and receivables’. Trade 
and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value 
and subsequently held at amortised cost, less provision 
or impairment. If there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect the full amount of the 
receivable, impairment is recognised through the income 
statement. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, 
probability that a debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial 
reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are  Financial statements
105 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. 
The impairment is calculated as the difference between the 
carrying value of the receivable and the present value of 
the related estimated future cash flows, discounted at the 
original interest rate.
Available-for-sale investments
The Group has investments in unlisted shares that are not 
traded in an active market but are classified as available-
for-sale financial assets and stated at fair value (because 
the directors consider that their fair value can be reliably 
measured)  . Fair value is determined in the manner described 
in note 12. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair 
value are recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in the accumulated profits reserve. Where 
the investment is disposed of or is determined to be 
impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised 
in the accumulated profits reserve is reclassified to the 
income statement. Dividends on available-for-sale equity 
instruments are recognised in profit or loss when the 
Group’s right to receive the dividends is established.
o)   Interests in joint ventures
Joint ventures are joint arrangements whereby the parties 
that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the 
net assets of the arrangement. These consolidated financial 
statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised 
gains and losses of joint ventures using the equity method 
less any impairment losses. When the Group’s interest in a 
joint venture has been reduced to nil because the Group’s 
share of losses exceeds its interest in the joint venture, the 
Group only provides for additional losses to the extent that 
it has incurred legal or constructive obligations to fund such 
losses, or where the Group has made payments on behalf of 
the joint venture. Any associated goodwill is included within 
the carrying value of the investment and is assessed for 
impairment as part of that investment.
p)   Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value, and on a weighted average cost basis. 
Cost comprises direct purchase cost and those overheads 
that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to 
their present location and condition less any attributable 
discounts and bonuses received from suppliers in respect 
of that inventory. Net realisable value is based on estimated 
selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to 
disposal. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or 
defective items where appropriate.
q)   Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in 
hand, bank overdrafts and short term highly liquid deposits 
which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in 
value. Bank overdrafts, which form part of cash and cash 
equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement, are 
shown under current liabilities.
r)   Borrowings and other financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities are those which involve a 
contractual obligation to deliver cash to external parties at 
a future date. Financial liabilities comprise all items shown 
in notes 16 to 19 with the exception of deferred income. 
Financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance 
sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. Financial liabilities (or a part 
of a financial liability) are derecognised when the obligation 
specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or 
expires.
Borrowings
Borrowings in the Group’s balance sheet represent 
committed and uncommitted bank loans. Borrowings are 
initially recorded at fair value less attributable transaction 
costs. Transaction fees such as bank fees and legal costs 
associated with the securing of financing are capitalised and 
amortised through the income statement over the term of 
the relevant facility. All other borrowing costs are recognised 
in the income statement in the period in which they are 
incurred.
Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated 
at amortised cost with any difference between cost and 
redemption value being recognised in the income statement 
over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest 
basis.
Under the classifications stipulated by IAS 39, borrowings, 
finance lease obligations and trade and other payables 
(excluding derivative financial liabilities)   are classified as 
‘financial liabilities measured at amortised cost’. Derivative 
financial instruments, which are described further in note 
26, are classified as ‘held for trading unless designated in a 
hedge relationship’.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables (excluding derivative financial 
liabilities)   are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost. Derivative financial instruments 
are initially recorded at fair value and then subsequently 
remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date and are 
held within assets or liabilities as appropriate. Gains and 
losses arising from revaluation at the balance sheet date are 
recognised in the income statement unless the derivatives 
are designated as hedges and such hedges are proved to 
be effective.
Where the Group has right of offset in relation to trade and 
other receivables and payables under IAS 39, these are 
presented on a net basis. See note 26 for a description of 
the financial assets and liabilities presented on a net basis.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activity
The Group uses derivatives to manage its exposures to 
fluctuating interest and foreign exchange rates. These 
instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the 
date the contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at their fair value. The treatment of the 
resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is 
designated as a hedging instrument and if so, the nature of 
the item being hedged. Derivatives that qualify for hedge 
accounting are treated as a hedge of a highly probable 
forecast transaction (cash flow hedge)   in the case of foreign 
exchange hedging and a hedge of the exposure arising 
from changes in the cash flows of a financial liability due  Financial statements
Notes to the Group financial statements
106 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
to interest rate risk on a floating rate debt instrument in the 
case of interest rate hedging.
At inception the relationship between the hedging 
instrument and the hedged item is documented, as is an 
assessment of the effectiveness of the derivative instrument 
used in the hedging transaction in offsetting changes 
in the cash flow of the hedged item. This effectiveness 
assessment is repeated on an ongoing basis during the 
life of the hedging instrument to ensure that the instrument 
remains an effective hedge of the transaction.
1. Derivatives classified as cash flow hedges: the effective 
portion of changes in the fair value is recognised in 
other comprehensive income. Any gain or loss relating 
to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in 
the income statement. Amounts recognised in other 
comprehensive income are recycled to the income 
statement in the period when the hedged item will 
affect profit or loss. If the hedging instrument expires 
or is sold, or no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in 
other comprehensive income at that time remains in 
other comprehensive income, and is recognised when 
the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in 
the income statement. If the forecast transaction is no 
longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss in 
other comprehensive income is immediately transferred 
to the income statement.
2. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting: 
these are classified at fair value through profit or loss. 
All changes in fair value of derivative instruments that 
do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
s)   Provisions
Provisions are recognised when a legal or constructive 
obligation exists as a result of past events and it is probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. Provisions are discounted where 
the time value of money is considered to be material.
All provisions are assessed by reference to the best 
available information at the balance sheet date.
t)   Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty
Critical accounting judgements and estimates used in 
the preparation of the financial statements are continually 
reviewed and revised as necessary.
Whilst every effort is made to ensure that such judgements 
and estimates are reasonable, by their nature they are 
uncertain, and as such changes may have a material impact.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Revenue recognition – network commissions
For certain transactions with MNOs, commission receivable 
on mobile phone connections depends on consumer 
behaviour after the point of sale. Further details of the 
judgement involved can be found at note 1 (e)  , and further 
details of estimates used to value commission receivable, 
carrying amounts at the balance sheet date, effects on the 
current year income statement of changes in estimates and 
sensitivity analysis of the carrying value can be found in 
note 26.
Revenue recognition – customer support agreements
As set out in note 1(d)  , revenue relating to customer support 
agreements is recognised by reference to the stage of 
completion of the contractual terms at the balance sheet 
date. The stage of completion is estimated with reference to 
the proportion of the expected costs of fulfilling the Group’s 
total obligations under the agreements, determined by 
reference to extensive historical claims data. The estimation 
techniques used for revenue and profit recognition in 
relation to the agreements require forecasts to be made 
of the outcome of the agreements and the timing of costs, 
based on historical cost profiles for each type of agreement. 
During the year, changes in estimates relating to contracts 
entered in previous periods totalled £21 million (2015/16: 
£3 million)  .
Defined benefit pension schemes
The surplus or deficit in the UK defined benefit pension 
scheme that is recognised through the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income and expense is 
subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties. 
The calculated liabilities of the scheme are based on 
assumptions regarding salary increases, inflation rates, 
discount rates and member longevity. Such assumptions 
are based on actuarial advice and are benchmarked against 
similar pension schemes. Refer to note 21 for further 
information.
Taxation
Tax laws that apply to the Group’s businesses may be 
amended by the relevant authorities, for example as a 
result of changes in fiscal circumstances or priorities. 
Such potential amendments and their application to the 
Group are monitored regularly and the requirement for 
recognition of any liabilities assessed where necessary. The 
Group is subject to income taxes in a number of different 
jurisdictions and judgement is required in determining the 
appropriate provision for transactions where the ultimate 
tax determination is uncertain. In such circumstances, the 
Group recognises liabilities for anticipated taxes due based 
on best information available and where the anticipated 
liability is probable and estimable. Where the final outcome 
of such matters differs from the amounts initially recorded, 
any differences will impact the income tax and deferred 
tax provisions in the year to which such determination is 
made. The Group has recognised provisions in relation to 
uncertain tax positions of £66 million at 29 April 2017 (2016: 
£54 million)  . Due to the nature of the provisions recorded, 
the timing of the settlement of these amounts remains 
uncertain.
Provisions
The Group’s provisions are based on the best information 
available to management at the balance sheet date. 
Judgement is required to assess the likelihood of success 
of any claim made against the Group and if any liability will 
arise. The most significant provision currently is in relation 
to the store reorganisation programme described in note 4. 
The costs and timing of cash flows are dependent on exiting  Financial statements
107 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
the property lease contracts or subletting the property. 
Significant assumptions are used in estimating the ultimate 
cost to the Group including the nature, timing and cost of 
exiting a lease and the level of sublease income. The future 
costs assumed are inevitably only estimates, which may 
differ from those ultimately incurred. Refer to note 20 for 
further information.
u)   Recent accounting developments
There were no new IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that had 
to be implemented during the year that significantly affect 
these financial statements.
The following new standards, which are applicable to the 
Group, have been published but are not yet effective and, in 
some cases, have not yet been adopted by the EU:
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’. This standard is the 
first step in the process to replace IAS 39 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. IFRS 
9 introduces new requirements for classifying and 
measuring financial assets. IFRS 9 is applicable for 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, and 
therefore will be applied by the Group in the 2018/19 
financial year. Based on our preliminary assessment, we 
do not currently anticipate a material impact from the new 
standard other than in providing additional disclosures in 
the Annual Report.
• IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ 
provides guidance on the recognition, timing and 
measurement of revenue. IFRS 15 is applicable for 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, and 
therefore will be applied by the Group in the 2018/19 
financial year. We have performed a high-level 
assessment on the impact of the standard. We will initiate 
a detailed project during 2017/18 in order to confirm 
any potential impact on reported revenue. There are no 
changes to cash flows or commercial impact from the 
change in standard.
• IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ is applicable for periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2019, and will therefore be applied by the 
Group in the 2019/20 financial year. IFRS 16 will require 
the Group to recognise a lease liability and a right-of-
use asset for most of those leases previously treated 
as operating leases. This will have a material effect on 
both non-current and current liabilities, fixed assets and 
the measurement and disclosure of expense associated 
with the leases which under the new standard will be 
treated as depreciation and financing expense which 
were previously recognised as operating expenses over 
the term of the lease. There is no cash impact of adoption 
of this standard, however the presentation of the cash 
flow statement will change. A project is underway across 
the Group to assess the overall impact of the standard, 
including considering the systems and processes required 
for implementation and the options around transition. 
We expect to report on the impact in the 2017/18 annual 
report.
It is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the 
effect of the adoption of the above standards until a detailed 
review has been completed.
Certain other new accounting standards, amendments to 
existing accounting standards and interpretations which 
are in issue but not yet effective, either do not apply to the 
Group or are not expected to have any material impact on 
the Group’s net results or net assets.
2 Segmental analysis
The Group’s operating segments reflect the segments 
routinely reviewed by the Board and which are used 
to manage performance and allocate resources. This 
information is predominantly based on geographical areas 
which are either managed separately or have similar trading 
characteristics such that they can be aggregated together 
into one segment.
The Group’s reportable segments have been identified as 
follows:
• UK & Ireland comprises operations in the UK and Ireland.
• Nordics operates in Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark 
and Iceland.
• Southern Europe comprises operations in Spain and 
Greece.
• Connected World Services is the Group’s B2B operation 
which leverages the specialist skills, operating processes 
and technology of the Group to provide managed services 
to third parties looking to develop their own connected 
world solutions.
UK & Ireland, Nordics and Southern Europe are involved 
in the sale of consumer electronics and mobile technology 
products and services, primarily through stores or online 
channels.
Transactions between segments are on an arm’s length 
basis. Financial statements

4 Non-headline items continued
(i)   Businesses to be exited:
Comprises the trading result of businesses to be exited where they do not meet the criteria under IFRS 5 for separate 
disclosure as discontinued operations. In the current period, this comprises of the iD mobile operations in the Republic 
of Ireland and the results of the Sprint joint venture. For iD mobile Ireland, a decision was reached to exit the business, 
most likely through a sale to a third party. The results of the Ireland MVNO have therefore been reclassified as non-
headline items in the current year in the income statement and related disclosures. The iD mobile operations in the 
Republic of Ireland contributed £5 million in revenue and a loss of £10 million in EBIT in 2016/17 (2015/16: revenue of 
£2 million and a loss of £6 million) which has been classified as non-headline. Restated amounts are set out in note 32.
In June 2017 the Group announced the sale of the 50% interest in the Sprint joint venture. The share of loss 
recognised in the year of £17 million, together with central costs directly related to the operation of £1 million, have 
therefore been classified as a business to be exited. The share of loss for 2015/16 of £4 million has been restated 
accordingly as set out in note 32.
(ii)   Amortisation of acquisition intangibles:
A charge of £34 million arose during the year in relation to acquisition intangibles arising on the CPW Europe 
Acquisition, the Dixons Retail Merger and the Simplifydigital acquisition (2015/16: £40 million)  .

Merger integration costs (18)  (48)  Transformation related costs (13)  —
Revolving Credit Facility fee write off — (4)   (31)  (52)   
The Merger has given rise to the following costs which have been treated as exceptional items:
• Merger integration costs relate to the reorganisation of the Group following the Merger and primarily comprise 
professional fees, employee severance and incentive costs associated with the integration process.
• During the current period, functional transformation projects have commenced across the finance, procurement 
and human resources functions to rationalise shared service centre activities and harmonise policies and 
procedures across key support functions of the business. The costs primarily relate to consultancy fees.
• In the year ended 30 April 2016, the Revolving Credit Facility fee write off recognised in finance costs relates to the 
deferred facility fees written off. The fees incurred were a result of the Merger and the financing required to facilitate 
the Merger at short notice. No related amounts were recognised in the current year.
(iv)   Property rationalisation costs:
Following the Merger it was announced that the Group would launch a major roll-out of its fully refurbished 3-in-1 
store concept in the UK & Ireland. This involves merging the remaining PC World and Currys stores and inserting a 
Carphone Warehouse, reducing the overall store portfolio by 134. The costs associated with this initiative, being early 
lease termination premiums, onerous lease provisions, dilapidations and fixed asset impairments, have been treated 
as exceptional items. On a net basis, there have been no additional costs incurred in the year ended 29 April 2017 
relating to the property rationalisation, and existing provisions have been utilised.
(v)   Acquisition related:
Acquisition related comprises costs incurred in the year ended 30 April 2016 relating to an increase in the contingent 
consideration payable on a business acquired by Dixons in the Nordics in 2011/12 (£5 million)  , and costs incurred in 
the acquisition of Simplifydigital and InfoCare (£1 million)  . Financial statements
113 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
4 Non-headline items continued
(vi)   Net non-cash financing costs on defined benefit pension schemes:
Under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’, the net interest charge on defined benefit pension schemes is calculated by 
applying the corporate bond yield rates applicable on the last day of the previous financial year to the net defined 
benefit obligation. Corporate bond yield rates vary over time which in turn creates volatility in the income statement 
and balance sheet and results in a non-cash remeasurement cost which can be volatile due to corporate bond yield 
rates prevailing on a particular day and is also unrepresentative of the actual investment gains or losses made or the 
liabilities paid and payable. Consistent with a number of other companies, the accounting effects of these non-cash 
revaluations of net defined benefit pension liabilities have been excluded from headline earnings.
(vii)   Share plan taxable benefit compensation:
As discussed in the Remuneration Committee Chairmen’s statement on page 61, in the event of non-vesting, 
compensation will be paid to participants of the Share Plan for any taxable benefit arising on the waiver of any portion 
of loans granted under the scheme. Based on the current share performance it is considered probable that this liability 
will crystallise, and therefore provision of £11 million has been made during 2016/17.
(viii)   Unieuro income:
In November 2013, the Group disposed of its Unieuro operations, and retained an investment of 14.96% in Italian 
Electronics Holdings s.r.l (IEH)  , a holding company which in turn owned 100% of the Unieuro operations. The 
investment was initially recognised at £nil based on the fair value of the retained interest. In March 2017, Unieuro 
undertook an IPO for 31.8% of its shareholdings, which reduced the Group’s investment to 10.2% of the Unieuro 
operations. As a result of the IPO, the Group received a dividend from the intermediate holding company of £5 million, 
which is treated as non-headline as relates to a disposal of a portion of our investment. A repayment was also received 
of £5 million for a loan previously impaired following the disposal, which has been treated as a discontinued operation 
income in line with the treatment of the original disposal, as disclosed in note 25.

During the 13 months ended 2 May 2015 and year ended 29 March 2014 loans were advanced to members of key 
management in relation to the Share Plan. At 29 April 2017, loans to key management in relation to these schemes totalled 
£9 million (2016: £10 million)  . Interest is charged on loans at market rates and interest of £0.2 million has been recognised 
during the period (2015/16: £0.3 million)  .
Further information about individual directors’ remuneration, share interests, share options, pensions and other 
entitlements, which form part of these financial statements, is provided in the Remuneration Report.
b)   Share-based payments
i)   Share Plan
During the year ended 29 March 2014, the Group introduced the Share Plan which allows participants to share 10% of the 
incremental value created in the Group in excess of an opening value (assessed on the value of CPW over a three-month 
period prior to approval of the plan by shareholders in June 2013 and, for new entrants during the 13 months ended 2 May 
2015, assessed on the aggregated value of CPW and Dixons Retail over a one-month period prior to the announcement 
of preliminary merger discussions in February 2015)   and beyond an annual rate of return of 7% on invested capital. The 
plan is underpinned by a minimum annual compound TSR growth of 5% and outperformance of the median TSR of the 
FTSE 250.
Participants acquired, at market value, participation shares in a subsidiary company that holds the Group’s interests in 
CPW Europe and, since the Merger, Dixons Retail. The Group granted loans to participants at a commercial rate of interest 
to acquire the shares. Loans are ordinarily repayable in full if performance conditions are met.
The performance of the scheme will ordinarily be measured after the publication of the preliminary announcement for the 
year ended 29 April 2017, when 60% of the shares vest, with 40% deferred for a further year. When the awards vest, the 
value of the shares held by participants will be based on the incremental value (if any)   of Dixons Carphone in excess of 
the opening valuation together with the minimum return on invested capital. These shares will then be purchased by the 
Company for cash and / or the Company’s ordinary shares.
A ‘bad leaver’ will be required to transfer the participation shares to such party as the Company designates for an amount 
equal to the total amount outstanding under the loan. If the market value of the shares is less than the amount of the 
outstanding loan (and any accrued interest)   then the participant may be required to repay up to 20% of the shortfall out of 
their own resources.
A participant shall be a ‘good leaver’ at the sole discretion of the Remuneration Committee and may be permitted to retain 
an award notwithstanding the termination of their employment.
The mechanics of the scheme may be varied by the Remuneration Committee if necessary to ensure that participants are 
neither advantaged nor disadvantaged by a variation of the share capital of the Company, bona fide merger, reconstruction 
or similar reorganisation.
Based on the current share price performance it is considered probable that part of the Share Plan will not vest, and in the 
event of non-vesting the Company has agreed to compensate participants for any taxable benefit arising on the waiver of 
any portion of loans granted under the scheme. This is discussed further in note 4.
ii)   Share option schemes
During the year ended 29 March 2014, the Group introduced a share option scheme which allows nil-priced options to be 
offered to senior employees.
Options were first granted under the scheme in January 2014. The options are subject to continuing employment and are 
subject to performance conditions. For options granted during 2015/16 and earlier periods, performance conditions are 
based on a combination of absolute TSR performance and relative TSR performance against the FTSE 250 or FTSE 350. 
For options granted during the year ended 29 April 2017, performance conditions are based on a combination of EPS 
growth and relative TSR performance against the constituents of the FTSE 51-150 at 1 May 2016. Financial statements

iii)   SAYE scheme
The Group has SAYE schemes which allow participants to save up to £500 per month for either three or five years. At 
the end of the savings period, participants can purchase shares in the Company based on a discounted share price 
determined at the commencement of the scheme. Participants in the Dixons Retail plc SAYE scheme had the opportunity 
to roll over their awards into options over shares in the merged entity, Dixons Carphone, on completion of the Merger. 
Employees who chose to roll over received 0.155 options in Dixons Carphone in exchange for each Dixons option held. 
The savings period and exercise date of these options remain unchanged.

b)   Share-based payments continued
iv)   Fair value model
The fair value of options was estimated at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo model. The model combines the 
market price of a share at the date of grant with the probability of meeting performance criteria, based on the historical 
performance of Carphone Warehouse and, for options issued subsequent to the Merger on 6 August 2014, the historical 
performance of Dixons.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the period was £1.40 (2015/16: £0.74)  . The following table lists 
the inputs to the model:
 
Year ended 
29 April 2017
Year ended 
30 April 2016
Exercise price £nil – £2.52 £nil – £3.77
Dividend yield 2.6% – 3.0% 2.3%
Historical and expected volatility 30% 27% – 28%
Expected option life 4 – 10 yrs 4 – 10 yrs
Weighted average share price £3.26 £4.35
 
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, including 
consideration of the historical volatility of Carphone Warehouse and Dixons prior to the Merger.
v)   Charge to the income statement and entries in reserves
During the year ended 29 April 2017, the Group recognised a non-cash accounting charge to profit and loss of £17 million 
(2015/16: £10 million)   in respect of equity settled share-based payments, with a corresponding credit through reserves.

Following the Merger, the Dixons Carphone plc EBT was established on 12 August 2016, after which the assets held 
in the two legacy Employee Share Ownerships Trusts (‘ESOTs’), being the Carphone Warehouse ESOT and the Dixons 
Retail ESOT, were transferred into the EBT. The ESOTs were terminated on 16 September 2016 and 28 September 2016 
respectively.
The number of shares held by the EBT, which are shown in the table above, remain held for potential awards under 
outstanding plans. The costs of funding and administering the EBT are charged to the income statement in the year to 
which they relate. Shareholders’ funds are reduced by the net book value of shares held in the EBT.
The EBT did not undertake any market purchases of the Company’s shares during the year ended 29 April 2017 (2015/16: 
1.9 million shares were purchased by the ESOTs for net cash consideration (after the receipt of the exercise price from 
employees)   of £5 million) .
The EBT has waived rights to receive dividends and the shares have not been allocated to specific schemes. Financial statements

The effective tax rate on headline earnings of 22% (2015/16: 24%)   has decreased due to a reduction in items attracting no 
tax relief or liability and a reduction in tax paid at higher overseas tax rates, largely as a result of statutory rate changes in 
the Nordics.
Adjustments in respect of prior years include a one-off tax credit following successful resolution of a prior year tax issue 
and movements in uncertain tax positions. Items attracting no tax relief or liability relate primarily to capital expenditure on 
which no deduction is available in respect of capital allowances.
A further reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 17% from 1 April 2020 has been substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date and has been used in the recognition of deferred tax balances.

b)   Goodwill impairment testing
As required by IAS 36, goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews. These reviews are carried out using the following 
criteria:
• business acquisitions generate an attributed amount of goodwill;
• the manner in which these businesses are run and managed is used to determine the CGU grouping as defined in IAS 36 
‘Impairment of Assets’;
• the recoverable amount of each CGU group is determined based on calculating its value in use (‘VIU’)  ;
• the VIU is calculated by applying discounted cash flow modelling to management’s own projections covering a five-year 
period;
• cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using a long-term growth rate equivalent to long-term forecasts 
of Gross Domestic Product (‘GDP’)   growth rates for the relevant market; and
• the VIU is then compared to the carrying amount in order to determine whether impairment has occurred.
During the year, management has reassessed the level at which the goodwill previously related to the UK & Ireland 
operations of Carphone Warehouse and Dixons is monitored by management, and therefore the level at which this is 
monitored for goodwill impairment purposes under IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. Due to the continued integration 
activities following the Merger, including the introduction of ‘store-within-a-store’ operations, the integration of finance 
and operational management, and the combined reporting of results for management reporting purposes, management 
has determined that the level at which goodwill for the UK & Ireland business is monitored is at an overall UK & Ireland 
level, compared to the previous level used of UK – Carphone, Ireland – Carphone, UK&I Dixons and Simplifydigital. For this 
reason, the goodwill has been combined for the purposes of impairment reviews.
The key assumptions used in calculating value in use are:
• management’s projections;
• the growth rate beyond five years; and
• the pre-tax discount rate. Financial statements
Notes to the Group financial statements
122 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
9 Goodwill continued
b)   Goodwill impairment testing continued
The long term projections, which have been approved by management, have been prepared using the latest approved 
budget for 2017/18 together with the three-year strategic plans as a base extrapolated to five years. These projections 
have regard to the relative performance of competitors and knowledge of the current market together with management’s 
views on the future achievable growth in market share and impact of the committed initiatives. The cash flows which derive 
from these five-year projections include ongoing capital expenditure required to develop and upgrade the store network 
in order to maintain and operate the businesses and to compete in their markets. In forming the five-year projections, 
management draws on past experience as a measure to forecast future performance.
Key assumptions used in determining the five-year projections comprise the growth in sales and costs over this period. 
The compound annual growth rate in sales and costs can rise as well as fall year-on-year depending not only on the year 
five targets, but also on the current financial year base. These targets, when combined, accordingly drive the resulting 
profit margins and the profit in year five of the projections which is in turn used to calculate the terminal value in the VIU 
calculation. Historical amounts for the businesses under impairment review as well as from other parts of the Group are 
used to generate the values attributed to these assumptions.
The value attributed to these assumptions for the most significant components of goodwill are as follows:

*  comparative values have been disclosed on an overall UK & Ireland level following the change discussed above. In the prior year, on a 
separated basis, the compound annual growth rates in sales used for UK – Carphone and UK & Ireland – Dixons were 2.8% and 2.3% and 
compound annual growth rates in costs were 2.6% and 2.1% respectively. Growth rates and pre-tax discount rates in the comparative period 
are unchanged.
Growth rates used were determined based on third-party long-term growth rate forecasts and are based on the GDP 
growth rate for the territories in which the businesses operate. The pre-tax discount rates applied to the forecast cash 
flows reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
c)   Goodwill impairment sensitivity analysis
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on each of the base case assumptions used for assessing the goodwill with other 
variables held constant. Consideration of sensitivities to key assumptions can evolve from one financial year to the next. 
The directors have concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which would cause the 
carrying amount of goodwill to exceed its value in use. Financial statements

Freehold land and buildings include the Group’s investment property, which is recorded at cost. The fair value of 
investment property was determined by an external, independent property valuation expert as £13 million (2016: 
£14 million)  . The valuation expert has appropriate recognised professional qualifications as well as recent experience 
in the location and category of the properties being valued. The valuation of properties was performed by reference to 
appropriate yield rates and market evidence of recent transactions. Future minimum lease income in respect of the Group’s 
investment properties is set out in note 30. Financial statements

The share of results recognised all relate to businesses to be exited, as described below. There were no items of 
other comprehensive income in the period and therefore the share of results represents the Group’s share of total 
comprehensive income. 
In June 2017, the Group announced that the interest held in the Sprint joint venture would be sold, as set out in note 33. In 
light of this decision, the trading result in the current and prior financial years has been restated as businesses to be exited, 
as disclosed in notes 4 and 32.
The remaining joint venture investments (£1 million) relate to investments held by our Nordics operations through the 
wholesaler network, which are not considered significant.

In November 2013, the Group disposed of it’s Unieuro operations, and retained an investment of 14.96% in Italian 
Electronics Holdings s.r.l (IEH)  , a holding company which in turn owned 100% of the Unieuro operations. The investment 
was initially recognised at £nil based on the fair value of the retained interest. In March 2017, Unieuro undertook an 
IPO for 31.8% of its shareholdings, which reduced the Group’s investment to 10.2% of the Unieuro operations. Given 
the successful IPO, a readily-determinable fair value is available based on the market price of the listed shares, and 
the investment has therefore been valued at £19 million. The movement in investment value has been taken to other 
comprehensive income as classified as an ‘available-for-sale’ investment. The fair valuation techniques used are outlined in 
note 26.

The Group operates a defined benefit and a number of defined contribution schemes. The principal scheme which 
operates in the UK includes a funded defined benefit section whose assets are held in a separate trustee administered 
fund. The scheme is valued by a qualified actuary at least every three years and contributions are assessed in accordance 
with the actuary’s advice. Since 1 September 2002, the defined benefit section of the scheme has been closed to new 
entrants and on 30 April 2010 was closed to future accrual with automatic entry into the defined contribution section being 
offered to those active members of the defined benefit section at that time. Membership of the defined contribution section 
is offered to eligible employees.
In the Nordics division, the Group operates small funded secured defined benefit pension schemes, which are also closed 
to new entrants, with assets held by a life insurance company as well as an unsecured pension arrangement. In addition, 
contributions are made to state pension schemes with defined benefit characteristics. Financial statements
Notes to the Group financial statements
130 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
21 Retirement and other post-employment benefit obligations continued
The defined benefit pension schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks such as longer than expected longevity of 
members, lower than expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the liabilities 
or reduce the value of assets of the plans.
a)   Defined contribution pension schemes
The pension charge in respect of defined contribution schemes was £24 million (2015/16: £23 million)  .
b)   UK defined benefit pension scheme – actuarial valuation and assumptions
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2016 and showed a shortfall of assets compared 
with liabilities of £560 million. A ‘recovery plan’ based on this valuation was agreed with the Trustees such that 
contributions in respect of the scheme will increase to £46 million per year starting from the 2017/18 financial year. As a 
result of the valuation, during the current year the Group agreed to pay an amount of £7 million in addition to the previously 
agreed contribution of £36 million, which leads to total contributions paid in 2016/17 of £43 million. The next triennial 
valuation will be as at 31 March 2019.
The principal actuarial assumptions as at 31 March 2016 were:
  Rate per annum
Discount rate for accrued benefits
†
– Growth portfolio 4.6%
– Matching portfolio 2.2%
Rate of increase to pensions 0% – 3.6%
Inflation 3.0%
 
†  The discount rate is based on a linear de-risking methodology which assumes the Scheme’s investment strategy switches investments from 
growth assets (such as equities) to matching assets (such as bonds) and multi-asset credit over a period of 10 years from 2026 to 2036 so 
that in 20 years’ time the asset portfolio is projected to be 90% invested in matching assets and multi-asset credit. 
At 31 March 2016, the market value of the scheme’s investments was £930 million and, based on the above assumptions, 
the value of the assets was sufficient to cover 62% of the benefits accrued to members with the liabilities amounting to 
£1,490 million.
c)   UK Defined benefit pension scheme – IAS 19
The following summarises the components of net defined benefit expense recognised in the consolidated income 
statement, the funded status and amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet and other amounts recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income. The methods set out in IAS 19 are different from those used by the scheme 
actuaries in determining funding arrangements.
(i)   Principal assumptions adopted
The assumptions used in calculating the expenses and obligations are set by the directors after consultation with the 
independent actuaries.

The Group uses demographic assumptions underlying the last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 31 March 
2016. In particular, post retirement mortality has been assumed to follow the standard mortality tables ‘S2’ All Pensioners 
tables published by the CMI, based on the experience of Self-Administered Pension Schemes (SAPS)   with multipliers of 
100% for males and 105% for females. In addition, an allowance has been made for future improvements in longevity from 
2003 by using the new CMI 2015 Core projections with a long term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum for men and 
1.25% per annum for women. Applying such tables results in an average expected longevity of between 87.5 years and 
89.7 years for men and between 88.9 years and 90.8 years for women for those reaching 65 over the next 20 years. Financial statements

The investment strategy of the scheme is determined by the independent Trustees through advice provided by an 
independent investment consultant. The scheme invests in a diverse range of asset classes as set out above with matching 
assets primarily comprising holdings in inflation linked gilts, corporate bonds and liability driven investments.
Actual return on the scheme assets was a gain of £174 million (2015/16: loss of £57 million)  .
(v)   Sensitivities
The value of the UK defined benefit pension scheme assets are sensitive to market conditions, particularly equity values 
which comprise approximately 49% of the scheme’s assets. Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement 
benefit costs and liabilities may have a material impact on the 2016/17 income statement and the balance sheet. The main 
assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and the assumed mortality rate. The following table provides an 
estimate of the potential impacts of each of these variables if applied to the current year consolidated income statement 
and balance sheet.

The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as 
it is unlikely that the changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be 
correlated.
d)   Other post-employment benefits – IAS 19
The Group offers other post-employment benefits to employees in overseas territories, in particular in Greece. These 
benefits are unfunded. At 29 April 2017 the net obligation in relation to these benefits was £3 million (2016: £3 million)  . Financial statements

24 Acquisitions
In August 2016 the Group acquired the trade and assets of ten FONA stores in Denmark for £6 million. Goodwill of 
£4 million was recognised from this transaction.
On 31 March 2016 the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Simplify Digital Limited. The provisional fair 
value of identifiable assets and liabilities of Simplify Digital Limited were reported in the annual report and accounts for the 
year ended 30 April 2016. During the current period, no material adjustments were identified. Financial statements

25 Discontinued operations and assets held for sale
a)   Profit / (loss) after tax – discontinued operations
The net profit of £4 million recognised in the current year primarily relates to the income recognised relating to the Unieuro 
investment. In April 2017 the Group received £5 million as repayment of a loan to the disposed operation from the disposal 
in 2013, which was fully impaired as part of the loss on disposal. In the current year, as repayment of the principle has 
been made, this income has been classified as a discontinued operation as the original impairment of the loan was 
recognised in the original loss on disposal.
There were no other significant movements in results relating to other discontinued operations in the year ended 29 April 
2017. 
The net loss on disposal recognised in the prior year of £18 million primarily relates to working capital adjustments agreed 
with acquirers, adjustments to net assets disposed, the recycling of foreign currency translation reserves of discontinued 
operations and other costs associated with the exits.
b)   Cash flows from discontinued operations
The net cash flows incurred by the discontinued operation during the year are as follows. These cash flows are included 
within the Consolidated cash flow statement:

26 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments
Financial instruments that are measured at fair value in the financial statements require disclosure of fair value 
measurements by level based on the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
• Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted)   in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
• Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly 
(that is, as prices)   or indirectly (that is, derived from prices)  ; and
• Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs)  .
The Group has assessed network commission receivables to meet the definition of loans and receivables as defined in 
IAS 39 and are therefore accounted for at amortised cost. The measurement of certain network commission receivables 
is a key source of estimation uncertainty, an explanation of the valuation method and an analysis of the sensitivity of the 
carrying value of receivables to the assumptions and estimates of this method has been provided below in note 26(h)  . The 
carrying value of such ongoing network commission receivables (net of commission received at the point of connection)   
is £1,014 million (2016: £904 million)  . If network commission receivables were alternatively classified at fair value through 
profit and loss these receivables would be categorised as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation requires the use 
of significant unobservable inputs. Under this alternative measurement basis their fair value is approximately equal to their 
current carrying value.
An explanation of the valuation methodologies and the inputs to the models are provided below for network commission.
Available-for-sale financial assets, in relation to listed investments held, are categorised as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy 
and are valued based on quoted bid prices in an active market.
Contingent consideration is categorised as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation requires the use of significant 
unobservable inputs. An explanation of the valuation methodologies and the inputs to the valuation model is provided in 
note 17.
The significant inputs required to fair value the Group’s remaining financial instruments that are measured at fair value on 
the balance sheet, being derivative financial assets and liabilities, are observable and are classified as level 2 in the fair 
value hierarchy. There have also been no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy.
Fair values have been arrived at by discounting future cash flows (where the impact of discounting is material)  , assuming 
no early redemption, or by revaluing forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to period end market rates as 
appropriate to the instrument.
The directors consider that the book value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at amortised cost and their fair value 
are not materially different. Financial statements

26 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued
a)   Financial risk management policies
The Group’s activities expose it to certain financial risks including market risk (such as foreign exchange risk and interest 
rate risk)  , credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s treasury function, which operates under treasury policies approved by 
the Board, uses certain financial instruments to mitigate potentially adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance 
from these risks. These financial instruments consist of bank loans and deposits, spot and forward foreign exchange 
contracts, foreign exchange swaps and interest rate swaps.
Throughout the period under review, in accordance with Group policy, no speculative use of derivatives, foreign exchange 
or other instruments was permitted. No contracts with embedded derivatives have been identified and, accordingly, no 
such derivatives have been accounted for separately.
b)   Foreign exchange risk
The Group undertakes certain transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies and as a consequence has exposure 
to exchange rate fluctuations. These exposures primarily arise from inventory purchases, with most of the Group’s 
exposure being to Euro, Norwegian Krone and US Dollar fluctuations. The Group uses spot and forward currency contracts 
to mitigate these exposures, with such contracts designed to cover exposures ranging from one month to one year.
The translation risk on converting overseas currency profits or losses is not hedged and such profits or losses are 
converted into Sterling at average exchange rates throughout the year. The Group’s principal translation currency 
exposures are the Euro and Norwegian Krone.
At 29 April 2017, the total notional principal amount of outstanding currency contracts was £1,358 million (2016: 
£2,856 million)   and had a fair value of £4 million asset (2015/16: £23 million liability)  . Monetary assets and liabilities and 
foreign exchange contracts are sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates. This sensitivity can be analysed in 
comparison to year end rates (assuming all other variables remain constant)   as follows:

10% movement in the Danish Krone exchange rate — 13 — 2
10% movement in the Norwegian Krone exchange rate — 17 — 6
10% movement in the Chinese Yuan Offshore exchange rate — 6 — —
c)   Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily on cash, cash equivalents and loans and other borrowings, all of which are 
at floating rates of interest and which therefore expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. These floating rates are 
linked to LIBOR and other interest rate bases as appropriate to the instrument and currency. Future cash flows arising from 
these financial instruments depend on interest rates and periods agreed at the time of rollover. Group policy permits the 
use of long term interest rate derivatives in managing the risks associated with movements in interest rates.
The effect on the income statement and equity of 1% movements in the interest rate for the currencies in which most 
Group cash, cash equivalents, loans and other borrowings are denominated and on which the valuation of most derivative 
financial instruments is based is as follows, assuming that the year end positions prevail throughout the year:

d)   Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial 
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by 
reviewing regularly the long term and short term cash flow projections for the business against the resources available to it.
In order to ensure that sufficient funds are available for ongoing and future developments, the Group has committed 
bank facilities, excluding overdrafts repayable on demand, totalling £1,050 million (2016: £800 million)  . Further details of 
committed borrowing facilities are shown in note 18.
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities into relevant maturity 
groupings. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, including both principal and 
interest flows, assuming that interest rates remain constant and that borrowings are paid in full in the year of maturity.

e)   Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises 
principally from the Group’s receivables from consumers. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is regularly monitored and 
the Group’s policy is updated as appropriate.
The majority of the Group’s trade receivables are balances due from MNOs, which are generally major multi-national 
enterprises with whom the Group has well-established relationships and are consequently not considered to add 
significantly to the Group’s credit risk exposure. In addition credit risk is also inherently associated with the MNO end 
consumers. Details of the sensitivity analysis of a change in credit risk associated with the MNO consumer is detailed 
below (consumer default rates)  . Exposure to credit risk associated with the MNO consumer is managed through extensive 
consumer credit checking process prior to connection with the network. The large volume of MNO consumers reduces the 
Group’s exposure to concentration of credit risk. Financial statements
Notes to the Group financial statements
138 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
26 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued
The Group’s trade receivables also include balances due from equipment manufacturers, dealers and Connected 
World Services consumers, business to business consumers and consumer credit receivables. Where it is considered 
appropriate, the Group obtains credit insurance on accounts receivable. Provision is made for any receivables that are 
considered to be irrecoverable. Details of trade receivables which are past due but not impaired are provided in note 14.
The credit risks on cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments are closely monitored and credit ratings 
are used in determining maximum counterparty credit risk.
The Group’s funding is reliant on its £1,050 million bank facilities, which are provided by nine banks; these institutions are 
considered to be adequately capitalised to continue to meet their obligations under the facility.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents 
the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.
f)   Capital risk
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities within the Group will be able to continue as going concerns, whilst 
maximising the return to shareholders through a suitable mix of debt and equity. The capital structure of the Group 
consists of cash and cash equivalents, loans and other borrowings and equity attributable to equity holders of the 
Company, comprising issued capital, reserves and accumulated profits. Except in relation to minimum capital requirements 
in its insurance business, the Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. The Group monitors its 
capital structure on an ongoing basis, including assessing the risks associated with each class of capital.
g)   Derivatives
Derivative financial instruments comprise forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign exchange swaps and interest rate 
swaps. The Group has designated financial instruments under IAS 39 as follows:
Cash flow hedges
At 29 April 2017 the Group had forward and swap foreign exchange contracts in place with a notional value of 
£1,190 million (2016: £1,909 million)   and a fair value of £6 million asset (2015/16: £17 million liability)   that were designated 
and effective as cash flow hedges. These contracts are expected to cover exposures ranging from one month to one year. 
The fair value of derivative foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps not designated as cash flow hedges 
was £2 million liability (2015/16: £6 million liability)  .
Interest rate swaps
The Group held interest rate swaps with a notional value of £60 million (2016: £255 million)   and a fair value of £nil million 
(2015/16: £1 million liability)   whereby the Group receives a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR and pays a fixed 
interest rate. These contracts mature between June 2017 and December 2020.
h)   Network commission receivables consumer behaviour risk
Under certain arrangements with MNOs, the commission receivable for the monthly consumer connections to the MNOs 
depends on consumer behaviour after the point of connection. A discounted cash flow methodology is used to measure 
the fair value of the revenue and associated receivables in the month of connection, by estimating all future cash flows that 
will be received from the MNO and discounting these based on their timing of receipt. Subsequently network commission 
receivables are measured at the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted using the effective interest 
rate determined in the month of connection.
The key inputs to the model are:
• revenue share percentage – the percentage of the consumer’s spend (to the MNO)   to which the Group is entitled;
• minimum contract period – the length of contract entered into by the consumer;
• out-of-bundle spend – additional spend by the consumer measured as a % of total spend;
• consumer default rate – rate at which consumers disconnect from the MNO;
• spend beyond the initial contract period – period of time the consumer remains connected to the MNO after the initial 
contract term; and
• upgrade propensity – the % of consumers initially connected by the Group estimated to be subsequently upgraded by 
an MNO. Financial statements
139 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
26 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued
The last four inputs are estimated based on extensive historical evidence obtained from the networks, and adjustment is 
made for the risk of potential changes in consumer behaviour. Reliance on historical data assumes that current and future 
experience will follow past trends, there is therefore a risk that changes in consumer behaviour reduce or increase the total 
cash flows ultimately realised over the forecast period. Management make a quarterly, and the directors a twice-yearly 
assessment of this data to ensure this continues to reflect the best estimate of expected future trends.
The tables below provide the sensitivity of the carrying value of the network commission receivables to a reasonably 
possible change in input to the discounted cash flow model. The gross value of the network commission receivable subject 
to the below sensitivities is £1,581 million (2015/16: £1,391 million)  :

(1)    The sensitivity represents the favourable and unfavourable effect on the income statement of remeasuring the carrying value for a 
reasonably possible change in the value of the input used. Whilst the nature of inputs is consistent across all MNOs the value applied differs 
on a MNO by MNO basis. The sensitivity analysis performed has applied a reasonably possible change on an input by input and MNO by 
MNO basis. The amounts shown above are the cumulative sensitivities for each input across all MNOs.
(2)    The reasonably possible range disclosed represent the high and low range of each unobservable input, across all MNOs, over the previous 
three years. The sensitivities, which fall within this range, have been applied to the unobservable inputs on a MNO by MNO basis on the 
relevant element of the gross receivable.
(3)    The value of commission receivable used for consumer default rate represents the total of in-contract commissions for the relevant MNOs, 
as the percentage default rate applied is over this total balance. 
Changes in range of assumptions
Ranges of assumptions used in the sensitivity analysis above evolve year on year to reflect the latest data provided by 
the MNOs and actual variances experienced by management. In the current year the range of sensitivities in relation to 
consumer default rates for new subscribers changed reflecting the increasing average consumer quality connected to the 
MNOs. Upgrade propensity ranges have widened reflecting an increase to the sensitivity applied to the actual inputs to the 
model (+/- 5%; 2015/16: +/- 2%), and changes in network upgrade behaviour in the year.
We consider that there are significant interdependencies between movements in the various inputs, in particular experience 
shows an inverse relationship between upgrade propensity and spend after the initial contract term (a decrease in the 
period of spend after the initial terms leads to an increase in upgrade propensity), and therefore these sensitivities should 
not be considered in aggregate. The significant unobservable inputs in determining the amortised cost carrying values 
used in the table above are the same significant unobservable inputs that would be required if the network commission 
receivable was measured at fair value on the balance sheet. In addition, the fair value would be impacted by changes in 
interest rates and counterparty credit risk. Financial statements
Notes to the Group financial statements
140 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
26 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued
Changes in relation to network commission receivable, for consumer connections recognised in previous years, due to 
changes in assumptions or recognition of previously unrecognised elements of commission resulted in an increase in 
revenue of £21 million in the current year (2015/16: £32 million). In the current year, this principally relates to changes to 
upgrade propensity and spend after the initial contract term assumptions offset by changes in anticipated out-of-bundle 
spend assumptions. In 2015/16, this principally related to settlement of receipts due from MNOs for consumers connected 
in previous periods and spend after the initial contract term assumptions offset by changes in anticipated out-of-bundle 
spend assumptions. If these amounts relating to consumer connections originating in previous years were not recognised 
in the current year, certain amounts would have been expected to be recognised in future periods, which would increase 
future revenues by £26 million (2015/16: £13 million increase), and decrease current year revenue by £11 million (2015/16: 
£7 million decrease).
Payment terms with the MNOs are based on a mix of cash received upon connection and future payments as the MNO 
receives monthly instalments from end consumers over the life of the consumer contract. The gross commission receivable 
in any month is settled for certain MNOs net of 1/24th of the amount received on connection. Initial commission received 
not yet subject to net settlement is subject to clawback should the consumer default on its contract with the MNO. The 
total gross network commission receivable at 29 April 2017 is £1,581 million (30 April 2016: £1,391 million)   which is offset 
by commission received of £567 million (30 April 2016: £487 million)  , resulting in a net network commission receivable of 
£1,014 million (30 April 2016: £904 million)  .
Cash flows in association with the network receivable are received over a period of 1–5 years. The expected timing of net 
cash flow settlement of commission is as follows:

31 Contingent liabilities
In recent years the Group has entered into agreements to dispose of certain operations. As part of these disposal 
agreements, the Group has provided the acquirer with general and tax related warranties. At the date of signing these 
financial statements, some of these warranties remain open and it is possible that claims could arise under these 
warranties.
The Group is subject to periodic tax audits and investigations by various tax authorities covering corporate, employee and 
sales taxes across various jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Applicable tax laws and regulations are subject to 
differing interpretations and the resolution of a final tax position, through negotiation or litigation, can take several years 
to complete. Where it is considered that future tax liabilities are more likely than not to arise, an appropriate provision is 
recorded in the financial statements.
Due to the nature of these contingent liabilities, it is not practicable to estimate their timing or possible financial impact. Financial statements

32 Restatement of comparative information
During the year, the iD mobile operations in the Republic of Ireland and the Sprint Joint Venture in the United States 
have been classified as ‘businesses to be exited’ as set out in note 4, and therefore classified in non-headline results. In 
accordance with the accounting policy as described in note 1, comparative information for the financial year ended 30 April 
2016 has been restated accordingly. The impact of the restatement has been set out below:
Consolidated income statement
The results of both operations have been reclassified from headline to non-headline results. There has been no impact on

Segmental information
The comparative segmental information provided in note 3 has been adjusted to reflect the above reclassifications. The 
iD mobile operations were previously included in the UK & Ireland operating segment and have decreased the headline 
external revenue of the UK & Ireland operating segment for 2015/16 by £2 million, from £6,404 million to £6,402 million. 
The headline EBIT of the UK & Ireland segment for 2015/16 has increased by £6 million from £365 million to £371 million. 
The Sprint joint venture operations were previously included in the Connected World Services operating segment, and 
the restatement has increased the headline EBIT of the Connected World Services operating segment by £4 million, from 
£7 million to £11 million. Financial statements
Notes to the Group financial statements
144 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
32 Restatement of comparative information continued
The sales from the iD Mobile operations in Republic of Ireland relate to sales of services, therefore the headline revenue 
from services disclosed in note 3 has decreased from £2,720 million to £2,718 million in 2015/16.
Other disclosures
In accordance with the policy as set out in note 1, there have been no restatements made to the consolidated balance 
sheet, consolidated statement of other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity or 
consolidated cash flow statement, as these statements do not separately distinguish headline and non-headline measures.
33 Events after the balance sheet date
In June 2017, in light of the changing US mobile market landscape and Sprint’s review of its own distribution strategy, the 
companies reached mutual agreement that Sprint will acquire the 50% remaining share of the joint venture currently held 
by the Group. In addition, ongoing agreements relating to consultancy and intellectual property will be settled. The total 
value of consideration received by the Group on 9 June 2017 was $30 million. The results of the joint venture have been 
presented as a ‘business to be exited’ as outlined in note 4, and comparatives have been restated as outlined in note 32. Financial statements

Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the re-measurement of certain financial

156 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Alternative performance measures (‘APMs’)
In the reporting of financial information, the Group uses certain measures that are not required under IFRS. We consider 
that these additional measures (commonly referred to as ‘alternative performance measures’) provide additional information 
on the performance of the business and trends to shareholders. These measures are consistent with those used internally, 
and are considered critical to understanding the financial performance and financial health of the Group. APMs are also 
used to enhance the comparability of information between reporting periods, by adjusting for non-recurring or items 
considered to be distortive on trading performance which may affect IFRS measures, to aid the user in understanding the 
Group’s performance. These alternative performance measures may not be directly comparable with other similarly titled 
measures or ‘adjusted’ revenue or profit measures used by other companies, and are not intended to be a substitute for, or 
superior to, IFRS measures.
Headline and non-headline measures
The Group’s income statement and segmental analysis identify separately headline performance and non-headline items. 
Headline performance measures reflect adjustments to total performance measures. The directors consider ‘headline’ 
performance measures to be an informative additional measure of the ongoing trading performance of the Group. Headline 
results are stated before non-headline items.
Non-headline items consist of the results of discontinued operations or exited / to be exited businesses, amortisation of 
acquisition intangibles, acquisition-related costs, any exceptional items considered sufficiently material that they distort 
underlying performance (such as re-organisation costs, impairment charges, property rationalisation costs and other non-
recurring charges), income from previously disposed operations and net pension interest costs.
Items excluded from headline results can evolve from one financial year to the next depending on the nature of exceptional 
items or one-off type activities. Where appropriate, for example where a business is classified as exited / to be exited, 
comparative information is restated accordingly.
Local currency
Some comparative performance measures are translated at constant exchange rates, called ‘local currency’ measures. 
This restates the prior period results at a common exchange rate to the current year in order to provide appropriate year-
on-year movement measures without the impact of foreign exchange movements.
In response to the Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures issues by the European Securities and Markets 
Authority (‘ESMA’), we have provided additional information on the APMs used by the Group below.

Revenue measures
Headline / non-headline 
Revenue
Revenue See note 2 and 4, 
and note 32 for 
details of restated 
amounts for 
2015/16.
Headline revenues represent the ongoing revenues 
of the Group, and are adjusted to remove non-
headline revenue items. In the current and restated 
comparative periods, this relates to the iD mobile 
operations in Republic of Ireland, which is classified 
as a ‘business to be exited’ and therefore presented 
in non-headline results.
Like-for-like (LFL) % 
change
No direct equivalent Not applicable Like-for-like revenue is calculated based on 
headline store and internet revenue using constant 
exchange rates. New stores are included where 
they have been open for a full financial year both 
at the beginning and end of the financial period. 
Revenue from franchise stores are excluded and 
closed stores are excluded for any period of 
closure during either period. Customer support 
agreement, insurance and wholesale revenues 
along with revenue from Connected World Services 
and other non-retail businesses are excluded from 
like-for-like calculations. We consider that LFL 
revenue represents a useful measure of the trading 
performance of our underlying and ongoing store 
and online portfolio. Investor information

Not applicable Reflects total revenues on a constant currency and

excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate 
movements.
Profit measures
Headline / non-headline 
profit / (loss) before tax, 
EBIT and profit / (loss)

Profit / (loss) before 
interest and tax, 
profit / (loss) after 
interest and tax.
See note 2 and 4, 
and note 32 for 
details of restated 
amounts for 
2015/16.
As discussed above, the Group uses headline profit 
measures in order to provide a useful measure of 
the ongoing performance of the Group. These are 
adjusted from total measures to remove ‘non-
headline’ items, the nature of which are disclosed 
above.
EBIT Profit / (loss) before 
interest and tax
No reconciling items Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) is directly 
comparable to profit / (loss) before tax. The 
terminology used is consistent with that used 
historically and in external communications.
Other earnings measures
Headline / non-headline 
net finance costs
Net finance costs See note 4 Headline net finance costs are adjusted from total 
finance costs to remove non-headline finance 
cost items. Non-headline finance costs includes 
the finance charge of businesses to be exited, 
net pension interest costs, finance income from 
previously disposed operations not classified 
as discontinued, and other exceptional items 
considered so one-off and material that they distort 
underlying finance costs of the Group. Under IAS 
19 ‘Employee Benefits’, the net interest charge 
on defined benefit pension schemes is calculated 
based on corporate bond yield rates at a specific 
date, which, as can vary over time, creates volatility 
in the income statement and is unrepresentative of 
the actual investment gains or losses made on the 
liabilities. Therefore this item has been removed 
from our headline earnings measure in order to 
remove this non-cash volatility.
Headline / non-headline 
income tax expense / 
(credit)
Income tax expense 
/ (credit)
See note 4 Headline income tax expense / (credit) represents 
the income tax on headline earnings. Non-headline 
income tax expense / (credit) represents the tax 
on items classified as ‘non-headline’, either in the 
current year, or the current year effect of prior year 
tax adjustments on items previously classified as 
non-headline. We consider the headline income 
tax measures represent a useful measure of the 
ongoing tax charge / credit of the Group.
Headline / Total effective 
tax rate
No direct equivalent The effective tax rate measures provide a useful 
indication of the tax rate of the Group. Headline 
effective tax is the rate of tax recognised on 
headline earnings, and total effective tax is the rate 
of tax recognised on total earnings.
Earnings per share measures
Headline basic EPS – 
continuing operations, 
headline diluted EPS – 
continuing operations, 
headline basic EPS – total, 
headline diluted EPS -

Statutory EPS 
figures
See note 8 EPS measures are presented to reflect the impact 
of non-headline items in order to show a headline 
EPS figure, which reflects the headline earnings per 
share of the Group. We consider the headline EPS 
provides a useful measure of the ongoing earnings 
of the underlying Group. Investor information

Cash flow measures
Free cash flow Cash generated 
from operations
See note 27 Free cash flow comprises cash generated from / 
(utilised by) continuing operations before special 
pension contributions, less net finance expense, 
less income tax paid and net capital expenditure. 
The directors consider that ‘free cash flow’ provides 
additional useful information to shareholders in 
respect of cash generation and is consistent with 
how business performance is measured internally.
Net debt Cash and cash 
equivalents less 
loans and other 
borrowings and 
finance lease 
obligations.
See note 27 Comprises cash and cash equivalents and short 
term deposits, less borrowings and finance lease 
creditors. We consider that this provides a useful 
measure of the indebtedness of the Group.
Other measures
Return on Capital 
Employed (ROCE)
No direct equivalent Not applicable Calculated on a pre-tax and lease adjusted basis. 
The return is based on headline EBIT, adjusted to 
add back the interest component associated with 
capitalising operating lease costs. Capital employed 
is based on net assets including capitalised leases, 
but excluding goodwill, cash, tax and the defined 
benefit pension obligations. The calculation is 
performed on a moving annual total in order to best 
match the return on assets in a year with the assets 
in use during the year to generate the return. We 
consider this a useful measure to understand how 
the Group has used the capital employed during the 
period.
Pro forma results
In previous periods (up to the annual report and accounts 2015/16), the Group presented ‘pro forma’ comparative financial 
information in order to reflect results of both Carphone Warehouse and Dixons Retail throughout the comparative periods 
as if the Merger on 6 August 2014 had occurred at the start of the 2013/14 financial year. In the current year, pro forma 
information is not presented as does not affect the comparative periods for the current year, other than in the five year 
summary. For information on the pro forma financial information and reconciliations please refer to the annual report and 
accounts 2015/16. Investor information

Other definitions
The following definitions apply throughout this Annual Report and Accounts unless the context otherwise requires:
Acquisition intangibles Acquired intangible assets such as customer bases, brands and other intangible 
assets acquired through a business combination capitalised separately from goodwill. 
Where businesses have grown organically rather than through acquisition, there is no 
amortisation of acquired intangibles and therefore the non-cash amortisation charge 
is removed from our headline earnings measures in order to increase comparability 
between segments.

WAEP Weighted average exercise price “Over the last few years a great deal of work has been done to make the company 
stronger, lower risk and more resilient. We are seeing the upside of these efforts now as 
we declare record headline profits before tax of over half a billion pounds – up 10%. More 
importantly, the improvement in our cost base, the strong leadership position that we 
have built, the investment that we have made in our digital business and, above all, the 
enormous shift in customer satisfaction and price competitiveness that we have driven 
leave us well positioned to flourish in the years ahead.
While the UK consumer environment seems to be holding up for us, there will 
undoubtedly continue to be changes in the way people buy all of the products that we 
sell from phones to washing machines. Change always represents opportunity, and our 
job is to find the propositions that keep us compelling to our customers forever. We are 
excited about our plans in services and about the myriad of initiatives that will drive long-
term relationships with our customers.
In short, it has been a good year for Dixons Carphone and it gives me great pleasure 
once again to thank my 43,000 colleagues for the work that they have done to deliver so 
well and so energetically for our customers.”
