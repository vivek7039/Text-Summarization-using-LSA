Giant Scale Drilling Campaign Initiated
• Drilling campaign initiated in Q1 2018 at zero cost with the Rabat  
 Deep 1 exploration well, Rabat Deep, Morocco, following completion  
 of Farm-Out Agreement with Eni
 – No hydrocarbon accumulation was encountered but a thick top  
  seal and tight, fractured carbonates in the primary Jurassic  
  target were penetrated
• Chariot funded to operate a further giant potential well in Q4 2018 
 – Ocean Rig Poseidon drill ship contracted for one firm and one optional 
  well with Prospect S, Namibia, (459mmbbls gross mean prospective 
  resources) anticipated to spud Q4 2018
• Potential for an additional two wells in the near term, each offering the  
 opportunity for transformational value to the Company and significant  
 follow on potential
Staying Ahead in a Cyclical Market

• Maintain stability and a position of strength by continuing  
 to pursue the de-risking strategy:
 – Use in-house technical capabilities to continue to mature  
  the current portfolio and develop a conveyor belt of giant  
  drilling opportunities and material value triggers
 – Additional partnering to enable the acceleration of  
  drilling of the current and follow-on portfolio
 – Applying capital discipline throughout the business
• Capitalise on the current business environment
• Continue to leverage knowledge of the Atlantic margins  
 to access additional highly prospective new ventures to

With a strong funding position and no remaining commitments across 
its operated portfolio Chariot initiated a three well drilling campaign 
in Q1 2018. Whilst the drilling results of the Rabat Deep 1 well were 
disappointing, we look forward to additional drilling in the year  
ahead, where Chariot’s high impact portfolio will be tested in  
the knowledge that, with its wider focus, we have exposure  
to additional drilling opportunities across a variety of basins  
and play types.

Chariot remains on track 
in its goal of drilling three 
high impact wells of 
transformational potential in 
the near term, with the drilling 
of the Rabat Deep 1 well by 
the Rabat Deep partnership 
complete and preparations 
underway for the drilling 
of Prospect S in Q4 of this 
year and, depending on the 
outcome and partnering, a 
further well, either in Namibia 
or Morocco in H1 2019. In our 
continued aspiration for risk 
management and zero cost 
exploration we will continue 
to seek a partnership balance 
in which the technical risk is 
measured against the cost 
and its associated prize for 
the drilling of these prospects.
With no remaining 
commitments across the 
portfolio we stand in a robust 
financial position from which 
we can look to technically 
mature our current assets and 
we will continue to leverage 
our knowledge of the Atlantic 
margins to access additional 
giant potential new ventures, 
with the aim of offering 
exposure to a pipeline of high 
impact drilling opportunities  
in the long term.
Managing Risks
Through looking to diversify its 
portfolio and seeking partners 
to share the technical and

What We Have Achieved Future Targets 08 Chariot Oil & Gas Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview
While we have seen some recent stabilisation 
in the oil markets, during 2017 the industry 
continued to encounter challenging and 
unpredictable conditions resulting in a reduction 
in global oil and gas Capex and Opex spending 
for a third year in succession. Given Chariot’s 
focus on capital preservation and the steps 
taken in 2015 and 2016 to ensure a robust cash 
position, the Company was again positioned 
to utilise these turbulent times to its strategic 
advantage. Specifically, by investing in the 
technical development of the Company’s assets 
with the acquisition of substantial 2D and 3D 
seismic campaigns at the bottom of the oil 
services market, and in looking to capitalise  
on unprecedented low rig rates for its near  
term drilling campaign. 
The recent disappointing well result in Rabat 
Deep demonstrates the importance of the 
management team’s continued determination 
to build a balanced and sustainable drilling 
portfolio, offering multiple opportunities for 
transformational value. Following the transfer  
of operatorship to Eni in the Rabat Deep acreage 
where the Rabat Deep 1 well was recently 
drilled, Chariot had no financial exposure, having 
achieved its aspiration for zero cost exploration  
in this region. The current market for partnering  
is tougher, but this is balanced by a reduction  
in oil services costs, meaning that Chariot can 
look to retain a greater equity in its assets at  
the point of drilling, especially in light of the 
recent fundraise.
Chariot is now fully funded to operate the drilling 
of Prospect S in Namibia where partnering 
programmes and preparations are underway 
to deliver this high impact well in Q4 2018, with 
optionality to add another two prospects to the 
exploration programme, depending on well 
results and partnering progress. This additional 
prospectivity was secured in 2016 and 2017 with 
further new ventures in Morocco as part of the 
team’s focus on risk diversification and aim to lock 
in additional potential from improved technical 
understanding of near term drilling. This strategy 
was also put into effect in Namibia with a back-in 
option in legacy acreage in the Southern Blocks 
secured in Q3 2017. 
It is with this continued focus on the de-risking 
strategy, governed by a diligent team, supportive 
partners and an effective Board that we hope 
to achieve our goal of discovering material 
accumulations of hydrocarbons.
Robust Financial Position
The Company ended the year with a robust 
balance sheet, with no debt and a cash balance 
of US$15.2 million as at 31 December 2017. This 
was achieved through the management team’s 
continued efforts to protect the Company’s 
strong cash position, supported by prudent 
decisions on expenditure, back costs received 
from its partners, and a reduction in its annual 
cash overheads for the fourth consecutive 
year – now less than half of what they were 
when current management first came to the 
helm. This, in part, has been possible owing to 
the continued impact of the 50% Board salary 
decrease since 2015 as well as the Company 
restructure of 2016. In maintaining capital 
discipline at the centre of our business we are 
able to apply our strategy from a position of fiscal 
strength and have the optionality to invest in 
opportunities as they arise.
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
FOCUSED ON VALUE
Chariot’s risk management
strategy and recent
successful equity fundraise
means that it is on track

Prospect S in Namibia in
Q4 2018 and continue
the development of the
Company’s broader portfolio. 
“With our continued focus on the de-risking strategy, 
governed by a diligent team, supportive partners and

discovering material accumulations of hydrocarbons. ”

Taking a Lead
We have focused core 
commercial, financial and 
technical capabilities within our 
team, ensuring the continued 
growth and forward progress 
of the Company.
Engaging with Shareholders
Communications with 
shareholders are given a high 
priority. We offer regular meetings 
to institutional investors and 
annual general meetings to our 
broader investor community. 
We also host conference calls 
following the announcement 
of interim and final results and 
at other appropriate times.
Managing Risks
We carry out in-depth technical 
reviews in accordance with our 
financial position and portfolio 
direction at quarterly meetings, 
and our committees meet 
regularly to support the delivery 
of best practice corporate 
standards in everything we do.
Supporting Management
We have a small and effective 
Board that provides strong 
leadership – engaging and 
challenging both the executive 
and senior management teams 
across the business in regular 
dialogue and face to face 
meetings.
Our Governance Principles
Successful Placing
Post period we were pleased to receive interest 
from both institutional and private investors  
who expressed a desire to make further 
investment in the Company, and in Q1 2018 a 
placing and open offer raised an additional net 
US$16.5 million. We see this as a sign that equity 
market observers are growing in confidence 
in the oil and gas sector and view Chariot’s 
resilience in the downturn and future exploration 
programme as a robust opportunity for growth. 
Chariot is now funded to operate the drilling 
of Prospect S, Namibia, in the latter part of 
this year, which has a gross mean prospective 
resource of 459mmbbls and a potential upside of 
2.2Bnbbls in other prospects within the licence. 
As a result this investment gives us more fire 
power in our decision making and commercial 
strength in negotiations, particularly with regard 
to capitalising on historically low rig rates and 
ongoing partnering discussions. 
Our Values
Throughout the year and despite a smaller 
headcount, we have maintained our skills 
and knowledge base by retaining the core 
commercial, financial and technical capabilities 
of our team, ensuring the continued growth 
and forward progress of the Company. This 
has been accomplished by having an effective 
Board that provides strong leadership, engaging 
and challenging both the executive and senior 
management teams across the business. 
We carry out in-depth technical reviews in 
accordance with our financial position and 
portfolio direction at quarterly meetings, and 
our committees meet regularly to support the 
delivery of best practice corporate standards 
in everything we do. This is further supported 
by our external advisors with whom we retain 
strong relationships and regular reviews.
This diligence at Board level creates a culture 
that emanates through the rest of the team. 
Long term growth and profitability is enhanced 
when businesses behave in a sustainable 
and responsible manner, with respect to the 
environment, health and safety, and to all their 
stakeholders. In particular, we recognise the 
importance of the work carried out by and 
the continued co-operation, correspondence 
and input of our in-country partners. Regular 
meetings to share technical and operational 
developments within each region facilitate 
communication and processes at all levels –  
from government to local empowerment 
partners and service companies. It is thanks 
to the continued support of these entities, 
particularly the Governments and Energy 
Ministries and their respective national oil 
companies, that Chariot has been able to  
mature its portfolio and seek partnerships  
for the next stages of exploration. We look 
forward to continuing to build on these strong 
relationships as we enter the drilling phase.
Outlook
We will continue to adhere to our core values 
as we look to execute the primary objective of 
creating value for our shareholders by delivering 
the highest quality exploration opportunities. We 
believe that we have built a strong platform for 
long term growth at the same time as offering 
near term, material value triggers. 
Chariot’s continued investment in the portfolio 
during a downturn in the industry means that 
this year the Company will have been exposed 
to two giant-scale wells whilst capturing the 
bottom of the cost cycle for drilling. Although the 
outcome of the Rabat Deep 1 well in Morocco 
was disappointing, Chariot’s risk management 
strategy and recent successful equity fundraise 
means that it is on track and fully funded to drill 
Prospect S in Namibia in Q4 2018 and continue 
the development of the Company’s broader 
portfolio in Brazil and its other Moroccan permits. 
It is an exciting year ahead but, as always, the 
Company will continue to apply risk reduction 
strategies throughout the portfolio due to the 
high risk – high reward nature of its exploration 
programme, as well as the unpredictability of 
the financial and resource markets. With our 
recently bolstered financial resources, supported 
by steps we have taken to ready our business for 
growth, we remain well prepared to capitalise on 
opportunities as they arise.

Chairman
5 June 2018 10 Chariot Oil & Gas Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Chariot’s continued focus over the last 12 
months on capital discipline, partnering and 
portfolio management has culminated in the 
current drilling programme, targeting some 
of the world’s largest prospects of 2018, with 
the capacity to transform the Company’s value 
and offer substantial follow on potential in the 
success case. At the same time, its technical 
focus ensures the Company continues to mature 
the rest of the portfolio and its new venture 
strategy has successfully sought to capitalise 
on any further information gained from our 
near term drilling programme to add to our 
longer term prospect inventory. 
The importance of this de-risking strategy is 
highlighted through the recent disappointing 
results of the Rabat Deep 1 well, which tested 
one of the play types, a Jurassic Carbonate, 
within the Company’s wider portfolio focus. 
Through partnering Chariot was able to 
participate in this well at no cost. At the same 
time as using the information gained from this 
well to de-risk those prospects with similar 
properties, with a diversified portfolio Chariot 
can offer exposure to other high impact drilling 
opportunities which fall across several basins  
in a number of play types within the Atlantic 
Margin, and the Company looks forward to the 
drilling of Prospect S in Namibia during Q4 2018.
Crucially, it is the in-house team that has been 
able to identify these giant, high margin assets 
and manage them in a challenging business 
environment that makes Chariot’s offering truly 
compelling. Using its strategic foresight the 
Company has invested in the opportunities 
that have arisen from a lower for longer oil price 
environment, taking advantage of significant 
reductions in the seismic market and now 
having captured the same effect on rig rates. 
Through this and our recently bolstered funding 
position, we expect to achieve a balance of 
equity, technical risk and cost through our 
ongoing partnering negotiations with the aim 
of maximising our exposure to the drilling of our 
near term giant prospects at the optimum point 
of the cost cycle.
Accelerated Drilling Campaign in a Low 
Cost Window of Opportunity
In Q1 2018 Chariot participated in the first of 
three giant potential wells that the Company  
is aiming to drill over the next 18 months.  
The Rabat Deep 1 well, targeting the JP-1 
prospect in Rabat Deep offshore Morocco,  
was drilled by the Rabat Deep partnership to  
a total depth of 3,180m with the Saipem 12000 
sixth generation ultra-deepwater drillship. It 
penetrated a thick top seal and encountered 
tight, fractured carbonates in the primary target 
and consequently was plugged and abandoned 
with the data collected used to calibrate existing 
data sets to understand the implications on the 
prospectivity of the surrounding area. 
Whilst the outcome of the well is very 
disappointing, having farmed down the acreage 
at both the seismic and drilling investment 
phase, Chariot was able to participate in a 
potentially transformational well at zero cost to 
the Company. This may not be achievable across 
the entirety of the portfolio, but Chariot aims to 
capitalise on opportunities where it is able, and 
with the recent successful fundraising it is funded 
to lock in the current reduction in rig rates which, 
in response to decreased world-wide exploration 
activity, are now a quarter of their previous cost. 
This timing is crucial. With a recently stabilised oil

point of the cost cycle
Staying Ahead in 
a Cyclical Market
“We look forward to a number of material value triggers in the 
year ahead, where Chariot’s high impact portfolio will be tested 
in the knowledge that, with its wider portfolio focus, we have 
secured follow on potential for the success case, and additional 
high impact drilling opportunities across a variety of basins  
and play types beyond the current objectives in the broader 
Atlantic Margin. ”

price and the reduced cost price environment 
encouraging more seismic activity, we see signs 
of a return to exploration from the industry, and 
with increasing demand for these services, will 
come increasing prices. It is for this reason that 
we are looking to act now, while this window 
of opportunity remains open. 
Drilling preparations have therefore 
commenced for Prospect S (audited gross 
mean prospective resources of 459mmbbls) in 
Namibia in anticipation of a Q4 2018 spud and 
Kenitra-1 (gross mean prospective resources 
of 464mmbbls) in Chariot’s operated acreage 
in Morocco where we are targeting drilling 
to commence in H1 2019, depending on 
drilling outcomes and partnering processes. 
Management believes that this preparatory work 
will avoid unnecessary delays associated with its 
plans to drill, strengthen its position in partnering 
negotiations and ensure it capitalises on the 
current low-cost oil services environment. 
As well as the financial capacity to do this, we 
now also have the operational skill set with the 
addition of David Brecknock, Drilling Manager, 
to the team in October 2017. David has held a 
variety of drilling operations and management 
roles, principally in deep-water drilling, with over 
20 years of international experience gained with 
Enterprise, Shell, BG, Devon, Perenco and Ophir. 
Most recently David led a team which delivered 
a deep-water exploration well in Cote d’Ivoire 
for less than US$20 million gross – a well drilled 
in similar water depth and depth of primary 
target as Prospect S in Namibia, which we aim to 
deliver safely and efficiently under his leadership. 
Partnering – Getting the Balance Right
Locking in the reduced rig costs is also deemed 
important to our negotiating position in the 
ongoing partnering processes on our Namibian 
and operated Moroccan acreage. The very 
process of carrying out a dataroom and the 
potential partnering negotiations that follow 
provides the third party validation and technical 
de-risking that the Company looks for to ensure 
that the potential of the asset is endorsed. The 
subsequent decisions are based on balancing 
the asset’s associated risk, with the cost and 
ultimate value of success to Chariot – taking into 
account external commercial factors such as the 
current economic environment. 
Where seismic was carried out at the peak of 
the market cycle in 2014 on the Rabat Deep 
asset, for example, partnering was essential 
to balance the cost of this and the rig market 
conditions at the time. The resulting equity left 
in the asset was representative of the anticipated 
financial outlay. At the moment, however, with 
rig rates down from US$650,000/day (2012) to 
less than US$200,000/day (2017), the costs of 
the upcoming drilling programme are vastly 
reduced. As such, and given Chariot’s recently 
strengthened financial position, this balance in 
the partnering process has shifted allowing the 
Company to retain larger equity in a low cost 
well (as anticipated for Prospect S) instead of a 
smaller equity position in a high cost well. 
Chariot aims to capitalise on 
opportunities where it is able, 
and with the recent successful 
fundraising it is funded to lock in 
the current reduction in rig rates 
which, in response to decreased 
world-wide exploration activity, are 
now a quarter of their previous cost. 
This timing is crucial. With a recently  
stabilised oil price and the reduced cost  
price environment encouraging more  
seismic activity, we see signs of a return 
to exploration from the industry, and with 
increasing demand for these services, will 
come increasing prices. 
Drilling preparations have therefore 
commenced for Prospect S in Namibia in 
anticipation of a Q4 2018 spud and Kenitra-1 
in Chariot’s operated acreage in Morocco 
where we expect drilling to commence in 
H1 2019, depending on drilling outcomes 
and partnering processes. Management 
believes that this preparatory work will avoid 
unnecessary delays, strengthen its position 
in partnering negotiations and ensure 
it capitalises on the current low-cost oil 
services environment. 
Successful Placing and Open Offer – What it Means for Chariot 12 Chariot Oil & Gas Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
Continued
Opportunities in the Low-cost Environment
Drilling costs at historic lows
•  Down by 65% – 75% of the 2014 peak, 
but expected to increase with a return 
to exploration 
•  Rig day rates down from >$650k/day 
to <$200k/day 
•  Ayame – 1x ultra-deepwater well offshore 
Cote d’lvoire drilled for <$20m (2017) 
– similar design and target depth to 
Chariot’s wells
Low cost window is expected to close
•  Chariot captured the bottom of the seismic 
market with extensive surveys in Morocco, 
Namibia and Brazil 
•  Seismic costs are now recovering from 
historic lows with growing limitations on 
streamer availability 
•  Increasing seismic activity enables additional 
exploration drilling
Industry return to exploration
•  In response to stabilised oil price, reduced 
cost environment and the challenge of 
reserve replacement 
•  First signs of increasing drilling activity 
in West Africa
It is thus that the Company will continue to look 
to balance its equity stake and cost in its licences 
while, at the same time as achieving third party 
validation and capital discipline, delivering the 
greatest value possible to its shareholders.
Successful partnering on these near term wells 
will also offer the potential to liberate funds to 
extend the current drilling programme. In the 
Central Blocks in Namibia, for example, with 
success in Prospect S and with partnering, Chariot 
will aim to drill the neighbouring Prospect W 
(284mmbbls gross mean prospective resources) 
back-to-back and, by using the same rig, to 
benefit from cost reduction through operational 
synergy. Similarly, at Kenitra-1, with success and 
partnering the Company would aim to drill 
LKP-1a (350 mmbbls gross mean prospective 
resources) back-to-back in the neighbouring 
Mohammedia Permits. It is thus that through the 
strong financial position of the Company and 
potential additional partnering Chariot could drill 
up to a further two prospects in the near term.
Focused Portfolio Management
Chariot continues to strive for a diverse 
portfolio that creates a variety of opportunities 
for substantial play opening targets with an 
optimum chance for long term success. As 
part of this focus, the team has continued to 
analyse the wider opportunities presented in 
the Atlantic Margin, particularly keeping in mind 
the objective of locking in follow on potential 
that may result from any success and improved 
technical understanding from near term drilling. 
In this way, having identified prospectivity 
extending into neighbouring acreage in the 
Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous plays from Rabat 
Deep, the team secured the Mohammedia 
permit in 2016 and, during 2017, Kenitra, 
offshore Morocco with a 75% equity holding 
– which now make up part of the near term 
drilling programme. 
In 2017 the team acquired and processed 
a further 1,027km
2
 of 3D and 2,254km of 2D 
seismic in this operated Moroccan acreage, 
concluding all remaining commitments at 
favourable rates. This, combined with the 
calibrated results of the Rabat Deep 1 well,  
will allow the team to improve the description 
of its drilling targets, Kenitra-1 and LKP-1a,  
in the Cretaceous siliciclastic play.
The team also continues to work towards 
maturing the longer-term prospect inventory 
from its current portfolio. This year the team 
completed its analysis of the 3D seismic data 
it acquired in 2016 across its Namibian and 
Brazilian licences, integrating five new prospects 
(S, T, U, V and W), ranging from 283 – 459mmbbls 
in gross mean prospective resources, into the 
drilling inventory from the former, and a large 
four way dip-closed structure in the latter, on 
which an independent audit of prospective 
resources has been completed, and a dataroom 
is currently open. The Brazil portfolio consists of 
seven prospective reservoir targets individually 
ranging up to 366mmbbls and collectively in 
excess of 1.4Bnbbls of gross mean prospective 
resources. With well operations now funded for 
Prospect S, it is intended that partnering followed 
by a drilling campaign on the rest of these newly 
defined targets, along with any additional new 
ventures, will secure the longevity and extend 
the follow-on potential of the Company’s 
portfolio beyond the current objectives. 
“Having captured the bottom 
of the seismic market with 
extensive 3D surveys in 
Namibia and Brazil in 2016, 
the team continued its 
rigorous tendering processes 
in 2017 to acquire and 
process a further 1,027km
2
 
of 3D and 2,254km of 2D 
seismic in its operated 
Moroccan acreage. With this 
complete, the Company 
also aims to take advantage 
of reduced rig rates, which, 
in response to decreased 
world-wide exploration 
activity, are now a quarter 
of their previous cost. ” STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
13 Chariot Oil & Gas Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017
As well as looking to add prospectivity, the team 
also consistently streamlines the portfolio to 
identify those parts that, despite being giant in 
their potential, may present higher risks. With this 
in mind, in August 2017, the Company reported 
that it had decided not to enter the next period 
of exploration in the Southern Blocks, Namibia. 
It has, however, secured an option to back-in 
for 10% equity after the completion of future 
exploration drilling in region for no financial 
consideration in exchange for facilitating  
a partnering programme which will be 
undertaken by the state oil company, NAMCOR. 
In doing so, the Company still retains exposure  
to the upside on this acreage, whilst being able 
to focus its funds on maturing its near-term 
drilling inventory.
Our T eam
Crucial to these achievements is Chariot’s 
in-house team. With a combined knowledge 
base of over 200 years on the Atlantic Margins 
we believe that Chariot has one of the best 
understandings of this geology amongst our peer 
group and by continuing to apply its technical 
strength, it aims to deliver on its goal; to discover 
material accumulations of hydrocarbons. This is 
complemented by the financial and commercial 
capabilities of the team in negotiating excellent 
contract rates and terms, with a focus on capital 
discipline ensuring for a robust fiscal position. 
We were also very pleased to welcome the 
aforementioned David Brecknock to the team 
in 2017 as Drilling Manager, in anticipation of  
safe, efficient and cost-effective drilling operations 
in the year ahead.
With another challenging year within the oil and 
gas industry I would like to thank the team for 
their continued hard work. The recent upturn 
in the sector, including interest from the equity 
markets, means Chariot is well positioned to take 
advantage of the opportunities presented at this 
point of the cost cycle and looks forward to the 
developments of the year ahead.
Outlook
Chariot remains on track in its goal of drilling 
three high impact wells of transformational 
potential in the near term, with the drilling 
of the Rabat Deep 1 well by the Rabat Deep 
partnership complete and preparations 
underway for the drilling of Prospect S in Q4 of 
this year and, depending on the outcome and 
partnering, a further well, either in Namibia or 
Morocco in H1 2019. It is owing to the continued 
focus on capital discipline, technical expertise 
and the de-risking strategy that we have been 
able to initiate this drilling campaign at no cost 
to the Company and we will continue to seek a 
partnership balance in which the technical risk 
is measured against the cost and its associated 
prize, to maximise the retention of licence equity 
and achieve drilling at the optimum point of the 
oil services cost cycle.
At the same time we remain vigilant of the 
potential ongoing volatility in the market 
and will continue to ensure the stability of 
the Company’s long term. With no remaining 
commitments across the portfolio we stand in a 
robust financial position from which we can look 
to technically mature our current assets and seek 
partners to enable the acceleration of drilling the 
follow-on portfolio. In addition, we will continue 
to leverage our knowledge of the Atlantic margins 
to access additional giant potential new ventures, 
with the aim of offering exposure to a sustainable 
pipeline of high impact drilling opportunities.

Funding and Liquidity as at 
31 December 2017
The Group continues to have a robust balance 
sheet with no debt, cash of US$15.2 million as at 
31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: US$25.0 
million) and, following the drilling of the Rabat 
Deep 1 well in Q1 2018 which Chariot achieved 
at zero cost, no remaining commitments. The 
equity fundraise announced post year end raised 
an additional net US$16.5 million providing 
funding for the planned drilling in Q4 2018 
of Prospect S in Namibia. 
During 2017 the Group continued with the 
development of its portfolio and business 
by investing c.US$13 million into its exploration 
portfolio and administration activities  
(31 December 2016: c.US$17 million) primarily 
in the 2D and 3D seismic campaign in 
Morocco. The timely acquisition of seismic 
data in Morocco allowed the Group to fulfil 
its commitments early in the licence phases 
at historically low rates, again demonstrating 
strong capital discipline and leveraging the 
technical expertise and value additive work 
of the highly experienced, industry respected, 
in-house team. 
The recovery of the Rabat Deep investment 
costs, received on completion of the farm-out 
to Eni in January 2017, was supported by careful 
stewardship of existing cash balances, as the 
effects of the 2016 restructuring and continued 
focus on cost saving led to further reductions 
in annual cash overheads, before any recovery 
from partners, to US$4.2 million down from 
US$5.0 million in 2016. 
As at 31 December 2017, US$7.6 million of the 
Group’s cash balances were held as security 
against licence work commitments. The increase 
from US$6.2 million as at 31 December 2016 was 
primarily due to the award of the Kenitra licence 
in 2017. In February 2018 US$4.0 million of 
Moroccan bank guarantees were released. 
Financial Performance – Year Ended 
31 December 2017 
The Group’s loss after tax for the year to  
31 December 2017 was US$55.4 million,  
which is US$48.6 million higher than the  
US$6.8 million loss incurred for the year ended  
31 December 2016. 
The vast majority of this US$48.6 million increase 
in the annual loss is due to an impairment 
charge of US$51.3 million against previously 
capitalised costs in the Namibian Southern 
Blocks due its relinquishment in August 2017 
compared with a US$5.2 million impairment 
charge in Mauritania in 2016, together with 
a reduction in net finance income of US$2.7 
million combined with an overall reduction 
in share based payments, other administrative  
expenses and tax expense totalling US$0.2 
million. This equates to a loss per share  
of US$(0.21) compared to a loss per share  
of US$(0.03) in 2016.
The share based payments charge of US$0.9 
million for the year ended 31 December 2017 in 
relation to employee deferred share awards was 
broadly consistent with US$0.8 million in the 
previous year.

Chief Financial Officer STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
15 Chariot Oil & Gas Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Other administrative expenses of US$3.4 million 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 is US$0.1 
million lower due to ongoing costs savings  
(31 December 2016: US$3.5 million). 
The finance income and expense net gain of 
US$0.2 million (31 December 2016: US$2.8 
million net gain) comprises interest on cash and 
foreign exchange movements on non-US$ cash.
Interest income of US$0.2 million for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 is significantly lower 
than the prior year as the vast majority of the 
Group’s cash is now held at lower interest rates 
in US Dollars, as compared with the significant 
Brazilian Real cash balance held throughout 
2016 earning a higher interest rate  
(31 December 2016: US$1.2 million).
The foreign exchange loss on non-US$ cash 
of less than US$0.1 million for the year ended  
31 December 2017 is also indicative of the 
Group holding the majority of its cash in US 
Dollars. In the prior year significant cash balances 
were held in Brazilian Real as security against 
licence work commitments resulting in a higher 
foreign exchange movement (31 December 
2016: US$1.6 million gain). 
The tax expense of less than US$0.1 million in 
the year to 31 December 2017 (31 December 
2016: US$0.2 million) relates to Brazilian taxation 
levied on interest income with its decrease 
consistent with lower Brazilian interest income 
received in 2017.
Exploration and Appraisal Assets as at 
31 December 2017
During the year to 31 December 2017, the 
carrying value of the Group’s exploration and 
appraisal assets decreased by US$46.9 million  
to US$72.8 million from US$119.7 million as  
at 31 December 2016. This US$46.9 million 
decrease was due to the US$51.3 million 
impairment charge against the Southern Blocks 
and US$3.0 million of farm-in proceeds in Rabat 
Deep, Morocco, partly offset by US$7.3 million  
of portfolio investment undertaken in 2017. 
The US$7.3 million portfolio investment is split as 
follows: in Morocco, US$5.8 million was incurred 
mainly on 2D and 3D seismic acquisition and 
processing; in Namibia, US$0.9 million was 
incurred across all the Group’s licences, with the 
majority relating to the Central Blocks 3D seismic 
interpretation and preparations to drill; and in 
Brazil, US$0.6 million was incurred mainly on the 
3D seismic interpretation.
Other Assets and Liabilities as at 
31 December 2017
The Group’s inventory balance of US$0.5 million 
as at 31 December 2017 has decreased from 
US$0.9 million at 31 December 2016 due to the 
disposal of some items of wellheads and casings.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group’s net 
balance of current trade and other receivables 
and current trade and other payables shows a 
net current liability position of US$1.0 million 
(31 December 2016: US$3.5 million) with the 
decrease primarily due to settlement in the 
current year of outstanding payables for the 
seismic campaigns in Brazil and Namibia.
Outlook
We will look to continue to apply the de-risking 
strategies of maturing the portfolio, partnering 
to drill assets where funding is needed, and 
applying capital discipline throughout the 
project execution phase. With US$15.2 million 
of cash at 31 December 2017, no debt and 
no commitments across the entirety of the 
portfolio, the Group is well funded. In March 
2018 this balance sheet was further bolstered by 
an equity raise of US$16.5 million net, allowing 
funding for the drilling of Prospect S in Namibia 
and acting as a potential catalyst for future 
partnering discussions. We thus look forward 
to an exciting year with the continuation of 
the Company’s drilling programme, providing 
additional value triggers and the possibility for 
Chariot’s giant potential prospect inventory to 
be realised.

Investment in the Portfolio 16 Chariot Oil & Gas Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Across its licences Chariot’s in-house team 
has evaluated new and existing 2D and 3D 
seismic data sets, with the Company having 
acquired, processed and interpreted in excess 
of 9,000km 2D and 17,000km2 3D data over 
the past decade. From this, the Company 
has identified over three billion barrels of 
gross mean prospective resources within the 
prospect inventory from its current acreage 
and has three high-graded drill-ready prospects 
ranging from 459mmbbls to 911mmbbls 
gross mean prospective resources, all having 
significant follow-on potential in diverse 
plays and trapping configurations. The year 
2018 sees the initiation of a three well drilling 
campaign, testing three of the four plays 
within the portfolio. From this campaign, we 
hope to attain our goal of discovering material 
accumulations of hydrocarbons and to apply 
the information from these wells, successful 
or not, to calibrate the seismic data and further 
refine our understanding of the potential 
of these underexplored regions.
Period and Post Period Exploration 
Developments
During 2017 Chariot continued to invest in 
its portfolio to capitalise on the current low 
cost environment. The first well in its drilling 
programme was completed at no cost to the 
Company in Rabat Deep, Morocco, in April 2018. 
Whilst the Rabat Deep 1 well was unsuccessful, 
Chariot’s operated neighbouring portfolio offers 
a variety of high impact drilling opportunities 
in the near term in other plays, which the team 
has continued to de-risk throughout the period 
through seismic acquisition and studies. 
New Venture Acquisitions
To capture this potential, Chariot secured 
the Kenitra Permit in Morocco in Q1 2017, 
encompassing the broader LKP group of 
prospects and the Kenitra prospect which now 
makes up part of the forward drilling campaign. 
Chariot also secured back-in rights in legacy 
acreage in Namibia.
Extensive Seismic Acquisition, Processing 
and Interpretation Programmes 
Through its extensive work programme, 
the Chariot in-house sub-surface team has 
continued to refine its prospect inventory  
with the completion of the evaluation of 3D 
seismic datasets acquired in 2016 in Brazil and 
Namibia. This work has led to the inclusion of 
five new structural prospects in Namibia and a 
diverse portfolio of stratigraphic and structural 
closures in Brazil as confirmed by a recently 
completed CPR.
In 2017 acquisition and processing of 
approximately 2,250km 2D and 1,000km2 3D 
seismic in Mohammedia and Kenitra, Morocco, 
was carried out under favourable commercial rates. 
This dataset is currently being interpreted and will 
be calibrated with the recent information from the 
drilling of the JP-1 prospect in Rabat Deep, to refine 
the Lower Cretaceous drilling targets Kenitra-1  
and LKP-1a. 
Partnering Progress
In Q1 2017 Chariot completed the transfer of 
operatorship in Rabat Deep offshore Morocco 
to Eni in return for a carry on the drilling of 
the commitment well Rabat Deep 1 offering 
the Company exposure to transformational 
potential at no financial risk. 
Partnering processes have also been initiated 
across the remainder of its acreage on priority 
drilling targets.
Preparations for Drilling Operations 
2018/2019
Having previously taken advantage of the 
low seismic acquisition rates, Chariot is now 
focusing on seizing the opportunity of the 
depressed deep-water drilling rig market 
and has launched drilling preparations in 
Namibia and Morocco through the initiation 
of Environmental Impact Assessments, 
procurement of long lead items and through 
well design and well planning activities. 
This advanced preparatory work will enable 
Chariot to have the flexibility to capitalise on 
the current low-cost environment for drilling. 
Chariot aims to operate the exploration drilling 
campaign on Prospect S, Namibia in Q4 2018, 
and depending on the outcome of this well, to 
secure a partner for back-to-back drilling in this 
region on Prospect W, or to drill in Morocco the 
following year.
EXPLORATION MANAGER’S REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
CREATING A BALANCED 
PORTFOLIO OF GIANT POTENTIAL
Chariot has built a diversified
portfolio encompassing
the giant-potential,
underexplored deep-water
regions offshore Namibia,
Morocco and Brazil, which
offer a range of risk and
maturity in three basins 
with four plays. 
“Although Chariot’s strategic application is key to being able to 
deliver on its goals, it is the quality of the portfolio that will be 
the ultimate determinant of our success. Despite the different 
levels of exploration maturity, each asset is characterised by 
flexible work programmes, excellent contract and commercial 
terms and most importantly scale, with our current drilling 
inventory containing high-graded prospects, each in excess  
of 450mmbbls of gross mean prospective resources. ”

Portfolio in Focus: Giant Prospectivity  
at Lowered Risk
Early stage exploration for giant opportunities 
carries high technical risk and we continue 
to mitigate these risks through the application 
of our de-risking strategy: 
• Acquiring diverse assets across a range of  
 basins and of varied exploration maturity
• Applying technology through the  
 acquisition of extensive 2D and 3D seismic  
 data sets, state of the art processing and  
 performing high quality sub-surface analysis 
• Active portfolio management, which includes  
 both rationalisation through relinquishments  
 and new acreage access, for example  
 through licence awards
• Levered partnering, as previously achieved  
 with Petrobras, BP , Azinam, Cairn, Woodside  
 and Eni. 
Although Chariot’s strategic application is 
key to being able to deliver on its portfolio 
goals, it is the quality of the portfolio that will 
be the ultimate determinant of our success. 
Despite the different levels of exploration 
maturity, each asset is characterised by flexible 
work programmes, excellent contract and 
commercial terms and most importantly scale, 
with our current drilling inventory containing 
high-graded prospects in excess of 450mmbbls 
each of gross mean prospective resources. 
As well as offering a range of play types and 
investment opportunities, these drill-ready 
targets fall in the lower cost environment 
for deep-water projects. All prospects fall 
within normal temperature and pressure 
environments, in deep-water of 750m to 
1,650m water depth and in basins unlikely 
to be affected by challenging metocean 
conditions. As a result of this lower cost 
environment, excellent contract commercial 
terms and large prospective resource potential 
we can offer assets with high margins and very 
robust economics to potential partners in the 
event of success, each with material direct 
follow-on potential.

Well Partnering
Chariot was one of the first oil and gas explorers 
to secure licence areas in deep-water offshore 
Namibia. As a result Chariot holds first-mover 
advantage with its in-depth knowledge of the 
Namibian geology and a significant acreage 
position totalling approximately 16,800km² 
within the Walvis Basin, adjacent to third-party 
wells which have proven mature source rock and 
excellent quality reservoirs. The Company has 
in excess of 6,000km2 of proprietary 3D seismic 
data, acquired in two separate campaigns. This 
3D data combined with its 2D proprietary data 
and the participation in the ION NambiaSP AN 
multi-client 2D seismic survey of 2015 which 
covered the entire offshore Namibian margin,  
as well as the information from the drilling of 
the Kabeljou and Tapir South wells, has provided 
invaluable detail on the regional geological 
architecture of our acreage. In particular, this 
permits an accurate depiction of the deeper 
basin structure, distribution of source rock 
levels, definition of the main reservoir fairways 
and critically the controls on generation 
of low-risk structural traps. Importantly, it 
appears that Chariot’s blocks are well placed 
to capture charge from key source kitchens 
and the Company’s 3D seismic programmes 
demonstrate the presence of large structural 
closures within the licence. 
Of note, five dip-closed structural traps have 
been identified in the Upper Cretaceous 
turbidite clastic play fairway, with the focus 
prospects being Prospect S (gross mean 
prospective resources 459mmbbls) – the 
2018 drilling candidate, Prospect W (gross 
mean prospective resource 284mmbbls) – the 
follow on drilling candidate and Prospect B 
(469mmbbls gross mean prospective resources) 
– a higher risk-reward stratigraphic trap which 
could be de-risked through calibration of 
the seismic data with the first well results. 
Preparation for drilling in Q4 2018 is underway 
for Prospect S, with an Environmental Impact 
Assessment (the Environmental Clearance 
Certificate being awarded in January 2018) 
and drilling and geological operational work in 
progress. A partnering process is ongoing with 
the aim of securing funding for optional future 
drilling, for example on Prospect W, should 
Prospect S be successful.
Additionally, during the year, and as part of the 
withdrawal from the Southern Blocks (2714A 
and 2714B), Chariot secured an option to back-
in for 10% equity at no cost after exploration 
drilling in return for which the Company will 
assist with the farm-out process that will be led 
by NAMCOR, the Namibian State Oil Company 
on this acreage.

Well Partnering Well Partnering
In Morocco, the Company holds acreage across 
three permit areas: Rabat Deep, Mohammedia 
and Kenitra, which are situated up to 50km 
offshore in northern Morocco and cover a 
combined area of approximately 12,800km2. 
Following extensive technical analysis of 
legacy 2D seismic data, and its own proprietary 
2D and 3D seismic, the team has identified 
potential in the two primary plays that have 
been the source of industry activity along the 
margin over recent years.
Mohammedia and Kenitra (75% Chariot 
(Operator), 25% ONHYM (carried interest)
In line with its new venture strategy, Chariot 
used its depth of understanding of the regional 
geology and associated hydrocarbon play 
potential to expand its portfolio in Morocco, 
securing first the Mohammedia permit in June 
2016 and then, in early 2017, the Kenitra permit. 
In Mohammedia and Kenitra, Chariot holds 75% 
equity and operatorship, the remaining 25% 
being with ONHYM.
The Mohammedia licence area sits inboard of 
Rabat Deep and covers an area of approximately 
4,600km2 with water depths of less than 500m. 
The Kenitra Exploration Permit is adjacent to 
Mohammedia covering an area of approximately 
1,400km2 with water depths ranging from 200m 
to 1,500m. In Q1 2017, leveraging the cost 
collapse of the seismic market to accelerate 
the fulfilment of its licence commitments, the 
Company acquired approximately 1,000km2 of 
3D and 2,250km of 2D, designed to investigate 
the extent of the prospectivity in the Lower 
Cretaceous play and in the Jurassic carbonate 
play which was the focus of the Rabat Deep 1 
well. The processing of these datasets has now 
been completed and the interpretation process 
is ongoing. This will be further refined through 
the calibrated information from the Rabat Deep 
1 well, to de-risk the prospectivity. 
Previous 3D data acquired by Chariot in 2014 
highlighted the LKP group of prospects in the 
shallower Lower Cretaceous clastic play, with 
the LKP-1a (350mmbbls gross mean prospective 
resources) being a priority drilling target. Crucially, 
however, it is anticipated that the new seismic 
data and insights from the Rabat Deep 1 well, 
will provide further detail to de-risk Kenitra-1 
(464mmbbls gross mean prospective resources 
(internal estimate)). This prospect is located across 
the boundary between the 2014 3D seismic data 
and the 2017 3D and currently interpreted as an 
attribute supported combination stratigraphic 
and fault-closed structural trap in the Lower 
Cretaceous marine sequence and has been 
earmarked as a priority drilling target. It sits 
within a prospect inventory of the Mohammedia 
and Kenitra permits, which currently totals 
in excess of 1 billion barrels of gross mean 
prospective resources.
To enable the possibility for an accelerated 
drilling programme, preparations for drilling 
on these priority prospects has been initiated. 
This includes Environment Impact Assessment 
preparation, preliminary geohazards and 
pore pressure analysis and conceptual well 
engineering. To allow for the completion of 
the interpretation of the 2017 seismic data 
and the incorporation of the results of the 
Rabat Deep 1 well, an updated partnering 
process on Kenitra-1 and the LKP-1a prospect 
is anticipated to commence in mid-2018, with 
the aim of securing partners to contribute to 
the funding of Kenitra-1 in H1 2019 (subject to 
partnering success).

Depending on the outcome of the partnering 
process, the possibility exists for the drilling of 
prospect LKP-1a back-to-back with the Kenitra-1 
well (subject to success in Kenitra-1).
Rabat Deep (10% Chariot, 40% Eni 
(Operator), 25% Woodside, 25%  
ONHYM (carried interest)
In Rabat Deep, Chariot is partnered with Eni 
(Operator), Woodside (25%) and the state 
oil company ONHYM (25%). In 2017, Chariot 
completed the transfer of operatorship to 
Eni in return for a carry on the drilling of the 
commitment well, Rabat Deep 1, which was 
completed in April 2018 with the Saipem 12000 
rig, a sixth generation ultra-deep-water drillship. 
The well did not encounter a hydrocarbon 
accumulation and as a result, the well was 
plugged and abandoned, however the extensive 
subsurface data collected will be used to 
calibrate the existing seismic data sets  
to understand the implications of the well results 
on the prospectivity of the surrounding area.
Forward Plan 2018/2019
Mohammedia and Kenitra:
• Complete 2D/3D seismic interpretation over  
 Mohammedia & Kenitra and calibrate this  
 with the information from the Rabat Deep 1  
 well to fully describe priority drilling targets  
 and additional prospectivity
• Initiate an updated partnering process,  
 anticipated mid-2018
• Drill Kenitra-1 (Kenitra) with LKP-1a  
 (Mohammedia) back-to-back (subject to  
 well results and partnering):
 – Kenitra-1 (464mmbbls gross mean  
  prospective resources (internal estimate))  
  is an attribute supported combination

• No remaining commitments
Rabat Deep 1 was safely drilled to 
a total measured depth of 3,180m 
to test the JP-1 prospect which 
had a pre-drill audited estimation 
of 768mmbbls of gross mean 
prospective resources. The well 
penetrated a thick top seal and 
drilled into the primary target 
encountering tight, fractured 
carbonates as evidenced by 
extensive losses of drilling fluid. 
As a consequence, only limited cuttings 
were recovered from the primary target and 
some limited hydrocarbon indications were 
observed. Electric log data and sidewall 
cores have been acquired and detailed 
analyses are currently being undertaken 
to determine why the reservoir was tight. 
By gaining a greater understanding of the 
physical rock properties we can carry out 
geophysical modelling to identify the 
seismic signature of this tight reservoir and 
compare it against the other seismic facies 
across the JP-1 structure and other Jurassic 
carbonate leads and prospects in Rabat 
Deep and Chariot’s neighbouring acreage, 
particularly that of JP-2.
The results of the well will also be useful to 
de-risk the younger Cretaceous siliciclastic 
play type in Chariot’s adjoining acreage. 
Within the thick seal section of the well 
the team has interpreted thin sands from 
log evaluation and cuttings. Using these 
logs we expect to be able to measure 
the physical rock properties to undertake 
seismic modelling and fluid substitution  
to calibrate and compare the LKP group  
of prospects and leads in the Mohammedia 
and Kenitra permits and the Kenitra-1 
prospect in Kenitra.

Following the highly successful drilling 
campaigns on the conjugate margin of Cote 
d’Ivoire and Ghana, the 11
th
 licensing round 
in the Brazilian Barreirinhas basin, where 
the potential for hydrocarbon generation is 
anticipated to be similar, was highly competitive. 
Despite this competition, Chariot secured 100% 
of licences BAR-M-292, 293, 313 and 314 on a 
seismic option and with a low signature bonus 
whilst many of the neighbouring operators in 
the region took on significantly higher signature 
bonus payments and drilling commitments 
within the First Exploration Phase. 
Whilst there have only been three deep-water 
wells drilled within the basin to date, the 
information these have provided has proven 
the presence of excellent quality Tertiary and 
Cretaceous deep-water turbidite reservoirs. 
In addition, the presence of Santonian and 
Cenomanian-Turonian source rocks have 
been demonstrated in legacy shallow-water 
wells drilled in-board of Chariot’s acreage with 
evidence for sufficient burial for hydrocarbon 
generation, which is supported by prevalent 
shows in offset wells.
Chariot has now completed the evaluation 
of its proprietary 775km2 3D seismic survey. 
A Competent Person’s Report (“CPR”) has been 
completed by Netherland Sewell and Associates 
Inc. (“NSAI”) over Chariot’s Brazilian portfolio. This 
portfolio consists of seven prospective reservoir 
targets in a range of trapping configurations 
from purely structural and combination traps, 
associated to a 200km2 4-way dip-closed 
structure which sits principally over Block 314, 
to stratigraphic traps. The on-licence gross 
mean prospective resource of individual targets 
range up to 366mmbbls, and a single vertical 
well located at Prospect 1 can penetrate the 
TP-1, TP-3 and KP-3 stacked targets which have 
a summed on-licence gross mean prospective 
resource of 911mmbbls. Additionally, the 
portfolio contains multiple additional structural, 
combination and stratigraphic closures in 
reservoir targets in the Tertiary and Upper 
Cretaceous. The description of this prospect 
inventory has been completed ahead of 
anticipated third party drilling in neighbouring 
acreage which will test the potential of the 
deeper outboard basin and directly de-risk the 
Chariot acreage which is located within the 
same play fairway, but critically in an up-dip 
setting. A partnering process on these licences 
has been initiated with a dataroom now open.

RISK MANAGEMENT STATEMENT
RISK MITIGATION AND 
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
Risk Description Mitigation
Funding and  
Financing Risk
The nature of the Group’s business of 
exploring in deep offshore regions 
means that there are significant costs 
associated with seismic and drilling 
campaigns.
The Group manages this risk in a number of ways. The Group closely monitors 
its cash position and each month produces updated cash flow forecasts 
to help it determine whether it has sufficient financial resources to fund its 
short and medium term operations. The Group also ensures that it always has 
adequate levels of cash on deposit with varying terms of maturity to match 
when significant items of expenditure become due. In addition, the Group 
is continually seeking to reduce its exposure to large expensive projects by 
engaging with farm-in partners with a view to reducing its equity stakes in the 
licences in which it operates and where the Group is unable to attract partners it 
may relinquish assets. To date, the Group has been successful in both managing 
its cash position and bringing large, well-funded partners into its licences.
Exploration Risk There is no assurance that the Group’s 
exploration activities will be successful.
Recognising this, the Group continually seeks to manage this risk by managing 
its funding and financing risk as described above and, in particular, by bringing 
in farm-in partners who have demonstrable technical skills and experience 
in similar projects worldwide. The Group has so far been successful with this 
strategy by introducing strong industry partners to its licences, including 
Woodside and Eni. Furthermore, the Group seeks to employ individuals with 
strong technical skills and experience in the areas in which it operates. This is 
evidenced by the fact that a number of the Group’s Board and Senior Technical 
Team have previously worked both offshore and onshore in Namibia, throughout 
West and North Africa and in Brazil.
Operating Risk The nature of oil and gas operations 
means that the Group is exposed to 
risks such as equipment failure, well 
blowouts, fire, pollution and bad 
weather.
In order to mitigate these risks, the Group ensures that: it adopts best in class 
industry operating and safety standards; it has sufficient levels of relevant 
insurance cover; and it only works with fellow operators and world-class 
contractors who can demonstrate similar high standards of safety, operating and 
financial capability.
Environmental Risk The Group is extremely conscious 
of the environmental risks that are 
inherent in the oil and gas industry 
and, in particular, those that exist as a 
result of operating offshore.
Given this, the Group works closely with the relevant ministries to ensure that 
all relevant Environmental Impact Studies are undertaken in advance of any 
proposed seismic or other offshore operations that are undertaken and that 
best in class industry environmental standards and practices are adopted by the 
Group in all of its operations. The Group is currently engaging with third party 
contractors for readiness planning and potential execution concerning i) any 
potential pollution incident and ii) emergency response planning related to the 
Group’s upcoming drilling programme. Furthermore, during seismic acquisition 
programmes, the Group routinely deploys marine mammal observers on vessels 
who are empowered to stop or modify the seismic programme if they deem 
it necessary. Whilst the Group can never fully mitigate against the cost and 
implications of future changes in environmental legislation and regulation, its 
strong working relationship with the governments in the countries in which it 
operates places it in a good position to be able to work through any potential 
significant changes that could arise in the future.
The Group is subject to various risks including those which derive from the 
nature of its oil and gas exploration activities. The following list sets out the 
Group’ s principal risks and uncertainties and also provides details as to how 
these are managed. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

hold employment without discrimination. It 
is our policy to make every effort to provide 
a working environment free from bullying, 
harassment, intimidation and discrimination 
on the basis of disability, nationality, race, sex, 
sexual orientation, religion or belief.
Employee Welfare
Chariot aims to assist employees at all levels 
to improve their professional abilities and to 
develop their skills.
The Group will practice manpower and 
succession planning in regard to the number 
and type of personnel resources that will 
be required in the future. Individual career 
progression activities are developed with 
this in mind.
Joint Venture Partners, Contractors  
and Suppliers
Chariot is committed to being honest and fair 
in all its dealings with partners, contractors and 
suppliers. The Group has a policy to provide 
clarity and protection, within its terms of 
business, to ensure the delivery and receipt 
of products and services at agreed standards. 
Procedures are in place to ensure that any 
form of bribery or improper behaviour is 
prevented from being conducted on Chariot’s 
behalf by joint venture partners, contractors 
and suppliers. Chariot also closely guards 
information entrusted to it by joint venture 
partners, contractors and suppliers, and seeks  
to ensure that it is never used improperly.
Operating Responsibly and  
Continuous Improvement
Chariot is committed to a proactive quality 
policy to ensure that stakeholders are satisfied 
with its results and the way in which the 
business operates and to promote continuous 
improvement in the overall operation of the 
Group. In pursuit of these objectives, Chariot 
will use recognised standards and models as 
benchmarks for its management systems.
Environmental and 
Socioeconomic Policy
Chariot adopts an environmental policy 
which sets standards that meet or exceed 
industry guidelines and host government 
regulations. This is reviewed on a regular 
basis. Wherever we operate we will develop, 
implement and maintain management systems 
for sustainable development that will strive 
for continual improvement.
Prior to any seismic acquisition programmes 
and in preparation for the drilling of any 
exploratory wells, Chariot will employ 
environmental consultants to carry out area 
specific Environmental Impact Assessments 
(“EIAs”) which are approved by the relevant 
ministries. Chariot intends to carry out all 
necessary requirements to ensure that the 
environment in and around its areas of interest 
is maintained to the highest standard. During 
all seismic acquisition programmes, Chariot 
employs marine mammal observers to travel 
on board the seismic vessels. These observers 
compile marine mammal and bird count 
statistics which will assist in the preparation  
of future EIAs.
With regards to preparation for drilling 
exploratory wells, Chariot will use its 
Environmental Management Plan which will  
be implemented from preparatory stage to  
well completion. Whilst drilling is underway,  
an Oil Spill Response and Emergency Response 
plan will be put in place. At the point of 
discovery, an Environmental Management 
System will be developed to co-ordinate and 
monitor environmental activities and report  
the performance over the lifetime of the field 
from discovery to development, through  
to abandonment.
Social impacts will also form part of these 
assessments and preliminary work in this 
area will consider the local communities and 
the local economic effects on a progressive 
and permanent level. It is Chariot’s aim to 
ensure that all the likely environmental and 
socioeconomic impacts will be managed  
with skill, care and diligence in accordance  
with professional standards.
Chariot is committed to maintaining and 
regularly reviewing its Health and Safety  
and Environmental (HSE) policies.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Report of the Directors and the financial statements for the Group in accordance with applicable Guernsey 
law and regulations.
Guernsey legislation requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that year.
The Directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that the financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Group’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. 
This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition 
criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s “Framework for the preparation and 
presentation of financial statements” . In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs.  
A fair presentation also requires the Directors to:
• consistently select and apply appropriate accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact 
of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
• prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless, having assessed the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, management 
either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or have no realistic alternative to do so.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with The Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Group’s website. Legislation 
in Guernsey governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

All of the current Directors have taken all the steps they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any information needed by the Company’s 
auditors for the purposes of their audit and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information. The Directors are not aware of any relevant audit 
information of which the auditors are unaware.
BDO LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office and a resolution to re-appoint them as auditors will be proposed at the next General Meeting.

to the Members of Chariot Oil & Gas Limited
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Chariot Oil & Gas Limited and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for the year ended 31 December 2017 which 
comprise the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December, 2017 and of the Group’s loss for the year then 
ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those 
standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the 
Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
• the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
• the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the Group’s 
ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least 12 months from the date when the financial statements 
are authorised for issue.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current 
period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had 
the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.
Recoverability of the Central Blocks offshore Namibia 
exploration assets.
At 31 December 2017 the carrying value of the Central Blocks 
offshore Namibia exploration assets were US$50.5 million (2016:  
US$49.8 million), as disclosed in Note 11 to the financial 
statements.
As the carrying value of these exploration assets represent  
a significant asset to the Group, we considered it necessary to 
assess whether any facts or circumstances exist to suggest that the 
carrying amount of this asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
As a result, the assets were required to be assessed for impairment 
indicators in accordance with IFRS 6. 
In regards to the Central Blocks offshore Namibia exploration assets:
• we have obtained and reviewed the licence agreements and 
confirmed that all licences were in good standing;
• we have obtained 2018/2019 budgets and have inspected 
intended work plans;
• we have reviewed Board minutes and RNS announcements for 
any indications of impairment; 
• we have reviewed technical data available including reserves/
resources and considered the implied value derived; and
• Assessed the adequacy of the related disclosure within Note 11 
of the financial statements.
Key audit matter Our response 32 Chariot Oil & Gas Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Our application of materiality
Group materiality US$1,800,000 (2016: US$3,000,000)
Basis for determining materiality 2% of total assets 
Group performance materiality US$1,170,000 (2016: US$1,950,000)
Basis for performance materiality 65% of Group materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements. We consider materiality  
to be the magnitude by which misstatements, including omissions, could influence the economic decisions of reasonable users that are taken on the 
basis of the financial statements. Importantly, misstatements below these levels will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also take account  
of the nature of identified misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating their effect on the financial statements  
as a whole. 
Our basis for the determination of materiality has remained unchanged with a significant decrease in the total assets in the year impacting materiality.  
We consider total assets to be the most significant determinant of the Group’s financial performance used by members as the Group continues to bring  
its oil and gas exploration assets through to production.
Whilst materiality for the financial statements as a whole was US$1.8 million, each significant component of the Group was audited to a lower level of 
materiality. Performance materiality has been set at 65% of materiality, which is used to determine the financial statement areas that are included within 
the scope of our audit and the extent of sample sizes during the audit.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all individual audit differences identified during the course of our  
audit in excess of US$90,000 (2016: US$140,000). We also agreed to report differences below these thresholds that, in our view warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit scope focused on the Group’s principal operating locations being Chariot Oil & Gas Limited (parent Company) registered in Guernsey, 
Enigma Oil & Gas Exploration (Pty) Limited registered in Namibia and Chariot Brasil Petroleo e Gas Ltda registered in Brazil which are subject to a full scope 
audit. Together with the group consolidation, which was also subject to a full scope audit, these represent the significant components of the Group. 
All of the audits of the components were principally performed in the United Kingdom by BDO LLP except for Enigma Oil & Gas Exploration (Pty) Limited 
which was audited by BDO Namibia. 
We sent group instructions to BDO Namibia for the audit of Enigma Oil & Gas Exploration (Pty) Ltd including details of the group risks specific to the entity. 
We have reviewed their work and performed further testing and made specific enquiries where it was deemed necessary.
The remaining components of the Group are considered non-significant. The non-significant components were principally subject to analytical review 
procedures. Our full audit procedures cover substantially 100% of the Group’s total assets. 
Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the 
financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the 
extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material 
misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
33 Chariot Oil & Gas Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit,  
we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the Directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
• proper accounting records have not been kept by the Company; or
• the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records; or 
• we have failed to obtain all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, are necessary for the purposes of our audit.
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group  
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether  
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 262 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law. Our audit work  
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and  
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 General information
Chariot Oil & Gas Limited is a company incorporated in Guernsey with registration number 47532. The address of the registered office is Regency Court, 
Glategny Esplanade, St Peter Port, Guernsey, GY1 1WW. The nature of the Company’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Report of the 
Directors and in the Exploration Manager’s Review of Operations.
2 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRIC interpretations, as issued  
by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), as adopted by the European Union. 
In accordance with the provisions of section 244 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008, the Group has chosen to only report the Group’s consolidated 
position, hence separate Company only financial statements are not presented.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost accounting convention on a going concern basis.
Going concern 
The Directors are of the opinion that the Group has adequate financial resources to enable it to undertake its planned programme of exploration and 
appraisal activities for a period of at least 12 months. 
New Accounting Standards
The following new standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for the first time for the Group for the financial year beginning 1 January 2017. 
The implementation of these standards and amendments to standards has had no material effect on the Group’s accounting policies.
Standard Effective year commencing on or after
IAS 7 – Statement of Cash Flows (Amendments) 1 January 201 7
IAS 1 2 – Income T axes (Amendments) 1 January 201 7
Annual Improvements to IFRSs – (2014-2016 Cycle) 1 January 201 7
Certain new standards and amendments to standards have been published that are mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning after  
1 January 2018 or later years to which the Group has decided not to adopt early when early adoption is available. The implementation of these standards 
and amendments is expected to have no material effect on the Group’s accounting policies. These are:
Standard Effective year commencing on or after
IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments 1 January 2018
IFRS 1 5 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018
IFRS 16 – Leases 1 January 201 9
IFRS 2 – Share Based Payments (Amendments) 1 January 2018
Annual Improvements to IFRSs – (2014-2016 Cycle) 1 January 2018

IAS 28: Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures  1 January 201 9*
* Not yet endorsed by the EU.
Exploration and appraisal costs
All expenditure relating to the acquisition, exploration, appraisal and development of oil and gas interests, including an appropriate share of directly 
attributable overheads, is capitalised within cost pools. 
The Board regularly reviews the carrying values of each cost pool and writes down capitalised expenditure to levels it considers to be recoverable.  
Cost pools are determined on the basis of geographic principles. The Group currently has four cost pools being Central and Southern Blocks in Namibia, 
Morocco and Brazil. In addition where exploration wells have been drilled, consideration of the drilling results is made for the purposes of impairment of 
the specific well costs. If the results sufficiently enhance the understanding of the reservoir and its characteristics it may be carried forward when there is 
an intention to continue exploration and drill further wells on that target.
Where farm-in transactions occur which include elements of cash consideration for, amongst other things, the reimbursement of past costs, this cash 
consideration is credited to the relevant accounts within the cost pools where the farm-in assets were located. Any amounts of farm-in cash consideration 
in excess of the value of the historic costs in the cost pools is treated as a credit to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
Inventories
The Group’s share of any material and equipment inventories is accounted for at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories 
comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
39 Chariot Oil & Gas Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017
2 Accounting policies continued
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax charge for the year.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding  
tax bases, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences  
and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted and are expected to apply in the year when the liability  
is settled or the asset realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, except when it relates  
to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when  
they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into US Dollars at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into US Dollars at the closing rates at the reporting date and the exchange differences are included in 
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The functional and presentational currency of the parent and all Group companies is the  
US Dollar.
Property, plant and equipment and depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or fair value on acquisition less depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is provided on a straight line 
basis at rates calculated to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of each asset over its expected useful economic life. The residual value is the 
estimated amount that would currently be obtained from disposal of the asset if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the 
end of its useful life. 
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives over a range of 3 – 5 years.
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is assessed annually and any impairment charge is charged to the Consolidated Statement  
of Comprehensive Income.
Operating leases
Rent paid on operating leases is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Share based payments
Where equity settled share awards are awarded to employees or Directors, the fair value of the awards at the date of grant is charged to the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on 
the number of awards that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the awards granted. As long as all other vesting 
conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for 
failure to achieve a market vesting condition.
Where the terms and conditions of awards are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the awards, measured immediately before and 
after the modification, is also charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the remaining vesting period.
Where shares already in existence have been given to employees by shareholders, the fair value of the shares transferred is charged to the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income and recognised in reserves as Contributed Equity.
Basis of consolidation
Where the Company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. The Company controls an investee if it has power over the investee and it 
is exposed to variable returns from the investee and it has the ability to use its power to affect those variable returns. Control is reassessed whenever facts 
and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control. The consolidated financial statements present the results of 
the Company and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) as if they formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between the Group companies 
are therefore eliminated in full. 40 Chariot Oil & Gas Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017
for the year ended 31 December 2017
NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2 Accounting policies continued
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial assets consist of a bank current account or short term deposits at variable interest rates and other receivables. Any interest earned 
is accrued and classified as finance income. Trade and other receivables are stated initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
The Group’s financial liabilities consist of trade and other payables. The trade and other payables are stated initially at fair value and subsequently at 
amortised cost. 
Joint operations
Joint operations are those in which the Group has certain contractual agreements with other participants to engage in joint activities that do not create 
an entity carrying on a trade or business on its own. The Group includes its share of assets, liabilities and cash flows in joint arrangements, measured 
in accordance with the terms of each arrangement, which is usually pro rata to the Group’s interest in the joint operations. The Group conducts its 
exploration, development and production activities jointly with other companies in this way.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
The Group makes estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based on historical experiences 
and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In the future, actual experience 
may deviate from these estimates and assumptions. If these estimates and assumptions are significantly over or under stated, this could cause a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. The areas where this could impact the Group are:
a) Areas of judgement
i. Recoverability of intangible assets
Expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset by reference to appropriate cost pools and is assessed for impairment when circumstances suggest 
that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable value. This assessment involves judgement as to: (i) the likely future commerciality of the 
asset and when such commerciality should be determined; (ii) future revenues and costs pertaining to any asset based on proved plus probable, 
prospective and contingent resources; and (iii) the discount rate to be applied to such revenues and costs for the purpose of deriving a recoverable 
value.
ii. Treatment of farm-in transactions
All farm-in transactions are reflected in these financial statements in line with the accounting policy on Exploration and Appraisal Costs. Farm-in 
transactions are recognised in the financial statements if they are legally complete during the year under review or, if all key commercial terms are 
agreed and legal completion is only subject to administrative approvals which are obtained within the post balance sheet period or are expected 
to be obtained within a reasonable timeframe thereafter.
b) Areas of estimation
i. Share based payments
In order to calculate the charge for share based compensation as required by IFRS 2, the Group makes estimates principally relating to the 
assumptions used in its pricing model as set out in note 20.
ii. Inventory provision
The Group assesses whether a provision is required for inventory by comparing the cost to the net realisable value, which is estimated 
based on available market prices. If the net realisable value is lower than the cost the difference is charged to the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

3 Segmental analysis 
The Group has two reportable segments being exploration for oil and gas and corporate costs. The operating results of each of these segments are 
regularly reviewed by the Board of Directors in order to make decisions about the allocation of resources and assess their performance.

9 Taxation
The Company is tax resident in the UK, however no tax charge arises due to taxable losses for the year (31 December 2016: US$Nil).
No taxation charge arises in Namibia, Morocco or the UK subsidiaries as they have recorded taxable losses for the year (31 December 2016: US$Nil).
In Brazil, there were taxable profits due to interest received on cash balances resulting in a tax charge payable of US$25,000 (31 December 2016: 
US$159,000). There was no deferred tax charge or credit in either period presented.
Factors affecting the tax charge for the current year
The reasons for the difference between the actual tax charge for the year and the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK applied to losses for the year 
are as follows:
   31 December 201 7 31 December 2016
   US$000 US$000
Tax reconciliation  
Loss on ordinary activities for the year before tax   (55,393) (6,673)
Loss on ordinary activities at the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 1 9.25% (31 December 2016: 20%)  (10,663)  (1,335)
Non-deductible expenses   10,050 1,200
Difference in tax rates in other jurisdictions   95 1 27
Deferred tax effect not recognised   543 167
Total taxation charge   25 159
The Company had tax losses carried forward on which no deferred tax asset is recognised. Deferred tax not recognised in respect of losses carried forward 
total US$5.9 million (31 December 2016: US$5.4 million). Deferred tax assets were not recognised as there is uncertainty regarding the timing of future 
profits against which these assets could be utilised.
10 Loss per share
The calculation of basic loss per Ordinary share is based on a loss of US$55,418,000 (31 December 2016: loss of US$6,832,000) and on 268,595,921 Ordinary 
shares (31 December 2016: 266,296,528) being the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue during the year. Potentially dilutive share awards 
are detailed in note 20, however these do not have any dilutive impact as the Group reported a loss for the year, consequently a separate diluted loss per 
share has not been presented.  44 Chariot Oil & Gas Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

18 Related party transactions 
• Key management personnel comprises the Directors and details of their remuneration are set out in note 6 and the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
• Alufer Mining Limited (“Alufer”) is a company where Robert Sinclair was a Director until 20 December 2016 and Adonis Pouroulis is a Director. During 
the year ended 31 December 2017, Alufer received administrative services from an employee of Chariot for which it incurred fees payable to Chariot 
of US$24,053 (31 December 2016: US$75,384). The amount outstanding as at 31 December 2017 was US$Nil (31 December 2016: US$11,357).
19 Financial instruments
The Board of Directors determine, as required, the degree to which it is appropriate to use financial instruments or other hedging contracts or techniques 
to mitigate risk. Throughout the year ending 31 December 2017, no trading in financial instruments was undertaken (31 December 2016: US$Nil). There is 
no material difference between the book value and fair value of the Group cash balances, short term receivables and payables.
Market risk
Market risk arises from the Group’s use of interest bearing and foreign currency financial instruments. It is the risk that future cash flows of a financial 
instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates (interest rate risk) and foreign exchange rates (currency risk). Throughout the year, the 
Group has held surplus funds on deposit, principally with its main relationship bank Barclays, on fixed short term deposits. The credit ratings of the main 
relationship bank the Group holds cash with do not fall below A or equivalent. The Group does not undertake any form of speculation on long term 
interest rates or currency movements, therefore it manages market risk by maintaining a short term investment horizon and placing funds on deposit to 
optimise short term yields where possible but, moreover, to ensure that it always has sufficient cash resources to meet payables and other working capital 
requirements when necessary. As such, market risk is not viewed as a significant risk to the Group. The Directors have not disclosed the impact of interest 
rate sensitivity analysis on the Group’s financial assets and liabilities at the year end as the risk is not deemed to be material.  
This transactional risk is managed by the Group holding the majority of its funds in US Dollars to recognise that US Dollars is the trading currency of the 
industry, with an appropriate balance maintained in Brazilian Real, Sterling and Namibian Dollars to meet other non-US Dollar industry costs and ongoing 
corporate and overhead commitments. 
At the year end, the Group had cash balances of US$15.2 million (31 December 2016: US$25.0 million) as detailed in note 15. 
Other than the non-US Dollar cash balances described in note 15, no other material financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than US 
Dollars. A 10% adverse movement in exchange rates would lead to a foreign exchange loss of US$50,000 and a 10% favourable movement in exchange 
rates would lead to a corresponding gain; the effect on net assets would be the same as the effect on profits (31 December 2016: US$384,000).
Capital
In managing its capital, the Group’s primary objective is to maintain a sufficient funding base to enable it to meet its working capital and strategic 
investment needs. The Group currently holds sufficient capital to meet its ongoing needs for at least the next 12 months.  
Liquidity risk
The Group’s practice is to regularly review cash needs and to place excess funds on fixed term deposits. This process enables the Group to optimise the 
yield on its cash resources whilst ensuring that it always has sufficient liquidity to meet payables and other working capital requirements when these 
become due.
The Group has sufficient funds to continue operations for the forthcoming year and has no perceived liquidity risk. 
Credit risk
The Group’s policy is to perform appropriate due diligence on any party with whom it intends to enter into a contractual arrangement. Where this 
involves credit risk, the Company will put in place measures that it has assessed as prudent to mitigate the risk of default by the other party. This could 
consist of instruments such as bank guarantees and parent company guarantees. 
At the year end the Group acts as Operator in one non-carried joint venture relationship on one of the Group’s licences and therefore from time to time 
is owed money from its joint venture partners. The joint venture partner which has a 20% interest in the Central Blocks in Namibia is an entity which is part 
owned by one of the world’s largest seismic and geoscience companies.
As such, the Group has not put in place any particular credit risk measures in this instance as the Directors view the risk of default on any payments due 
from the joint venture partner as being very low.  48 Chariot Oil & Gas Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Share Option Scheme
During the year, the Company operated the Chariot Oil & Gas Share Option Scheme (“Share Option Scheme”). The Company recognised total expenses  
of US$Nil (31 December 2016: US$Nil) related to equity settled share based payment transactions under the plan.
The options expire if they remain unexercised after the exercise period has lapsed. For options valued using the Black-Scholes model, there are no market 
performance conditions or other vesting conditions attributed to the options. 
The following table sets out details of all outstanding options granted under the Share Option Scheme:
   31 December 201 7 31 December 2016
   Number of Options Number of Options
Outstanding at beginning of the year   3,000,000 4,000,000

Outstanding at the end of the year   3,000,000 3,000,000
Exercisable at the end of the year   3,000,000 3,000,000
The range of the exercise price of share options exercisable at the year end falls between US$0.36 (27p) – US$1.68 (125p) (31 December 2016:  
US$0.33 (27p) – US$1.54 (125p)).
The estimated fair values of options which fall under IFRS 2 and the inputs used in the Black-Scholes model to calculate those fair values are as follows:
 Estimated    Expected   Expected
Date of grant fair value Share price Exercise price volatility Expected life Risk free rate dividend
1 September 2011 £0.87 £1.29 £1.25 80% 5 years 4.3% 0%
22 April 2013 £0.11 £0.186 £0.273 80% 5 years 1.5% 0%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the annualised standard deviation of the daily changes in the share price. 
Long Term Incentive Scheme (“LTIP”)
The plan provides for the awarding of shares to employees and Directors for nil consideration. The award will lapse if an employee or Director  
leaves employment. 
Shares granted when an individual is an employee will vest in equal instalments over a three year period from the grant date and shares granted when  
an individual is a Director or otherwise specified will vest three years from the end of the year or period that the award relates. 
The Group recognised a charge under the plan for the year to 31 December 2017 of US$806,000 (31 December 2016: US$734,000).

Non-Executive Directors’ Restricted Share Unit Scheme (“RSU”)
The plan provides for the awarding of shares to Non-Executive Directors for nil consideration. An award can be Standalone or Matching.
Standalone share awards are one-off awards to Non-Executive Directors which will vest in equal instalments over a three year period and will lapse if not 
exercised within a fixed period on stepping down from the Board.
Matching share awards will be granted equal to the number of existing Chariot shares purchased by the Non-Executive Director in each calendar year 
capped at the value of their gross annual fees for that year. The shares will vest in equal instalments over a three year period and will lapse if not exercised 
prior to stepping down from the Board or if the original purchased shares are sold prior to the vesting of the relevant Matching award. Any potential 
Matching awards not granted in a calendar year shall be forfeited and shall not roll over to subsequent years. 
The Group recognised a charge under the plan for the year to 31 December 2017 of US$69,000 (31 December 2016: US$53,000).
The following table sets out details of all outstanding share awards under the RSU:

21 Contingent liabilities 
From 30 December 2011 the Namibian tax authorities introduced a withholding tax of 25% on all services provided by non-Namibian entities which are 
received and paid for by Namibian residents. From 30 December 2016 the withholding tax was reduced to 10%. As at 31 December 2017, based upon 
independent legal and tax opinions, the Group has no withholding tax liability (31 December 2016: US$Nil). Any subsequent exposure to Namibian 
withholding tax will be determined by how the relevant legislation evolves in the future and the contracting strategy of the Group.

On 30 April 2018 the Company announced that the Rabat Deep 1 well on the Rabat Deep Permits in Morocco (Eni Maroc B.V. 40% (operator), Woodside 
Energy (Morocco) Pty Ltd 25%, OHNYM 25%, Chariot Oil & Gas Investments (Morocco) Limited 10%), had been safely drilled to a total depth of 3,180m. 
Chariot was fully carried for the drilling of the Rabat Deep 1 well as part of the farm-out to Eni which was approved in January 2017. The well, which did 
not encounter a hydrocarbon accumulation, was subsequently plugged and abandoned. The drilling result is a non-adjusting post-balance sheet event  
as the recognition criteria for the Moroccan cost pool under IFRS 6 were still met at the year end. 50 Chariot Oil & Gas Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017
