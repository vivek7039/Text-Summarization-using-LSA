*** Headline earnings per share is an APM, see page 12 and note 2 on pages 91 and 92 for further information. What’s in a name?
Our new name recognises the size and  
importance of Ferguson in the USA which today 
generates nearly 90 per cent of the Group’s  
trading proﬁt. It’s also about the Ferguson culture  
that puts people and customers ﬁrst, resulting  
in the highest levels of quality, service and efficiency  
for over sixty years.
Our customers rely on us every day and our 
specialist products and services are used in almost 
every stage of commercial, residential, industrial 
and municipal development. We help them ﬁnd the  
best combination of services and solutions to  
save them time and money. Whatever the challenge, 
we work closely with our customers to help  
them run their businesses more effectively and 
save them time and money.
Over the following pages we celebrate our  
new name by focusing on the strengths and 
opportunities inherent in our US business which we 
believe will generate sustainable proﬁtable growth  
and strong returns for our shareholders.

Strategic report What makes Ferguson a great business
 
We operate in attractive,  
fragmented markets
As the largest distributor of plumbing and 
heating products in the USA, we hold  
leading market positions in the majority of  
our businesses. These markets are typically  
highly fragmented with few large  
competitors and we compete with many  
small local distributors.
Consequently, there continues to  
be excellent opportunities to grow our  
business geographically, particularly in large  
metropolitan areas across the USA.
Page 19

02 Case study
Blended Branches is the 
Number 1 distributor of plumbing 
and heating products in the 
USA with an estimated market 
share of 17 per cent. 
There are only three national 
competitors with a market share 
above 5 per cent with the majority 
of supply houses being small local 
distributors. Market share varies 
across the USA from low single  
digit in some states to high twenties 
in others. 
There are numerous opportunities 
in highly populated regions in the 
USA for us to grow our business. 
For example in the north east 
Ferguson has relatively low market 
share with many huge metro 
markets still relatively unpenetrated. 
These include New Y ork and Boston 
which are some of the largest 
metro markets in the USA. 
We are now targeting accelerated 
growth plans in these regions 
and many others across the USA. 
For information on the USA business 
units and our international operations 
see pages 14 and 15.

What makes Ferguson a great business
 
We work in an industry with compelling 
growth opportunities
Our strong service ethic combined with  
scale advantages in logistics, supply chain  
and technology, means we have consistently 
gained market share to generate strong  
proﬁtable growth. Acquiring regional  
or local competitors where we can rapidly 
integrate them into our supply chain makes  
bolt-on acquisitions highly attractive.
Other growth opportunities lie in  
developing new adjacent businesses such  
as Facilities Supply and B2C e-commerce  
where we can utilise our existing skills, 
capabilities and infrastructure.
Pages 17, 19 and 40
04 Case study
Our Facilities Supply business 
provides our customers with 
products and services used in the 
repair, maintenance, replacement 
and renovation of their facilities 
with key product categories 
including janitorial supplies, 
hardware, heating ventilation 
and air conditioning (“HVAC”), 
lighting, plumbing, paint and 
safety equipment.
The newest business group in the 
USA operates in a c. $90 billion 
addressable market that was 
historically served by a highly 
fragmented, localised base of 
competitors. Our aim is to become 
the market leader and we are 
well positioned to capture market 
share through our product mix, 
national network, technology, 
supplier relationships and talent 
development programme. 
Growth will continue to be 
enhanced through both organic 
business development and 
targeted acquisitions that add to our 
geographical capabilities, expand 
our customer base and bring 
talented associates into the business. 
We strongly believe we will gain 
market share and grow proﬁtably 
in this attractive market.
$90bn
The Facilities Supply market in the  
USA is highly fragmented and estimated 
 to be worth circa $90 billion
05 What makes Ferguson a great business
 
We offer our customers  
unrivalled scale
Our highly efficient national logistics and 
distribution network enables us to achieve 
volume discounts from suppliers and the  
highest levels of availability for our customers  
on a broad range of products. 
We continue to invest in the latest  
technology solutions to make us an even  
more efficient business and to save time  
and resources for our customers.

06 Case study
Our T exas distribution hub based in 
Euless, near Dallas, was at capacity 
due to increasing growth in the 
region over the last two years. 
The logistics operation was being 
run from two separate buildings, with 
more than 20 storage containers, and 
an appliance warehouse in the Dallas 
Fort Worth region. A solution was 
found in a new Market Distribution 
Centre (“MDC”) which centralises 
the “ﬁnal mile” logistics to customers 
for the whole region from one 
large location. 
The new 281,000 square foot facility 
will support the high growth rate in the 
region with more capacity and better 
operating efficiencies. Ideally situated 
in the heart of the market, the MDC 
drives scale and also enables local 
branches to concentrate on sales and 
service to customers. 
This is Ferguson’s third MDC 
installation in 18 months with two 
others now fully operational in 
the New Y ork and San Francisco 
metro regions.

What makes Ferguson a great business
 
We recruit and retain the best people,  
with a passion for customer service
The knowledge and service our associates 
provide is what our customers value. 
Our dedication to provide unrivalled service  
is the key Ferguson differentiator and it  
will continue to be our focus by providing  
the best trained workforce in the industry.
Employee engagement is key to delivering 
outstanding service and our highly-structured 
career development programmes, together  
with specialist training for our associates, 
is a primary driver behind achieving  
industry leading net promoter scores.
Pages 22 to 24
08 Case study
In the USA, our Industrial Group 
welcomed their ﬁrst cohort 
of trainees at a newly designed, 
state-of-the-art training facility 
in Richmond, Virginia. 
The Industrial Group University is 
a ﬁve month, concentrated training 
programme designed to provide 
trainees with knowledge and hands-
on experience, allowing them to 
successfully integrate into our sales 
force. Centralising the training 
programme allows trainees to focus 
on the learning process, while 
improving the speed to efficacy. 
T rainees follow a speciﬁed curriculum 
which aims to accelerate their 
knowledge of products, business 
systems, sales processes, industry 
standards and safety regulations while 
learning about our culture.
Upon completion of the programme, 
trainees are well positioned to 
contribute as highly functional sales 
associates and deliver the excellent 
customer service expected as 
a sales associate.

What makes Ferguson a great business
 
We use technology to give customers  
choice and ﬂexibility
E-commerce has grown rapidly with  
22 per cent of revenue in the USA now 
generated online. Our omni-channel approach 
gives our customers the choice of how they 
want to do business with us; through traditional  
bricks and mortar, for consultations and 
to interact with products, or through the 
latest e-business platforms where we offer 
virtual help and advice and access to our 
product range 24/7 .
We are continually developing and 
improving technology to make it quicker 
and easier for our customers to do 
business with us. 
Pages 17, 24 and 25
10 Case study
Like the rest of Ferguson, the 
HVAC business is making rapid 
progress converting customers and 
integrating our online channels into 
their business. 
27 per cent of HVAC revenue is 
already generated from online 
channels and this grew 20 per cent 
last year. This included an increase 
in system-to-system integration 
that creates many efficiencies for 
our customers including placing 
orders and managing their accounts 
online. Many HVAC contractors have 
installed order processing systems 
which are integrated with their 
general ledgers. 
We are able to integrate them with 
our own order processing system to 
save our customers time and money. 
E-commerce makes us more efficient 
with fewer manual processes and 
customers order more when they 
purchase their products online.

12 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Highlights Name change
Let me start out by welcoming 
shareholders to this the ﬁrst Annual 
Report of Ferguson plc. We changed our 
name from Wolseley plc to the name of 
our business in the USA on 31 July 2017 . 
We strongly believe that the Ferguson 
name is much more reﬂective of the 
Group today with 89 per cent of our 
trading proﬁt generated in the USA. 
Board changes
Mike Powell joined the Group as Chief 
Financial Officer (“CFO”) on 1 June 2017 
and he brings a wealth of experience 
having worked in a variety of senior 
ﬁnance positions. He has spent many 
years running large businesses in 
North America which will stand him in 
good stead in his career at Ferguson. 
Dave Keltner’s appointment as Interim 
CFO last year, after 10 years as CFO 
of the USA, enabled us to conduct a 
thorough search for a suitable long-term 
CFO and execute an orderly handover 
of responsibilities to Mike. 
Frank Roach, formerly Chief Executive of 
the USA, also retired this year. Frank had  
a remarkable career with Ferguson, joining 
the business 41 years ago. In particular, 
his tenure as Chief Executive for the 
last eight years has been outstanding, 
achieving sustained rapid growth and 
record trading margins. 
On behalf of the Board I’d like to 
thank both Frank and Dave for their 
signiﬁcant contributions to the Group’s 
success and wish them both long and 
happy retirements.
Kevin Murphy succeeded Frank on 
1 August 2017 . Kevin joined the business 
in 1999 and spent the last 10 years as the 
Chief Operating Officer of the USA. 
He has a great track record of 
driving proﬁtable growth and a deep 
understanding of the business which 
makes him the ideal Executive to drive 
our future growth and development.
While the Group has made excellent 
progress in developing our e-commerce 
platforms, the Board is aware of the need 
to stay vigilant to future potential threats 
and opportunities in the digital space. 
Nadia Shouraboura was appointed 
as a Non Executive Director on 1 July 
2017 and has spent her entire career 
working in and running large international 
e-commerce businesses including eight 
years at Amazon.com Inc. Nadia will 
provide support, challenge management 
and assist in capitalising on the signiﬁcant 
opportunities in the years ahead.
Governance
The Company remains UK-listed and 
meets the requirements of the regulations 
published by the UK Government 
concerning narrative and directors’ 
remuneration reporting. We continue 
to meet these disclosure requirements, 
monitor developments and adopt best 
practice in corporate governance. 
We describe how we have applied the 
UK Corporate Governance Code’s main 
principles in the Governance section of 
this report on pages 50 to 84. The Board 
places great emphasis on providing clear 
and transparent reporting and believes 
this Annual Report is fair, balanced 
and understandable.
Shareholder returns
The Board is committed to maximising 
long-term shareholder value. We are 
recommending a ﬁnal dividend of 73.33 
pence per share (2015/16: 66.72 pence 
per share), to be paid on 1 December 
2017 to shareholders on the register 
at 27 October 2017 . 
This will bring the total dividend for the year 
to 110.0 pence per share (2015/16: 100.0 
pence per share) representing a year-on-
year increase of 10.0 per cent. 
Our investment priorities remain focused 
on achieving organic growth, funding 
the ordinary dividend through the cycle 
and investing in bolt-on acquisitions that 
meet our stringent investment criteria. 
The Board has a progressive dividend 
policy for future payouts, with the aim 
of increasing dividends in line with the 
long-term underlying growth in earnings. 
Any surplus cash after meeting these 
investment needs will be returned 
to shareholders. 
Reﬂecting management’s conﬁdence 
in the business and the continuing strong 
cash generation of the Group, the Board 
considers that the Group has surplus 
cash resources available. The Group 
will now commence a £500 million share 
buyback programme with the intention 
to complete this within the next 12 months. 
Our balance sheet remains strong and 
the Group will continue to target net debt 
in the range of 1x to 2x EBITDA, consistent 
with investment grade credit metrics. 
People
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank all our associates for their hard work, 
enthusiasm and dedication throughout 
the year. It is the service they provide 
that delivers continually improving results 
for the Group and creates value for 
customers, suppliers and shareholders 
every year. 
Gareth Davis
Chairman
Well positioned 
for future growth
2016/17 has been a year of substantial progress under the stewardship  
of John Martin in his ﬁrst year as Group Chief Executive. The Group has  
again delivered a good set of ﬁnancial results and John has provided fresh 
impetus to the rapid execution of our strategy, in particular prioritising 
investment and focus on our largest growth opportunity in the USA, 
commencing the transformation plan in the UK and the Nordics disposals.

15 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 What’s been the highlight 
of the year?
I began my ﬁrst year as CEO with 
two months visiting our operations 
across the Group and listening to our 
associates. Their enthusiasm for serving 
our customers to the highest standards 
and furthering our strategic objectives 
is extremely motivating. Their passion 
for our business and relentless focus to 
improve it makes the Group what it is 
today: the largest and most successful 
distributor of plumbing and heating 
products in the world. These results are 
a testament to their commitment.
How did the Group perform 
this year?
Ongoing revenue of £14,878 million was 
22.5 per cent ahead of last year (2015/16:  
£12,146 million) and 6.0 per cent ahead 
on a like-for-like basis*. Our gross 
margins were 40 basis points ahead 
of last year as we continue to focus 
on a better mix of higher value-added 
products and services and improving 
our purchasing terms. The Group’s 
operating expenses were 10.1 per cent 
higher at constant exchange rates* which 
included 2.6 per cent from acquisitions. 
Ongoing trading proﬁt was 24.8 per 
cent ahead of last year at £1,032 million 
(2015/16: £827 million) which included 
a £122 million beneﬁt from foreign 
exchange movements. 
Statutory proﬁt before tax of £1,180 million 
(2015/16: £675 million) is after exceptional 
gains from disposals and losses from 
impairments and restructuring costs.
To read more about our ﬁnancial 
performance see pages 26 to 33 and 
38 to 41. 
Why did you change 
the name of the Group 
to Ferguson? 
The majority of our associates work 
in the USA, which also serves nearly 
800,000 customers so it made sense to 
change and align the name of the Group 
with our largest operation. The name 
change will help us continue to raise 
our proﬁle in the USA and establish the 
strongest connection possible between 
our stakeholders and our market leading 
brand there.
Will the Group eventually 
operate exclusively in 
the USA?
The allocation of capital and other 
resources to those businesses capable 
of generating the best returns for 
shareholders is an important principle. 
Funding growth and investment in the 
USA will continue to be our highest 
priority because we generate the best 
returns for shareholders in this market. 
The plumbing and heating market in the 
USA is a huge opportunity for us: it is a 
large, attractive and fragmented market 
with excellent growth prospects. 
Our ﬁrst priority is to ensure that we 
capitalise on this opportunity. However, 
that doesn’t mean our international 
businesses are not important. Whilst  
they are smaller, they make an important 
contribution to the Group. They do not 
detract from our focus and we will continue 
to develop and invest in them too. 
The Group will present 
its 2017/18 ﬁnancial 
statements in US dollars. 
How will shareholders 
beneﬁt from this?
The vast majority of our mix of trading 
proﬁt is generated in the USA so it makes 
sense to report our ﬁnancial results in 
US dollars. Doing so will reduce volatility 
in our results in terms of the translational 
impact of foreign exchange and our 
results will better reﬂect the underlying 
performance of our business. We will 
also give shareholders a choice between 
receiving ordinary dividends in US 
dollars or in pounds sterling which they 
will be able to do from April next year.
Turning to strategy, last year 
you set out three priorities. 
How would you summarise 
your progress on each?
Priority one – generate the best 
proﬁtable growth in the USA. 
The business in the USA had a good 
year especially when you consider the 
headwinds we faced in the ﬁrst half of 
the year from commodity price deﬂation 
and weak industrial markets. 
Continued  
strategic development
I am pleased to report a good ﬁnancial performance in 2016/17  
with all of our ongoing businesses ahead of last year and a particularly  
pleasing result in the USA where we achieved good trading proﬁt growth.  
We also made rapid progress with our strategic development focusing  
more of our resources on the USA to accelerate proﬁtable growth.  
We’re continuing to work hard to improve returns in the international  
businesses, particularly in the UK, and to complete the previously  
announced disposal of our Nordic business.

16 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
John Martin
Group Chief  
Executive Our associates responded positively 
and we generated stronger growth 
in the second half with the return of 
modest price inﬂation and a recovery 
in industrial end-markets. As we start 
the new ﬁnancial year we’re generating 
good growth in all of our end-markets 
and the regional picture of growth across 
the USA is encouraging. At the same 
time as accelerating revenue growth 
we’re continuing to expand our gross 
margins through driving beneﬁts of scale 
in areas such as sourcing, increasing 
own label sales and better pricing 
discipline. We’re also continuing to invest 
in future growth by developing more 
efficient operating models including 
world-class e-commerce platforms, 
building our brands and investing in 
adjacent businesses such as Facilities 
Supply. So overall, we feel that we 
have made good progress in driving 
proﬁtable growth.
Priority two – execute UK turnaround 
and repositioning plan. 
We’re about a year into the 
implementation of our transformation 
plan in the UK and we expect that it 
will take a further two years to complete 
so it’s still early days. We’ve made good 
progress this year and we are carefully 
implementing the key initiatives to 
ensure we minimise disruption to our 
customers while continuing to execute 
at pace. 
Milestones next year include continuing 
the reconﬁguration of the branch 
network, logistics and supply chain, 
simpliﬁcation of the product range and 
the roll out of sign on glass technology. 
Drivers of proﬁtable growth
Engaged  
associates  
Well trained, highly engaged 
associates deliver excellent 
customer service. A relentless 
focus in this area drives 
customer loyalty.
Excellent  
service ethic
Our aim is to provide the 
best customer service in the 
industry, consistently across 
branches and regions.
Strong sales  
culture
We will continue to drive 
a strong sales culture. 
When our associates are 
proud and conﬁdent about 
our services, and have the 
best tools, knowledge and 
data to support them, we will 
achieve the strongest results. 
They engage with existing 
and new customers to make 
sure we are front of mind when 
it comes to bids for work.
Organic  
expansion
We want to accelerate 
proﬁtable growth through 
above market revenue  
growth and targeted branch  
expansion.
Bolt-on  
acquisitions
We complement our organic 
growth strategy with bolt-on 
acquisitions which are rapidly 
integrated into our network to 
deliver attractive returns. 
Adjacent 
opportunities
We will utilise our existing 
knowledge, skills and 
infrastructure to capitalise 
on new market opportunities. 
For example Facilities Supply  
and our B2C e-commerce  
businesses. 
Operating model 
and e-commerce 
development
We need to ensure that our 
operating model is agile 
and ﬂexible so it can adapt 
to changing customer needs 
and that we are able to ﬂex our 
cost base when required.
Increasingly our customers 
want to deal with us online and 
we must ensure we have the 
leading e-commerce platform 
in each market in our industry. 
Pricing  
discipline
We will work constantly to 
understand our customers’ 
needs more accurately and 
structure our pricing to be fair, 
consistent and transparent.
Own label 
penetration
We will systematically 
build upon and extend our 
portfolio of private label brands 
which in 2016/17 represented 
6.7 per cent of Group revenue. 
We have an opportunity to 
offer a wider range of own label 
products to our customers, 
some of which attract higher 
gross margins.

On the logistics and supply chain side we 
added new market distribution centres 
in Euless, Texas and San Francisco, 
California this year and we have plans 
for three more in 2018. We are continuing 
to roll out our university training courses 
in the USA to ensure we have the best 
trained associates in the industry which 
we believe is key to delivering world 
class customer service (see page 22 
for more information).
Throughout this Annual Report we have 
also outlined how our strategy drives 
our thinking in all aspects of how we do 
business from how the Board operates 
and corporate governance to KPIs, 
principal risks and sustainability.
What changes have you 
made in your senior team 
this year?
I’d like to express my own thanks (in 
addition to the Chairman’s comments) in 
recognising the signiﬁcant contributions 
of Frank Roach and Dave Keltner who 
retired this year. Both were fundamental 
to the strong growth and excellent 
returns shareholders have enjoyed 
from the business in the USA over many 
years. I’d like to wish them both well in 
their retirement. 
It’s great to have Mike Powell on board 
as our Group CFO and Kevin Murphy 
as the CEO of the USA. They are 
already making a considerable impact. 
Elsewhere in the senior team in the 
USA we have promoted Bill Brundage 
to CFO and Alex Hutcherson to COO. 
Kevin Fancey has recently joined the 
business as President of Canada. 
I’m delighted that a majority of these 
positions have been ﬁlled through 
internal succession, recognising the 
strong pipeline of talent developed over 
many years within our core operations.
What about sustainability? 
How are you building 
a better business?
We established our “Better Business” 
sustainability programme (see pages 
34 and 35) following consultation with 
shareholders two years ago and we 
strive to make these issues an integral 
part of how we do business. 
This year we have made steady progress 
on our sustainability programme 
and further detail can be seen in the 
Resource and Relationships section 
(pages 22 to 25) and in the Sustainability 
section (pages 34 to 37). However, I am 
disappointed with the deterioration in 
our injury and lost workday rates. I am 
personally engaged with health and 
safety specialists from our businesses to 
ensure that we consider and act on their 
views for best practices and opportunities 
for improvement. There is also regular 
review of health and safety performance 
with our business leaders. We have put in 
place actions to address this deterioration 
and all businesses are committed to 
improving our performance in this area.
What is your outlook for 
2017/18?
US markets continue to be favourable, 
in particular residential and commercial 
markets where we generate the majority 
of our revenue. Group organic revenue 
growth* in the new ﬁnancial year has 
been about 6 per cent. Our business 
is performing well, we have a strong 
balance sheet to support our plans 
and the Board continues to look to the 
medium-term with conﬁdence.
We remain excited about the signiﬁcant 
structural growth opportunities in our 
markets and the potential for revenue 
growth, margin improvement, and 
attractive returns. 
What is your message to 
Ferguson associates?
It is our associates who make the 
difference for our customers and 
ultimately deliver value to our shareholders. 
The strong performance of the Group 
this year is attributable to them. I would 
like to thank each and every one of 
our associates for their dedication, 
enthusiasm and hard work that are the 
key reasons for our continued success. 
John Martin
Group Chief Executive
Once we’ve delivered the plan we are 
conﬁdent we will have built a better, 
more proﬁtable business by simplifying 
our customer propositions, lowering 
the cost base and optimising the supply 
chain and branch network. You can read 
in more detail about the transformation 
plan in the UK operating review on 
page 32. 
Priority three – review Nordic 
operational strategy and restore the 
business to proﬁtable growth.
We concluded the review of Nordic 
operating strategy in March 2017, 
identifying a clear and executable plan to 
return the business to proﬁtable growth. 
However, there are few synergies with 
the rest of the Group’s plumbing and 
heating activities and we have initiated 
a process to exit our building materials 
business in the region which is on track. 
In August 2017 we completed the sale 
of Silvan, the Danish DIY chain.
Thinking about the strategy 
in more detail you also 
talked last year about the 
importance of achieving 
excellent execution in some 
key areas. How are you 
making progress here?
This year we have further reﬁned our 
drivers of proﬁtable growth (see page 17) 
which set out how we will win in our local 
markets, outperform our competitors 
and drive strong ﬁnancial results. 
Our businesses are not homogeneous 
and they require customised strategies 
and each of our business units 
are prioritising them appropriately, 
depending on their local market and 
competitive environment. 
Highlights this year include excellent 
growth in our e-commerce businesses 
which now generates 20 per cent of 
Group revenue. We continue to see 
e-commerce as an efficient way to meet 
the needs of our customers using the 
current branch and logistics network 
without adding extra branch capacity. 
We are gaining momentum in the 
acceleration of own label in our 
businesses and in the USA it now 
represents 6.9 per cent of overall 
revenues (2015/16: 5.8 per cent). We  
are continuing to invest in our operating 
model, including further investment in 
*  The increase or decrease in revenue excluding 
the effect of currency exchange, acquisitions and 
disposals and trading days.

Customers require  
a basket of goods
Ferguson serves approximately one 
million customers across the Group and 
customers typically require a basket of 
goods. In the USA the average basket 
size is ﬁve products valued at circa $600.
Customers’ needs are local 
The customer base is fragmented. 
Professional contractors typically operate 
within about 20 miles of a local branch 
and may visit it several times per week. 
In addition to visiting branches, they 
are now using digital channels which 
complement their working patterns. 
Large supplier base 
Ferguson distributes the products 
of approximately 44,000 suppliers

Key resources and relationships
How we serve  
our customers
Ferguson is a specialist distributor adding value through its scale,  
bespoke logistics network and its people’s expertise. We bridge the gap 
between our suppliers and our customers, providing our suppliers  
a cost effective route to market and customers specialist advice and  
a wide range of products where and when they are required.
Our people
33,000
associates
Our associates are fundamental to our 
success. They deliver excellent customer 
service, develop strong relationships, 
maximise operational efficiencies 
and accelerate the adoption of new 
operating models. One of our core 
values relates to our people and six 
of our material sustainability issues are 
focused on our talented teams. 
Page 36
Leadership
Reshaping and focusing our strategy to 
create an even more successful business 
is dependent on the effectiveness 
of our leaders and their teams. 
This year has been a year of signiﬁcant 
change in the Executive leadership 
of the Group, please see the Board 
changes in the Chairman’s statement. 
Additionally, we have seen a number 
of internal succession appointments 
within the USA to leadership positions. 
These appointments have been 
enhanced by the use of rigorous 
assessment techniques, structured 
transition and personal development 
processes – the same processes that 
now apply to all senior level hiring across 
the Group. 
Pages 13 and 18
Talent development
This year we will welcome 400 college 
graduates to our business in the USA. 
Our investment in targeted talent 
management and development is a 
key feature of our business and we are 
adopting an internal university approach 
to train associates. 
Sharing success and best practice is a 
staple of our thriving culture. Four years 
ago, the HVAC business unit in the USA 
implemented a centralised “university” 
training model where associates relocate 
to a speciﬁc branch and follow a set 
curriculum combining instructor-led 
classroom, virtual instruction and on-the-
job training. Its success prompted the 
Industrial and Facilities Supply business 
units to launch individual universities 
where graduates are trained in the 
speciﬁcs of that business unit. You can 
read more about the Industrial Group’s 
university on page 9.
Today, this training model is being used 
throughout the USA with the recent 
addition of The College of Ferguson. 
In July 2017, the ﬁve-month programme 
was launched in seven Blended 
Branches nationwide and 88 recent 
college graduates participated, learning 
the skills needed to prepare them for 
an inside sales position. 
The goal of the programme is to increase 
the speed of impact for new hires. 
Various metrics will be used to measure 
the participant’s added value to the 
business including sales, their potential 
and retention prospects. 
Whilst we are committed to recruiting 
and growing early career talent, we also 
acquire talent with speciﬁc skills mid-
career to enhance our ability to bring 
new services to the market and improve 
our capabilities. Great examples of hiring 
people with capabilities developed 
outside our sector have enabled us to 
accelerate the growth of our business. 
For example, our new National Sales 
Centre Director in the USA, Josh Smith, 
brings expertise from over 20 years 
in professional customer service 
centre management.
Rewarding performance
We celebrate success and our reward 
programmes are important in reinforcing 
the way we do business. Over the past 
year new incentive programmes have 
been re-developed in each business for 
branch and sales associates to ensure 
that high performance is well rewarded. 
We adjust measures to the type of role 
or team, but typically incentivise based 
on combinations of trading proﬁt, gross 
margin, gross proﬁt, average cash-to-
cash days and net promoter score.
7 ,000
current 
associates have 
higher education 
degrees, about 
28 per cent of 
the workforce 
in the USA Strategic report Governance Financials Other information
23 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Signature recognition programmes in our 
business in the USA include President’s 
Club, recognising the performance of 
top outside sales associates; President’s 
Circle, recognising sales associates and 
sales managers who are top performers 
in the marketplace; and President’s 
Gallery, honouring showroom sales 
associates who meet key corporate 
showroom initiatives and demonstrate 
exceptional leadership. 
The pinnacle sales award, the Bob 
Wells Leadership Award, is presented 
to a remarkable sales associate who 
consistently demonstrates exceptional 
sales leadership and performance. 
New innovative long-term incentive 
programmes have been introduced 
to each business to reward sustained 
or improved trading proﬁt performance 
in our different businesses. For example, 
over a three-year cycle critical staff 
in the USA can see their initial grants 
multiply by ﬁve times for exceptional 
performance. Our investment in 
this programme is overseen by the 
Remuneration Committee.
Associate engagement
Our teams in sales, branches, contact, 
logistics and distribution centres are 
the local face of our business. Their  
relationships with both large and small 
customers are critical to our success and 
their expert knowledge means they are 
a key part of our customers’ workday. 
It is important that our associates feel 
they have a voice and that their views and 
opinions are listened to. All businesses 
in the Group measure engagement and 
take action to identify improvements 
locally, regionally and nationally. Our  
winning teams depend on it. 
In the USA we continue to measure 
engagement regularly and the team is 
proud of the degree to which current 
associates would recommend Ferguson 
as a place to work to a good friend. 
Over the past ﬁve years our scores 
have consistently exceeded 75 per cent 
which is well above industry averages. 
Our levels of associate engagement in 
the USA remain strong although lower 
than last year.
One initiative which demonstrates 
practical care for our associates is 
Ferguson Fit. Ferguson Fit was originally 
set up to focus on physical health given 
rising medical insurance costs in the 
USA and to promote the beneﬁts of 
a healthy workforce. The concept has 
grown to encompass an all-around 
approach to healthy living. We provide 
24/7 online and telephone medical, 
health and lifestyle advice and guidance 
for all associates. Across the Group, 
our associate assistance programmes 
provide support, counselling and advice 
on a range of issues for associates and 
their families to help our people with 
a positive work-life balance.
In our UK business, where signiﬁcant 
change is underway, associate 
engagement survey scores have 
remained constant whilst participation 
has risen to over 70 per cent. A new 
associate forum has been established 
to help drive the transformation process 
across the branch network and to help 
shape parts of the programme itself. 
Formal consultation processes have 
run in parallel, ensuring all our affected 
associates can be reassured that 
when changes affect them they will be 
managed openly and fairly.
Our new Canadian President, Kevin 
Fancey, is taking a ground up approach 
to his introduction to the Company and 
in his ﬁrst two months in the role he ran 
engagement sessions at 25 sites with 
500 associates. 
Diversity and inclusion
We want access to the best talent 
irrespective of gender, race, orientation 
or background. The Board is now a 50:50 
balance of male and females in our Non 
Executive Directors and, whilst our sector 
remains male dominated, we are starting 
to see greater female participation at each 
level in our business. 
Our diversity policy statement can be 
seen on page 65. In the UK business, 
where we have made some signiﬁcant 
changes in the Leadership team, four 
(40 per cent) executive positions are 
occupied by women. So whilst we have 
work to do there are some promising 
signs of progress. 
Pages 36 and 65
Our present recruitment practices factor 
in under-represented groups and we 
insist on balanced candidate lists when 
using executive search ﬁrms. In the 
UK, the government requires certain 
businesses to declare their gender pay 
gap. The UK business has a 2.38 per cent  
gap in base pay compared to the UK 
average 18.1 per cent. Nevertheless, 
during 2017/18 we will put in place a 
diversity plan in each business, building 
on our present practices where, like many 
businesses, we continue to identify and 
remove any potential for unconscious 
bias in our employment and promotion 
practices. Much external research 
in improving diversity highlights the 
importance of role models, who inspire 
others and create a different level of 
expectation of the type of career that 
is possible.
Health and safety
Caring for our people’s safety and 
wellbeing is at the heart of the Group’s 
values. Board and Executive Committee 
meetings of the Group always start with 
our Health and Safety report because 
we want to ensure that our people return 
home safely each day and thrive in 
the workplace.
The main causes of injury within our 
business are manual handling (leading 
to sprains and strains), slips, trips and 
falls, the use of mechanical handling 
equipment such as forklift trucks and 
being struck by unsecured products 
and vehicle collisions. Our health and 
safety management framework and 
controls are structured to address 
all health and safety risks and 
compliance requirements. 
We are disappointed to report a 
deterioration of our Group injury rate 
and Group lost workday rate in 2016/17 
primarily as a result of a deterioration 
in the rates in the USA. Each of our 
businesses has plans in place to reverse 
these trends. The Group collision 
rate improved in 2016/17 following an 
in-depth driver risk assessment and 
control improvements.

suppliers
We have 44,000 reputable suppliers 
manufacturing over one million products 
around the world. This gives us access 
to a diverse and broad range of quality 
products. Our leading market positions 
enable our central sourcing teams in 
each region to leverage our scale and 
negotiate competitive prices in return for 
access to our one million customers.
We work with our suppliers to ensure  
that they are reliable and ethical and 
that their products are fully compliant 
with the laws and regulations of the 
countries in which they and we operate. 
Each business assesses its suppliers 
against set criteria to provide protection 
to both us and our customers in the 
event of a product failure or breach of 
regulation in the supply chain. On the 
rare occasion that a product is faulty, 
customers have the conﬁdence of 
knowing that we will support them. 
We conduct third party background

an outside sales force. The majority of 
our business is still conducted through 
our branches and our extensive branch

a group of highly skilled ﬁeld-based 
health and safety specialists from each 
of our businesses in May and July 
2017 to discuss the health and safety 
development across the Group and 
to understand how we can improve. 
Whilst we benchmark as average for 
our industry sector we intend to become 
leaders. The observations made over 
recent months are being worked on by 
all leadership teams across the Group 
to ensure we leverage the expertise 
of our associates in this area.
One immediate action has been to 
increase the number of Health and 
Safety professionals and we have 
begun the process to appoint a 
specialist leader in the USA to drive 
our improvement agenda.

Ethical behaviour and human rights
We are committed to comply with the 
law and to operate under high ethical 
standards. This is simply the right thing 
to do and it protects us from business 
disruption; it also strengthens our 
reputation with customers, suppliers 
and other stakeholders. Our Code of 
Conduct is dedicated to helping each 
of our associates to live our values 
on a daily basis in all decisions and 
interactions. Our Code of Conduct in the 
USA was renewed during 2016/17 and 
features Q&A sections to provide real life 
examples of our values in action. 
All of our businesses provide training for 
relevant associates on anti-corruption, 
anti-trust and modern slavery matters. 
This is typically provided through online 
training material and face-to-face training 
is also provided. Training is provided for 
new associates on induction.
Our Human Rights policy statement can 
be seen on page 36. For information on 
ethical behaviour in our supply chain, 
please refer to page 36.

Our estate is carefully managed to ensure 
the health and safety of our associates, 
customers, suppliers and any other 
visitors. Regular health and safety risk 
assessments and branch audits ensure 
that we maintain our equipment and 
product racking, safely store and move 
products and provide for any potential 
emergency incident. Our insurers also 
support these efforts, undertaking their 
own safety assessments at selected key 
sites each year. 
45 per cent of the Group carbon footprint 
is generated in our buildings. This includes 
electricity and fuels consumed for heating 
or cooling. Each of our businesses 
has targets to reduce carbon and the 
associated costs from buildings, relative 
to revenue. Building improvements during 
2016/17 include the installation of LEDs and 
heat curtains in some of our sites. We have 
partnered with energy brokers in the USA 
and UK and are developing consumption 
dashboards to allow us to better target our 
efforts on energy efficiency from 2017/18.
Our online sales channels, available 
through any device, allow our customers 
to reduce their environmental impact as 
travel to our branches for product advice 
or product collection is reduced.

Technology 
£3 billion
revenue from e-commerce activities
We are continually investing in 
technology to improve our business, 
win new customers and retain existing 
customers. E-commerce accounts for 
£3 billion (20 per cent) of the Group’s 
revenue and our customer facing 
channels to market are mentioned 
on page 24. Additional technology 
investments are aimed at improving 
execution and efficiency in all areas of 
our business from warehousing, ﬂeet, 
inventory and customer relationship 
management to back-office human 
resources and ﬁnancial management 
and reporting systems. 
As many of our competitors are small 
local distributors this is a major source of 
competitive advantage. We are focused 
on staying ahead of the competition by 
looking at every opportunity in this space 
while defending against any new threats 
that may enter the market.
Distribution network
6,100
ﬂeet vehicles 
Our extensive distribution network 
and large ﬂeet enable us to ensure 
same or next day availability of a wide 
basket of products to our customers. 
Our customers rely upon us for prompt 
and ﬂexible delivery options to meet 
their own needs.
Suppliers deliver in bulk to our 
distribution centres, our branches 
or directly to our customers. 
We predominantly distribute from 
distribution centres, ship hubs and 
branches to customers. 
The safety of our drivers is taken very 
seriously and during 2016/17 an in-
depth risk assessment was conducted 
into driver safety by our health and 
safety experts. The assessment 
took into account vehicle condition, 
road hazards, loading and unloading 
risks, physical health risks and driver 
training. Existing controls have been 
strengthened and new controls 
introduced to best protect our drivers. 
We monitor our collision rate monthly 
for both our goods ﬂeet and company 
car ﬂeet. Each business has targets 
to reduce their collision rate and 
performance is reported to the Executive 
Committee each month and to the Board 
every other month. 
Approximately 55 per cent of our carbon 
footprint is generated by transport 
(including commercial vehicles, company 
cars and business travel by road, rail 
or air) and 43 per cent of this is from 
commercial vehicles, whether our own 
or that of third party hauliers that we 
partner with. 
To keep our distribution network running 
efficiently with minimal impact on the 
environment, each of our businesses 
has targets to reduce carbon and the 
associated costs for transport, relative 
to revenue. Distribution network 
improvements in 2016/17 which have 
positively impacted our environmental 
performance include ﬂeet upgrades and 
the installation of a telematics system 
in the commercial ﬂeet in the USA (see 
case study below). Our branches also 
use the distribution network to support 
their waste management efforts, sending 
recyclable packaging waste back to the 
distribution centres for sorting, baling 
and recycling.
Where possible, we work with our 
suppliers to reduce their environmental 
impacts. For example, we help our 
suppliers to avoid unnecessary travel 
by “backhauling” product from their 
factories when our trucks are returning 
empty to our distribution centres. 
In 2016/17, we saved our suppliers in the 
USA and UK from travelling 4.2 million 
miles. This equates to 5,946 tonnes 
of avoided carbon emissions (the 
equivalent of taking 1,256 passenger 
vehicles off the road for a year*).

Case study
Improving driver 
behaviours
A new telematics 
system has been 
installed in the  
goods ﬂeet of our 
business in the USA.  
The system allows  
for monitoring of 
driver behaviours  
to mitigate  
speeding, excessive 
idling and harsh 
acceleration or 
braking. Besides 
supporting more 
efficient driving 
behaviours and 
optimising fuel 
consumption this also 
serves to increase 
the safety of our 
driver population. Like-for-like revenue growth

Associate engagement, USA
Engaged associates deliver excellent customer service, 
consequently we measure associate engagement in every region. 
Engagement surveys are periodically sent to associates at all levels 
asking: “Would you recommend Ferguson as a place to work to a 
good friend?”.

-7 .1%
The process of tracking and reporting engagement 
differs by region, therefore an example is 
given for the USA. Average engagement was 
77.4 per cent in 2016/17 , a decline compared to 
2015/16 but it remains a very high score, well 
above industry averages. Management believes 
the lower score achieved in 2016/17 was due 
to reorganisation and leadership changes 
which included Business Model Improvement, 
a complex nationwide change management 
programme, which is now complete.
Injury rate
Total number of injuries per 100,000 hours worked. The numbers 
are based on injuries requiring an associate to leave the workplace 
for medical treatment. The hours worked are calculated using 
full-time equivalent associate numbers and average work days by 
business and assume an eight-hour working day. This is for continuing 
and discontinued operations.

Injuries requiring medical treatment per

This is primarily as a result of a deterioration 
of the injury rate in the USA. All businesses 
have plans in place to improve the injury rate. 
See the Sustainability section for more 
information on pages 34 to 37.
Customer service, USA
There is a good correlation in our business between high customer 
loyalty scores in a branch and better ﬁnancial performance. The net 
promoter score is a means of measuring customer service. The survey 
asks: “How likely is it that you would recommend Ferguson to a friend 
or colleague?” and customers respond with a score between zero (bad) 
and 10 (exceptional). We look at the 12-month average of the proportion 
of customers who scored nine or more, less those customers scoring 
six or less. The methodology was changed in 2017 and prior years 
restated to weight the responses by business unit revenue.

Business proﬁle
The business is the market leading 
distributor of plumbing and heating 
products in the USA. It operates nationally 
serving the residential, commercial, civil 
and industrial markets. Residential end 
markets represent about 50 per cent 
of sales within the USA and commercial 
about 35 per cent, with the remainder split 
between civil/infrastructure and industrial 
equally. We predominantly serve the 
Repair, Maintenance and Improvement 
(“RMI”) markets, with relatively low 
exposure to the new construction market.
We operate seven business units in 
the USA offering different categories 
of plumbing and heating products and 
solutions to ﬁt the customers’ needs. 
Six of the business units predominantly 
serve trade customers with one serving 
mainly consumers. There are no direct 
competitors that operate across all of 
our markets. Each business unit has its 
own competitors which range from large 
national companies, including trade sales 
by large home improvement chains, 
to small, privately owned distributors.
The business in the USA constantly 
aims to strengthen its positions in 
existing and adjacent markets through 
bolt-on acquisitions. During the year 
we completed nine bolt-on acquisitions 
with acquisitions in the majority of our 
business units. 
At the end of the year we operated 
1,423 branches serving all 50 states 
with 23,986 associates. The branches 
are served by 13 distribution centres, 
providing same day and next day product 
availability, a key competitive advantage.
Key  
highlights
A more focused  
geographic footprint
We are progressively focusing more resources on our business in the

Speciﬁc market trends
The four end markets that Ferguson 
serves have different characteristics 
and as such certain market data is more 
relevant to speciﬁc end markets.
Residential markets
(Approximately 50 per cent of revenue)
The Leading Indicator of Remodelling 
Activity (“LIRA”) provides a short-term 
outlook of national home improvement 
and repair spending to owner-occupied 
homes. It is designed to project the 
annual rate of change in spending for 
the current quarter and subsequent 
four quarters. The LIRA projections 
have continued to increase over the 
last 12 months, indicating growth in the 
market in 2017/18.

Developing e-commerce
This year we launched the new 
Ferguson.com website which is the 
foundation for future e-commerce 
and omni-channel customer 
engagement. It provides new 
functionality and solutions that will 
help customers run their businesses 
more effectively.
This latest iteration provides 
our customers with signiﬁcant 
improvements to functionality, 
such as identifying the accessories

Macroeconomic trends
Demand in the USA business is 
impacted by changes in activity in the 
economy in the USA. The following 
macroeconomic trends have an impact 
on all of our business units.
The Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) 
is one of the primary indicators used to 
gauge the health of a country’s economy.

GDP growth in the USA has been positive 
for the last 12 months, indicating continued 
expansion in the economy. The rate 
of growth has sequentially increased 
quarter on quarter throughout the last year 
showing an increasing rate of growth.
Consumer conﬁdence has increased 
over the last 12 months to levels 
consistent with Q1 2015. 
The unemployment rate continues to fall, 
it has sequentially decreased quarter on 
quarter for over 24 months. 
Commercial
(Approximately 35 per cent of revenue)
The American Institute of Architects 
(“AIA”) Billings Index – Commercial/
Industrial is a leading economic indicator 
of construction activity and reﬂects, 
with an approximate nine to 12-month lag 
time, construction spending. Any score 
below 50 indicates a decline in business 
activity across the architecture profession, 
whereas an index score above 50 
indicates growth.
The index has been above 50 for the last 
three quarters of 2016/17 after dipping to 
49.9 in the ﬁrst quarter of 2016/17.
Civil/Infrastructure
(Approximately 7.5 per cent of revenue)
The AIA Billings Index – Commercial/
Industrial is also a good indicator for the 
civils market.
The non-residential construction Put In 
Place survey is a further indicator of the 
strength of the market, reﬂecting the 
value spent each month on structures in 
the sector. The value of spend was rising 
year-on-year for the ﬁrst three quarters of 
2016/17 but declined in the ﬁnal quarter 
of 2016/17 .
Industrial
(Approximately 7.5 per cent of revenue)
A good indicator of the strength of our 
industrial market is the Institute of Supply 
Chain Management Purchase Managers 
Index. Any reading above 50 indicates 
that the manufacturing economy is 
generally expanding, below 50 indicates 
that it is generally declining. The index has 
been above 50 throughout 2016/17 and 
sequentially growing through the year.

E-commerce sales are growing rapidly 
in the USA and in 2016/17 amounted 
to £2.6 billion accounting for 22 per 
cent of USA sales, growth of 25 per 
cent. Our customers have undertaken 
18.5 million “Self Service Events” during 
the year, providing them with signiﬁcant 
service beneﬁts, and helping us to 
lower the cost to serve. 
We aim to have the best transactional 
e-commerce capability in our industry 
which is increasingly becoming a 
competitive advantage over smaller 
regional competitors. We have 
a competitive advantage in the 
deployment of technology, partly 
as a result of our scale, and we 
will aim to maintain and enhance 
it as we continue to invest in our 
technology platforms. USA continued

Business units and brands
The size and market positions of the main 
businesses are below:
Blended Branches
Blended Branches is the largest 
business unit serving customers 
across the residential and commercial 
sectors for RMI and new construction. 
Blended Branches mainly provides 
plumbing and sanitary products as 
well as heating solutions to trade 
customers through a combination of 
branch counters, inside and outside 
sales associates and our fast growing 
e-commerce channel which enables 
customers to be served 24/7 through 
their online account. The business also 
operates 275 showrooms, serving 
trade customers and consumers, which 
showcase bathroom, kitchen and 
lighting products and assist customers 
in designing their home improvement 
projects. The showroom channel 
generated revenue of over £1.3 billion 
in 2016/17. 
In certain markets where it is more 
efficient and effective we will serve 
our customers through a Blended 
Branches location rather than 
standalone Heating, Ventilation and Air 
Conditioning (“HVAC”), Waterworks or 
Industrial business.
Blended Branches is the number one 
distributor of plumbing and heating 
products in the USA, with an estimated 
market share of 17 per cent. There are 
only three national competitors with 
a market share above 5 per cent. 
The estimated combined market 
share of the top four companies is 
40 per cent with the remainder of the 
market consisting of mid-size regional 
distributors and small, local distributors.
Blended Branches’ market share 
varies signiﬁcantly across the USA 
from low single digit market share 
in some states to high-twenties in 
others. There continues to be excellent 
opportunities to expand the business 
geographically, particularly in large 
metropolitan areas across the country.

Waterworks standalone
The Waterworks business is the largest 
waterworks distributor in the USA. 
It distributes PVF, hydrants, meters and 
related water management products 
alongside related services including 
water line tapping and pipe fusion. 
Waterworks sales tend to be part of 
large planned projects to public and 
private water sewer authorities, utility 
contractors, public works/line contractors 
and heavy highway contractors on 
residential, commercial and municipal 
projects across the water, sanitary sewer 
and storm water management markets.
The Waterworks market has two 
large competitors holding around 
45 per cent market share, we estimate 
our market share to be 24 per cent. 
No other company holds greater than 
5 per cent market share.
B2C e-commerce
The B2C e-commerce business sells 
home improvement products directly 
to consumers via a network of online 
stores, the primary brand is Build.com. 
The business is supported by a call 
centre of product experts to provide 
product advice and to assist customers 
with orders. The business uses the 
same distribution network as the 
trade businesses.
We estimate our B2C e-commerce 
business to be the largest online 
supplier of plumbing and heating 
products direct to consumers, and 
the largest competitor is a similar size.
HVAC standalone
The HVAC business is an industry 
leader in wholesale heating and 
cooling distribution offering heating, 
ventilation, air conditioning and 
refrigeration equipment, parts and 
supplies to specialist contractors. 
The business predominantly serves 
the residential and commercial markets 
for repair and replacement in addition 
to heating and air conditioning projects. 
Branded Branches selling high quality 
products are an important feature 
for this market.

Operating performance
Our business in the USA grew revenue 
7.1 per cent on a like-for-like basis which 
included price deﬂation of 0.5 per cent 
principally due to falling commodity 
prices in the ﬁrst half. In the second half 
commodity deﬂation has subsided and 
overall there were low levels of inﬂation

Supply generated good growth and 
gained market share. Industrial revenues 
recovered after a weak ﬁrst half 
which was impacted by a slowdown 
in end markets. Build.com, our B2C 
e-commerce business, continued to 
grow strongly throughout the year. 
Acquisitions contributed 2.7 per cent 
of additional revenue in the year. 
E-commerce accounted for over 
£2.6 billion (22 per cent) of revenue 
in the USA and we have continued to 
prioritise investment in both our B2B 
and B2C platforms. Online ordering 
is a valuable sales order channel for 
our customers, giving them greater 
ﬂexibility. During the year we upgraded 
our technology platforms including 
the delivery of a new Ferguson.com 
website and a dedicated showroom 
website to enable customers to prepare 
for consultations. These new platforms 
have added new time-saving features 
and greater functionality to enhance the 
customer experience. 
We improved our gross margins 
and operating expenses grew with 
investments in technology, marketing 
and ﬂeet along with increased associate 
numbers, wage inﬂation and expense 
growth from acquisitions. Trading proﬁt 
of £950 million (2016: £761 million) 
was 8.2 per cent ahead of last year at 
constant exchange rates and exchange 
rate movements increased trading proﬁt 
by £116 million. The US trading margin 
was 8.0 per cent (2016: 8.2 per cent).
Nine acquisitions were completed during 
the year with total annualised revenue of 
£267 million. Since the year end we have 
acquired two more B2C businesses, 
AC Wholesalers and Supply.com which 
generate £86 million of annualised 
revenue. During the year we disposed 
of Endries, a small fasteners business, 
for £186 million. The business generated 
revenue of £170 million and trading proﬁt 
of £16 million in the 10 months to disposal 
in June 2017.

We estimate our HVAC business 
to be the third largest distributor 
of HVAC equipment in a highly 
fragmented market with the market 
leader about twice the size with an 
estimated 10 per cent market share.
Industrial standalone
The Industrial business is a 
supplier of PVF and industrial 
maintenance, repair and operations 
(“IMRO”) specialising in delivering 
automation, instrumentation, 
engineered products and turn-key 
solutions. We also provide supply 
chain management solutions for a 
full range of PVF and IMRO supplies 
focusing on providing cost savings 
across the entire supply chain.
The Industrial business distributes 
products to industrial customers 
across all sectors including oil and 
gas, mining, chemical and power.
The industrial market is fragmented, 
we estimate the market leader to 
hold 10 per cent market share and 
our market share to be 7 per cent.
Fire and Fabrication
The Fire and Fabrication business 
caters to ﬁre protection contractors 
and engineers offering ﬁre protection 
products, ﬁre protection systems 
and bespoke fabrication services 
to commercial contractors for new 
construction projects.
We estimate our market share 
to be 20 per cent and the two 
largest competitors holding an 
estimated 30 per cent market 
share between them. 
Facilities Supply
The Facilities Supply business 
provides products, services 
and solutions to enable reliable 
maintenance of facilities across 
multiple RMI markets including 
multi-family properties, government 
agencies, hospitality, education 
and healthcare. The Facilities Supply 
market is highly fragmented with 
no competitors holding more than 
5 per cent market share. UK

Regional performance continued
Business proﬁle
The UK operates three businesses 
under the Wolseley brand predominantly 
in the trade market through 642 
branches covering the whole country. 
These branches are served by six 
distribution centres providing same 
and next day product availability, a key 
service offering to our customers. The UK 
business mainly serves RMI markets, and 
has relatively low exposure to the new 
residential construction market. At 31 July 
2017 , Wolseley UK had 5,900 associates.
The UK business is currently in the 
ﬁrst year of a major transformation 
programme to improve service to 
customers, performance and proﬁtability.

70 per cent revenue. It operates under 
the Wolseley brand with a number of 
smaller brands including William Wilson 
and soak.com. These businesses 
provide plumbing and heating products 
primarily to trade customers in the 
residential and commercial sectors, 
for RMI purposes. The Plumbing and 
Heating business also provides specialist 
above ground drainage products.
The Pipe and Climate business distributes 
pipes, valves and ﬁttings as well as air 
conditioning and refrigeration products to 
B2B customers in the commercial sector, 
mainly for non-residential new construction.
Infrastructure is a specialist in below 
ground drainage. Operating under the 
Burdens and Fusion brands, it serves the 
civil infrastructure and utilities markets.

Operating performance
Like-for-like revenue was 1.0% ahead 
including price inﬂation of 2.2 per cent. 
Whilst new residential construction 
markets grew, repairs, maintenance 
and improvement markets, where we 
generate the majority of our trading 
proﬁt, were ﬂat. We continued to achieve 
good growth in the small customer 
segment which was offset by declining 
revenue in the large customer segments. 
The Pipe and Climate and Infrastructure 
businesses traded well and gained 
market share, though Plumbing and 
Heating markets remained challenging. 
We continue to invest in our B2C 
business, soak.com, which traded well 
and achieved good growth. 
Gross margins were ahead of last year 
and headcount was 2.8 per cent lower. 
Trading proﬁt of £76 million was £2 million 
ahead of last year. The trading margin 
grew by 10 basis points to 3.8 per cent.
During the year we remained ﬁrmly 
focused on implementing the strategy 
we announced in September last year. 
The transformation programme is 
continuing and we made progress in 
simplifying our customer propositions 
and optimising the supply chain and 
branch network to deliver a more 
efficient business. The programme 
remains in the early stages. Exceptional  
restructuring charges of £40 million were 
partly offset by £11 million one-off credits 
relating to a pension curtailment gain.

Operating performance
In Canada and Central Europe like-
for-like revenue grew by 3.6 per cent 
including price inﬂation of 1.7 per cent. 
Acquisitions contributed 0.9 per cent of 
additional growth. Canada grew well and 
the Netherlands also made very good 
progress. Gross margins were broadly 
ﬂat, mainly due to competitive conditions 
in Western Canada.
Operating expenses were well 
controlled with headcount up 1.2 per 
cent. Exchange rate movements were 
favourable and increased trading proﬁt 
by £6 million. Reported trading proﬁt of 
£45 million was £8 million ahead of last 
year. The trading margin was maintained 
at 4.3 per cent.
As previously announced the merger 
of our Tobler business with Walter 
Meier in Switzerland was completed on 
6 April 2017 and we now own 39.2 per 
cent of the combined business. For the 
8 months prior to the transaction Tobler 
generated £176 million of revenue and 
£11 million of trading proﬁt.
Since the year end we have acquired 
three more businesses, Aircovent 
in the Netherlands and Plomberium 
Pierrefonds and Tackaberry in Canada, 
combined they generate £23 million of 
annualised revenue.
Key  
highlights We strive to make these issues an 
integral part of how we do business, 
which is reﬂected in this report. 
Many of the issues are described within 
the key resources and relationships 
section on pages 22 to 25.
Stakeholder engagement
The framework was established 
following consultation with our 
stakeholders. A comprehensive 
review of our sustainability strategy 
is conducted each year and takes into 
account feedback from our investors, 
suppliers, customers, associates and 
third parties. 
Building a  
better business
Ferguson’s “Better Business” framework comprises 13 material issues  
which actively support our growth, improve associate engagement,  
address our top risks and compliance requirements or are important  
to our shareholders, customers and suppliers.
Our values

personal and cultural differences; 
we are open and honest in all our 
dealings with our people.

Sustainability Sustainability and drivers 
of proﬁtable growth
The symbols above are displayed in 
the table to the left to indicate which of 
our strategic drivers are most directly 
supported by each of the “Better Business” 
programme components. The strategic 
drivers are summarised on page 17 .
Governance
The overall “Better Business” framework 
is reviewed annually to test the ongoing 
materiality of the issues identiﬁed. 
The Group’s General Counsel is 
responsible to the Board for the overall 
programme. Objectives and, where 
appropriate, quantiﬁed targets are set 
for each material issue. Group-wide 
KPIs have not been set for all issues 
as it is not always practical to bring 
distinct local methods under one 
uniﬁed metric. Improved performance is 
the primary goal. Business units monitor 
performance throughout the year and 
performance reports are submitted to 
the Executive Committee and the Board 
at regular intervals.
“Better Business” –  
progress in 2017
The following two pages provide an 
overview of our progress in the year 
under review. It is referenced when 
further information on these topics 
can be found elsewhere in this report. 
A greater level of detail is available 
on the Ferguson plc website 
www.fergusonplc.com.
Opportunities Risks
A multi-skilled and well trained workforce will help us 
to deliver against our objectives and adapt to changing 
customer needs.
Changing operating models require us to constantly  
up-skill our people. A competitive marketplace puts greater 
emphasis on excellent career development to attract talent. 
Well structured remuneration and incentive programmes 
align associate and company objectives in order to 
maximise results.
An uncompetitive remuneration programme could impact 
our ability to attract and retain the best people.
Motivated and engaged people deliver excellent 
customer service, develop strong supplier relationships 
and maximise operational efficiencies.
Low associate engagement can lead to sub-optimal business 
results and poor retention of our people. 
A diverse workforce brings with it the widest range 
of knowledge, skills and experience and promotes 
innovation. An inclusive environment allows our people 
to feel at ease in the workplace.
In an ever-changing market a lack of diversity can limit business 
progression. 
A robust health and safety programme protects our 
people, customers and suppliers. It also improves 
productivity by reducing the number of days lost to injury.
Our principal risks relate to manual handling, working at height, 
the use of motorised equipment and vehicle collisions. If not 
mitigated, these risks can harm our associates, impact our 
productivity and incur costs. See page 47, Health and safety.
A commitment to high ethical standards strengthens 
our reputation with customers, suppliers and other 
stakeholders.
The business is exposed to risks of bribery and fraud, which can 
damage our reputation. Compliance programmes are in place 
to mitigate these risks. See page 48, Government regulations.
Sourcing and supplying safe, quality products improves 
our margins, enhances customer satisfaction and enables 
our people in branch to devote more time to service.
Product-related litigation is recognised as one of our principal 
risks. For more detail on how we are managing the risk, 
see page 47.
Working with reputable suppliers gives our stakeholders 
conﬁdence in the integrity of our supply chain, including 
standards around ethical labour, modern slavery, conﬂict 
minerals and anti-bribery and corruption. 
There is increasing focus on supply chain transparency 
due to the risk of business interruption or reputational harm. 
Where the opportunity exists, we can gain market share 
by supplying eco products and offering training and 
advice to our customers. 
Building regulations increasingly focus on sustainable 
construction. Growth opportunities can be missed if we 
do not adapt to our customers’ changing product needs.
Better energy and waste management decreases  
costs and improves operational efficiencies.
Energy costs and increasing “green” taxes can reduce 
Ferguson’s proﬁt margins. We have reduction targets in place 
to minimise these costs.
Compliance with legal regulations gives us a licence  
to operate.
Mitigating the risk of non-compliance with increasing levels 
of governmental regulations is a priority (see page 48). 
Without certain licences the Company cannot operate.
Robust systems and processes together with an  
informed workforce allow us to protect our sensitive 
or commercial data.
Information security is one of our principal risks.  
For more detail, see page 46.
Engagement with the communities in which we operate 
promotes our business and enhances people skills 
and engagement.
Ferguson has many locally established competitors who 
are active in the community. A lack of engagement with our 
communities can weaken our reputation with both customers 
and employees.

Health and safety
Ferguson had set a 2 per cent reduction 
target for each of the three health 
and safety metrics during the year 
under review. 
Injury rate 7.2% deterioration  
(1.63 per 100,000  
hours worked)

rate
8.9% deterioration  
(53.75 per 100 employees)

(14.45 per 100 vehicles)
The deterioration in our injury and lost 
workday rates is disappointing and is 
primarily as a result of deteriorating 
rates in the USA. Further information 
on our key health and safety risks and 
the mitigating actions being taken is 
provided in the key resources and 
relationship section. 
Pages 23 to 25
Ethical behaviour  
and human rights
Page 24 
Human rights
Both the United Nations Global 
Compact and Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights have been considered in 
determining the human rights issues that 
are material to Ferguson. These topics 
include associate policies (covering 
topics such as anti-discrimination), health 
and safety and ethics and conduct. 
All of these issues are managed through 
policies and programmes of work and 
are regularly monitored for compliance. 
Business partners and suppliers are 
expected to conform to Ferguson’s 
Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct 
is detailed on the Ferguson plc website 
www.fergusonplc.com.
Our products
Product quality and integrity
During 2016/17, we continued to embed 
our quality control procedures for 
sourcing from the Far East. Quality teams 
in our Asian sourcing entities continue to 
visit and assess our suppliers. The overall 
framework for product integrity was 
reviewed and strengthened and 
additional resource was added to the 
quality team in the UK business. 
Responsible sourcing
Each business assesses its suppliers 
against set criteria to provide protection 
to both us and our customers in the 
event of a product failure or breach 
of regulation in the supply chain.
Page 24
Modern Slavery Act
The UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 (“the 
Act”) requires Ferguson plc and its group 
of companies (“the Group”) to make an 
annual statement outlining the steps the 
business is taking to identify and prevent 
modern slavery within our organisation 
and its supply chain. 
Through its various business divisions, 
the Group sources, distributes and sells 
products in mature markets in North 
America and Western Europe. A small 
percentage of the Group’s own label 
products are sourced from other regions, 
principally in Asia.
It is recognised that there could be a 
small risk of human trafficking or slavery 
in the manufacturing, distribution and 
logistics activities that are connected 
with our business. Ferguson plc has zero 
tolerance for such activities. 
The Group is undertaking a number  
of steps to minimise the risks of slavery 
occurring in our business or our  
supply chain.
 – We built upon our existing processes 
for background screening of suppliers 
so that now we have screened tens 
of thousands of our suppliers (see 
case study to the left). No slavery 
risks were identiﬁed in the process. 
The businesses continue to screen 
their highest risk entities (based on 
spend value, geographical location 
and business type).
Case study
Working with 
responsible 
suppliers
One of the steps 
taken by the 
Company to 
assess the ethical 
behaviours of 
suppliers is to screen 
their company names 
through a third-party 
risk assessment 
portal. This allows 
for identiﬁcation 
of any issues 
such as adverse 
media relating to 
regulatory breaches 
or employment 
practices, sanctions, 
criminal activity or 
links to senior ranking 
public officials. 
Tens of thousands of 
our suppliers have 
been assessed over 
the last two years. 
No high risk issues 
were identiﬁed. 
Ethical screening 
continues on higher 
risk entities.

Compliance with the law
Legal and compliance teams 
across the Group work with the 
businesses to adhere to all legal and 
regulatory requirements. 
Protecting information
As our channels to market develop 
so too does the technology that we 
employ and the data that we hold. 
We are committed to protecting the 
security of our systems and information 
so that customers can transact with 
us safe in the knowledge that we 
have the appropriate safeguards 
in place. The Group operates an IT 
governance framework, including a 
full set of dedicated IT policies, aligned 
to known security and operational risks. 
A broader Group information security 
policy determines how we protect all 
information wherever it exists and in 
whatever form (electronic or hard-copy).

Our communities
Active corporate citizen
Our businesses seek to be contributing 
members to the communities in which 
they operate. The Group supports 
a number of charitable organisations 
both at a Group and a business unit level. 
In 2016/17, Ferguson plc’s businesses 
contributed to a range of charities, 
including support for the homeless, 
scholarships for young apprentices and 
provision of care for sufferers of cancer 
and other illnesses. 
Our people engaged in numerous 
community and charity events during 
the year. Further information and case 
studies of the events our associates 
and businesses have supported 
over the last year can be found at 
www.fergusonplc.com.
Performance at the end of 2016/17, one 
year into the target period, is positive 
across all three performance measures.

Promotion of “eco” products
Our businesses continue to monitor the 
market for “eco” products and promote 
these products where there is customer 
demand. For example, customers of 
our online business Build.com can ﬁlter 
their product search to view products 
with recognised national environmental 
labels. The UK and Dutch businesses 
each have a dedicated showroom to 
promote renewable technologies and 
publish targeted marketing material on 
these products.

Environmental efficiency
Ferguson plc set ﬁve-year targets to 
reduce carbon (-10 per cent) and waste 
(-15 per cent) per £m revenue and to 
increase the percentage of waste that is 
recycled to 40 per cent. Each business 
has set its own targets for carbon and 
waste to support the achievement of the 
Group goals.

(“GWP”) of each of the “basket of six” greenhouse 
gases, as deﬁned by the Kyoto Protocol.
Strategic report Governance Financials Other information
37 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 In addition to a good set of results, we have also made rapid progress on 
executing our strategy. Actions in the year included the business disposals 
in Central Europe and the USA and restructuring activities in the UK. 
In addition, the Group decided to divest all its businesses in the Nordic 
region. These changes, whilst beneﬁcial for the Group, do cause some 
complexity in the ﬁnancial statements. 
In order to monitor performance on a consistent basis the Group uses 
certain alternative performance measures which enable it to assess the 
underlying performance of its businesses. The Group’s key ﬁnancial 
performance metric is “Trading Proﬁt” which is operating proﬁt before 
exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired 
intangible assets. The Group’s deﬁnition of exceptional items includes 
costs incurred on major restructuring programmes, gains or losses on 
disposal of businesses and other signiﬁcant one-off items. 
In accordance with IFRS 5 “Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations”, the Group’s results for its Nordic businesses 
have been included as discontinued operations in the current and prior 
year and are excluded from continuing operations. In addition, the Group 
has disposed of a number of businesses which do not satisfy the criteria 
of IFRS 5 and are therefore included in the Group’s results from continuing 
operations. The results from disposed businesses included in the 
Group’s continuing operations are excluded from the Group’s alternative 
performance measure of “ongoing results”. Any reference to “ongoing 
operations” excludes the performance of the Group’s discontinued and 
disposed businesses.
See note 2 on pages 91 and 92 for further information, deﬁnitions and 
reconciliations of alternative performance measures.

Ferguson plc delivered a good set of results driven by the USA and some 
recovery in the UK and Canada. Residential and commercial markets in the 
US remained strong throughout the year and Industrial markets improved 
in the second half. The UK heating market remained weak and the market 
in Canada improved progressively through the year.
Revenue in the ongoing business of £14,878 million (2015/16: £12,146 million) 
was 6.0 per cent ahead on a like-for-like basis with a further 2.1 per cent of 
growth from acquisitions, 0.4 per cent from one additional trading day and 
0.1 per cent from new branches. 
Gross margins were 40 basis points ahead as we continued to focus on a 
better mix of higher value-added products and services and improving our 
purchasing terms. 
T rading proﬁt in the ongoing business was £1,032 million (2015/16: £827 million), 
8.7 per cent ahead of last year at constant exchange rates. The trading margin 
in the ongoing business was 10 basis points ahead of last year at 6.9 per cent. 
Favourable foreign exchange rate movements added £122 million and an 
additional trading day increased trading proﬁt by approximately £9 million.

A good trading 
performance
The Group delivered a good set of results in 2016/17, primarily 
driven by a strong performance in the USA. During the year, 
Ferguson continued to generate excellent cash ﬂow which enabled 
us to invest in organic growth and bolt-on acquisitions, while 
returning surplus cash to shareholders.

Mike Powell
Chief Financial  
Officer Non-ongoing trading proﬁt
During the year, the Group disposed of a small non-core Industrial business, 
Endries, in the USA and its Swiss business, T obler. These non-ongoing 
businesses generated revenue of £346 million (2015/16: £403 million) and 
trading proﬁt of £27 million (2015/16: £30 million).
Amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets
Amortisation of £64 million (2015/16: £48 million) represents the normal 
recurring charge of the Group’s acquired intangible assets. The Group 
reviews the carrying value of its goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
annually and when there is an indicator of impairment during the year. 
No impairment of the continuing operations was identiﬁed as part of the 
annual impairment review. Goodwill, with a carrying value of £888 million 
(2015/16: £902 million), remains on the balance sheet and is supported by 
the value in use calculations. 
Exceptional items
Net exceptional credits totalled £229 million (2015/16: £4 million charge) 
in the year, comprising £266 million gain on disposal of businesses, 
£40 million restructuring charges and £3 million of other exceptional 
credits. The gain on disposal of businesses was generated from the 
disposal of Tobler, Endries and a property company in Austria. The gain 
includes £49 million from the recycling of deferred foreign exchange 
translation differences, which are included in a translation reserve until 
disposal, in accordance with IAS 21 “The Effects of Changes in Foreign 
Exchange Rates”. Restructuring charges were primarily in relation to 
the UK turnaround strategy and principally comprised property closure 
and redundancy costs. Other exceptional items include an £11 million 
curtailment gain relating to the UK deﬁned beneﬁt pension plan.
Statutory results
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under IFRS and the Group’s 
accounting policies are set out on page 90.

Finance costs
Finance costs before exceptional items were £43 million 
(2015/16: £36 million). The increase is due to foreign exchange rate 
movements, as the majority of the Group’s debt is held in US dollars, 
and a small increase in the pension interest expense.
Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations include the results of the Nordic region 
and France. The balance sheet relating to the Nordic region has 
been transferred to assets and liabilities held for sale. The result from 
discontinued operations is comprised as follows:

The impairment charge of £102 million was in relation to the Group’s 
Swedish building materials business, Beijer. This resulted from the 
performance of Beijer deteriorating sharply in the ﬁrst half of the year, 
with trading proﬁt signiﬁcantly lower than the prior year and below 
management’s expectations.
Discontinued exceptional items relate to the property exit and redundancy 
costs from the closure of branches across the Nordic region. 
Tax 
Ferguson plc is tax resident in Switzerland. The Group’s operations 
are international with 89 per cent of the Group’s ongoing trading proﬁt 
generated in the USA, 7 per cent generated in the UK and 4 per cent in 
other overseas territories before central costs. The Group’s proﬁts are 
therefore subject to different overseas tax rates and tax laws.
The pre intra-group ﬁnancing ongoing expected weighted average tax rate 
is 37 .2 per cent (2015/16: 37 .6 per cent) and this is reduced to a post intra-
group ﬁnancing ongoing expected weighted average tax rate of 24.4 per 
cent (2015/16: 25.5 per cent) as detailed in note 7 .
Other than intra-group ﬁnancing and the recharging of shared administration 
costs, the Group currently has no signiﬁcant transfer pricing arrangements.
The Group’s Tax Strategy is to maintain the highest standards of tax 
compliance. We support the execution of the Ferguson business 
strategy by managing our tax affairs in full compliance with local laws and 
international guidelines while seeking to maximise shareholder value and 
serving the interest of all our stakeholders. The Group Tax Strategy can 
be found at www.fergusonplc.com.
The Group incurred a tax charge of £292 million (2015/16: £210 million) 
on proﬁt before tax of £1,180 million (2015/16: £675 million) resulting in an 
effective tax rate of 24.7 per cent (2015/16: 31.1 per cent). This tax charge 
includes an ongoing tax charge from ongoing operations before exceptional 
items, the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets and 
non-recurring tax items of £277 million (2015/16: £217 million). This equates 
to an ongoing effective tax rate of 28.0 per cent (2015/16: 27.4 per cent) on 
the ongoing proﬁt before tax, exceptional items and the amortisation and 
impairment of intangible assets of £989 million (2015/16: £792 million). 
Although the ongoing effective tax rate has remained stable over the 
last few years, it is sensitive to the Group’s mix of geographical proﬁts, 
its internal ﬁnancing arrangements, international tax law and rate 
changes and the impact of acquisitions, disposals and restructurings.
Strategic report Governance Financials Other information
39 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The ongoing effective tax rate is expected to remain at approximately 
28 per cent next year although this could increase or decrease signiﬁcantly 
depending on the ﬁnal outcome of US tax reform changes. No reliable 
estimate can be made of the impact of these changes at this stage given 
the lack of detail currently available, although potential changes may 
decrease the ongoing effective tax rate and restrict interest deductibility. 
In the medium term, potential tax reform in Switzerland could also 
signiﬁcantly vary the rate but, as with the US tax reform above, there is 
insufficient detail currently available of the exact tax law changes to enable 
management to make a reliable estimate of their impact.
The Group does not expect the ongoing effective tax rate to be inﬂuenced 
signiﬁcantly by international tax law changes arising from the OECD’s Base 
Erosion and Proﬁt Shifting Action Plan nor the outcome of Brexit over the 
next few years. 
The Group will continue to keep all external developments on the above 
issues under review.
The Group paid £310 million (2015/16: £193 million) in corporation tax in the 
year. The corporation tax paid in the year will typically differ to the total tax 
charge in the income statement as a result of:
 – non-cash deferred tax expense or income arising from accounting 
requirements in IAS 12 “Income Taxes” to recognise tax which may 
become payable or recoverable in future periods;
 – adjustments to the current year’s tax charge in respect of the under 
or over provision of tax for prior years; and
 – timing differences between when tax is reﬂected as a charge in 
the accounts and when it is paid to the tax authority as typically tax 
payments relating to a particular year’s proﬁts are paid partly in the year 
and partly in the following year. 
Earnings per share 
Headline earnings per share increased by 23.1 per cent from 234.7 pence 
to 288.9 pence. Basic earnings per share from continuing operations 
were 353.4 pence and diluted earnings per share were 350.8 pence. 
Total basic earnings per share, including discontinued operations, were 
311.6 pence and total diluted earnings per share were 309.4 pence. 
A signiﬁcant proportion of these increases were due to favourable foreign 
exchange translation.
Impact of foreign exchange rates
The Group reports its results in sterling. The main currency exposure 
arises on the translation of overseas earnings into sterling. The Group 
does not hedge this exposure as any earnings hedges have only a 
temporary effect. The Group’s policy is broadly to match the currencies 
in which its debt is denominated to the currencies in which its trading 
proﬁt is generated. The exchange rates used for the consolidated income 
statement and balance sheet are set out on page 139. The impact of 
foreign exchange rate movements on the ﬁnancial statements is shown 
in the table below.

As previously announced, from 2017/18 the Group will present its 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements in US dollars and, as the majority 
of revenue and trading proﬁt is generated in US dollars, the impact 
of foreign exchange rate movements will be reduced.
Cash ﬂow
The Group has continued to generate strong cash ﬂows during the year 
with cash generated from operations of £1,115 million (2015/16: £1,019 million) 
and an excellent cash conversion ratio of cash generated from operations/
EBITDA (£1,289 million including £90 million EBITDA from discontinued 
operations) of 87 per cent (2015/16: 96 per cent).

Acquisitions and capital expenditure
Acquisitions are an important part of our growth model and during the year 
we invested £256 million in 11 bolt-on acquisitions, principally in the USA. 
The strategy of investing in the development of the Group’s 
business models is supported by capital expenditure of £178 million 
(2015/16: £218 million). This investment was primarily for strategic projects 
to support future growth such as new distribution centres, distribution 
hubs, technology, processes and network infrastructure. 
As at 31 July 2017, the Group had total operating lease commitments 
of £854 million (2015/16: £853 million). Management believes there 
is substantial capacity for revenue growth utilising the existing branch 
infrastructure and will remain cautious when considering new lease 
commitments for the foreseeable future. Additional information can 
be found in note 34 on page 118. 
Returns to shareholders
The Group is highly cash generative and the Board has established 
clear priorities for the utilisation of cash. In order of priority these are:
(i) to re-invest in organic growth opportunities;
(ii)  to fund the ordinary dividend to grow in line with the Group’s 
expectations of long-term earnings growth;
(iii)  to fund bolt-on acquisitions to existing businesses where we have 
momentum and management bandwidth; and
(iv)  if there is excess cash after these priorities, return it to 
shareholders promptly. 
The Group paid an interim dividend of 36.67 pence per share 
(2015/16: 33.28 pence per share) amounting to £92 million. A ﬁnal dividend 
of 73.33 pence per share (2015/16: 66.72 pence per share), equivalent 
to £185 million is proposed. This brings the total dividend for 2016/17 to 
110.00 pence per share, an increase of 10 per cent.
Reﬂecting management’s conﬁdence in the business and the continuing 
strong cash generation of the Group, and after taking into account the 
excellent opportunities to invest in organic growth and acquisitions, the 
Board considers that the Group has surplus cash resources available. 
The Group will now commence a £500 million share buyback programme 
with the intention to complete this within the next 12 months. 
40 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial and operating review continued Net debt
Net debt decreased during the year by £402 million to £534 million 
at 31 July 2017. The reduction is due to strong operating cash ﬂow 
generation of £1,115 million and disposal proceeds of £267 million partially 
offset by acquisition and capital investment of £434 million, dividends 
of £259 million and interest and tax payments of £363 million. Net debt 
was 0.45 times EBITDA before exceptional items at the end of the year 
(2015/16: 0.96 times).
Pensions
At 31 July 2017 , the Group’s net pension liability of £21 million (2015/16:  
£147 million) comprised assets of £1,501 million (2015/16: £1,558 million) and 
liabilities of £1,522 million (2015/16: £1,705 million). IAS 19 (Revised) “Employee 
Beneﬁts” requires the Group to make assumptions including, but not limited 
to, rates of inﬂation, discount rates and current and future life expectancy. 
The value of the liabilities and assets could change materially if different 
assumptions were used. T o help understand the impact of changes in 
these assumptions we have included key sensitivities as part of our pension 
disclosure in note 26 (iv) on page 112.
In June 2017 , the UK pension plan entered into a buy-in annuity insurance 
policy with a major insurance company to cover all existing pensioner 
liabilities. Measured against the long-term funding objective agreed 
between Ferguson and the T rustee, entering into the annuity represented a 
small funding improvement. On an IAS 19 accounting basis the annuity policy 
is recorded as a plan asset amounting to £497 million as at 31 July 2017 .
The UK pension plan was subject to a triennial valuation in April 2016 which 
has now been ﬁnalised. As a result, the Group will fund additional employer 
pension contributions of £25 million over the next two years.
Other ﬁnancial matters
Supplier rebates
Supplier rebates, typically in the form of a volume-based reduction to 
a supplier’s list price, are commonly used by suppliers in our industry. 
Ferguson has agreements with a large number of its suppliers covering 
volume-based rebates, marketing support and other discounts receivable 
in connection with the purchase of goods for resale from those suppliers. 
More detail about the Group’s supplier rebates is disclosed in note 37 on 
page 120.
The following amounts are included in the balance sheet at the year-end 
in relation to supplier rebates:
2017  
£m
2016  
£m
Trade receivables 177 182
Inventories (204) (214)
Trade payables – 15
Net balance sheet position (27) (17)
Capital structure
The Group’s sources of funding currently comprise operating cash ﬂow, 
access to substantial committed bank facilities from a range of banks 
and access to capital markets in the USA. The Group maintains a capital 
structure appropriate for current and prospective trading and aims to 
operate with investment grade credit metrics and within a through-cycle 
range of net debt of 1 to 2 times EBITDA. 
Liquidity 
The Group maintains sufficient borrowing facilities to ﬁnance all investment 
and capital expenditure included in its strategic plan with an additional 
margin for contingencies. The Group aims to have a range of borrowings 
from different ﬁnancial institutions to ensure continuity of ﬁnancing. 
At 31 July 2017, the Group had total committed facilities of £2,337 million 
(2015/16: £2,320 million). Of the Group’s committed facilities at 31 July 2017, 
£1,398 million (2015/16: £1,159 million) was undrawn and £606 million of the 
total facilities mature after more than ﬁve years.
Interest rates
The Group’s weighted average cost of debt is 3.9 per cent. The largest 
part of this is the Group’s private placement bonds, which have an 
outstanding par value of £937 million and a weighted average ﬁxed 
interest rate of 3.3 per cent.
Financial risk management 
The Group is exposed to risks arising from the international nature 
of its operations and the ﬁnancial instruments which fund them. These  
instruments include cash, liquid investments and borrowing and items 
such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from 
operations. The Group also enters into selective derivative transactions, 
principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts, 
to reduce uncertainty about the amount of future committed or forecast 
cash ﬂows. The policies to manage these risks have been applied 
consistently throughout the year. It is Group policy not to undertake 
trading in ﬁnancial instruments or speculative transactions. 
Other ﬁnancial risks
The nature of the Group’s business exposes it to risks which are 
partly ﬁnancial in nature including counterparty and commodity risk. 
Counterparty risk is the risk that banks and other ﬁnancial institutions 
which are contractually committed to make payments to the Group may 
fail to do so. Commodity risk is the risk that the Group may have purchased 
commodities which subsequently fall in value.
The Group manages counterparty risk by setting credit and settlement 
limits for a panel of approved counterparties, which are approved 
by the Group’s Treasury Committee and are monitored regularly. 
The management of customer trade credit and commodity risk is 
considered to be the responsibility of operational management and, 
in respect of these risks, the Group does not prescribe a uniform 
approach across the Group.
The Group’s principal risks (including strategic, operational, legal and 
other risks) are shown on pages 42 to 49.
Going concern
The Group’s principal objective when managing cash and debt is to 
safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern for the 
foreseeable future. The Group retains sufficient resources to remain in 
compliance with the ﬁnancial covenant of its bank facilities with substantial 
headroom. The Directors consider it appropriate to continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
The Directors have also assessed the Group’s prospects and viability over 
a three-year period. The viability statement can be found on page 43.

Risk analysis during the year
2016/17 risk and control assessments
Ferguson formally reviews its principal Group and business unit risks 
every six months – at the half-year and at the year-end.
In January and July 2017, the Board provided its perspective on risks 
relating to the Group’s strategy for 2017/18 and beyond. The Board’s 
assessment was then combined with bottom-up risk reports received 
from business units in February and August 2017 to produce an overall 
risk proﬁle and report for the Group.
This risk report, listing principal and “emerging” risks and how they 
have changed, was reviewed, amended and ﬁnalised with the Executive 
Committee in March and September 2017. The mitigation in place for each 
principal risk was then reported to and reviewed by the Audit Committee.
Throughout the year, members of the Board, Audit Committee and 
Executive Committee have received updates on the Group’s principal 
risks, as follows: 
Risk Updates provided
A New competitors 
and technology
Formal analysis and update provided 
to the Board in September 2016. 
Related risks considered by the 
Board in January and July 2017 and 
by the Executive team in March and 
September 2017.
B Market conditions Monthly performance reviews with 
CEO and CFO. CEO update to the 
Board at each Board meeting.
C Pressure on margins
D Information security Reports on the status of the Group’s 
information security programme were 
provided to the Executive Committee 
and the Board and the Audit 
Committee throughout the year.
E Litigation The Group General Counsel regularly 
provides updates to the Executive 
Committee and the Board on changes 
in legislation and any material litigation 
or exposures. Reports were provided 
on how the Group mitigates the risk of 
product integrity and related exposure.
F Health and safety Performance updates were provided at 
every Executive Committee and Board 
meeting during the year.
G Strategic change Monthly performance reviews with 
CEO and CFO. CEO update to the 
Board at each Board meeting.
H Regulations The status of the Group’s anti-bribery 
programme was reported to the Audit 
Committee in January 2017.
I Talent management 
and retention
The Board, supported by the 
Nominations and Audit Committees, 
has received detailed updates 
throughout the year from leadership 
teams around the Group.
Longer-term viability of the Group
Building on this risk analysis, the Directors have assessed the Group’s 
prospects and viability in light of its current ﬁnancial position, strategic 
plan and principal risks. The Board believes that a three-year viability 
assessment period to July 2020 is appropriate as this timeframe aligns 
with the Group’s planning horizon. Furthermore, the Group’s principal 
risks are ongoing in nature and could materialise at any time. None are 
triggered by a speciﬁc, known event that will happen beyond that three-
year timeframe. Forecasting beyond the three-year timeframe does not 
therefore provide additional accuracy or risk insight.
Strategic plans have been prepared by all business units and ﬁnancial 
forecasts and budgets have been reviewed by the Board. The principal 
risks to the Group’s strategy were formally reviewed by the Board in 
January and July 2017. Consideration has also been given to the strength 
of the Group’s balance sheet and its credit facilities.
Financial forecasts have been tested against an unlikely, but realistic, 
worst-case scenario. This incorporates a material downturn occurring 
in the Group’s major markets. The material assumptions used in this 
analysis were based on a hypothetical market downturn resulting in a 
20 per cent shortfall in forecast Group revenue in 2018, lasting for one 
year, followed by annual growth rate of 5 per cent thereafter. The impacts 
of the revenue fall have been ﬂowed through the cash ﬂow statement on 
a line by line basis using management assumptions which have then been 
tested against the historical trends experienced by the Group in the last 
economic downturn of FY08 – FY10. The testing took account of a number 
of mitigating cash ﬂow actions available to the business to respond to the 
market downturn – for example, a reduction in working capital, capital 
expenditure and tax alongside the elimination of acquisitions.
Based on these assumptions, and considering the Group’s ﬁnancial 
position, strategic plans and principal risks, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year 
period of their assessment.
The Directors’ statement regarding the adoption of the going concern 
basis for the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements can be found on 
page 41.
UK referendum result – June 2016
The UK referendum result of a vote to leave the European Union continues 
to produce some market uncertainties including a material weakening of 
sterling against the Group’s principal trading currencies, of which the most 
signiﬁcant is the US dollar. The weakening of sterling has had a translation 
impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial statements with a beneﬁcial impact on 
results. In future years, the Company will report in US Dollars. 
Since the large majority of the Group’s proﬁt is derived from activities 
outside of the UK and Europe, the Group does not, at this point in time, 
envisage a material adverse impact in the future. The Group will continue 
to monitor developments. Heat map (before mitigating controls and actions)
The heat map below illustrates the relative positioning of our principal 
risks by severity and likelihood. Severity scales are different to those 
used in previous annual reports and are not directly comparable.

Deﬁnition and impact
Wholesale and distribution 
businesses in other industry sectors 
have been disrupted by the arrival 
of new competitors with lower-cost 
business models or new technologies 
to aggregate demand away 
from incumbents.
The Board is attuned to both the risks 
and opportunities presented by these 
changes and is actively engaged as 
the Group takes action to respond.
Changes during the year
Increased resources were allocated 
to the exploration and incubation 
of new business models and new 
technologies. The Group made 
a number of acquisitions of online 
businesses during the year. 
A new Non Executive Director, 
Nadia Shouraboura, joined the 
Board, bringing experience of large 
international e-commerce businesses.
Mitigation
The Group develops and invests 
in new business models, including 
e-commerce, to respond to changing 
customer and consumer needs. 
One example, online channels in our 
HVAC business, is set out on page 11.
The Company remains vigilant to 
the threats and opportunities in 
this space. The development of 
new business models in our market 
place is closely evaluated – both for 
investment potential and threats. 
44 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Principal risks and their management continued
The materialisation of these risks could have an adverse effect on the 
Group’s results or ﬁnancial condition. If more than one of these risks occur, 
the combined overall effect of such events may be compounded.
The chart shows management’s assessment of material risks before 
mitigating controls and actions. Various strategies are employed to reduce 
these inherent risks to an acceptable level. These are summarised in the 
tables on the following pages.
The effectiveness of these mitigation strategies can change over time, 
for example with the acquisition or disposal of businesses. Some of 
these risks remain beyond the direct control of management. The risk 
management programme, including risk assessments, can therefore only 
provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that risks are managed to 
an acceptable level.
The Group faces many other risks which, although important and subject 
to regular review, have been assessed as less signiﬁcant and are not 
listed here. These include, for example, natural catastrophe and business 
interruption risks and certain ﬁnancial risks. A summary of ﬁnancial risks 
and their management is provided on pages 41 , 107 and 108.

Deﬁnition and impact
This risk relates to the Group’s 
exposure to short-term 
macroeconomic conditions 
and market cycles in our sector  
(i.e. periodic market downturns).
Some of the factors driving market 
growth are beyond the Group’s 
control and are difficult to forecast.
Further information on the trends in 
each of our regions can be found on 
pages 28 to 33.
Changes this year
The downturn seen in industrial 
markets in 2015/16 has stabilised. 
The UK’s vote to leave the European 
Union continues to create a level 
of uncertainty affecting the UK 
economy, although this is not 
expected to have a material impact 
on the Group.
The Group has maintained a strong 
balance sheet throughout the year 
and other measures have been taken 
to manage the cost base in line with 
forecast growth.
The Group has again tested its 
ﬁnancial forecasts, including cash 
ﬂow projections, against the impact 
of a severe market downturn.
Mitigation
The Group cannot control market 
conditions but believes it has effective 
measures in place to respond to 
changes. Ferguson continues 
to reinforce existing measures in 
place, including:
 – the development of our 
business model;
 – cost control, pricing and 
gross margin management 
initiatives, including a focus 
on customer service and 
productivity improvement;
 – resource allocation processes; and
 – capital expenditure controls 
and procedures.
C
 
Pressure on margins
Inherent risk level
High
Trend
No change
Deﬁnition and impact
Ferguson’s ability to maintain 
attractive proﬁt margins can be 
affected by a range of factors. 
These include levels of demand 
and competition in our markets, the 
arrival of new competitors with new 
business models, the ﬂexibility of 
the Group’s cost base, changes in 
the cost of commodities or goods 
purchased, customer or supplier 
consolidation or manufacturers 
shipping directly to customers.
There is a risk that the Group may 
not identify or respond effectively 
to changes in these factors. If it 
fails to do so, the amount of proﬁt 
generated by the Group could be 
signiﬁcantly reduced.
Changes during the year
Pressure on margins remained high 
during the period under review, 
primarily due to levels of competition. 
Commodity price deﬂation eased 
during the year.
In response, the Group has continued 
to manage its cost base in line with 
changes in expected growth rates. 
Business unit performance, including 
margins achieved, were monitored 
monthly throughout the year.
Gross margins were 40 basis points 
ahead of last year. This was achieved 
by driving the beneﬁts of scale in 
sourcing, growing own label sales 
and through good pricing discipline. 
Mitigation
The Group’s strategy for tackling 
this issue remains unchanged. 
This includes continuous 
improvements in customer service, 
product availability and inventory 
management. Revenues from 
e-commerce and other growth 
sectors continue to expand and 
the Group has made acquisitions 
in these areas during 2016/17.
The performance of each 
business unit is closely monitored 
and corrective action taken 
when appropriate.
Resource allocation processes invest 
capital in those businesses capable 
of generating the best returns.

Information security 
Inherent risk level
High/medium
Trend
No change
Deﬁnition and impact
Technology systems and data 
are fundamental to the future 
growth and success of the Group. 
These digital assets are threatened 
by sophisticated security threats, 
including hacking, viruses, “phishing” 
or inadvertent errors.
The Group is reliant on a number of 
different legacy technology systems, 
some of which have been in place for 
many years or have been subject to 
in-house development.
Data breaches in our industry 
sector and others indicate that such 
events are highly likely and difficult 
to prevent.
Sensitive employee, customer 
or other data may be stolen and 
distributed or used illegally, leading to 
increased operating costs, litigation 
and ﬁnes or penalties.
These technology systems, on which 
our branches, distribution centres and 
e-commerce businesses rely, may be 
disrupted for several hours or days. 
As a result, Ferguson could forego 
revenue or proﬁt margins if we are 
unable to trade.
Changes during the year
This risk has remained material, 
as a greater proportion of the 
Group’s revenue is derived from 
e-commerce. The level and 
sophistication of IT security threats 
is constantly developing.
Like all large corporations, the Group 
continues to experience sustained 
and frequent attempts to gain 
unauthorised access to its technology 
systems, primarily from automated, 
non-directed malware. 
During the year, the Group engaged 
a specialist security consultancy to 
benchmark its information security 
capabilities. The ﬁndings, along with 
improvement actions, have been 
shared with the Audit Committee. 
Further penetration tests have been 
conducted, using both digital and 
physical means, e.g. phone calls. 
Improvements have been made 
where necessary.
Technical IT projects continue 
to deliver enhancements to the 
Group’s digital security systems 
and infrastructure.
The Group reviewed the adequacy of 
its “cyber” insurance arrangements. 
Using a database of 50,000 historical 
data breaches, the Group conducted 
a statistical analysis to estimate 
its exposure to certain types of 
cyber risks.
Brieﬁngs on the status of the Group’s 
information security programme 
were provided to the Board, the 
Audit Committee and the Executive 
Committee throughout the year.
Mitigation
The Group operates an IT 
governance framework including 
a set of dedicated IT policies, 
procedures and standards aligned 
to known security and operational 
risks. These include behavioural 
procedures for associates and 
technical controls for IT systems. 
These are reviewed annually and are 
subject to continuous improvement.
The Group periodically reviews the 
nature of the sensitive data it holds, its 
location and the controls in place to 
protect it. 
The Group reviewed its approach to 
obtaining assurance over the correct 
operation of IT systems and controls, 
some of which relate to cyber risks. 
Certain of these controls are tested 
by business units and the Group 
IT and internal audit functions. 
External specialists are also 
employed as appropriate to test the 
security of our technology systems, 
e.g. penetration tests.
Core IT systems and data 
centres for the Group’s material 
businesses, including the Group’s 
principal e-commerce businesses, 
have documented disaster 
recovery plans which are tested 
annually. Crisis management 
and communications plans are 
regularly updated.
Insurance coverage is in place, 
including coverage for “cyber” risks.

Litigation
Inherent risk level
Medium
Trend
No change
Deﬁnition and impact
The international nature of the 
Group’s operations exposes it to the 
potential for litigation from third parties 
and such exposure is considered to 
be greater in the USA than in Europe.
Material levels of litigation may arise 
from many of the Group’s activities. 
Signiﬁcant levels of litigation in our 
industry sector have in the past 
related to products, associates or 
major contracts.
Acquisitions and disposals and the 
restructuring of under-performing 
businesses may also give rise 
to litigation.
For more information on litigation 
affecting the Group and related 
provisions, see pages 109 and 119.
Changes this year
During the year, there has been 
no material change in the level 
of litigation to which the Group 
is exposed.
An improved management 
information system was introduced 
to improve the reporting and analysis 
of actual and potential litigation.
Reviews of policies and procedures 
relating to product liability were 
undertaken during the year and the 
ﬁndings were reported to the Board. 
Particular focus is being placed 
on quality control and assurance 
procedures to support the successful 
growth of own label sales.
The level of contractual protection 
afforded to the Group under product 
and employee-related contracts has 
improved during the year.
Contracting procedures continue 
to be improved in all businesses.
The Group’s liability insurance 
programme was restructured 
to provide enhanced cover.
Mitigation
Levels of litigation are monitored 
by individual operating companies. 
A monthly report of potential 
exposures and current litigation 
is submitted by all businesses 
and reviewed by the Group 
General Counsel.
Contracting procedures are 
continuously reviewed and improved 
against a “good practice” framework 
used by all Ferguson businesses.
The Group periodically re-assesses 
the level of product-related risk in 
all business units. Due diligence 
is conducted on products and 
suppliers considered to be high 
risk. Product testing is carried out 
in certain businesses supplying 
product to industrial customers.
KPIs are used to measure the level 
of contractual and other protection.
In the case of claims related to 
exposure to asbestos, Ferguson 
continues to employ independent 
professional advisers to actuarially 
determine its potential gross liability.

Deﬁnition and impact Changes this year Mitigation
The Group does not operate in a high 
risk industry with regard to health 
and safety. 
The nature of Ferguson’s operations 
can nevertheless expose its 
employees, contractors, customers, 
suppliers and other individuals to 
health and safety risks.
Health and safety incidents can lead 
to loss of life or severe injuries.
The risk has been elevated this year 
following the deterioration in injury 
and lost workday rates. The Company 
is recruiting a senior leader for health 
and safety in the USA. The Group 
conducted in-depth driver risk 
assessments and implemented 
control improvements. The Group 
vehicle collision rate has improved.
Page 23 provides further information.
Leadership of health and safety is 
key. Health and safety performance 
is reported to and discussed at 
all Group Executive Committee 
meetings and Board meetings.
The Group maintains a health and 
safety policy and detailed minimum 
standard, which sets out requirements 
which all Ferguson businesses are 
expected to meet. Branches are 
audited against this standard.

Decreased
Deﬁnition and impact
To respond to changing customer 
needs the Group is changing 
traditional ways of working in its 
established businesses. 
These changes are underway in all 
of our key markets, especially the UK, 
and will continue for several years.
The Group must successfully 
implement these changes without 
disrupting existing operations.
The Group’s ability to successfully 
execute these changes will affect its 
ability to grow proﬁtably in the future.
Changes during the year
During the year, we announced our 
intention to dispose of our operations 
in the Nordics.
In the UK, the transformation plan is 
underway and we expect that it will 
take a further two years to complete. 
To support faster execution, greater 
focus has been paid to a smaller 
number of initiatives capable of 
delivering the greatest value.
Mitigation
Each business unit has a clear 
strategy for continuously developing 
its business model and a deﬁned 
programme of work to execute 
the strategy.
The Group Chief Executive and Chief 
Financial Officer discuss progress 
with each business unit during regular 
performance reviews.
The Board reviews progress during 
regular updates from the Group 
Chief Executive and as part of its 
six-monthly review of principal risks.

Regulations
Inherent risk level
Medium
Trend
No change
Deﬁnition and impact
The Group’s operations are affected 
by various statutes, regulations 
and standards in the countries 
and markets in which it operates. 
The amount of such regulation and 
the penalties can vary.
While the Group is not engaged in a 
highly regulated industry, it is subject 
to the laws governing businesses 
generally, including laws relating to 
competition, product safety, timber 
sourcing, data protection, labour and 
employment practices, accounting 
and tax standards, international trade, 
fraud, bribery and corruption, land 
usage, the environment, health and 
safety, transportation, payment terms 
and other matters.
Breach of any legal or regulatory 
requirement could result in signiﬁcant 
ﬁnes and penalties and damage to 
the Group’s reputation.
Changes during the year
There has been no major change 
in the level of regulation applying 
to the Group.
Anti-bribery and anti-corruption 
practices in all businesses were 
reviewed during the year and the 
ﬁndings reported to the Executive 
Committee and to the Audit 
Committee. Improvements are 
being implemented.
The Group reviewed its Code 
of Conduct.
Further information on the Group’s 
ethics and compliance programme 
can be found on pages 24 and 36.
Mitigation
The Group monitors the law 
across its markets to ensure the 
effects of changes are minimised 
and the Group complies with all 
applicable laws.
The Group’s Code of Conduct sets 
out the behaviours expected of 
Ferguson associates. This includes 
clear statements that the Group does 
not permit bribery or the giving or 
receiving of improper gifts, that it does 
not tolerate fraud and that associates 
must comply with anti-trust laws.
The Group aligns Company-wide 
policies and procedures with its 
key compliance requirements and 
monitors their implementation.
Brieﬁngs and training on legal and 
regulatory topics and compliance 
requirements, including anti-trust, 
anti-fraud and anti-corruption, 
are undertaken.
Where appropriate, tests are 
conducted to ensure that the Group 
would respond appropriately to a 
regulatory investigation.

New addition
Deﬁnition and impact
As the Group develops new business 
models and new ways of working, 
it needs to develop suitable skill-sets 
within the organisation.
Furthermore, as the Group continues 
to execute a number of strategic 
change programmes, it is important 
that existing skill-sets and talent 
is retained. 
Failure to do so could delay the 
execution of strategic change 
programmes, result in a loss of 
“corporate memory” and reduce 
the Group’s supply of future leaders.
Changes during the year
There has been no material change in 
the level of employee turnover during 
the year; however a number of senior 
management changes have occurred 
throughout the Group.
These have included the retirement 
of the Group CEO and the CEO in 
the USA, the appointment of their 
successors and the appointment of 
a new Group Chief Financial Officer.
Talent management procedures 
were reviewed during the year.
Page 22 provides further information.
Mitigation
All of the Group’s businesses 
have established performance 
management and succession 
planning procedures. Reward  
packages for associates are designed 
to attract and retain the best talent.
Organisational and talent reviews 
are conducted quarterly by the Group 
HR Director with each business.
The Group continues to invest in 
associate development, an example 
of which – our Industrial Group 
University – is highlighted on page 9.

Drivers of proﬁtable growth
On the following pages the symbols below indicate where the 
activity of the Board and its Committees related to the drivers 
for proﬁtable growth set out in the Group Chief Executive’s 
review on page 17.
50 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Company’s Corporate Governance 
Report for the ﬁnancial year ended 31 July 2017. This report explains 
how the Board operates and how our governance structure contributes 
to the achievement of the Group’s long-term strategic objectives.
This section, together with the reports from the Audit, Nominations and 
Remuneration Committees beginning on pages 60, 64 and 69 respectively, 
provide a description of how the Group has applied the main principles and 
complied with the relevant provisions of UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the “Code”). We remain committed to full compliance with the Code and to 
achieving high standards of corporate governance both in the boardroom and 
throughout the Group. We have used the core principles of the Code as the 
framework within which we explain our governance practices in this report – 
please see the boxes below, which direct you to further detail. I also note with 
interest the UK Government’s proposals for corporate governance reform 
published in August 2017 . Y our Board will continue to monitor these proposed 
reforms as they develop to ensure that we remain fully compliant and that our 
high standards of corporate governance are maintained. 
The Board remains committed to presenting a clear assessment of the 
Company’s position and prospects through the information provided in this 
report, through interim ﬁnancial statements and other narrative and ﬁnancial 
reports and statements as required.
In addition to our usual programme of business, set out on page 57 , the 
Board has this year placed particular emphasis on succession planning and 
the delivery of the Group’s three strategic priorities as set out in last year’s 
report – to generate the best proﬁtable growth in the USA, to execute the 
UK turnaround and repositioning plan and to review the Nordics operational 
strategy and restore the business to proﬁtable growth. Detail of how your 
Board has supported delivery of the Group’s strategic priorities is provided 
in my Chairman’s statement on page 13, and later in this section on page 57 . 
It has also been a particularly active year for the Board in terms of succession 
planning and Board appointments, more detail is provided in the Nominations 
Committee report on pages 64 and 65.
The Board is responsible for determining the nature and extent of the principal 
risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives and for maintaining 
sound risk management and internal control systems. The effectiveness 
of these systems is reviewed through the work of the Audit Committee 
described on pages 60 to 63. During the year, the Board and its Committees 
carried out a robust assessment of the risks facing the business and the 
principal risks which the Board has focused on are set out in the Principal risks 
and their management section on pages 42 to 49. 
In the coming year your Board will continue to work to support the 
implementation and excellent execution of the Group’s strategy. Y our Board 
continues to strive for improvement and the areas for further development 
identiﬁed in the annual effectiveness review have been noted as priority 
areas for 2017/18. Details of the effectiveness review and the Board’s 
priorities for the coming year are set out on page 58. As usual, during the 
year the Non Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, 
conducted their annual evaluation of my performance. I also chair two 
other listed companies and this is speciﬁcally taken into account in the 
evaluation. The Board believes that I continue to perform effectively and to 
devote sufficient time and attention to my role as Chairman of the Company. 
A process to identify my successor as Chairman of William Hill PLC is 
underway and I envisage that I will stand down from that role by May 2018, 
once my successor has been appointed. 
Ferguson’s Group-wide policies and procedures provide a framework for 
governance and are underpinned by the Group’s core values and its Code 
of Conduct. The Group’s core values set the expectation that all employees, 
at all levels, will: place value on our people by encouraging development; act 
with integrity; and drive for results and improvement.
Culture and good governance are inherently linked and your Board 
recognises the fundamental importance of a corporate culture that is aligned 
with and supportive of the Group’s long-term strategic objectives. However, 
culture is, ultimately, an output resulting from the individual and collective 
actions of the Group’s associates. The Board has oversight of the Group’s 
“Better Business” framework, described in detail on pages 34 and 35, which 
sets out the 13 material issues we consider essential to how we do business. 
Objectives and, where appropriate, quantiﬁed targets are set for each of these 
material issues and regular performance updates are submitted to the Board.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders for their 
continuing support. The Board and I will be available to respond to any 
questions on this report or any of the Committee’s activities at our 2017 AGM in 
November and I look forward to welcoming those shareholders able to attend.

Board decision-making
The Board has a strong culture of open debate. All Directors are actively 
encouraged to challenge existing assumptions and to raise challenging 
questions. Certain strategic decisions and authorities of the Company 
are reserved as matters for the Board with other matters, responsibilities 
and authorities delegated to its Committees as detailed in the Ferguson 
governance structure on page 56. A formal schedule of matters reserved 
for the Board is reviewed annually in July, a summary of which can be 
found at www.fergusonplc.com together with the terms of reference 
of each of the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees.
Individual roles
The effective working of the Board is crucial to the long-term prospects 
and strategic aims of the Company. This is achieved through strong and 
open working relationships between the Directors and, in particular, 
the Chairman, Group Chief Executive and Senior Independent Director, 
whose roles are agreed and set out in writing. A short summary of their 
roles and division of responsibilities is set out below.

Board and Committee meetings
The Company is registered in Jersey and is tax resident in Switzerland. 
During the year, all meetings of the Board, Committees of the Board and 
all other meetings requiring decisions of a strategic or substantive nature 
were held outside the UK. 
Each Director is required to attend all meetings of the Board and 
Committees of which they are a member. In addition, senior management 
from across the Group and advisers attend some of the meetings for the 
discussion of speciﬁc items in greater depth.
The Board met regularly during the year, with Board and Committee 
meetings scheduled over one or two-day periods. Details of Director 
attendance at Board and Committee meetings during the year is set 
out above. 
In order to provide the Board with greater visibility of the Group’s 
operations, to provide further opportunities to meet senior management 
and to gain a deeper understanding of local market dynamics, the Board 
aims to visit at least one of the Group’s business unit locations each year. 
Details of the Board’s visit to Boston, USA in July 2017 can be found on 
page 55.
54 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Leadership and effectiveness Development of the Board
Upon appointment, all new Directors follow a comprehensive induction 
programme, further detail on which is provided below. All Directors are 
provided opportunities for further development and training following their 
induction and, during the year, the Chairman discusses a development 
plan with each Director. In addition to regular updates on governance, legal 
and regulatory matters, the Board also receives detailed brieﬁngs from 
advisers on a variety of topics that are relevant to the Group and its strategy. 
The annual formal review of governance provides the Directors with an 
opportunity to assess their effectiveness and that of the Board as a whole.
New Director induction programme
All new Directors appointed to the Board undertake an induction 
programme aimed at ensuring they develop an understanding and 
awareness of our businesses, people and processes, and of their roles 
and responsibilities as a director of a public company. The programme 
is structured to reﬂect what is regarded as best practice and includes:
 – Provision of relevant current and historical information about the 
Company and the Group;
 – Visits to operations around the Group;
 – Meetings with the Group Company Secretary and the 
Company’s advisers;
 – Induction brieﬁngs from Group functions; and,
 – One-to-one meetings with Directors and senior executives.
During the year, Mike Powell and Nadia Shouraboura undertook induction 
programmes following their appointments as Group Chief Financial Officer 
and Non Executive Director respectively. The programmes were tailored 
to ensure that they could familiarise themselves with the business, and the 
markets in which it operates, from the ground up. 
Mr Powell spent signiﬁcant periods of time with the Group’s USA, UK 
and Canadian business. Mr Powell met with senior regional ﬁnance and 
operational executives, visited branch and showroom locations in the 
USA, UK and Canada. He spent time with senior executives at the Group’s 
consumer e-commerce business and time on the road with salespeople 
meeting customers.
Ms Shouraboura’s induction spent several days immersed in the business 
including at a branch location, a showroom location and a distribution 
centre at our USA business, time with the consumer e-commerce business 
and time on the road with a salesperson meeting customers.
Since the end of the 2016/17 ﬁnancial year, Kevin Murphy was appointed 
Chief Executive Officer, USA and a member of the Board. Given the wealth 
of experience in the business Mr Murphy already possesses, his induction 
was more focused on his new role and his responsibilities as a Director 
and Chief Executive Officer, USA.
Information and support
In advance of each set of meetings, papers and relevant information are 
delivered so that each Director is provided with the necessary resources 
to fulﬁl their duties. The information is published via a secure web portal, 
allowing remote access by Directors. Meeting support is provided by the 
Company Secretariat department.
All Directors have access through a web portal to a library of relevant 
information about the Company, the Group and Board procedures.
The Board has an established procedure for Directors, if necessary, 
to take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense 
in furtherance of their duties. This is in addition to the direct access 
that every Director has to the Group Company Secretary for his advice 
and services.
Board composition
As at the date of this report, the Board consists of 11 members including the 
Chairman, three Executive Directors and seven Non Executive Directors. 
The composition of the Board is kept under review by the Nominations 
Committee to ensure an appropriate balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge are maintained.
The biographies of the Directors (on pages 52 and 53) demonstrate the 
strong and diverse experience possessed by the members of the Board. 
The Non Executive Directors play an essential role bringing a range of 
skills and expertise and challenging the Board to help develop Group 
strategy. Each of the Non Executive Directors and the Chairman are 
considered by the Board to be independent and free of any relationship 
which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent 
judgement. The Code suggests that length of tenure is a factor to consider 
when determining the independence of the Non Executive Directors. 
Each Non Executive Director has served for six years or less with the 
exception of Tessa Bamford. Ms Bamford was reappointed for a third three-
year term from March 2017. As required by the Code, the reappointment 
was subject to a particularly rigorous review, including taking into account 
the need for progressive refreshing of the Board. The Board was satisﬁed 
that Ms Bamford continued to demonstrate the high level of independence 
expected of a Non Executive Director. The Board concluded that 
Ms Bamford would continue to be a highly effective member of the 
Board, recognising in particular her wide-ranging business experience 
across a range of sectors in the UK and the USA, her expertise in senior 
management succession and her deep knowledge of the Group’s 
businesses. The Board is satisﬁed each Non Executive Director continues 
to demonstrate independence of thought and expertise in meetings, 
and to support the senior management in an objective manner.
Why you should vote to re-elect your Board
The Board contains a broad range of experience and skills from a variety 
of industries and advisory roles, which fully complement each other. 
In accordance with the Code, all Directors will stand for election or 
re-election at the 2017 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”). The Directors’ 
biographies can be found on pages 52 and 53, and in the Notice of AGM. 
Further details on the AGM can be found on page 144 and at  
www.fergusonplc.com
In July 2017, the Board and Committee meetings were held in Boston, 
Massachusetts, USA. This provided an opportunity for the Board to visit PV Sullivan, 
a blended distributor operating in Massachusetts acquired during the year, and 
its showroom in Burlington. During these visits the Board met with both senior 
executives and local management to discuss business strategy and operational 
performance, and received a presentation from local management on the 
performance and plans for the New England district as a whole. The Board visited 
the PV Sullivan warehouse in Boston, which allowed the Board to meet management 
and associates and gain a more detailed understanding of the business and how 
post-acquisition integration plans had been implemented ahead of schedule. 
At the Burlington showroom Board members met staff and customers and saw how 
product ranging was developing to meet the needs of customers.

Leadership and effectiveness What the Board has done during the year
The Board has a rolling agenda programme which ensures that items 
relating to strategy, ﬁnance, operations, health and safety, product integrity, 
corporate governance and compliance are covered in its meetings. 
The balance of time spent by the Board on strategic, performance related 
and governance issues is considered as part of the annual effectiveness 
review process and adjustments are made to the Board’s agenda for the 
following year. The Board receives copies of the minutes of each Board 
Committee meeting and key issues covered by each Committee are also 
reported to the subsequent meeting of the Board. Standing agenda items 
including reviews of health and safety performance, strategic initiatives 
such as acquisitions, investments and disposals and reports from the 
Group CEO and Group CFO are discussed at each Board meeting and 
other items are included on the agenda at relevant times throughout the 
year. A brief overview of some key areas of Board activity during the year

57 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Evaluating the performance of the Board of Directors
The Board undertakes a formal review of its performance and that of its Committees each year, with an external evaluation every three years. 
Following the external evaluation conducted in 2015, in accordance with the Code, the next externally-facilitated effectiveness review will be conducted 
during the year ending 31 July 2018. Progress against the actions identiﬁed following the internal review undertaken in 2016, is outlined below: 
Action point Responsibility Outcome
Keep under review the range of 
skills and experience required at 
Board level as the Group’s strategy 
is implemented and its businesses 
develop in the future
Board and Nominations  
Committee
During the year, the Board dealt with major succession issues with the 
appointment of a new Group CFO and a new CEO, USA. The opportunity 
was taken to supplement and complement the skills and experiences of the 
Board through the appointment of an additional Non Executive Director.
Continue to focus on succession 
planning at Board and Executive level
Board and Nominations  
Committee
Board and Executive succession planning was reviewed in detail by the Board 
and Nominations Committee (further information is provided on page 64).
Develop further opportunities 
for Board members to continue 
to deepen their understanding 
of and engagement with the 
Group’s businesses
Board Management presentations made to the Board on regional business 
performance and progress with strategic initiatives.
Board members met with, and received presentations from, local 
management during their visit to the USA for the July Board meeting.  
More detail on the Board’s visit to the USA is provided on page 55. 
Board and Committee effectiveness review
This year, the Board and Committee effectiveness review was facilitated 
internally using an online survey. The survey included questions tailored to 
address the activities and particular concerns of the Board and the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nominations Committees. The questions encouraged 
comment and qualitative evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board 
and each Committee, the individual members and the support received 
from management and advisers. Questions used in the previous year 
were included, enabling the Board to monitor and evaluate progress. 
Feedback from the reviewers was reported to and discussed by the 
Board and by each relevant Committee. In addition, the Chairman spoke 
with each Non Executive Director to discuss the results of the reviews.
All Directors, from the time of appointment, are aware of the time 
commitment expected in order to discharge their responsibilities 
effectively. The Chairman maintains frequent contact with all Directors 
and constantly monitors whether they are able to devote sufficient time 
to their respective roles, and he is satisﬁed that each Director has been 
able to do so. The Chairman also has regular meetings, outside of Board 
and Committee meetings, with the CEO and other executives to keep up 
to date with material developments in the business and discussed Board 
composition and succession planning at his meetings with shareholders. 
During the ﬁnancial year, each Director attended all scheduled Board 
meetings. The Board continues to consider each of the Directors to be 
effective and to demonstrate commitment to his or her role.
During the year, the Non Executive Directors, led by the Senior 
Independent Director, undertook the performance evaluation of the 
Chairman. The evaluation concluded that the Chairman performed 
strongly and is highly effective in his role. Board meetings were considered 
to be well chaired. The Chairman continued to devote sufficient time and 
attention to his role and had made himself available to Directors whenever 
necessary outside of Board meetings. 
Key ﬁndings, improvement actions and priorities
Overall, the key ﬁndings of the internal evaluation were positive. The review 
concluded that the Board was very effective and worked well together 
enabling the individual Directors to discharge their respective roles 
effectively. Although the composition of the Board was rated highly, the 
opportunity to enhance Board expertise with further digital expertise and 
USA operational experience was identiﬁed as an important aspect of Board 
development. The atmosphere at Board meetings was commented on 
favourably and seen as encouraging equal contribution, candid discussion 
and critical thinking. The support and challenge of management by 
Non Executive Directors was rated highly. The review concluded that the 
Board’s testing and development of strategy was strong and the Board’s 
oversight of the subsequent implementation of strategic objectives was 
rated highly. Performance of the Board Committees was rated very highly.
Areas identiﬁed in order to improve overall effectiveness, are 
summarised below:
Actions
Develop further opportunities for the Board to meet with USA 
management and further their understanding of the Group’s USA 
operations and market environment
Continue to focus on succession planning at Board and Executive level
As at the date of this report, the Board has already begun to incorporate 
these action points into its processes and procedures. An opportunity 
to further enhance the skills and expertise of the Board identiﬁed 
in the review has been taken with the appointment of an additional 
Non Executive Director. For further commentary please see page 64.
In addition to the actions arising from the effectiveness review, the Board 
priorities for 2017/18 are set out in the table below
Board priorities for 2017/18

Relations with shareholders Darren Shapland
Audit Committee Chairman
Dear Shareholder 
I am pleased to present the report of the Audit Committee for 2016/17. 
This report provides an insight into the activities of the Committee during 
the year and how the Committee plays a key oversight role for the 
Board. I will be available at the 2017 AGM, to respond to any questions 
shareholders have on this report or any of the Committee’s activities. 
As at 2 October 2017, the Committee was made up of seven Non 
Executive Directors as set out in the table on page 54. During the year, 
Nadia Shouraboura joined the Committee following her appointment as 
a Non Executive Director on 1 July 2017.
How the Committee operates
The Audit Committee met on four occasions during the ﬁnancial year. 
Meetings are scheduled to coincide with key dates in the ﬁnancial 
reporting cycle. Attendance at these meetings is set out on page 54.
The Board considers that several members of the Committee have recent 
and relevant ﬁnancial experience and that each member of the Committee 
is independent within the deﬁnition set out in the Code. Members of the 
Committee between them possess signiﬁcant international, commercial, 
retail, ﬁnancial and human resource skills and expertise which are relevant 
to an international specialist distribution company. In addition to me, Alan 
Murray and Pilar López have served as Chief Financial Officers of large 
businesses during their career. This provides the Board with assurance 
that the Audit Committee meets the relevant regulatory requirements 
relating to independence, ﬁnancial experience and sectoral competence. 
The key strengths and experience of each member of the Committee are 
summarised on pages 52 and 53. 
In addition to the members of the Committee, the Chairman, Group Chief 
Executive, Interim Group Chief Financial Officer and the Head of Internal 
Audit, together with senior representatives of Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”), 
the Company’s external auditors, attended and received papers for each 
meeting. Following his appointment as Group Chief Financial Officer on 
1 June 2017, Mike Powell also attended and received papers for the July 
Committee meeting. The Committee meets periodically with the Group 
Chief Financial Officer and also meets separately with Deloitte and the 
Head of Internal Audit without the presence of Executive Directors. The  
Committee has a programme where the Finance Directors of the Group’s 
major businesses attend and present updates on items such as regional 
ﬁnance team development, ﬁnance transformation and ﬁnancial systems 
architecture and the base ﬁnancial controls environment. Other senior 
executives are also invited to attend and provide updates to the Committee, 
for example the Chief Information Officer regularly attends meetings to 
report on the Group’s information security programme and IT controls. 
Principal areas of focus
During the year, the Committee has continued to focus on maintaining the 
quality and integrity of our ﬁnancial reporting, and monitoring and ensuring 
the appropriateness of the Company’s risk management systems and 
internal control environment. In line with the assessment of the Group’s 
principal risks (detailed on pages 42 to 49), and mindful of external events 
which have highlighted its importance, the Committee has increased its 
scrutiny of information security during the year and has reported on its activity 
to the Board. The Committee has also continued to monitor the interaction 
between the internal audit function and the external auditors, to monitor 
and review the effectiveness of the external audit process and to ensure 
that the Group’s governance standards are maintained. Further details of 
the Committee’s activities during the year are set out opposite.

Financial reporting and signiﬁcant ﬁnancial judgements
The Committee considered the issues summarised below as signiﬁcant in the context of the 2016/17 ﬁnancial statements. These were discussed 
and reviewed with management and the external auditors and the Committee challenged judgements and sought clariﬁcation where necessary. 
The Committee received a report from the external auditors on the work they had performed to arrive at their conclusions and discussed in detail 
all material ﬁndings contained within the report.
Carrying value 
of goodwill and 
intangible assets 
(recurring item)
Audit Committee review
The Committee reviewed the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets for 
impairment, including a detailed review of the assumptions underlying the value in use 
calculations for businesses identiﬁed as cash generating units. The key assumptions 
underlying the calculations are primarily the achievability of the long-term business plan, 
country speciﬁc discount rates, anticipated revenue growth in the short-term and long-term 
growth assumptions.
For further information please see notes 12 and 13 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
on pages 100 and 101.
Conclusions
The Committee agreed with 
management’s assessment that 
an impairment charge had arisen 
relating to the Swedish business, 
Beijer, due to signiﬁcantly 
reduced expectations 
of proﬁtability. 
Completeness of 
supplier rebates 
(recurring item)
Audit Committee review
The Committee reviewed the recognition of supplier rebates which are signiﬁcant to the 
Group and are an area of inherent risk due to the number and complexity of the arrangements. 
In addition, the majority of the supplier rebate arrangements cover a calendar year and 
therefore do not end at the same time as the Group’s accounting year-end. Where the rebate 
arrangements are calculated at a ﬂat rate there is limited judgement. However, for tiered 
rebates, judgements are required to forecast the expected level of volumes purchased to 
determine the appropriate rate at which a rebate is earned. This review covered the processes 
and controls in place during the year and the level of adherence to the Group’s accounting 
policies and procedures.
For further information please see note 1 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements on page 90.
Conclusions
As a result of the review process, 
which included consideration 
of the external audit ﬁndings, 
the Committee concluded that 
the level of rebate income and 
rebate receivable as at 31 July 
2017 was properly reﬂected in the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Inventory 
valuation 
(recurring item)
Audit Committee review
Judgement is applied in determining the appropriate values for slow-moving or obsolete 
inventory. The provisions are predominantly system-generated calculations, comparing 
inventory on hand against expected future sales using historic experience as the basis for 
provisioning, along with the results of physical stock-counts. The Committee considered the 
level of provisions and ensured the policy was consistently applied across the Group in the 
current and previous ﬁnancial periods. The Committee also sought the views of the auditors.
For further information please see note 1 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements on page 90.
Conclusions
Following their review, which 
included consideration of the 
external audit ﬁndings, the 
Committee concluded that 
provisions for obsolete and 
slow moving inventory are 
fairly stated in the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements.

61 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Audit Committee effectiveness review
An internally facilitated review of the Committee’s effectiveness was 
carried out in July 2017. The review concluded that the Committee 
continued to be effective and well run and the composition of the Audit 
Committee was rated highly. The review found that the work of the 
internal and external auditors was well co-ordinated and that their work 
continued to be effectively reviewed and assessed by the Committee. 
The Committee’s monitoring and review of the status of IT controls and 
information security systems was identiﬁed as an evolving area which 
had seen improvements implemented during the year. The review also 
highlighted several areas for improvement and these either have been 
incorporated into our priorities for 2017/18, or for more minor areas will 
be addressed during the year. 
Audit Committee priorities for 2017/18
Continue to review and monitor the approach to risk management 
and the level of risk driven through changes to the operating model, 
industry changes and technological developments
Continued increase in focus on the Group’s approach to

External audit
Auditor reappointment
Following an external tender process, Deloitte were ﬁrst appointed as the 
Company’s external auditor for the 2015/16 audit and have served as the 
Company’s auditor for two years. Deloitte’s reappointment was approved 
by shareholders at the 2016 Annual General Meeting. Ian Waller has 
served as lead audit partner since Deloitte’s appointment. In line with the 
Audit Practices Board Ethical Standard 3 the lead audit partner is due to be 
rotated following the 2019/20 audit.
The Committee reviews the external auditor appointment and the need to 
tender the audit annually. The Company conﬁrms that it complied with the 
provisions of the Code and the Competition and Markets Authority Order for 
the ﬁnancial year under review. For the ﬁnancial year ending 31 July 2018, the 
Committee has recommended to the Board that Deloitte be reappointed as 
the external auditor and the Directors will be proposing the reappointment of 
Deloitte at the 2017 Annual General Meeting. The Committee conﬁrms that 
the Company complied with the provisions of the Statutory Audit Services 
Order 2014 during the ﬁnancial year ended 31 July 2017 .
External audit processes
During the year, the Group audit partner, together with other relevant and 
appropriate Deloitte partners, attended all the Audit Committee meetings. 
They provided the Committee with information and advice including 
detailed reports on the ﬁnancial statements and internal controls.
In January 2017, the Committee reviewed and approved the terms, areas 
of responsibility and scope of the 2016/17 audit. During the year, Deloitte 
provided external audit services for regulatory and statutory reporting. 
Deloitte are expected to report to the Committee any material departures 
from Group accounting policies and procedures that are identiﬁed during 
the course of their audit work. Deloitte’s 2016/17 external audit plan has 
been successfully completed at the date of this report. No material items 
were found or reported in the ﬁnancial year. 
Effectiveness of the audit process
Following the issue of the Company’s Annual Report, the Committee 
conducts an annual review of the effectiveness of the external audit. 
A survey of all the Group’s ﬁnance teams is conducted. Each team is 
asked to rate the performance of the external auditor against a range of 
measures, including relating to the adequacy of planning, sufficiency of 
resource, thoroughness of review and testing, adequacy and application 
of knowledge of the Group, usefulness of feedback and the quality of 
reporting. The Committee was satisﬁed that Deloitte provided an effective 
audit service in 2015/16. A review of the effectiveness of the audit for the 
year ended 31 July 2017 will be conducted.
Auditor independence and objectivity
The Company has policies and procedures in place to ensure that the 
independence and objectivity of the external auditor are not impaired. 
These include restrictions on the types of services which the external 
auditor can provide, in line with the Audit Practices Board Ethical Standards 
on Auditing. Details of the services that the external auditors cannot be 
engaged to perform are provided at www.fergusonplc.com.
Deloitte also provides speciﬁc assurance to the Committee on the 
arrangements and safeguards it has in place to maintain its independence 
and objectivity, including an internal process to preapprove provision 
of non-audit services and the use of separate teams where non-audit 
services are being provided to the Group. The Committee continues to be 
satisﬁed with the independence and objectivity of Deloitte.
When considering the award of non-audit work to the external auditor, 
an assessment is made to consider if it is more effective for the work to 
be carried out by the external auditor who has existing knowledge of 
the Company and all appointments are made on a case-by-case basis. 
The prior consent of the Chairman of the Committee is required before 
the Company’s external auditor is appointed to undertake non-audit work. 
The external auditor will not be appointed to provide non-audit services 
where the Committee considers it might impair their independence or 
objectivity in carrying out the audit. At each meeting the Committee 
reviews any new non-audit engagement of the Company’s external 
auditor and reviews the level of fees for all non-audit work. During the year, 
Deloitte was appointed to undertake non-audit work, the details of which 
are provided below.
Audit and non-audit fees
Fees for non-audit work performed by Deloitte as a percentage of 
audit fees for the year ended 31 July 2017 were 24 per cent (2016: 7 per 
cent). Further disclosure of the non-audit fees incurred during the year 
ended 31 July 2017, can be found in note 4 to the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements on page 95.
Non-audit services related mainly to services provided to T obler as part of 
the merger with Walter Meier AG and services related to the disposal of the 
Nordic businesses and the change of presentational currency for the Group 
in 2017/18. In each instance it was considered to be in the best interests 
of the Group to use Deloitte due to efficiencies gained from their existing 
knowledge of the Company. Their continued objectivity and independence 
was unaffected due to the nature and scale of the work undertaken.
62 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Audit Committee continued
Accountability assure itself that the Company’s systems comply with the requirements 
of the Code. The Committee can conﬁrm that the Company’s systems 
have been in place for the full ﬁnancial year and up to the date on which 
the ﬁnancial statements were approved, that they are effective and that 
they are regularly reviewed by the Committee on behalf of the Board. 
The Committee is of the view that the Company has a well-designed 
system of internal control. These systems can only provide reasonable, 
but no absolute, assurance that risks are managed to an acceptable level.
In relation to the ﬁnancial reporting process, at the business level, line 
management are required to implement base ﬁnancial and other controls 
in line with a clear set of detailed policies relating to ﬁnancial reporting and 
other accounting matters and act in accordance with the Group Code of 
Conduct. At Group level, the Group ﬁnance function oversees through 
setting the policies, requiring a self-certiﬁcation from the businesses 
and a bi-annual assessment of implementation by the businesses. 
At a further level, assurance functions (Internal and External Audits) 
test various aspects of the processes and report to the Committee.
The Chairman of the Committee reports any matters arising from the 
Committee’s review to the Board following each meeting. This update 
covers the way in which the risk management and internal control 
processes are applied and any signiﬁcant failings or weaknesses in, 
or exceptions to, these processes. There were no signiﬁcant failings or 
weaknesses identiﬁed. These processes have been in place throughout 
the year ended 31 July 2017 and have continued to the date of this report.
Further information on the Company’s risk management systems is set out 
in the section on Principal risks and their management on pages 42 to 49.
Whistleblowing and fraud
The Group’s whistleblowing policy, which supports the Group-wide Code 
of Conduct, is monitored by the Committee. A copy of the Group’s Code of 
Conduct is available at www.fergusonplc.com. The Committee received 
reports at each Committee meeting providing details of matters reported 
through the Group’s international conﬁdential telephone reporting lines and 
secure website reporting facility, which are operated on its behalf by an 
independent third party. All matters reported are investigated by the relevant 
operating company and reported to the Committee, together with details 
of any corrective action taken. The Committee also received reports at 
Committee meetings providing details of fraud losses on a half yearly basis.
Fair, balanced and understandable assessment
At the request of the Board, the Committee assessed whether the content 
of the 2016/17 Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable. In order to make this declaration, a formal process is 
followed to ensure the Committee has access to all relevant information 
including a paper from management detailing the approach taken in the 
preparation of the Annual Report and Financial Statements and explaining 
why management believes the Annual Report is, taken as a whole, fair, 
balanced and understandable. The Committee and all Board members 
receive drafts of the Annual Report and Financial Statements in sufficient 
time to allow challenge of the disclosures where necessary. The Committee 
advised the Board it was satisﬁed that, taken as a whole, the 2016/17 Annual 
Report and Accounts is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the necessary information for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy. The Directors’ 
responsibilities statement can be found on page 68.

Internal audit
The scope of activity of internal audit is monitored and reviewed at each 
Committee meeting. An annual plan was agreed by the Committee in 
July 2017 which covers the activities to July 2018. During the year, the 
Head of Internal Audit attended all Committee meetings and provided 
the Committee with a detailed report on internal audit activities which the 
Committee reviewed and discussed in detail. The Committee considered 
the matters raised and the adequacy of management’s response to them, 
including the time taken to resolve any such matters.
In July 2017 , the Committee conducted the annual review of the effectiveness 
of the Group’s Internal Audit function, including its terms of reference, audit 
planning process, general performance and relationship with the external 
auditors. The review identiﬁed opportunities to enhance the resourcing of 
the function through co-sourcing and maintaining the rigour of following 
up the implementation of audit recommendations. Steps have already 
been taken to implement these suggested improvements. The review was 
undertaken using guidance issued by the Chartered Institute of Internal 
Auditors. As part of this review the Committee was satisﬁed that all the 
opportunities for improvement in the function’s operations which had been 
identiﬁed by external consultants in last year’s effectiveness review had been 
implemented. Based on its review the Committee was satisﬁed with the 
effectiveness of the Group’s Internal Audit function.
Risk
Risk management
Risk management reports prepared by the Group Head of Risk and 
Compliance were submitted to the Committee in March and September 
2017. These reports summarise submissions from all areas of the business 
which the Executive Committee and senior management have reviewed. 
Risks relating to material joint ventures and associates are considered as 
part of this process. The six-monthly reports identify the signiﬁcant risks to 
the Group, the controls in place and highlight the tolerance levels that the 
Executive Committee and, ultimately, the Board are prepared to accept. 
The Audit Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the Company’s overall 
risk management framework, including the generic procedures for risk 
identiﬁcation, assessment, mitigation, monitoring and reporting and was 
satisﬁed with their effectiveness.
Viability Statement
The Committee also reviewed management’s work in conducting a robust 
assessment of those risks which would threaten the future performance 
or liquidity of the Company, including its resilience to the threats of 
viability posed by certain of those risks in severe but plausible scenarios. 
This assessment included the stress testing of cash ﬂow projections 
to evaluate the impact of an unlikely, but realistic, worst-case scenario. 
The Company’s Viability Statement can be found on page 43.
Internal controls
During the year, the Committee monitored and reviewed the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal control systems, accounting policies and practices, 
standards of risk management and risk management procedures and 
compliance controls, as well as the Company’s statements on internal 
controls, before they were agreed by the Board for this Annual Report. 
The Group’s internal control systems are designed to manage rather 
than eliminate business risk. Such systems are necessary to safeguard 
shareholders’ investment and the Company’s assets and depend on 
regular evaluation of the extent of the risks to which the Company is 
exposed. The Committee receives regular reports throughout the year, 
including from the Finance Directors of the Group’s major businesses, to

Nominations Committee Chairman
Dear Shareholder 
Board and senior leadership succession planning is of paramount 
importance to Ferguson’s continued success. It continues to be a major 
priority for the Board and is something the Nominations Committee keeps 
under continuous review. As I mentioned in my Chairman’s statement 
on page 13, during the year, we announced three changes to the Board: 
Frank Roach’s retirement and the appointment of Kevin Murphy as our new 
Chief Executive Officer, USA (“CEO, USA”); the appointment of Mike Powell 
as our new Group Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”); and the appointment of 
Nadia Shouraboura as a Non Executive Director.
Recruitment
In accordance with our procedure for selecting and recruiting Directors, 
the Committee identiﬁed the key skills and experience required for the 
new appointments. The Committee retained external search advisers to 
assist in the process of identifying potential candidates for nomination 
to the Board. The Company does not use open advertising to search 
for suitable candidates for Director positions, as we believe that the 
optimal way of recruiting for these positions is to use targeted recruitment 
based on the skills and experience required. Both internal and external 
candidates were considered for Executive Director positions as part of 
a rigorous process involving interviews and assessments.
Executive Director succession
During the year, we undertook a process to identify a successor for the 
role of CFO. The criteria identiﬁed by the Committee for the CFO selection 
process included strategic development abilities, functional capabilities, 
relevant sector and international experience, and the ability to work 
effectively in and to build high performing teams.
Following an extensive recruitment process the Committee agreed 
that Mike Powell was the strongest candidate for the CFO role and 
recommended his appointment to the Board. Mike’s international 
background, ﬁnancial skills, familiarity with the USA and operational 
experience of running multi-site businesses will be important attributes 
as we continue to develop the Ferguson business.
At the same time as announcing Mike’s appointment the Company also 
announced that Dave Keltner, who has served as Interim Group CFO since 
September 2016 would step down from the role at the end of 2016/17 
following an orderly transition. I would like to thank Dave for the invaluable 
support and leadership he has provided whilst standing in as Interim 
Group CFO, allowing the Board ample time to enable a smooth handover 
to a successor of the highest calibre. He has given outstanding service 
to the Group over 23 years and I wish him well in his retirement.
In March 2017, the Company announced the retirement of Frank Roach 
as CEO, USA and the appointment of Kevin Murphy as his successor.
As part of the Committee’s succession planning process for the role 
of CEO, USA external candidates were considered in addition to Kevin 
Murphy, who was then Chief Operating Officer of our USA business. 
The criteria for the selection of a successor to Frank Roach as CEO, USA 
included strategic development and execution capabilities, signiﬁcant 
executive experience in the relevant sector, core functional capabilities 
and a proven organisational leadership ability.
After a careful and thorough review, the Committee agreed that 
Kevin Murphy was the most appropriate successor as CEO, USA and 
recommended his appointment to the Board. Kevin joined the USA 
business in 1999 and held several leadership positions before being 
appointed Chief Operating Officer in 2007. Kevin has played a vital 
part in our USA business’ success, and his skills, expertise and deep 
understanding of the business make him the ideal person to drive future 
growth in the USA. I am delighted that a candidate identiﬁed by the 
Board some time ago as having signiﬁcant potential, and subsequently 
developed by the Company as part of the succession planning process for 
senior leadership positions, has been selected to lead the Group’s largest 
operating segment.
I’d like to take this opportunity to thank Frank Roach for his immense 
contribution to the business and for his distinguished service. Frank has 
been an outstanding Chief Executive of our USA business. Under his 
leadership, the business has developed into the leading specialist 
distribution business in the USA, whilst maintaining an enviable track 
record of delivering superior service to customers and creating signiﬁcant 
shareholder value. I wish Frank well in his retirement.
Non Executive Director appointment
During the Board and Committee effectiveness review process, an 
opportunity was identiﬁed to enhance the skill set of the Board through 
the recruitment of an additional Non Executive Director. The criteria 
identiﬁed by the Committee for the Non Executive Director recruitment 
process included a proven track record as a senior leader of a USA 
business, deep understanding of the evolving digital environment and 
ﬁrst-hand experience of disruptive business models. Following a thorough 
recruitment process the Committee agreed that Nadia Shouraboura was the 
most suitable candidate and recommended her appointment to the Board.
I am delighted to welcome Nadia to the Board. Her considerable expertise 
in running complex logistics and supply chain activities will be invaluable 
to us. E-commerce remains a signiﬁcant opportunity for the Group with 
almost £3 billion of revenue generated from online activities last year and 
growing this channel remains an important part of our strategy. 
External search advisers
External search advisers Russell Reynolds Associates and JCA Group 
assisted the Nominations Committee during the year with the CFO 
recruitment process. Russell Reynolds Associates also assisted the 
Nominations Committee with the CEO, USA succession process. 
Russell Reynolds Associates and JCA Group have no other connections 
to the Company. Korn Ferry, an external search adviser, assisted the 
Nominations Committee with the Non Executive Director recruitment 
process. Korn Ferry has no other connections with the Company except 
in relation to other senior executive search mandates.

Gender diversity Board tenure
Board composition and succession planning
As at 31 July 2017, the Board comprises the Chairman, three Executive 
Directors and seven Non Executive Directors. The biographies of all 
members of the Board, which outline the skills and experience they bring 
to their roles, are set out on pages 52 and 53.
It has been a busy year for the Committee in terms of succession planning 
and during the year, in addition to the three appointments, the Committee 
considered the composition, skills and experience of, and the succession 
plans for, the Group’s senior leaders. Succession for the Board and senior 
executives will continue to be a crucial area of focus of the Committee in the 
coming year and beyond to ensure that, as the Group develops, the business 
has the appropriate mix of skills and experience at Board and senior levels.
Diversity
One of the core values of Ferguson is that we value our people. 
We believe that well trained, highly engaged associates deliver better 
customer service. This is one of the Group’s drivers of proﬁtable growth, 
set out in the CEO’s review on page 17, and there are examples throughout 
the report of what the Company is doing in support of this.
We aim to recruit, retain and develop a high quality, diverse workforce. 
T o achieve our objectives we will always appoint or hire the best candidates 
available from the widest range of knowledge, skills and experience. 
The diversity of our people – whether in terms of gender, race and ethnicity, 
religious or political beliefs, marital status, sexual orientation, age, disability, 
culture, background or any other measure – strengthens our diversity of 
thought, which is vital to the growth and success of our business. We are 
committed to providing our employees with an inclusive work environment 
in which diversity is valued, discrimination in any form is not tolerated, and in 
which all our people feel empowered to reach their full potential. Details of 
our current gender diversity statistics are set out on page 36 and further 
information on diversity is detailed on page 23.
We remain supportive of the voluntary approach as an effective way 
to encourage companies to improve gender diversity in boardrooms. 
For the last four years we have met the gender diversity recommendations 
set out in Lord Davies’ original report, “Women on Boards”, and this year 
36 per cent of your Board are women.

Ferguson takes diversity seriously. We met the gender diversity targets set 
out in Lord Davies’ report well ahead of schedule and the Committee has 
noted the recommendations made by the Hampton-Alexander Review on 
the gender diversity of FTSE 100 Executive Committee members and their 
direct reports as well as the Parker Review Report’s recommendations for 
increasing the ethnic diversity of boards. The Committee has also noted 
the recommendations made by the McGregor-Smith Review of race in the 
workplace and the government’s response to those recommendations.
Ferguson remains absolutely committed to equality in our employment, 
promotion and pay practices and the Committee will continue to 
monitor and review the Company’s progress as it continues to deliver 
improvements in workforce diversity.
Effectiveness
The annual review of the effectiveness of the Committee was carried 
out in July 2017 . The review concluded that the Committee was well run 
and that, overall, Committee members were satisﬁed with the quality 
of the succession planning process for Board and Executive positions. 
The review also highlighted areas for continued improvement and we have 
incorporated these into our priorities for 2017/18 as set out in the table below.

65 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association may be amended by a special 
resolution of the shareholders.
Appointment and removal of Directors
The Board may exercise all powers of the Company, subject to the 
limitations of the law and the Company’s Articles of Association. The Board 
may appoint a person who is willing to act as a Director, either to ﬁll a 
vacancy or as an additional Director. Under the Articles of Association any 
such Director shall hold office only until the next Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”) and shall then be eligible for election. In addition, the Articles 
require that at each AGM at least one-third of the current Directors must 
retire as Directors by rotation. All those Directors who have been in office 
for three years or more since their last appointment shall retire at that AGM. 
Any Director may at any AGM retire from office and stand for re-election. 
However, in accordance with the provisions of the Code, the Board has 
agreed that all continuing Directors will stand for annual election at the 
2017 AGM.
Authority to allot shares
At the 2016 AGM, authority was given to the Directors to allot new 
ordinary shares up to a nominal value of £18,194,582. The Directors 
intend to propose at the 2017 AGM to seek authority to allot and grant 
rights to subscribe for or to convert securities into shares up to an 
aggregate nominal amount representing approximately two-thirds of the 
Company’s issued share capital (excluding Treasury shares), calculated 
at the latest practicable date prior to publication of the Notice of AGM, 
but of that amount only one-third of the Company’s issued share capital 
(excluding Treasury shares), calculated at the latest practicable date prior 
to publication of the Notice of AGM, may be allotted pursuant to a fully 
pre-emptive rights issue (“Allotment Authority”). If approved, the Allotment 
Authority will expire at the conclusion of the 2018 AGM.
Subject to the terms of the authority noted above, the Directors will also 
recommend that they be empowered to allot equity securities for cash 
or to sell or transfer shares out of Treasury other than pro rata to existing 
shareholders, until the 2018 AGM (“Authority to Disapply Pre-Emption”). 
This authority shall be limited to the allotment of equity securities for cash 
up to an aggregate nominal amount of no more than approximately 5 per 
cent of the issued ordinary share capital calculated at the latest practicable 
date prior to publication of the Notice of AGM as well as an additional 5 
per cent, which may only be used for an acquisition or speciﬁed capital 
investment which is announced contemporaneously with the issue or 
which has taken place in the preceding six-month period and is disclosed 
in the announcement of the issue (in accordance with the Pre-Emption 
Group’s Statement of Principles).
Authority to purchase shares
At the 2016 AGM, authority was given to the Directors to purchase up 
to 25,263,165 of the Company’s ordinary shares of 10 53⁄66 pence (with 
such purchase being subject to minimum and maximum price conditions). 
This authority to purchase the Company’s shares will expire at the 
2017 AGM.
In certain circumstances, it may be advantageous for the Company to 
purchase its own ordinary shares and the Company seeks authority on 
an annual basis to renew the Directors’ limited authority to purchase the 
Company’s ordinary shares in the market pursuant to Article 57 of the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. As detailed in the Chairman’s statement 
on page 13, the Company intends to commence a £500 million share 
repurchase programme to be executed over the 12-month period to 
October 2018 (the “Buyback Programme”). It is intended that a special 
resolution will be proposed at the 2017 AGM to grant authority for the 
Company to purchase up to approximately 10 per cent of the Company’s 
issued share capital, calculated at the latest practicable date prior to 
the publication of the Notice of AGM. The special resolution will set 
the minimum and maximum prices which may be paid. The Directors 
intend to use this authority to make share repurchases pursuant to the 
Buyback Programme. The Directors will use this authority only after careful 
consideration, taking into account market conditions, other investment 
opportunities, appropriate gearing levels and the overall ﬁnancial position 
of the Company. The authority will enable the Directors to continue to 
be able to respond promptly should circumstances arise in which they 
consider that such a purchase would result in an increase in earnings per 
share and would be in the best interests of the Company. In accordance 
with the Company’s Articles of Association, the Company is allowed to 
hold shares purchased by it as Treasury shares that may be cancelled, 
sold for cash or used for the purpose of employee share schemes. 
The Allotment Authority and Authority to Disapply Pre-Emption apply 
equally to shares to be held by the Company as Treasury shares and to 
the sale of Treasury shares. The Directors consider it desirable for these 
general authorities to be available to provide ﬂexibility in the management 
of the Company’s capital resources.
Details of shares held by the Company that were acquired in previous 
ﬁnancial years are provided in note 27 to the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements on page 113. 
Capitalised interest
The Group does not have capitalised interest of any signiﬁcance on its 
balance sheet.
Change of control (signiﬁcant agreements)
The Company is not party to any signiﬁcant agreements that take effect, 
alter or terminate upon a change of control following a takeover except for 
the US$800 million USA Private Placement Bonds issued on 1 September 
2015, the £800 million multi-currency revolving credit facility agreement 
dated 3 June 2015, the amended US$600 million receivables facility 
agreement originally entered into on 31 July 2013 and the US$438 million 
USA private placement Bonds issued on 16 November 2005 which could 
become repayable following a relevant change of control. There are 
no agreements between the Company and any Director that would 
provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from 
a change of control following a takeover bid, except that provisions of 
the Company’s share schemes may cause options and awards granted 
under such schemes to vest in those circumstances. All of the Company’s 
share schemes contain provisions relating to a change of control. 
Outstanding options and awards would normally vest and become 
exercisable for a limited period of time upon a change of control following 
a takeover, reconstruction or winding up of the Company (not being 
an internal reorganisation), subject at that time to rules concerning the 
satisfaction of any performance conditions.
Conﬂicts of interest
Processes and procedures are in place which require the Directors to 
identify and declare actual or potential conﬂicts of interest, whether 
matter-speciﬁc or situational. These notiﬁcations are made by a Director 
prior to or at a Board meeting, or in writing. All Directors have a continuing 
duty to update any changes. The Board may authorise potential conﬂicts 
which can be limited in scope, in accordance with the Company’s 
Articles of Association. These authorisations are regularly reviewed.

Employees
The Group actively encourages employee involvement in driving our 
current and future success and places particular importance on keeping 
employees regularly informed about the Group’s activities and ﬁnancial 
performance and on matters affecting them individually and the business 
generally. This can be through informal bulletins, in-house publications and 
brieﬁngs, as well as via the Group’s intranet sites.
A European Works Council (“EWC”) has been operating since 
1996 to provide a forum for informing and consulting employees in 
Europe on such matters as signiﬁcant developments in the Group’s 
operations, management’s plans and organisational changes within 
the Group. There are currently 11 EWC representatives, of which six are 
employee representatives and ﬁve are management representatives. 
Employee representatives are appointed from each European country 
in which Ferguson operates.
All employees are offered a range of beneﬁts depending on their local 
environment. Where possible, they are encouraged to build a stake in the 
Company through the ownership of shares through participation in the 
Company’s all-employee sharesave plans.
Employment policies
Our employment policies aim to attract the very best people and we 
believe that a diverse and inclusive culture is a key factor in being a 
successful business. For more information on this, see pages 23 and 36.
The Group also has policies in place relating to the continuation 
of employment of, and appropriate retraining for, employees who 
become disabled, for giving full and fair consideration to applications 
for employment by disabled persons, having regard to their particular 
attributes and abilities, and for the training, career development and 
promotion of disabled employees.
Indemnities and insurance
The Company indemniﬁes the Directors in respect of liabilities incurred 
as a result of their office in accordance with its Articles of Association and 
to the maximum extent permitted by Jersey law. Qualifying third-party 
indemnity provisions (to the maximum extent permitted by English law) 
were granted to all Directors in office by the then holding company (now 
known as Wolseley Limited) and these remain in force as at the date of this 
report. When Ferguson plc (registered in Jersey) became the new holding 
company, additional third-party indemnity provisions were granted by the 
Company, and it has granted indemnities in accordance with Jersey law to 
all Directors and the Company Secretary appointed since November 2010.
There is appropriate insurance coverage in respect of legal action 
against the Directors and officers. Neither the Company’s indemnities 
nor insurance would provide any coverage to the extent that a Director 
is proved to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.

each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare 
the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent 
company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law), including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure

 – prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
In preparing the Group ﬁnancial statements, International Accounting

Remuneration Committee Chairman
Dear Shareholder 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 July 2017.
The current Remuneration Policy (“Policy”), was approved at the Annual 
General Meeting (AGM) in December 2015 and is due to be resubmitted 
for approval in December 2018. The Committee is satisﬁed that this Policy 
continues to be appropriate for the coming year and as such no changes 
to the Policy are proposed for 2017/18.
Although the Company (being Jersey incorporated) is not subject to the 
Directors’ Remuneration Regulations 2008 (“Regulations”), the Committee 
recognises the importance of shareholder transparency and standards 
of governance. This Directors’ Remuneration Report complies with the 
Regulations as they would apply if we were a UK incorporated company.
On page 71 there is a summary of the current Policy and the full Policy 
can be found on the Who We Are section of the Ferguson plc website at 
www.fergusonplc.com.
In this statement I will share with you the major decisions taken by the 
Committee during the year, corporate performance and incentive 
outcomes for 2016/17 and our approach for 2017/18, which will continue to 
be based on the reward principles we have applied since 2015:
 – to provide remuneration packages that fairly reward Executive Directors 
and senior executives for the contribution they make to the business, 
having regard to the size and complexity of the Group’s business 
operations and the need to attract, retain and motivate executives of the 
highest quality;
 – to have remuneration packages which comprise salary, short-term 
bonuses, long-term incentives, beneﬁts-in-kind and pension provision; 
and
 – to aim to provide a total cash award of base salary and bonus around 
the median of the market, with the opportunity to earn a higher reward 
for sustained superior ﬁnancial and individual performance.
Group Chief Financial Officer succession
As announced on 1 March 2017, Mike Powell was appointed as Group 
Chief Financial Officer (“Group CFO”) with effect from 1 June 2017 in 
succession to John Martin who was appointed as Group Chief Executive 
Officer on 1 September 2016. Mike has extensive international experience 
having worked overseas in a variety of senior ﬁnance positions. 
The Committee made the decision to set his salary on appointment at 
£510,000, below the market median, to enable room for growth as he 
develops into the role. Therefore, it is the Committee’s intention to increase 
his salary by more than the average salary increase for the relevant 
general workforce (subject to his performance in the role) in both August 
2018 and 2019 to move him closer to the market median, consistent with 
our Policy.
The Company compensated Mike for a number of awards he forfeited 
from his previous employer BBA Aviation plc (“BBA”) as a result of joining 
Ferguson; the replacement awards replicated as far as practicable the 
structure, time horizon and fair value of the arrangements he forfeited, and 
are subject to the Company’s standard malus and clawback provisions. 
Further details on these buy-out awards are on pages 78 and 80.
Chief Executive Officer, USA succession
As we also announced in March 2017, Kevin Murphy was appointed as 
Chief Executive Officer, USA (“CEO, USA”) on 1 August 2017, in succession 
to Frank Roach who retired on 31 July 2017. Kevin has been Chief Operating 
Officer of the Group’s USA business for the past 10 years and an integral 
member of the senior leadership team. His appointment on a salary of 
$900,000 is below the market median (and below his predecessor’s salary) 
and as with the Group CFO, provides room to increase his salary by more 
than the average salary increase for the relevant general workforce, subject 
to his performance in the role, in both August 2018 and 2019 to move him 
closer to the market median, consistent with our Policy.
The Committee agreed to exercise its discretion to treat Frank Roach as 
a “good leaver” for his unvested ESOP and LTIP awards, in view of his 
leaving Ferguson through retirement, and he will receive no severance 
payments. His long-term incentive awards will be time pro-rated on the 
basis of full years worked during the relevant performance period for 
each award. Therefore, the awards granted to him in 2015/16 and 2016/17 
will be subject to a reduction of one-third and two-thirds respectively. 
Further details of the termination arrangements are set out on page 78 
of the Annual Report on Remuneration. These are in line with our Policy.
Performance in 2016/17
Company performance for the year ended 31 July 2017 saw strong trading 
performance, particularly in the USA. Canadian performance also improved in 
2016/17 , whilst the UK continues to progress with its transformation programme. 
During the year, the Company announced the merger of its Swiss business 
(Tobler) with Walter Meier AG which took place on 7 April 2017 and plans to 
exit from the Nordic region, as well as the change in name to Ferguson plc.
The continued focus which the Company places on proﬁt growth and 
maintaining strong cash ﬂow has enabled it to increase both the interim 
dividend paid to shareholders in April, which was 10 per cent higher than 
in 2016, and the proposed ﬁnal dividend, which is 10 per cent higher 
at 73.33 pence per share. 
This strong trading performance and good cash ﬂow has resulted in the 
bonus payments to the Executive Directors averaging 93.1 per cent of their 
maximum levels.
In the three years to 31 July 2017, annualised Total Shareholder Return 
(“TSR”) was 16.5 per cent, and as a result the Company achieved a TSR 
ranking of 24th against our FTSE 100 comparator group and therefore 
71.6 per cent of the shares awarded under the 2012 LTIP in 2014 will vest.
The Company’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 
31 July 2017 have been restated to present the Nordic business as 
discontinued operations under IFRS 5. The performance of the Nordic 
business declined over the periods covered by long-term incentive 
awards made in 2014, 2015 and 2016. The Committee therefore decided 
that the EPS calculation used to measure performance under the 
Company’s long-term incentive plans should include the Nordic business 
to more accurately reﬂect management’s performance in relation to all of 
the businesses under its control throughout the relevant period for long-
term incentive awards made in 2014, 2015 and 2016.

69 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Directors’ Remuneration Report Following the Brexit vote on 23 June 2016, foreign exchange rates moved 
rapidly and signiﬁcantly. This has had a signiﬁcant favourable impact on 
EPS growth in the year ended 31 July 2017. Given the scale of movement 
in foreign exchange rates during the ﬁnancial year the Committee has 
also adjusted the EPS calculation used to determine the extent to which 
the Group has met this performance condition downwards to remove any 
beneﬁt to management accruing as a result of factors beyond its control. 
Adjusted headline earnings per share (“EPS”) for the three years ended 
31 July 2017 reﬂected strong trading proﬁt growth, contributing to a 
headline increase in EPS of 38.7 per cent to 270.5 pence. As a result, 
ESOP awards granted in 2014 will vest in full in November 2017. 
Looking ahead to the year ending 31 July 2018
For the ﬁnancial year ending 31 July 2018, the remuneration arrangements 
which were approved in December 2015 will continue to apply. It is intended 
that awards under the 2015 L TIP will be made to Executive Directors during 
2017/18. The weighting of the performance measures for the share awards 
under the 2015 L TIP (TSR, EPS and Operating Cash Flow) will continue to be 
applied in equal proportions of one-third as they were in 2016/17 .
In line with our Policy, the Committee undertook an annual review of the 
Executive Directors’ base salaries. For the Group CFO and CEO, USA, 
as detailed above, their salaries will not be reviewed until 1 August 2018. 
For the Group Chief Executive Officer (“Group CEO”) his salary will be 
increased by 2.0 per cent from 1 August 2017 in line with the general level 
of increase awarded to other employees in the Group.
As a Committee we continue to monitor developments in corporate 
governance and remuneration and, where we consider it appropriate to 
do so, based on the best interests of Ferguson and its shareholders, we 
would propose to adopt them.
As announced on 28 March 2017 and detailed in the Chairman’s statement 
on page 13 the Company changed its presentational currency from sterling 
to US dollars with effect from 1 August 2017. To align with this change, 
the Committee has restated the base years for EPS and the targets for 
operating cash ﬂow for the LTIP awards granted in 2015/16 and 2016/17 
from sterling to US dollars. The revised operating cash ﬂow targets are 
detailed on page 79. The performance targets for all future awards will 
be set, and performance measured, in US dollars. For LTIP awards to be 
granted in 2017/18, targets for real growth in EPS will be set in US dollars 
relative to US CPI, to align with our presentational currency going forward. 
The Committee is satisﬁed that achieving 3-year real growth in EPS of 9 
per cent to 30 per cent is not materially more or less difficult in US dollars 
than sterling, and performance will be less susceptible to foreign exchange 
movements when measured in US dollars due to the high proportion of 
our business transacted in US dollars.
In line with the Remuneration Report Regulations we have commenced 
our review of the Policy, which we will be sharing and discussing with our 
key shareholders over the coming months.
On behalf of the Committee, I thank you for your continued support and 
trust that you ﬁnd the Directors’ Remuneration Report informative. I very 
much hope that we will receive your support at the 2017 AGM and I will 
be available at the meeting to respond to your questions on any aspect 
of this Report.

71 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Information
For the purposes of this Annual Report on Remuneration:
1  any payments made in US dollars have been converted to sterling. 
The calculations are made based on the average exchange rate for the 
year ended 31 July 2017 of $1.2667:£1 (for the year ended 31 July 2016 
of $1.4603:£1); and
2  any estimated share values are determined using a share price of 
4,822 pence, being the average closing mid-market quotation for 
Ferguson plc shares for the three-month period ended 31 July 2017.
Remuneration Policy
The Policy was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 1 December 
2015 and can be found on our website at www.fergusonplc.com. 
The Policy took effect from this date and may operate for up to 
three years.
The Policy remains unchanged and all remuneration and all 
recruitment or loss of office payments are consistent with the Policy. 
For convenience we include Policy Extracts on pages 82 and 83. 
These extracts from the Policy provide the context within which 
individual remuneration decisions have been made during the year.
 Implementation of Policy for the year ending 31 July 2018
Executive Directors
Base salary
In line with the Policy, the Remuneration Committee undertook an 
annual review of the Executive Directors’ base salaries in July 2017. 
The Committee agreed to an increase to the base salary level of the 
Group CEO of 2.0 per cent with effect from 1 August 2017. Therefore, 
the Group CEO’s annualised base salary is £877,200 for the year ending 
31 July 2018 (£860,000 for the year ended 31 July 2017). This is in line with 
the general level of increase awarded to other employees in the Group. 
The Committee agreed that the salaries of the Group CFO and CEO, USA, 
who took up their positions on 1 June 2017 and 1 August 2017 respectively, 
would not be reviewed until 1 August 2018.
On appointment, the Group CFO and CEO, USA’s salaries were set below 
market median and below those of their predecessors. As detailed in 
the Remuneration Committee Chair’s statement on page 69 it is the 
Committee’s intention to increase both the Group CFO and CEO, USA’s 
salaries by more than the average salary increase for the relevant general 
workforce (subject to their performance in the respective roles) in both 
August 2018 and 2019 to bring them into line with the market median. 
This approach is consistent with the Policy.
Pension and beneﬁts
UK-based Executive Directors receive a salary supplement in lieu of 
membership of the Group pension scheme, being 30 per cent of base 
salary for John Martin and 25 per cent for Mike Powell. USA-based 
Executive Director Kevin Murphy participates in the Ferguson deﬁned 
contribution pension arrangement and receives a Company contribution 
of 16 per cent of base salary. Kevin Murphy’s current year pension 
beneﬁts include a 401k plan and Ferguson Executive Retirement Plan 
arrangements. These plans have normal retirement ages of 59 1⁄2 and 55 
respectively. Bonus payments are not included in the calculation of the 
Company pension contributions. Beneﬁts provided to Executive Directors 
are detailed in the Remuneration table on page 76.
Annual bonus
When considering the objectives for the Executive Directors and other 
members of the Executive Committee, the Remuneration Committee 
takes into account whether speciﬁc attention should be given to 
environmental, social and governance matters. Directors take such 
matters into account when considering any investment proposal or 
operational matters and management is expected to meet performance 
targets which include compliance with any environmental, social 
or governance-related standards that have been set. The overall 
performance of the businesses and of management is reviewed at the 
end of the year when considering the award of bonuses and whether 
operational and personal objectives have been met.
The threshold, target and maximum bonus opportunities for each of the 
Executive Directors are set out in the table below:
Threshold Target Maximum
As % of salary
J Martin (Group CEO) 80% 100% 120%
M Powell (Group CFO) 70% 90% 110%
K Murphy (CEO, USA)

80% 100% 120%

1.  Award levels for Kevin Murphy as CEO, USA are lower than the award made to his 
predecessor in 2016/17.
Performance targets are set as 80 per cent of bonus opportunity on 
ﬁnancial performance (20 per cent is based on cash-to-cash days, 30 per 
cent on trading proﬁt and 30 per cent on gross proﬁt) and 20 per cent of 
bonus opportunity on personal strategic objectives. Speciﬁc individual 
objectives were set at the beginning of the 2017/18 ﬁnancial year.
For the 2017/18 ﬁnancial year, the threshold for bonus payments in relation 
to ongoing trading proﬁt will be set at or above the outturn trading proﬁt for 
the 2016/17 ﬁnancial year on a constant currency basis.
The Board considers that the performance targets for 2017/18 are 
commercially sensitive and they are not included for this reason. 
The Committee intends to disclose the targets and performance against 
them in the Annual Report on Remuneration next year depending on 
considerations of commercial sensitivity at that time.

The extent to which the LTIP awards (proposed to be granted during 
2017/18) vest will be dependent on the following performance targets each 
with a weighting of one-third of award opportunity: comparative TSR; EPS 
growth; and OpCF.
Comparative TSR
The TSR element of the award will vest as set out in the table below 
(comprising one-third of the total award opportunity):

period, with no additions or exclusions.
2.  Awards will vest on a straight-line basis between 25 per cent and 100 per cent.
The TSR measure is considered appropriate as it ensures that the interests 
of the Executive Directors are closely aligned with those of the Company’s 
shareholders over the long term and incentivises outperformance of 
the Company relative to its peers. The TSR performance condition 
supports the achievement of proﬁt growth, cash generation, maximising 
shareholder value and relative outperformance of its peer group.
EPS growth
The EPS

 element of the award will vest as set out in the table below

(subject to such adjustments as the Committee deems appropriate to ensure it reﬂects 
underlying business performance). 
2.  Awards will vest on a straight-line basis between 25 per cent and 100 per cent.
As set out in the introduction to this Report on page 70, EPS growth for 
LTIP awards to be granted in 2017/18 will be measured relative to US CPI.
For EPS growth targets, the Committee sets the EPS growth range having 
due regard to the Group’s budget and strategic business plan every year 
as well as market expectations, the Group’s trading environment and the 
consensus of analysts’ forecast trading proﬁt. 
The EPS targets are considered appropriate as they require substantial 
improvement in the Group’s ﬁnancial performance and EPS is a key metric 
used by investors to assess the Group’s performance.
Operating cash ﬂow (“OpCF”)
In line with the Company’s change in presentational currency to US dollars 
OpCF targets for LTIP awards to be made in the year ending 31 July 2018 
have been set in US dollars. 
The OpCF element of the award will vest as set out in the table below

1.  Cash generated from operations (before interest and tax) as presented in the audited 
Group cash ﬂow statement in the Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts (subject to 
such adjustments as the Committee deems appropriate to ensure it reﬂects underlying 
business performance, and speciﬁcally would be adjusted downwards to reﬂect the 
impact on operating cash ﬂow following the expected disposal of the Nordic business).
2.  Awards will vest on a straight-line basis between 25 per cent and 100 per cent.
3.  The cumulative three-year ﬁgure for OpCF as taken from the Company’s Annual Report 
and Accounts translated at the average exchange rate for each applicable year for the last 
three years equals $4.36 billion.
For OpCF generation, the Committee sets the cumulative OpCF target 
having due regard to the Group’s budget and strategic plan every year 
as well as market expectations and the Group’s trading environment.
The OpCF measure is considered appropriate as it encourages long-term 
generation of cash to fund investment and returns to shareholders.
Non Executive Directors and Chairman
The Company’s policy on Non Executive Directors’ remuneration is 
set by the Board with account taken of the time and responsibility 
involved in each role, including where applicable the Chairmanship 
of Board Committees.
A summary of current fees is as follows:
2017/18

73 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Advisers to the Committee
During the year, the Committee received advice and/or services from 
various parties. Details are set out below.
In March 2017, Kepler (a brand of Mercer, which is part of the MMC 
group of companies) was appointed as the Committee’s independent 
remuneration consultant following a competitive tender process led by 
the Chair of the Committee. Kepler is a founding member and signatory 
to the UK Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct which 
governs standards in the areas of transparency, integrity, objectivity, 
conﬁdentiality, competence and due care. Kepler adheres to this Code of 
Conduct. The Committee has established arrangements to ensure that 
the advice received from Kepler is independent of the advice provided to 
the Company. Kepler is appointed by the Committee and its performance 
will be reviewed on an annual basis. The Committee will review the 
performance of, and advice provided by, Kepler in November 2017. 
Kepler also provided remuneration consultancy services to the Company 
during the year. Fees are charged predominantly on a “time spent” basis 
and the total fees paid to Kepler for the advice provided to the Committee 
during the year was £41,400. Fees paid to Kepler for other pay-related 
services to the Company during the year were £28,800. 
From the beginning of the 2016/17 ﬁnancial year until the appointment of 
Kepler in March 2017 , New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon Hewitt 
Limited and part of Aon plc) (“NBS”) was the Committee’s independent 
remuneration consultant. NBS is a member of the Remuneration 
Consultants’ Group and also adheres to the Code of Conduct referred to 
above. Throughout the period the Committee operated arrangements 
to ensure that the advice received from NBS was independent of advice 
provided to the Company. NBS was appointed by the Committee and its 
performance reviewed on an annual basis. The Committee was satisﬁed 
that the advice received was objective and independent. NBS also provided 
remuneration consultancy services to the Company during the year. 
Fees are charged predominantly on a “time spent” basis and the total fees 
paid to NBS for the advice provided to the Committee during the year was 
£31,582. Fees paid to NBS for other pay-related services to the Company 
during the year were £11,500.
Alithos Limited (“Alithos”) provided information to the Committee for the 
testing of the TSR performance conditions for the LTIP awards and also 
provided the TSR performance graphs for the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report. They received total ﬁxed fees of £10,500. Fees were charged as a 
ﬁxed annual rate. Alithos was appointed by the Company for both services 
as it was considered to have the relevant expertise and experience. 
Alithos did not provide any other advice or services during the year and 
so the Committee considers Alithos to be objective and independent.
Freshﬁelds Bruckhaus Deringer LLP (“Freshﬁelds”) provided legal advice 
to the Committee during the year in connection with retirements from and 
appointments to the Board and the Company’s Remuneration Report. 
Fees are charged predominantly on a “time spent” basis and the total 
fees paid to Freshﬁelds for the advice provided to the Committee during 
the year were £42,073. Freshﬁelds was appointed by the Company and 
provided other services to the Company during the year. The Committee 
is satisﬁed that the services provided to it by Freshﬁelds are of a technical 
nature and did not create any conﬂict of interest and therefore the advice 
received from them was objective and independent. If a conﬂict of interest 
were to arise, the Committee would appoint separate legal advisers from 
those used by the Company.
The Committee also seeks internal support from the Group HR Director 
and the Group Chief Executive together with other senior Group 
employees as necessary. Those who attend by invitation do not participate 
in discussions that relate to the details of their own remuneration.

2.  Mike Powell was appointed as Group Chief Financial Officer on 1 June 2017. 
During 2016/17, Mr Powell received two months’ salary, taxable beneﬁts, pension beneﬁts

3.  Ian Meakins retired as Group Chief Executive on 31 August 2016. During 2016/17, Mr 
Meakins received one month’s salary, taxable beneﬁts and pension beneﬁts. The majority 
of Mr Meakins taxable beneﬁts for the period related to tax gross up arrangements. 
Mr Meakins did not receive an annual bonus payment in 2016/17. The value of Mr Meakins 
LTI award vesting in November 2017 is pro-rated on the basis of full ﬁnancial years served 
during the relevant performance condition testing period for each award as described in 
the section detailing the Committee’s exercise of discretion on page 66 of the Company’s 
2016 Annual Report. The value of LTI vesting chart, opposite, reﬂects this pro-ration.
4.  These are pre-tax ﬁgures. Beneﬁts comprise private health insurance, car beneﬁt 
(car allowance, car, driver), tax and ﬁnancial advice and tax gross up arrangements. 
The majority of Frank Roach’s beneﬁts relate to medical insurance and a car allowance.
5.  The ESOP and LTIP grants were made in November 2014. The ESOP awards will vest at 
100 per cent in November 2017 and the LTIP awards will vest at 71.6 per cent in November 
2017. See page 78 for further information on the treatment of Frank Roach’s LTI awards. 
6.  The ﬁgure for total remuneration includes share price appreciation for the value of LTI 
vesting and the value of dividend equivalents on vested LTIP awards. As the ESOP and 
LTIP grants made in November 2014 will not vest until November 2017, the values of 
long-term incentive awards vesting in the graph opposite include share price appreciation 
determined using the share price of 4,822 pence noted on page 72 under the heading

2.  John Martin’s personal objectives were based on growth in the USA business, the UK strategy review and the Nordic strategy review and implementation plan. 
3.  Mike Powell was appointed Group Chief Financial Officer on 1 June 2017 and received two months’ annual bonus for the year ended 31 July 2017. 
4.  Mike Powell’s personal objectives were based on the year-end audit clearance meetings, 2017/18 budget reviews and the completion of his induction programme.
5.  Frank Roach’s personal objectives were based on improvements in the USA customer service measures and development of the USA CMRO business against agreed targets.
6.  The speciﬁc targets set for personal objectives are considered to be commercially sensitive as they relate to internal operational and strategic measures which could be used by 
competitors to gain an advantage if disclosed. The Committee will consider disclosing the information if these sensitivities fall away in future periods. 
Following a review, the Committee considers that Executive Directors’ personal objectives for 2015/16 are no longer commercially sensitive and has 
approved their disclosure. 
Ian Meakins’ objectives were to: (a) accelerate proﬁtable top line growth and market share gains with speciﬁc focus on: improving customer service levels; 
implementing differentiated customer propositions; and improving execution by the sales force; and (b) deliver strategic and budget plans for increases 
in e-commerce revenues in Canada, DT Group and the UK business, and for USA operational expenditure growth to be lower than budget. Mr Meakins 
achieved an overall score of 14⁄20. 
John Martin’s objectives were to: (a) complete the development of Group ﬁnance systems; (b) implement Hyperion Financial Management at Group level; 
and (c) deliver strategic and budget plans in Canada for: an increase in e-commerce revenues; improvements in sales management against quarterly 
non-ﬁnancial milestones; and meeting quarterly milestones for the implementation of a new reporting system and opening a new distribution centre. 
Mr Martin achieved an overall score of 14⁄20. 
Frank Roach’s objectives were to: (a) improve proﬁtable top line growth and market share gains in the USA business with speciﬁc focus on: improving 
customer service levels; implementing differentiated customer propositions; and improving execution by the sales force; and (b) deliver strategic and 
budget plans for: the completion of the Business Model Improvement programme in the USA; USA operational expenditure growth to be lower than 
budget; and quarterly e-commerce, customer and operational targets. Mr Roach achieved an overall score of 14⁄20. 
The Committee also approved the disclosure of the 2014/15 objectives on the Company’s website at www.fergusonplc.com. 
Strategic report Governance Financials Other information
77 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Long-term incentives
Long-term incentives awarded to Executive Directors under the ESOP 
and LTIP in November 2014 will vest in November 2017. The vesting of 
both awards is subject to the performance conditions shown in the tables 
that follow. 
The Committee decided to adjust the EPS measure used to calculate the 
level of awards made under the ESOP and 2012 LTIP that are due to vest 
in 2017/18 to neutralise the effect of currency movements during 2016/17 
that would have rewarded management for factors beyond its control and 
to include the results of the Nordic business, the performance of which 
declined over the performance period. This adjustment is explained in 
more detail in the Committee Chair’s statement on pages 69 and 70.
Executive Director changes
Frank Roach
Under the rules of the ESOP , 2012 LTIP and 2015 LTIP , when an employee 
ceases to be employed by the Group unvested awards will lapse unless 
the participant is treated as a “good leaver”. In the case of retirement, 
the Remuneration Committee has the discretion under the rules to treat 
a participant as a “good leaver” by determining that the employee left 
“for any other reason at the discretion of the Committee”.
For “good leavers”, the rules provide that awards will vest on the original 
vesting date, subject to satisfaction of performance conditions, and 
will be pro-rated to the date of cessation of employment. Although the 
performance conditions for the awards are measured from 1 August 
in the year in which awards were granted, pro-ration under the rules 
is calculated using the three-year period commencing on the date 
of grant. The Remuneration Committee has discretion to base any 
pro-ration for a “good leaver” to reﬂect completed ﬁnancial years 
during a performance period.
Frank Roach retired as Chief Executive, USA on 31 July 2017. In light 
of Mr Roach’s outstanding contribution to the Company’s success, 
the Remuneration Committee agreed to exercise its discretion:
 – to treat him as a “good leaver” for his unvested awards granted under 
the ESOP , 2012 LTIP and 2015 LTIP;
 – to allow awards to vest on the original vesting dates (subject to 
satisfaction of the performance conditions); and
 – to time pro-rate his awards granted in 2014/15, 2015/16 and 2016/17 on 
the basis of full ﬁnancial years worked by Mr Roach during the relevant 
performance period for each award. Therefore, the 2014/15 award 
will vest in full and the 2015/16 and 2016/17 awards will be subject 
to a reduction of one-third and two-thirds respectively.
Mike Powell
Mike Powell joined the Company as Group Chief Financial Officer on 
1 June 2017. As a result of joining Ferguson, Mr Powell forfeited awards 
he held under the BBA Deferred Share Plan and the BBA LTIP . Due to 
these unusual circumstances and in line with the approved Remuneration 
Policy, the Committee agreed it was appropriate to broadly replicate the 
structure and fair value of unvested long-term incentive awards forfeited 
by Mr Powell as a result of joining Ferguson and approved the grant of 
three Restricted Share Buy Out Awards (RSBO) to replace awards forfeited 
under the BBA Deferred Share Plan and one Performance Based Buy Out 
Award (PBBO) to replace awards forfeited under the BBA LTIP . Mr Powell 
ﬁrst became eligible to participate in these arrangements on 1 June 2017. 
The RSBO and PBBO awards were granted to Mr Powell on 21 June 
2017. The RSBO awards were granted as conditional share awards. 
No consideration is payable on grant or on vesting of these awards.
These awards are not subject to performance conditions and will vest 
subject to continued employment. The PBBO award was granted as a 
conditional share award. The PBBO award will only vest if certain Company 
corporate performance conditions are satisﬁed. These performance 
conditions are measured over a three-year period and are the same as 
those applied to awards granted to Executive Directors on 1 November 
2016 under the 2015 LTIP . The PBBO award will normally vest subject to 
continued employment and the satisfaction of the performance conditions.
Further details of the RSBO and PBBO awards granted to Mr Powell on 
21 June 2017, including the performance conditions applicable, are set out 
under the Scheme interests awarded during the ﬁnancial year heading on 
page 80. The number of shares awarded for each of the RSBO and PBBO 
awards detailed in the table under that heading are the maximum awards 
under the RSBO and PBBO. 
ESOP
Vested awards
The ESOP awards granted on 7 November 2014 are the last such awards 
to have been granted by the Company. Vesting of awards under the ESOP 
are subject to performance targets based on growth in the Company’s 
headline EPS above UK RPI over a three-year period. The ESOP plan 
rules set out the EPS performance conditions that apply to awards and 
are shown in the table below. The Committee has discretion to set more 
challenging EPS targets than those contained in the ESOP plan rules.

(173.2 pence prior to adjustment), this represents growth of 38.7 per cent. 
Over the same three-year period, RPI growth was 6.6 per cent. The growth 
above RPI in the period was therefore 32.1 per cent and accordingly all

1.  All Directors have a ﬁve-year time period from the date of appointment or promotion to meet the shareholding target. If not met within that timeframe the individual Director would discuss 
plans with the Committee to ensure that the target is met over an acceptable timeframe. Under the Policy, Executive Directors would defer amounts in excess of target bonus into shares 
under the Deferred Bonus Plan. Beneﬁcially owned shares count towards the guideline whilst unvested awards of shares or share options do not. Vested share awards do not count 
towards the guideline until exercised.
2.  All Directors met their shareholding guideline targets set for 2016/17. Shareholding guideline targets for Mike Powell, Kevin Murphy and Nadia Shouraboura were set on 1 August 2017 and 
as such they had no targets to meet as at the end of the 2016/17 ﬁnancial year. Shareholding guideline targets are ﬁrst set by reference to the salary or fees of a Director as at 1 August in the 
ﬁnancial year following appointment to the Board and calculated using the average share price for the two months ended 31 July of the ﬁnancial year in which the appointment was made 
and are re-tested annually until met. Once met, the target is only increased annually in line with base salary or fee increases, if any. 
3. There were no vested (unexercised) awards under the Sharesave. There was an award under the ESOP held by Frank Roach who had 38,014 conditional shares vested but unexercised.
4. Details of share awards exercised in the year are detailed in the Share awards exercised during the year table at the bottom of page 79.
5.  LTIP, ESOP and PBBO awards are subject to performance conditions but RSBO and Sharesave awards are not. LTIP awards are awarded in the form of nil cost options to John Martin and 
in the form of conditional share awards to Frank Roach. PBBO and RSBO awards were awarded to Mike Powell in the form of conditional share awards. Further details of the performance 
conditions which apply to the LTIP and PBBO awards are set out on pages 78 and 79.
Scheme interests awarded during the ﬁnancial year (Audited)
Awards under the 2015 LTIP were made on 1 November 2016. Awards are based on a percentage of salary determined by the Committee. 
The Committee considers annually the size of each grant, determined by individual performance, the ability of each individual to contribute to the 
achievement of the performance conditions, and market levels of remuneration. The maximum vesting is 100 per cent of the award granted. Details of 
performance conditions for awards which were granted during the year are set out on pages 78 and 79. Further information on the buy-out awards 
granted to Mike Powell is provided on page 78.

1.  John Martin and Frank Roach’s awards during the ﬁnancial year were based on a percentage of salary as follows: John Martin (300 per cent); and Frank Roach (275 per cent). Following his 
appointment as Group Chief Financial Officer on 1 June 2017 buy out awards were granted to Mike Powell that broadly replicate the structure and fair value of unvested long-term incentive 
awards forfeited by Mr Powell as a result of joining Ferguson. 
2.  The share price used to calculate the face value of the LTIP share awards granted on 1 November 2016 was 4,383 pence which was the average share price over a 10-dealing day period 
immediately preceding the date of grant. The LTIP award made to John Martin was in the form of nil cost options. At vesting, the exercise price per share will be nil. The LTIP award made to 
Frank Roach was a conditional share award and there is no exercise price. The share price used to calculate the face value of the PBBO and RSBO share awards granted on 21 June 2017 was 
4,944.6 pence which was the average share price over a ﬁve-dealing day period preceding 28 February 2017. The PBBO and RSBO awards made to Mike Powell were conditional share awards 
and there is no exercise price. Face value is calculated as required by the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (“Regulations”) as the 
maximum number of shares at full vesting multiplied by either the share price at date of grant or the average share price used to determine the number of shares awarded. Dividend equivalents 
also accrue on the LTIP and PBBO awards and the amount which may be due to an Executive Director is not included in the calculation of face value.
3.  The maximum dilution which may arise through issue of shares to satisfy the entitlement to these LTIP, PBBO and RSBO scheme interests would be 0.00057 per cent calculated as 
at 31 July 2017.

compared to that of Ferguson employees 
The table below shows the percentage year-on-year change in base

and the previous ﬁnancial year for the Group Chief Executive compared  
to the average for UK-based employees1.

Average for all UK-based employees +3.5% +9.7% +140.8%
1.  Although the Group Chief Executive has a global role and responsibilities, UK-based 
employees were chosen as a suitable comparator group as he is based in the UK 
(except to attend Board and Committee meetings in Switzerland or other worldwide 
locations outside of the UK). Also pay structures and changes to pay vary widely across 
the Group, depending on the local market conditions.
2.  The Group Chief Executive’s bonus is determined by both his performance and the 
performance of the whole of the Ferguson Group, whereas employees’ bonuses are 
based on their performance and the performance of the businesses in the countries in 
which they work. The percentage change in annual bonus for UK-based employees is 
based on the best available estimates at time of publication.
3.  During the year ended 31 July 2017, John Martin replaced Ian Meakins as Group CEO on 
1 September 2016. Changes in Group Chief Executive pay have been calculated using the 
sum of Mr Meakins and Mr Martin’s salary, beneﬁts and bonus for their respective one and 
11 months of service as Group CEO during 2016/17. Mr Meakins did not receive an annual 
bonus for the year ended 31 July 2017. 
4.  The change in beneﬁts for the Group Chief Executive, includes a tax gross up payment 
made to Ian Meakins in August that relates to the previous tax year and a tax gross 
up payment made to John Martin in September that relates to the previous tax year. 
The change in beneﬁts without this duplication would have been 9.0 per cent.
Payments for loss of office and to past Directors 
(Audited)
No payments for loss of office were made during the ﬁnancial year. 
Ian Meakins served as Group Chief Executive Officer for one month 
during the year until his retirement on 31 August 2016. Payments made to 
Mr Meakins are set out in the Remuneration table on page 76. Additionally, 
detail on ESOP and LTIP awards granted to Mr Meakins that vested during 
the year are disclosed on pages 78 and 79. No other payments have 
been made to past Directors that have not already been included in the 
Remuneration table.

exemption permitted within the Listing Rules.
Policy on loss of office
All Directors
In the event of termination of a service contract or letter of appointment 
of a Director, contractual obligations will be honoured in accordance with 
the service contract and terms of incentive plans or letter of appointment. 
The Committee will take into consideration the circumstances and reasons 
for departure, health, length of service, performance and the duty (where 
applicable) for Directors to mitigate their own loss. Under this Policy the 
Committee may make any statutory payments it is required to make and/
or settle claims brought against the Company in relation to a termination. 
In addition, the Committee may agree to payment of outplacement 
counselling costs and disbursements (such as legal costs) if considered 
to be appropriate and dependent on the circumstances of departure.
It is the Company’s policy for the period of notice from the Company to 
the Executive Directors not to exceed 12 months and for Non Executive 
Directors to the Company not to exceed six months.
There are no pre-determined contractual provisions for Directors regarding 
compensation in the event of loss of office except those listed in the 
table below: 
Details of 
provision Executive Directors
Chairman and Non 
Executive Directors
Notice  
period
 – 12 months’ notice from  
the Company.
 – Six months’ notice from  
the Executive.
Six months’ notice 
by either party.
Termination 
payment
The Company may terminate 
an Executive Director’s service 
contract by making a payment 
in lieu of notice equal to:
 – 12 months’ base salary and 
beneﬁts; and
 – 12 months’ pension contributions 
or cash pension supplement.
Fees and expenses 
accrued up to the 
termination date only.
The Company would seek to 
ensure that any termination 
payment is mitigated in the event 
that the Executive Director starts 
alternative employment within 
the notice period.
In the case of the UK-based Executive 
Directors, the Company may pay a 
lump sum in respect of six months and 
the remaining six months in monthly 
instalments subject to reductions if 
the Executive Director commences 
alternative employment with a base 
salary/fee of at least £20,000.
No payment will be made to 
Executive Directors in the event 
of gross misconduct.
Post-
termination 
covenants
Non-compete and non-solicitation 
covenants apply for a period 
of 12 months after the termination date.
Not applicable.
The policy on loss of office and contractual provisions above would be 
applied to any new Director’s service contract or letter of appointment.
Policy extracts
Ferguson’s Remuneration Policy remains unchanged from that approved 
by shareholders at the AGM on 1 December 2015. For convenience, 
some extracts from the Policy are included below to provide the context 
within which individual remuneration decisions have been made during 
the year. The full Policy can be found on the Ferguson plc website at 
www.fergusonplc.com.
In these extracts, the following deﬁnitions apply:
DBP   Deferred Bonus Plan 
OSP   Ordinary Share Plan
Recruitment policy
Executive Directors
As noted earlier, the Committee will consider the need to attract the best 
talent whilst aiming to pay no more than is appropriate or necessary in 
the circumstances. In determining each element of pay and the package 
as a whole upon recruitment, the Committee will take into account all 
relevant factors including, but not limited to, the skills and experience of 
the individual, the market rate for an individual of that experience, as well 
as the importance of securing the best person for the role.
Fixed pay (base salary, beneﬁts, pension)
A newly appointed Executive Director will be offered a base salary, 
beneﬁts and pension package in line with the Policy. The Committee 
retains the ﬂexibility to review and decide on a case-by-case basis 
whether it is appropriate to award increases to allow a newly appointed 
Executive Director whose base salary has been set below the mid-market 
level to progress quickly to or around that mid-market level once expertise 
and performance has been proven. This decision would take into account 
all relevant factors noted above.
Variable pay (annual bonus and long-term incentive awards)
A newly appointed Executive Director will be offered an annual bonus 
and long-term incentives in line with the Policy. The maximum level of 
variable remuneration (annual bonus and 2015 LTIP awards) which may 
be awarded to new Executive Directors is limited to 500 per cent of base 
salary excluding any buy out awards, the policy for which is set out below. 
The Committee retains the ﬂexibility to vary the weighting between annual 
bonus and 2015 LTIP up to the approved Policy maxima.
Depending on the timing of the appointment, the Committee may 
set different annual bonus performance criteria for the ﬁrst year of 
appointment. Where an appointment is an internal promotion, any 
variable pay element awarded in respect of the individual’s previous 
role would continue on the original grant terms. In addition, any other 
ongoing remuneration (including pension) obligations existing prior to 
the appointment would be able to continue.
One-off “buy out” cash or share award
Where an Executive Director is appointed from outside the Group, the 
Committee may make a one-off award to the new Executive Director to 
“buy out” incentives and other remuneration opportunities forfeited on 
leaving his or her previous employer. The Committee retains the ﬂexibility 
to make such additional payments in the form of cash and/or shares.
When making such an award, the Committee will, as far as practicable, 
replicate the structure of the arrangements being forfeited and in doing so 
will take into account relevant factors including the delivery mechanism, 
time horizons, attributed expected value and performance conditions of 
the forfeited award. The Committee will endeavour not to pay more than 
the value of the forfeited award.
82 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued 
Remuneration Discretion, ﬂexibility and judgement of the Committee
The Committee operates the annual bonus plan, DBP , LTI plans and all-
employee plans, according to their respective rules and in accordance with 
tax authorities’ rules where relevant. To ensure the efficient administration 
of those plans, the Committee may apply certain operational discretions. 
These include the following:
 – selecting the participants in the plans on an annual basis;
 – determining the timing of grants of awards and/or payment;
 – determining the quantum of awards and/or payments (within the limits 
set out in the Policy table above);
 – determining the extent of vesting based on the assessment 
of performance;
 – making the appropriate adjustments required in certain circumstances 
(e.g. change of control, changes to accounting rules, rights issues, 
corporate restructuring events, and special dividends);
 – determining “good leaver” status for the purposes of the LTI plans and 
applying the appropriate treatment; and
 – undertaking the annual review of performance measures and weighting 
between them (within the limits set out in the Policy table), and setting 
targets for the annual bonus plan and LTI plans from year to year.
If an event occurs which results in the performance conditions and/or 
targets of the annual bonus plan or LTI plans being deemed no longer 
appropriate (e.g. a material acquisition or divestment), the Committee will 
have the ability to adjust appropriately the measures and/or targets and 
alter weightings, provided that the revised conditions or targets are not 
materially less difficult to satisfy. The use of the discretions referred to in 
the Future policy table and above will be explained as appropriate in the 
Annual report on remuneration and may, as appropriate, be the subject 
of consultation with major shareholders.
Executive Directors
On loss of office, there is no automatic entitlement to a bonus. 
Executive Directors may receive a bonus in respect of the year of 
cessation of employment based on, and subject to, performance 
conditions and pro-rated to reﬂect the actual period of service in the 
year of cessation (except pro-ration may not be applied in exceptional 
circumstances such as death in service or ill health). The Committee 
will take into account the reason for the Executive Director’s departure 
and any other relevant factors when considering a bonus payment 
of a departing Executive Director.
The treatment of leavers under the 2012 LTIP and 2012 ESOP plans 
as approved under the 2014 Remuneration Policy and the 2015 LTIP 
(together the “LTI plans”), together with awards under all-employee plans 
and, if applicable the DBP , would be determined by the relevant leaver 
provisions in accordance with the plan rules.
Under the LTI plans, any unvested awards will lapse at cessation unless 
the individual has “good leaver” status (namely for reasons of death, 
redundancy, injury, disability, ill-health, employing business or company 
sold out of the Group and any other reason at the discretion of the 
Committee). The Committee retains the discretion to determine when the 
awards should vest and performance conditions be tested, for example, 
at the date of cessation or at the usual vesting date. In the event of a 
change of control or takeover, all long-term incentive awards will vest 
subject to performance conditions being met. In relation to the LTI plans, 
awards would generally be pro-rated to reﬂect the period of service of the 
Executive Director; although, if the Committee considers it appropriate, 
the Committee has the discretion set out in the plan rules not to pro-rate.
Under the all-employee plans, any unvested awards will lapse at cessation 
unless the individual has a “good leaver” status – for UK Executive 
Directors this will be speciﬁcally as prescribed by HMRC in the SAYE 
appendix of the relevant plan rules and for Executive Directors in other 
jurisdictions as set out in the relevant section of the applicable plan rules.
Under the DBP , any unvested awards will be forfeited if an Executive 
Director ceases to be an employee of the Group by reason of misconduct 
or if the Company becomes aware, after termination, of facts or 
circumstances which would have entitled it to dismiss the Executive 
Director for misconduct. If an Executive Director ceases to be an employee 
for any other reason, an award shall vest in full at the end of the deferral 
period unless the reason for cessation is death or other circumstances 
which the Committee considers sufficiently exceptional, the award shall

83 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Dilution
Awards under the LTI plans and all-employee plans may be met by the 
issue of new shares when options are exercised, by the use of Treasury 
Shares or by market purchase. Awards under the OSP are met by market 
purchase of shares or from the Trusts. The Company monitors the number 
of shares issued under the Plans and any impact on dilution limits.
Compared to the limits set by the Investment Association in respect of new 
share issues to satisfy options granted for all share plans (10 per cent in any 
rolling 10-year period) and executive share plans (5 per cent in any rolling 
10-year period) as at 31 July 2017 the Company’s headroom was 5.02 per 
cent and 1.94 per cent respectively.

Chair of the Remuneration Committee
2 October 2017
This Report, approved by the Board, has been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Conduct Authority and the Remuneration Reporting 
Regulations. Furthermore, the Board has also applied the principles 
of good governance relating to Directors’ remuneration contained

The Remuneration Committee conﬁrms that throughout the ﬁnancial 
year the Company has complied with these governance rules and best 
practice provisions. 
Further information
External Directorships
Executive Directors are permitted to take on external Non Executive 
Directorships. In order to avoid any conﬂicts of interest, all such 
appointments are subject to the approval of the Nominations Committee. 
The Nominations Committee believes that taking up an external non 
executive appointment helps bring a wider perspective to the Company 
and also assists in the development of business skills and experience.
During the year, and until his retirement as Group CEO on 31 August 
2016, Ian Meakins was a Non Executive Director and Senior Independent 
Director of Centrica plc and received an annualised fee of £92,500 for 
his services (2015/16: £89,375). During the year, and until his retirement 
as Group CEO on 31 August 2016, Mr Meakins also served as a Non 
Executive Director of Rexel SA. The annualised fee for his service was 
set at €40,000 per annum (2015/16: €40,000). The Company allowed 
Mr Meakins to retain the fees paid to him during the year.
During the year, and from the date of appointment as Group CFO of 
Ferguson plc on 1 June 2017, Mike Powell was a Non Executive Director 
and Audit Committee Chairman of Low & Bonar plc and received an 
annualised fee of £47,000 per annum for his services. The Company 
allowed Mr Powell to retain the fees paid to him during the year.
Detail of Employee Beneﬁt Trusts
The Ferguson plc 2011 Employee Beneﬁt Trust (“ Jersey Trust”) and 
Ferguson plc US Trust (“US Trust”) (together, “the Trusts”) were established 
in connection with the obligation to satisfy historical and future share 
awards under the LTI plans and OSP and any other employee incentive 
schemes (“Share Awards”).
The trustees of each of the Trusts have waived their rights to receive 
dividends on any shares held by them. As at 31 July 2017, the Jersey Trust 
held 379,154 ordinary shares of 1053⁄66 pence and £1,942 in cash; and the 
US Trust held 1,056,001 ordinary shares of 1053⁄66 pence. The number of 
shares held by the Trusts represented 0.54 per cent of the Company’s 
issued share capital at 31 July 2017.
On 7 November 2016, shares were purchased by the US Trust to 
ensure that it continues to have sufficient shares to satisfy share awards. 
The US Trust purchased 142,000 ordinary shares of 1053⁄66 pence and 
paid £5.96 million. The Company provided funds to the US Trust to enable 
it to make the purchase. The number of shares purchased represented 
0.05 per cent of the Company’s issued share capital at that date.
Detail of all-employee sharesave plans
The Company operates two all-employee sharesave plans which 
Executive Directors can participate in. In the USA and Canada, the 
Employee Share Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) operates as a one-year savings 
contract plan. In all other business units, employees may participate in 
the International Sharesave Plan (“ISP”) saving for a period of three or 
ﬁve years.

Group cash ﬂow statement
Year ended 31 July 2017 1 –  Accounting policies and critical estimates and judgements
Basis of preparation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the 
European Union, including interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and its committees.
Ferguson plc is a public company limited by shares incorporated in Jersey under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and is headquartered in Switzerland.
The Company changed its name from Wolseley plc to Ferguson plc on 31 July 2017. 
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis (see page 41) and under the historical cost convention as modiﬁed 
by the revaluation of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities held for trading.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are presented in sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group. The Group’s presentational currency 
will change from sterling to US dollars from 1 August 2017.
The Nordic businesses have been reclassiﬁed as discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5 “Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations” and the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and affected notes for the year ended 31 July 2016 have been restated to reﬂect this.
Accounting developments and changes
At the time of this report a number of accounting standards have been published, but not yet applied.
IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” and IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” are effective for the Group from the year ending 31 July 2019.
The Group has completed an initial assessment of the impact of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 and it is expected adoption will not have a material impact on the 
Group’s consolidated ﬁnancial results.
IFRS 16 “Leases”, which is yet to be endorsed by the EU, is effective for the Group for the year ending 31 July 2020. IFRS 16 represents a signiﬁcant 
change for the treatment of leases in the lessee’s ﬁnancial results. Lessees will be required to apply a single model to recognise a lease liability and asset 
for all leases, including those classiﬁed as operating leases under current accounting standards (note 34), unless the underlying asset has a low value or 
the lease term is 12 months or less. 
On adoption of IFRS 16 there will be a signiﬁcant change to the ﬁnancial statements, as each lease will give rise to a right of use asset, which will be 
depreciated on a straight-line basis, and a lease liability, with the related interest charge. This will replace existing lease balances on the balance sheet 
and charges to the income statement.
The Group continues to assess the full impact of IFRS 16, however the impact will depend on the transition approach and the contracts in effect at the 
time of adoption. It is therefore not yet practicable to provide a reliable estimate of the ﬁnancial impact on the Group’s consolidated ﬁnancial results.
Choices permitted by IFRS
The Group has elected to apply hedge accounting to some of its ﬁnancial instruments.
Accounting policies
Note 37 details the principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Critical accounting judgements 
Exceptional Items
Note 2 provides a deﬁnition of exceptional items. The classiﬁcation of exceptional items requires signiﬁcant management judgement to determine the 
nature and intentions of a transaction. Note 5 provides further details on current year exceptional items.
Pensions and other post-retirement beneﬁts
The Group operates deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans in the UK and in a number of overseas locations that are accounted for using methods that rely on 
actuarial assumptions to estimate costs and liabilities for inclusion in the ﬁnancial statements. The Group takes advice from independent actuaries relating 
to the appropriateness of the assumptions. 
The cost of providing beneﬁts is determined annually using the Projected Unit Credit Method, which includes actuarial assumptions for discount rates, 
expected salary and pension increases, inﬂation and life expectancy and are disclosed in note 26. The discount rate used is the yield at the valuation 
date on high quality corporate bonds that have a maturity approximating to the terms of the pension obligations. Signiﬁcant judgement is required when 
setting the criteria from which the yield curve is derived. 
Sources of estimation uncertainty
In applying the Group’s accounting policies, various transactions and balances are valued using estimates or assumptions. Should these estimates or 
assumptions prove incorrect there may be an impact on the following year’s ﬁnancial statements. The Group believes that the estimates and assumptions 
that have been applied would not give rise to a material impact within the next ﬁnancial year.
90 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
Year ended 31 July 2017 2 – Alternative performance measures
The Group uses alternative performance measures (“APMs”), which are not deﬁned or speciﬁed under IFRS. The Group believes that these APMs, which 
are not considered to be a substitute for IFRS measures, provide additional helpful information. APMs are consistent with how business performance is 
planned, reported and assessed internally by management and the Board and provide comparable information across the Group.
The Group reports some ﬁnancial measures net of businesses or branches that have been disposed of, closed or classiﬁed as held for sale and uses the 
following terminology:
Non-ongoing operations: businesses and groups of branches, which do not meet the criteria to be classiﬁed as discontinued operations under IFRS 5 
“Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations”, which have been disposed of, closed or classiﬁed as held for sale. In 2017, the Group’s 
Swiss business, Tobler, and a small Industrial business in the USA, Endries, have been classiﬁed as non-ongoing.
Ongoing operations: continuing operations excluding non-ongoing operations.
A reconciliation between ongoing and continuing operations is shown below.

The Group measures some ﬁnancial metrics on both a reported basis and at constant exchange rates. The constant exchange rate basis re-translates the 
prior year at the current year exchange rate to eliminate the effect of exchange rate ﬂuctuations when comparing information year-on-year.

Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those which are considered signiﬁcant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence. These items are presented as exceptional within 
their relevant income statement category to assist in the understanding of the trading and ﬁnancial results of the Group as these types of cost do not form 
part of the underlying business.
Examples of items that are considered by the Directors for designation as exceptional items include, but are not limited to: 
 – material restructuring costs within a segment incurred as part of a signiﬁcant change in strategy or due to the closure of a large part of a business and 
are not expected to be repeated on a regular basis.
 – signiﬁcant costs incurred as part of the integration of an acquired business and which are considered to be material. 
 – gains or losses on disposals of businesses are considered to be exceptional in nature as they do not reﬂect the performance of the trading business.
 – costs or credits arising as a result of material regulatory and litigation matters.
If provisions have been made for exceptional items in previous years, then any reversal of these provisions is treated as exceptional.
Exceptional items for the current and prior year are disclosed in note 5.

Gross margin
The ratio of gross proﬁt, excluding exceptional items, to revenue. This is presented for both ongoing operations and continuing operations. Gross margin 
is used by management for assessing business unit performance and it is a key performance indicator for the Group (see page 26).
Trading proﬁt
Trading proﬁt is deﬁned as operating proﬁt before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets. Trading proﬁt is 
used as a performance measure because it excludes costs and other items that do not form part of the underlying trading business.

Ongoing effective tax rate
The ongoing effective tax rate is the ratio of the ongoing tax expense to ongoing proﬁt before tax and is used as a measure of the tax rate of the ongoing 
business. See reconciliation in note 7.
Headline proﬁt after tax and headline earnings per share
Headline proﬁt after tax is calculated as the proﬁt from continuing operations after tax, before charges for amortisation and impairment of acquired 
intangible assets net of tax, exceptional items net of tax and non-recurring tax relating to changes in tax rates. 
Headline earnings per share is the ratio of headline proﬁt after tax to the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding 
those held by the Employee Beneﬁt Trusts and those held by the Company as Treasury shares. Headline earnings per share is used for the purpose of 
setting remuneration targets for executive directors and other senior executives. See reconciliation in note 10.
Net debt and adjusted net debt
Net debt comprises cash and cash equivalents, bank overdrafts, bank loans, derivative ﬁnancial instruments and obligations under ﬁnance leases. Net debt 
is a good indicator of the strength of the Group’s balance sheet position and is widely used by credit rating agencies. See note 32 for a reconciliation.
Adjusted net debt is net debt after the year-end working capital adjustment used in the return on gross capital employed calculation below.
Return on gross capital employed
Return on gross capital employed is the ratio of the Group’s total trading proﬁt to the average year-end aggregate of shareholders’ equity, adjusted net debt 
and cumulative goodwill and other acquired intangible assets written off. Return on gross capital employed is a key performance indicator (see page 27).

92 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 3 – Segmental analysis
The Group’s reportable segments are the operating businesses overseen by distinct divisional management teams responsible for their performance. 
All reportable segments derive their revenue from a single business activity, the distribution of plumbing and heating products.
The Group’s business is not highly seasonal and the Group’s customer base is highly diversiﬁed, with no individually signiﬁcant customer. 
In the year ended 31 July 2017, the Nordic businesses have been reclassiﬁed into discontinued operations and all comparatives have been restated 
for consistency and comparability.
The changes in revenue and trading proﬁt for continuing operations between the years ended 31 July 2016 and 31 July 2017 include changes in 
exchange rates, disposals, acquisitions and organic change.
Where businesses are disposed in the year, the difference between the revenue and trading proﬁt in the current year up to the date of disposal and the 
revenue and trading proﬁt in the equivalent portion of the prior year is included in organic change.
Revenue by reportable segment for continuing operations is as follows:

(a)  This expected weighted average tax rate reﬂects the applicable statutory corporate tax rates on the accounting proﬁts/losses in the countries in which the Group operates after 
intra-group ﬁnancing. This results in interest deductions and lower taxable proﬁts in many of the countries and therefore reduces the tax rate. The pre intra-group ﬁnancing ongoing 
expected weighted average tax rate is 32.7 per cent (2016: 37.6 per cent) and this is reduced to a post intra-group ﬁnancing ongoing expected weighted average tax rate of  
24.4 per cent (2016: 25.5 per cent). The 1.1 per cent decrease in the post intra-group ﬁnancing ongoing expected weighted average tax rate is primarily due to a change in proﬁt mix.
(b)  This includes adjustments arising out of movements in uncertain tax provisions regarding prior periods and differences between the ﬁnal tax liabilities in the tax computations and the 
tax liabilities provided in the accounts. The non-ongoing and other credit of £11 million relates primarily to a one-off settlement of tax enquiries in the UK.
(c)  In 2016, this relates primarily to non-tax deductible impairment of goodwill in the UK.
(d)  In 2017, this relates primarily to non-taxable disposals of businesses.
(e)  This reﬂects management’s assessment of the potential tax liability for the current year in relation to open tax issues and audits. 
(f)  This relates to certain expenditure for which no tax relief is available such as disallowable business entertaining costs.
(g)  This relates to the reduction in the UK standard rate of corporation tax from 20 per cent to 19 per cent from 1 April 2017 and to 17 per cent from 1 April 2020. The rate change was considered 
exceptional in 2016 on the grounds that it was only announced at the end of the 2015 ﬁnancial year and could not be foreseen in the Group’s forecast ongoing effective tax rate for the 
2016 ﬁnancial year.
(h)  Ongoing proﬁt means proﬁt before tax, exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets for ongoing operations as deﬁned in note 2. Ongoing tax is the 
tax expense arising on ongoing proﬁt.
(i)  Non-ongoing and other proﬁt or loss is proﬁt or loss from non-ongoing operations as deﬁned in note 2 and from the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets and 
exceptional items. Non-ongoing and other tax is the tax expense or credit arising on the non-ongoing and other proﬁt or loss.

The impairment charge for the year includes £82 million (2016: £nil) in respect of discontinued operations.
Goodwill and intangible assets acquired during the year have been allocated to the individual cash generating units or aggregated cash generating units 
(together “CGUs”) which are deemed to be the smallest identiﬁable group of assets generating independent cash inﬂows. CGUs have been aggregated 
in the disclosure below at a segmental level except for certain CGUs in the USA which are considered to be signiﬁcant (more than 10 per cent of the 
current year goodwill balance). Impairment reviews were performed for each individual CGU during the year ended 31 July 2017.

The relevant inputs to the value in use calculations of each CGU were:
Cash ﬂow forecasts for years one to three are derived from the most recent Board approved strategic plan. The forecast for year ﬁve represents an 
estimate of “mid-cycle” trading performance for the CGU based on historic analysis. Year four is calculated as the average of the ﬁnal year of the strategic 
plan and year ﬁve’s mid-cycle estimate. The other inputs include a risk-adjusted, pre-tax discount rate, calculated by reference to the weighted average 
cost of capital (“WACC”) of each country and the 30-year long-term growth rate by country, as published by the IMF in April 2017. 
The strategic plan is developed based on analyses of sales, markets and costs at a regional level. Consideration is given to past events, knowledge 
of future contracts and the wider economy. It takes into account both current business and future initiatives.
Management has performed a sensitivity analysis across all CGUs which have goodwill and acquired intangible assets using reasonably possible 
changes in the following key impairment review assumptions: compound average revenue growth rate, post-tax discount rate and long-term growth 
rate, keeping all other assumptions constant. The sensitivity testing identiﬁed no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions that would cause the 
carrying amount of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

During the period, the performance of our Swedish building materials business, Beijer, deteriorated sharply with trading proﬁt signiﬁcantly lower

In April 2017, the Group acquired a 39.21% share in Walter Meier AG, a trading company whose principal place of business is Switzerland and which is 
engaged in the distribution and maintenance of heating and air conditioning systems. 
The investment in Walter Meier AG is accounted for as an associate using the equity method. Walter Meier AG prepares accounts under Swiss GAAP 
FER with a year-end of 31 December. The Group’s accounts have been prepared based on Walter Meier AG’s half year accounts ended 30 June 2017. 
There were no signiﬁcant transactions between that date and 31 July 2017 and no material differences would arise if the accounts were prepared 
under IFRS.

Legislation has been enacted in the UK to reduce the standard rate of UK corporation tax from 20 per cent to 19 per cent with effect from 1 April 2017 and 
to 17 per cent with effect from 1 April 2020. Accordingly, the UK deferred tax assets and liabilities have predominantly been calculated based on a 17 per 
cent tax rate which materially reﬂects the rate for the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to reverse.
Net deferred tax assets have been recognised on the basis that sufficient taxable proﬁts are forecast to be available in the future to enable them to 
be utilised.
In addition, the Group has unrecognised gross tax losses totalling £328 million (2016: £68 million) that have not been recognised on the basis that their 
future economic beneﬁt is uncertain. These losses have no expiry date and relate predominantly to capital losses.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries. However, tax may arise 
on £284 million (2016: £253 million) of temporary differences but the Group is in a position to control the timing of their reversal and it is probable that 
such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

where there is an equal and opposite balance included within cash and cash equivalents (note 19). These amounts are subject to a master

£2 million of bank loans are secured against the Group’s freehold property (2016: £130 million). In addition, £79 million of bank loans included in liabilities 
held for sale (note 20) are secured against freehold property included in assets held for sale. No bank loans were secured against trade receivables at 
31 July 2017 (2016: £nil) as the trade receivables facility of £454 million was undrawn as at 31 July 2017.

The carrying value of the senior unsecured loan notes of £952 million comprises a par value of £937 million and a fair value adjustment of £15 million 
(2016: £959 million, £936 million and £23 million respectively). The fair value adjustment arose before 30 November 2011 when the loan notes were 
hedged by a series of interest rate swaps. From 30 November 2011, the hedge relationship was de-designated and the fair value adjustment is being 
released to the income statement on an amortised cost basis and the fair value hedge is based on a recalculated effective interest rate at the date 
when hedge accounting was discontinued. The adjustment will be fully amortised at the point the unsecured loan notes mature. Finance costs are 
disclosed in note 6.
There have been no signiﬁcant changes during the year to the Group’s policies on accounting for, valuing and managing the risk of ﬁnancial instruments. 
These policies are summarised on pages 123 to 126.
23 – Financial instruments and ﬁnancial risk management
Capital structure
To assess the appropriateness of its capital structure based on current and forecast trading, the Group’s principal measure of ﬁnancial gearing is the ratio 
of net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items. The Group aims to operate with investment grade credit metrics and ensure this ratio remains within 1 
to 2 times. The Group’s main borrowing facilities contain a ﬁnancial covenant limiting the ratio of net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items to 3.5:1. 
The reconciliation of opening to closing net debt is detailed in note 32.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may return capital to shareholders, repurchase its own shares, issue new shares or sell 
assets to reduce debt. 
Liquidity
During the year ended 31 July 2017, the Group’s US$600 million revolving credit facility has been extended by one year and matures in December 2019. 
The Group also entered into a US$190 million bilateral revolving credit facility agreement maturing in December 2017. As at 31 July 2017, all of the Group’s 
revolving credit facilities were undrawn. The maturity proﬁle of the Group’s undrawn facilities is as follows:

The environmental and legal provision includes £52 million (2016: £61 million) for the estimated liability for asbestos litigation on a discounted basis 
using a long-term discount rate of 2.3 per cent (2016: 1.5 per cent). This amount has been actuarially determined as at 31 July 2017 based on advice from 
independent professional advisers. The Group has insurance that it believes is sufficient cover for the estimated liability and accordingly an equivalent 
insurance receivable has been recorded in other receivables. Based on current estimates, the amount of performing insurance cover signiﬁcantly 
exceeds the expected level of future claims and no material proﬁt or cash ﬂow impact is therefore expected to arise in the foreseeable future. Due to the 
nature of these provisions, the timing of any settlements is uncertain.
Wolseley Insurance provisions represent an estimate, based on historical experience, of the ultimate cost of settling outstanding claims and claims 
incurred but not reported on certain risks retained by the Group (principally USA casualty and global property damage). Due to the nature of these 
provisions, the timing of any settlements is uncertain.
Restructuring provisions include provisions for staff redundancy costs and future lease rentals on closed branches. In determining the provision for 
onerous leases, the cash ﬂows have been discounted on a pre-tax basis using appropriate government bond rates. The weighted average maturity 
of these obligations is approximately three years.
Other provisions include warranty costs relating to businesses disposed of, rental commitments on vacant properties and dilapidations on leased 
properties. The weighted average maturity of these obligations is approximately three years.

(i) Long-term beneﬁt plans provided by the Group
The Group has a deﬁned beneﬁt pension plan for certain of its UK employees. This plan was closed for future service accrual in December 2013 and 
during October 2016 the plan was closed for future non-inﬂationary salary accrual. The Group operates a number of smaller plans in other jurisdictions, 
providing pensions or other long-term beneﬁts such as long service or termination awards. More information about the plans operated by the Group is 
set out on page 126. 
During the year, the Group secured a buy-in insurance policy with Pension Insurance Corporation (PIC) for the UK pension plan. This policy covered all 
of the pensioner members of the plan and exactly matches the beneﬁts provided by the plan. This has led to the recognition of an asset in respect of this 
policy exactly equal to the insured liabilities at 31 July 2017. The difference between the premium paid and the asset recognised in respect of this policy 
has been recognised as an actuarial movement in other comprehensive income.

Weighted average fair value per share/option granted during the year (£) 32.95 24.28
At 31 July 2017 and 31 July 2016, all of the shares and options outstanding had an exercise price which was below the market price. The market price at 
31 July 2017 was £45.27 (2016: £42.09) and the average share price in the year to 31 July 2017 was £47.28 (2016: £38.30). For executive share option plans 
and all-employee sharesave plans, the range of exercise prices for shares and options outstanding at 31 July 2017 was £12.69 to £42.96 (2016: £7.01 to 
£33.62). For the ordinary share plan and long term incentive plans, all share options outstanding at 31 July 2017 had an exercise price of £nil (2016: £nil).
For shares and options outstanding at 31 July 2017, the weighted average remaining contractual life was three years (2016: four years).
The fair value at the date of grant of options awarded during the year has been estimated using the binomial methodology for all plans except the portion 
of the grants awarded under the long term incentive plan that are subject to a relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance condition, for which 
a Monte Carlo simulation was used. 
The fair value of shares granted under the ordinary share plan was calculated as the market price of the shares at the date of grant reduced by the 
present value of dividends expected to be paid over the vesting period.
The principal assumptions required by these methodologies were:
Ordinary share plans All-employee sharesave plans Long term incentive plans
2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016
Risk-free interest rate 0.3% 0.7% 0.1% 0.6% 0.3% 0.7%
Expected dividend yield 2.7% 3.0% 2.4% 2.7% 0.0% 2.2%
Expected volatility 22% 23% 22% 25% 22% 23%
Expected life 1–3 years 3 years 1–6 years 1–6 years 3 years 3 years
There were no executive share options granted in the period.
Expected volatility has been estimated on the basis of historical volatility over the expected term, excluding the effect of extraordinary volatility due 
to the Group’s capital reorganisation and rights issue in 2009. Expected life has been estimated on the basis of historical data on the exercise pattern.

The fair value adjustments are provisional ﬁgures, being the best estimates currently available. Further adjustments may be necessary when additional 
information is available for some of the judgemental areas.
The goodwill arising on these acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated proﬁtability of the new markets and product ranges to which the Group 
has gained access and additional proﬁtability and operating efficiencies available in respect of existing markets. 
The acquisitions contributed £214 million to revenue, £29 million to trading proﬁt and £12 million to the Group’s operating proﬁt for the period between 
the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date. It is not practicable to disclose proﬁt before and after tax, as the Group manages its borrowings 
as a portfolio and cannot attribute an effective borrowing rate to an individual acquisition. 
If each acquisition had been completed on the ﬁrst day of the ﬁnancial year, Group revenue would have been £15,277 million and Group trading proﬁt 
would have been £1,062 million. It is not practicable to disclose proﬁt before tax or proﬁt attributable to equity shareholders, as stated above. It is also not 
practicable to disclose operating proﬁt as the Group cannot estimate the amount of intangible assets that would have been acquired at a date other than 
the acquisition date.

The commitments shown above include commitments for onerous leases which have already been provided for. At 31 July 2017, provisions include an 
amount of £27 million (2016: £25 million) in respect of minimum lease payments for such onerous leases net of sublease income expected to be received. 
The total minimum sublease income expected to be received under non-cancellable subleases at 31 July 2017 is £7 million (2016: £8 million).
The commitments above include £91 million operating lease commitments (2016: £102 million) for discontinued operations.
Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements continued
Year ended 31 July 2017
118 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 35 – Contingent liabilities
Group companies are, from time to time, subject to certain claims and 
litigation arising in the normal course of business in relation to, among 
other things, the products that they supply, contractual and commercial 
disputes and disputes with employees. Provision is made if, on the basis of 
current information and professional advice, liabilities are considered likely 
to arise. In the case of unfavourable outcomes, the Group may beneﬁt from 
applicable insurance protection. 
Warranties and indemnities in relation to business disposals
Over the past few years, the Group has disposed of a number of non-core 
businesses and various Group companies have provided certain standard 
warranties and indemnities to acquirers and other third parties. Provision is 
made where the Group considers that a liability is likely to crystallise, 
though it is possible that claims in respect of which no provision has been 
made could crystallise in the future. Group companies have also made 
contractual commitments for certain property and other obligations which 
could be called upon in an event of default. As at the date of this report, 
there are no signiﬁcant outstanding claims in relation to business disposals.
Environmental liabilities
The operations of certain Group companies are subject to speciﬁc 
environmental regulations. From time to time, the Group conducts 
preliminary investigations through third parties to assess potential risks 
including potential soil or groundwater contamination of sites. Where an 
obligation to remediate contamination arises then this is provided for, 
though future liabilities could arise from sites for which no provision 
is made.
Outcome of claims and litigation
The outcome of claims and litigation to which Group companies are 
party cannot readily be foreseen as, in some cases, the facts are unclear, 
further time is needed to assess properly the merits of the case, or they 
are part of continuing legal proceedings. However, based on information 
currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an 
unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is not expected to have 
a material adverse effect on the ﬁnancial position of the Group.
36 – Post-balance sheet events
Since the year-end, the Group has acquired ﬁve businesses, two in the 
USA and three in Canada and Central Europe with a combined annual 
revenue of £109 million. As at the date of this report, the accounting for 
these transactions has not been ﬁnalised.
On 31 August 2017, the Group disposed of Silvan, its DIY business 
in Denmark.
37 – Additional information
(i) Group accounting policies
A summary of the principal accounting policies applied by the Group in 
the preparation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements is set out below. 
The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the 
current and preceding year.
Consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial information includes the results of the 
parent company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiary 
undertakings and controlling interests) and its share of the results of 
its associate drawn up to 31 July 2017.
The trading results of business operations are included in proﬁt from 
continuing operations from the date of acquisition or up to the date of sale.
Intra-group transactions and balances and any unrealised gains and losses 
arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation, 
with the exception of gains or losses required under relevant IFRS 
accounting standards.
Discontinued operations
When the Group has disposed of or intends to dispose of a business 
component that represents a separate major line of business or 
geographical area of operations, it classiﬁes such operations as 
discontinued. The post-tax proﬁt or loss of the discontinued operations 
is shown as a single line on the face of the income statement, separate 
from the other results of the Group. 
Foreign currencies
Items included in the ﬁnancial statements of each of the Group’s subsidiary 
undertakings are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the subsidiary undertaking operates (the “functional 
currency”). The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are presented in sterling, 
which is the presentational currency of the Group and the functional 
currency of the parent company.
The trading results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated 
into sterling using the average rates of exchange ruling during the relevant 
ﬁnancial period. The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings 
are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the period end. 
Exchange differences arising between the translation into sterling of the 
net assets of these subsidiary undertakings are recognised in the currency 
translation reserve (as are exchange differences on foreign currency 
borrowings to the extent that they are used to ﬁnance or provide a hedge 
against foreign currency net assets).
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments, entered into to 
hedge foreign currency net assets and that satisfy the hedging conditions 
of IAS 39, are recognised in the currency translation reserve (see the 
separate accounting policy on derivative ﬁnancial instruments). 
In the event that a subsidiary undertaking which has a non-sterling 
functional currency is disposed of, the gain or loss on disposal recognised 
in the income statement is determined after taking into account the 
cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to 
the subsidiary undertaking concerned.
Foreign currency transactions entered into during the year are translated 
into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates of the transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
All currency translation differences are taken to the income statement with 
the exception of differences on foreign currency net borrowings to the 
extent that they are used to ﬁnance or provide a hedge against foreign 
currency net assets as detailed above.
Business combinations
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, 
equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date 
of exchange. Identiﬁable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent 
liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their 
fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-
controlling interest. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s 
share of the identiﬁable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the 
cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Group’s share of the net 
assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in 
the income statement.
Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identiﬁed separately from the 
equity attributable to shareholders of the Company. The interests of non-
controlling shareholders are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to 
acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount 
of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ 
share of subsequent changes in equity. 
Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even 
if this results in the non-controlling interests showing a deﬁcit balance.

119 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 37 – Additional information continued
(i) Group accounting policies continued 
Interests in associates
Investments in companies where signiﬁcant inﬂuence is exercised 
are accounted for as interests in associates using the equity method 
of accounting from the date the investee becomes an associate. 
The investment is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter for 
changes in the Group’s share in the net assets of the investee. The Group’s 
share of proﬁt or loss after tax is recognised in the Group income 
statement and share of other comprehensive income or expense is 
recognised in the Group statement of other comprehensive income.
On acquisition of the investment in an associate, any excess of the cost 
of the investment over the Group’s share of the net assets of the investee 
is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount 
of the investment. The requirements of IAS 36 are applied to determine 
whether it is necessary to recognise any impairment loss with respect to 
the Group’s investment in an associate.
Revenue
Revenue is the amount receivable for the provision of goods and services 
falling within the Group’s ordinary activities, excluding intra-group sales, 
estimated and actual sales returns, trade and early settlement discounts, 
value added tax and similar sales taxes.
The Group acts as principal for direct sales which are delivered directly 
to the customer by the supplier. 
Revenue from the provision of goods is recognised when the risks and 
rewards of ownership of goods have been transferred to the customer. 
The risks and rewards of ownership of goods are deemed to have been 
transferred when the goods are shipped to, or picked up by, the customer.
Revenue from services is recognised when the service provided to the 
customer has been completed.
Customer loyalty credits are accounted for as a separate component 
of the sales transaction in which they are granted. A portion of the fair 
value of the consideration received is allocated to the loyalty credits 
and recognised in the period that loyalty credits are redeemed.
Revenue from the provision of goods and services is only recognised 
when the amounts to be recognised are ﬁxed or determinable and 
collectability is reasonably assured.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes purchased goods, the cost of bringing inventory 
to its present location and condition and labour and overheads attributable 
to assembly and construction services.
Supplier rebates
In line with industry practice, the Group has agreements (“Supplier 
Rebates”) with a number of its suppliers whereby volume-based rebates, 
marketing support and other discounts are received in connection with 
the purchase of goods for resale from those suppliers. Rebates relating to 
the purchase of goods for resale are accrued as earned and are recorded 
initially as a deduction in inventory with a subsequent reduction in cost of 
sales when the related product is sold.
Volume-based rebates
The majority of volume-based rebates are determined by reference to 
guaranteed rates of rebate. These are calculated through a mechanical 
process with minimal judgement required to determine the amount 
recorded in the income statement.
A small proportion of volume-based rebates are subject to stepped 
targets where the rebate percentage increases as volumes purchased 
reach agreed targets within a set period of time. The majority of rebate 
agreements apply to purchases in a calendar year and therefore, for 
stepped rebates, judgement is required to estimate the rebate amount 
recorded in the income statement at the end of the period. The Group 
assesses the probability that targeted volumes will be achieved in the 
year based on forecasts which are informed by historical trading patterns, 
current performance and trends. This judgement is exercised consistently 
with historically insigniﬁcant true ups at the end of the period.
An amount due in respect of Supplier Rebates is not recognised within 
the income statement until all the relevant performance criteria, where 
applicable, have been met and the goods have been sold to a third party.
Marketing support
Marketing support, which represents a smaller element of the Group’s 
overall Supplier Rebates, is recognised in the income statement when 
all performance conditions have been fulﬁlled.
Supplier Rebates receivable
Where Supplier Rebates are netted off the amounts owing to that 
supplier, any outstanding amount at the balance sheet date is included 
within trade payables. Where the Supplier Rebates are not offset against 
amounts owing to a supplier, the outstanding amount is included within 
prepayments. The carrying value of inventory is reduced by the relevant 
amount where the inventory has not been sold by the balance sheet date.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the 
fair value of the Group’s share of the net identiﬁable assets of the 
acquired subsidiary undertaking at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on 
acquisitions of subsidiary undertakings is included within intangible assets. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units or aggregations of cash 
generating units (together “CGUs”) where synergy beneﬁts are expected. 
CGUs are independent sources of income streams and represent 
the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is 
monitored for management purposes. The Group considers that a CGU 
is a business unit because independent cash ﬂows cannot be identiﬁed 
below this level. 
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment and 
carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. For goodwill 
impairment testing purposes, no CGU is larger than the reporting 
segments determined in accordance with IFRS 8 “Operating Segments”. 
The recoverable amount of goodwill and acquired intangible assets is 
assessed on the basis of the value in use estimate for CGUs to which they 
are attributed. Where carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount a 
provision for the impairment is established with a charge included in the 
income statement.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount 
of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Other intangible assets
An intangible asset, which is an identiﬁable non-monetary asset without 
physical substance, is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
expected future economic beneﬁts attributable to the asset will ﬂow to 
the Group and that its cost can be measured reliably. The asset is deemed 
to be identiﬁable when it is separable or when it arises from contractual or 
other legal rights.
Intangible assets, primarily brands, trade names and customer 
relationships, acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised 
separately from goodwill and are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is 
calculated using the reducing balance method for customer relationships 
and the straight-line method for other intangible assets. 
Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements continued
Year ended 31 July 2017
120 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 37 – Additional information continued
(i) Group accounting policies continued 
The cost of the intangible assets is amortised and charged to operating 
costs in the income statement over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Customer relationships  4–25 years
Trade names and brands  1–15 years
Other    1–4 years
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and 
equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset and is carried 
at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment 
losses. Costs include software licences and external and internal costs 
directly attributable to the development, design and implementation of the 
computer software. Costs in respect of training and data conversion are 
expensed as incurred. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line 
method so as to charge the cost of the computer software to operating 
costs in the income statement over its estimated useful life of between 
three and ﬁve years. 
Property, plant and equipment (“PPE”)
PPE is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses, except for land and assets in the course of 
construction, which are not depreciated and are carried at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the items. In addition, subsequent costs 
are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate 
asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic 
beneﬁts associated with the item will ﬂow to the Group and the cost of 
the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs 
are charged to the income statement during the ﬁnancial period in which 
they are incurred.
Assets are depreciated to their estimated residual value using the 
straight-line method over their useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings and long leaseholds 20–50 years
Operating leasehold improvements over the period of the lease
Plant and machinery   7–10 years
Computer hardware   3–5 years
Fixtures and ﬁttings   5–7 years
Motor vehicles   4 years
The residual values and useful lives of PPE are reviewed and adjusted 
if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the long-term construction or 
production of an asset are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
Leased assets
Assets held under ﬁnance leases, which are leases where substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have transferred to 
the Group, are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over 
the shorter of the lease term or their useful lives. The asset is recorded 
at the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum 
lease payments at the inception of the lease. The capital elements of 
future obligations under ﬁnance leases are included in liabilities in the 
balance sheet and analysed between current and non-current amounts. 
The interest elements of future obligations under ﬁnance leases are 
charged to the income statement over the periods of the leases and 
represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments 
outstanding in accordance with the effective interest rate method.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership are classiﬁed as operating leases. The cost of operating leases 
(net of any incentives received from the lessor) is charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the leases.
Assets and disposal groups held for sale 
Assets are classiﬁed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be 
recovered by sale rather than by continuing use in the business. 
Where a group of assets and their directly associated liabilities are to be 
disposed of in a single transaction, such disposal groups are also classiﬁed 
as held for sale. For this to be the case, the asset or disposal group must 
be available for immediate sale in its present condition and management 
must be committed to and have initiated a plan to sell the asset or disposal 
group which, when initiated, was expected to result in a completed 
sale within 12 months. Assets that are classiﬁed as held for sale are not 
depreciated. Assets or disposal groups that are classiﬁed as held for sale 
are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell. 
Inventories
Inventories, which comprise goods purchased for resale, are stated at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the ﬁrst-in, 
ﬁrst-out (“FIFO”) method or the average cost method as appropriate to the 
nature of the transactions in those items of inventory. The cost of goods 
purchased for resale includes import and custom duties, transport and 
handling costs, freight and packing costs and other attributable costs less 
trade discounts, rebates and other subsidies. It excludes borrowing costs. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Provisions are made against slow-moving, obsolete and damaged 
inventories for which the net realisable value is estimated to be less than 
the cost. The risk of obsolescence of slow-moving inventory is assessed 
by comparing the level of inventory held to estimated future sales on the 
basis of historical experience. 
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and measured 
subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less 
provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables 
is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not 
be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the 
receivables. The amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement. 
Trade receivables are written off against the provision when recoverability 
is assessed as being remote. Subsequent recoveries of amounts 
previously written off are credited to the income statement.
Provisions
Provisions for self-insured risks, legal claims, environmental restoration 
and onerous leases are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not 
that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and 
the amount can be reliably estimated. Such provisions are measured at the 
present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required 
to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. The discount rate 
used to determine the present value reﬂects current market assessments 
of the time value of money. Provisions are not recognised for future 
operating losses.
Retirement beneﬁt obligations
Contributions to deﬁned contribution pension plans and other post-
retirement beneﬁts are charged to the income statement as incurred.
For deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans and other retirement beneﬁts, the 
cost of providing beneﬁts is determined annually using the Projected 
Unit Credit Method by independent qualiﬁed actuaries. The current 
service cost of deﬁned beneﬁt plans is recorded within operating proﬁt. 
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income. 
Strategic report Governance Financials Other information
121 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 37 – Additional information continued
(i) Group accounting policies continued
The net interest amount is calculated by applying the discount rate used 
to measure the deﬁned beneﬁt net asset or liability at the beginning of 
the period. The pension plan net interest is presented as ﬁnance income 
or expense. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and 
changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other 
comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. The liability/asset 
recognised in the balance sheet in respect of deﬁned beneﬁt pension 
plans is the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the deﬁned 
beneﬁt obligation at the end of the reporting period.
Tax
Current tax represents the expected tax payable (or recoverable) on 
the taxable income (or losses) for the year using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and taking into account 
any adjustments arising from prior years.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary 
differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Deferred tax 
is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability 
in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt or loss.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are 
expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or 
the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁt will be available 
against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments 
in subsidiaries except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Tax provisions
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. 
Judgement is sometimes required in determining the worldwide provision 
for income taxes. There may be transactions and calculations for which 
the ultimate tax determination is uncertain and may be challenged by the 
tax authorities. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated or actual tax 
audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. 
Where an outﬂow of funds to a tax authority is considered probable and 
the Group can make a reliable estimate of the outcome of the dispute, 
management calculates the provision using the single best estimate 
of likely outcome approach. In assessing its uncertain tax provisions, 
management takes into account the speciﬁc facts of each dispute, the 
likelihood of settlement and the advice from its in-house tax specialists 
and professional advisers. Where the ultimate liability in a dispute varies 
from the amounts provided, such differences could impact the current and 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which the dispute 
is concluded.
The Group believes that it has made adequate provision for the liabilities 
likely to arise from open audits and assessments. At 31 July 2017, the 
Group has recognised provisions of £162 million in respect of its uncertain 
tax positions (2016: £166 million). The total provision has decreased by 
£4 million in the year due to the settlement of various open tax issues in 
the UK. The remaining open signiﬁcant tax issues relate predominantly 
to cross border transfer pricing risks. Given the uncertainty regarding 
the timing of the resolution of these matters, it is difficult for the Group 
to estimate whether there will be a material change in its estimate of 
uncertain tax provisions within the next 12 months. 
Share capital
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options 
are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital 
(Treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable 
incremental costs (net of tax), is deducted from equity attributable to 
the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued 
or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, 
any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental 
transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity 
attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
Share-based payments
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Group’s 
executive share option plan, long term incentive plan, all-employee 
sharesave plan, ordinary share plan, performance ordinary share plan 
and revised ordinary share plan. The Group recognises a compensation 
cost in respect of these plans that is based on the fair value of the awards, 
measured using Binomial and Monte Carlo valuation methodologies. 
For equity-settled plans, the fair value is determined at the date of 
grant (including the impact of any non-vesting conditions such as a 
requirement for employees to save) and is not subsequently remeasured 
unless the conditions on which the award were granted are modiﬁed. 
For cash-settled plans, the fair value is determined at the date of grant 
and is remeasured at each balance sheet date until the liability is settled. 
Generally, the compensation cost is recognised on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period. Adjustments are made to reﬂect expected and 
actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to the failure to satisfy 
service conditions or non-market performance conditions.
Dividends payable
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in the Group’s ﬁnancial 
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the 
shareholders of the Company or paid.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with 
banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities 
of three months or less and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown 
within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet to the extent 
that there is no legal right of offset and no practice of net settlement with 
cash balances.
Cash which is not freely available to the Group is disclosed as 
restricted cash.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments, in particular interest rate swaps and 
foreign exchange swaps, are used to manage the ﬁnancial risks arising 
from the business activities of the Group and the ﬁnancing of those 
activities. There is no trading activity in derivative ﬁnancial instruments.
At the inception of a hedging transaction involving the use of derivative 
ﬁnancial instruments, the Group documents the relationship between 
the hedged item and the hedging instrument together with its risk 
management objective and the strategy underlying the proposed 
transaction. The Group also documents its assessment, both at the 
inception of the hedging relationship and subsequently on an ongoing 
basis, of the effectiveness of the hedge in offsetting movements in the 
fair values or cash ﬂows of the hedged items.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities 
measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. Where derivative 
ﬁnancial instruments do not fulﬁl the criteria for hedge accounting 
contained in IAS 39, changes in their fair values are recognised in the 
income statement. When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging 
relationships are classiﬁed as fair value hedges, cash ﬂow hedges or net 
investment hedges.

(ii) Additional information about ﬁnancial instruments
Where the hedging relationship is classiﬁed as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability is adjusted by the increase or 
decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement where, to the extent that 
the hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to proﬁt or loss over the 
period to maturity. Where the hedging relationship is classiﬁed as a cash ﬂow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent the hedge is effective, 
changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument arising from the hedged risk are recognised directly in equity. 
When the hedged item is recognised in the ﬁnancial statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in equity are either recycled to the 
income statement or, if the hedged item results in a non-ﬁnancial asset, are recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount. When a hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that 
time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is 
no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at the fair value of the consideration received net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated 
at amortised cost with any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value being recognised in the income 
statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classiﬁed as current liabilities unless the Group has an 
unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

Financial instruments in the category “fair value through proﬁt and loss” are measured in the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value measurements 
can be classiﬁed in the following hierarchy:
 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1);
 – inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (level 2); and
 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3).

Derivatives at fair value through proﬁt and loss –20 –20 –31 –31
As at 31 July 2017 and 31 July 2016, there were no derivative liabilities held at fair value through proﬁt and loss. No transfers between levels occurred 
during the current or prior year. 
The fair value of ﬁnancial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. The fair value of ﬁnancial 
instruments that are not traded in an active market (such as over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. The Group’s other 
ﬁnancial instruments are measured on bases other than fair value. Other receivables include an amount of £50 million (2016: £60 million) which has been 
discounted at a rate of 2.3 per cent (2016: 1.5 per cent) due to the long-term nature of the receivable. Other current assets and liabilities are either of short 
maturity or bear ﬂoating rate interest and their fair values approximate to book values. The only non-current ﬁnancial assets or liabilities for which fair value 
does not approximate to book value are the senior unsecured loan notes, which had a book value of £952 million (2016: £959 million) and a fair value 
(level 2) of £991 million (2016: £1,027 million).

Financial instruments: risk management policies
The Group is exposed to market risks arising from its international operations and the ﬁnancial instruments which fund them. The main risks arising from 
the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Group has well-deﬁned policies for the management of 
interest rate, liquidity, foreign exchange and counterparty exposures, which have been consistently applied during the ﬁnancial years ended 31 July 2017 
and 31 July 2016. By the nature of its business, the Group also has trade credit and commodity price exposures, the management of which is delegated 
to the operating businesses. There has been no change since the previous year in the major ﬁnancial risks faced by the Group.
Policies for managing each of these risks are regularly reviewed and are summarised below. When the Group enters into derivative transactions 
(principally interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts), the purpose of such transactions is to hedge certain interest rate and currency risks 
arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of ﬁnance. It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no trading 
in ﬁnancial instruments or speculative transactions be undertaken.
Capital risk management
The Group’s sources of funding currently comprise cash ﬂows generated by operations, equity contributed by shareholders and borrowings from banks 
and other ﬁnancial institutions. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may pay a special dividend, return capital to shareholders, 
repurchase its own shares, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. 
Liquidity risk
The Group maintains a policy of ensuring sufficient borrowing headroom to ﬁnance all investment and capital expenditure included in its strategic plan, 
with an additional contingent safety margin. 
The Group has estimated its anticipated contractual cash outﬂows (excluding interest income and income from derivatives) including interest payable 
in respect of its trade and other payables and bank borrowings on an undiscounted basis. The principal assumptions are that ﬂoating rate interest is 
calculated using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date and cash ﬂows in foreign currency are translated using spot rates at the balance 
sheet date. These cash ﬂows can be analysed by maturity as follows:

Foreign currency risk
The Group has signiﬁcant overseas businesses whose revenues are mainly denominated in the currencies of the countries in which the operations 
are located. Approximately 79 per cent of the Group’s revenue is in US dollars. Within each country it operates, the Group does not have signiﬁcant 
transactional foreign currency cash ﬂow exposures. However, those that do arise may be hedged with either forward contracts or currency options. 
The Group does not normally hedge proﬁt translation exposure since such hedges have only a temporary effect.
The Group’s policy is to adjust the currencies in which its net debt is denominated materially to match the currencies in which its trading proﬁt is 
generated. Details of average exchange rates used in the translation of overseas earnings and of year-end exchange rates used in the translation 
of overseas balance sheets for the principal currencies used by the Group are shown in the ﬁve-year summary on page 139. The net effect of 
currency translation was to increase revenue by £1,609 million (2016 restated: increase by £548 million) and to increase trading proﬁt by £126 million 
(2016 restated: increase by £46 million). These currency effects primarily reﬂect a movement of the average sterling exchange rate against US dollars, 
euro and Canadian dollars as follows:
2017
 
Weakening  
of sterling
2016 
(Weakening)/
strengthening
of sterling
US dollars (15.3%) (6.8%)
Euro (13.5%) (0.8%)
Canadian dollars (15.5%) 4.1%
The Group has net ﬁnancial liabilities denominated in foreign currencies which have been designated as hedges of the net investment in its overseas 
subsidiaries. The principal value of those ﬁnancial liabilities designated as hedges at the balance sheet date was £1,528 million (2016: £1,636 million). 
The loss on translation of these ﬁnancial instruments into sterling of £6 million (2016: £107 million) has been taken to the translation reserve.

Net investment hedging
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in 
foreign operations are recognised directly in equity. Gains and losses on 
those hedging instruments designated as hedges of the net investments 
in foreign operations are recognised in equity to the extent that the 
hedging relationship is effective; these amounts are included in exchange 
differences on translation of foreign operations as stated in the Group 
statement of comprehensive income. Gains and losses relating to hedge 
ineffectiveness are recognised immediately in the income statement 
for the period. Gains and losses accumulated in the translation reserve 
are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is 
disposed of.
Interest rate risk
At 31 July 2017, 100 per cent of loans were at ﬁxed rates. The Group 
borrows in the desired currencies principally at rates determined by 
reference to short-term benchmark rates applicable to the relevant 
currency or market, such as LIBOR. Rates which reset at least every  
12 months are regarded as ﬂoating rates and the Group then, 
if appropriate, considers interest rate swaps to generate the 
desired interest rate proﬁle.
The Group reviews deposits and borrowings by currency at Treasury 
Committee and Board meetings. The Treasury Committee gives prior 
approval to any variations from ﬂoating rate arrangements.
During November 2011, the Group entered into interest rate swap 
contracts comprising ﬁxed interest payable on US$729 million of notional 
principal. The residual contracts of US$438 million expire between 
November 2017 and November 2020 and the ﬁxed interest rates range 
between 2.06 per cent and 2.94 per cent (2016: 2.06 per cent and 2.94 
per cent). These contracts have been held since inception at fair value 
through proﬁt and loss. With effect from 1 December 2011, interest rate 
swap contracts comprising ﬁxed interest receivable on an original notional 
principal of US$729 million and as at 31 July 2017, residual contracts of 
US$438 million have been classiﬁed as held at fair value through proﬁt and 
loss. The contracts expire between November 2017 and November 2020 
and the ﬁxed interest rates range between 5.18 per cent and 5.32 per cent 
(2016: 5.18 per cent and 5.32 per cent).

swaps at fair value through proﬁt and loss.

Monitoring interest rate and foreign currency risk
The Group monitors its interest rate and foreign currency risk by reviewing 
the effect on ﬁnancial instruments over various periods of a range of 
possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates. The Group has 
estimated that an increase of one percentage point in the principal 
ﬂoating interest rates to which it is exposed would result in a charge to 
the income statement of £nil (2016: £1 million). The Group has estimated 
that a weakening of sterling by 10 per cent against gross borrowings 
denominated in foreign currency in which the Group does business 
would result in a charge to equity of £156 million (2016: £177 million).
The Group does not require operating businesses to adhere to a 
formalised risk management policy in respect of trade credit risk or 
commodity price risk and does not consider that there is a useful way 
of quantifying the Group’s exposure to any of the macroeconomic 
variables that might affect the collectability of receivables or the prices 
of commodities.
Credit risk
The Group provides sales on credit terms to most of its customers. 
There is an associated risk that customers may not be able to pay 
outstanding balances. At 31 July 2017, the maximum exposure to credit 
risk was £2,022 million (2016: £2,187 million).
Each of the Group’s businesses have established procedures in place to 
review and collect outstanding receivables. Signiﬁcant outstanding and 
overdue balances are reviewed on a regular basis and resulting actions 
are put in place on a timely basis. In some cases, protection is provided 
through credit insurance arrangements. All of the major businesses 
use professional, dedicated credit teams, in some cases ﬁeld-based. 
Appropriate provisions are made for debts that may be impaired on a 
timely basis. Concentration of credit risk in trade receivables is limited as 
the Group’s customer base is large and unrelated. Accordingly, the Group 
considers that there is no further credit risk provision required above the 
current provision for impairment. 
The Group has cash balances deposited for short periods with ﬁnancial 
institutions and enters into certain contracts (such as interest rate swaps) 
which entitle the Group to receive future cash ﬂows from ﬁnancial 
institutions. These transactions give rise to credit risk on amounts 
due from counterparties with a maximum exposure of £424 million 
(2016: £237 million). This risk is managed by setting credit and settlement 
limits for a panel of approved counterparties. The limits are approved 
by the Treasury Committee and ratings are monitored regularly.
(iii) Additional information on the allotment of equity 
securities for cash
During the year, the Company did not issue any ordinary shares 
to participants in the long term incentive plans and all-employee 
sharesave plans (2016: issued 43,428 ordinary shares with a nominal 
value of 10 
53
/ 66 pence per share).
(iv) Additional information about pensions and other long-term 
employee beneﬁts
Description of plans
The principal UK deﬁned beneﬁt plan is the Wolseley Group Retirement 
Beneﬁts Plan which provides beneﬁts based on ﬁnal pensionable 
salaries. This plan was closed to new entrants in 2009. The assets are 
held in separate trustee administered funds. The Group contribution rate 
is calculated on the Projected Unit Credit Method and agreed with an 
independent consulting actuary. The Group Retirement Beneﬁts Plan 
was closed to future service accrual in December 2013 and was replaced 
by a deﬁned contribution plan. During October 2016, the plan was closed 
for future non-inﬂationary salary accrual. 
The principal plans operated for USA employees are deﬁned contribution 
plans, which are established in accordance with USA 401k rules. 
Companies contribute to both employee compensation deferral and proﬁt 
sharing plans. The Group also operates two deﬁned beneﬁt plans in the 
USA which are closed to new entrants. One of the plans is funded and the 
majority of assets are held in trustee administered funds independent of 
the assets of the companies. The closed plans now provide a minimum 
pension guarantee in conjunction with a deﬁned contribution plan. 
The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit Credit Method 
as agreed with independent consulting actuaries. 
In Canada, deﬁned beneﬁt plans and a deﬁned contribution plan are 
operated. Most of the Canadian deﬁned beneﬁt plans are funded.

The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit Credit Method

In Europe, both deﬁned contribution and deﬁned beneﬁt plans are 
operated. Liabilities arising under deﬁned beneﬁt plans are calculated 
in accordance with actuarial advice.
Investment policy
The Group’s investment strategy for its funded post-employment plans 
is decided locally and, if relevant, by the trustees of the plan and takes 
account of the relevant statutory requirements. The Group’s objective for 
the investment strategy is to achieve a target rate of return in excess of the 
increase in the liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment 
risk relative to the liabilities.
This objective is implemented by using speciﬁc allocations to a variety 
of asset classes that are expected over the long term to deliver the target 
rate of return. Most investment strategies have signiﬁcant allocations to 
equities, with the intention that this will result in the ongoing cost to the 
Group of the post-employment plans being lower over the long-term 
and within acceptable boundaries of risk.
For the UK plan, the buy-in insurance policy represents approximately 
40 per cent of the plan assets. For the remaining assets, the strategy is to 
invest predominantly in growth assets including equities and diversiﬁed 
growth assets. The investment strategy is subject to regular review by 
the plan trustees in consultation with the Company. For the overseas 
plans, the investment strategy involves the investment in deﬁned levels of 
predominantly equities with the remainder of the assets being invested in 
cash and bonds.
Investment risk
The present value of the UK deﬁned beneﬁt plan liability is calculated using 
a discount rate determined by reference to high quality corporate bond 
yields; if the actual return on plan assets is below this rate, it will decrease 
a net surplus or increase a net pension liability. Currently, the plan has a 
relatively balanced investment in equity securities, debt instruments and 
property. Due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities, the trustees of 
the pension plan consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the 
plan assets should be invested in equity securities to leverage the return 
generated by the fund.
Interest risk
A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the UK plan liability 
and this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plan’s 
debt investments.
Longevity risk
The present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is calculated by 
reference to the best estimate of the mortality of the UK plan participants 
both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy 
of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.
(v) Additional information about share-based payment plans
The Group currently operates ﬁve types of discretionary plans and 
two types of all-employee sharesave plans.
Historical awards granted under the executive share option plans are 
subject to a condition such that they may not be exercised unless the 
growth in headline earnings per share over a period of three consecutive 
ﬁnancial years exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the 
same period by at least 9 per cent and consequently vest over a period 
of three years. 
For historical awards granted under the long term incentive plan (“LTIP 
2012”), senior executives were awarded a variable number of shares 
depending on the level of total shareholder return over a three-year 
period relative to that of the FTSE 100. The maximum award under the LTIP 
2012 was determined at grant date and then adjusted at vesting date in 
accordance with the market performance condition. The vesting period 
is three years. 
For awards granted under the new long term incentive plan (“LTIP 2015”) 
senior executives are awarded a variable number of shares depending 
on three equally weighted conditions of: (1) level of total shareholder return 
over a three-year period relative to that of the FTSE 100; (2) growth in 
headline earnings per share over a period of three consecutive ﬁnancial 
years, which must exceed the growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the 
same period by at least 9 per cent; and (3) a cumulative three-year ﬁgure 
of operating cash ﬂow measured against the agreed three-year target. 
The vesting period is three years.
For awards granted to eligible employees (excluding Executive Directors) 
under the ordinary share plan, such employees may be granted a variable 
number of awards in any form or combination of options, restricted 
share awards, conditional share awards or phantom share awards up to 
a maximum of 100 per cent of their current salary. The vesting period is 
typically three years and there are no performance measures other than 
retained employment.
For awards granted to eligible employees (excluding Executive Directors) 
under the performance ordinary share plan, such employees may be 
granted a variable number of awards in any form or combination of 
options, restricted share awards, conditional share awards or phantom 
share awards with a maximum amount typically set at 5 times salary. 
The vesting period is typically three years and the performance period 
relating to the relevant operating business’ performance is typically over a 
three-year period.
For awards granted to eligible employees (excluding Executive Directors) 
under the revised ordinary share plan, such employees may be granted 
a variable number of awards in any form or combination of options, 
restricted share awards, conditional share awards with a maximum amount 
typically set at 3 times salary. The vesting period is typically three years 
and the performance period relating to the relevant operating business’ 
performance is typically over a one-year performance period.
Awards granted under the all-employee sharesave plans vest over periods 
ranging from three to seven years, except for awards granted under the 
Employee Share Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) in the USA and Canada, which 
vest over a one-year period.

127 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Report on the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
Opinion
In our opinion:
 – the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 July 2017 and of the Group’s 
and the parent company’s proﬁt for the year then ended;
 – the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted 
by the European Union;
 – the parent company ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
including Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and
 – the ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law, 1991. 
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of Ferguson plc (the “parent company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) which comprise:
 – the Group Income Statement;
 – the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income;
 – the Parent Company Proﬁt and Loss Account;
 – the Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets;
 – the Group Cash Flow Statement;
 – the Group and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity; 
 – the notes to the Group ﬁnancial statements 1 to 37; and
 – the notes to the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements 1 to 15.
The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group ﬁnancial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company ﬁnancial statements is 
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those 
standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁnancial statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
ﬁnancial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulﬁlled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We conﬁrm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not 
provided to the parent company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
While the parent company is not a public interest entity as deﬁned by European Regulation 537/2014, the Directors have decided that the parent 
company should follow the same requirements as if that Regulation applied to the parent company.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key risks that we identiﬁed in the current year were:
 – Appropriateness of supplier rebates;
 – Inventory provision for slow-moving and obsolete inventory; and
 – Accounting for restructuring costs.
Materiality The materiality that we used in the current year was £45m (2016: £40m) which was determined on the basis of approximately 5% of proﬁt 
before tax excluding exceptional items.
Scoping We performed full audits on the three key regions of continuing businesses, Head office entities and the consolidation process, 
representing 97% (2016: 96%) of revenue, 99% (2016: 86%) of proﬁt before tax and 98% (2016: 99%) of net assets.
Signiﬁcant changes 
in our approach
Our approach is consistent with the previous year with the exception of:
 – the inclusion of an additional key audit matter relating to the accounting for restructuring costs. This relates to the disposal of 
the Nordic region businesses and the restructuring in the UK where judgements are made over the costs categorised as exceptional.
 – the exclusion of the key audit matter relating to goodwill and intangible asset carrying values. Following the impairment charge 
recognised for Beijer and the proposed sale of the Nordic businesses, the judgement over the carrying value of goodwill and 
intangible assets reduced; and 
 – our planned audit scope has changed, taking into consideration changes in the Group structure as a result of completed and 
planned disposals. The Nordic regions (Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway) and Switzerland were subject to full scope audits in 
the previous year. This year the scope has been reduced to analytical procedures.
128 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Independent auditor’s report to the members of Ferguson plc Conclusions related to principal risks, going concern and viability statement
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting contained within note 1 to the 
Financial Statements and the Directors’ statement on the longer-term viability of the Group contained within the principal risks and their management 
section on page 43.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
 – the disclosures on pages 42-49 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
 – the Directors’ conﬁrmation on page 51 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
 – the Directors’ statement in note 1 to the Financial Statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing them and their identiﬁcation of any material uncertainties to the Group and the parent company’s ability to continue 
to do so over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the ﬁnancial statements;
 – the Directors’ explanation on page 43 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualiﬁcations or assumptions; or
 – whether the Directors’ statements relating to going concern and the prospects of the Company required in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) 
are materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We conﬁrm that we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in respect of these matters.
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and we did not identify any such material uncertainties. However, 
because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most signiﬁcance in our audit of the ﬁnancial statements of the 
current period and include the most signiﬁcant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identiﬁed. These matters 
included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the ﬁnancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Appropriateness of supplier rebates 
Key audit matter 
description
As described in the Audit Committee report on page 61 as a signiﬁcant judgement and the Accounting Policies in note 37 to the 
Financial Statements, the Group recognises a reduction in cost of sales as a result of amounts receivable from suppliers in the form of 
rebate arrangements. Where the rebate arrangements are non-tiered arrangements (ﬂat rate), there is limited judgement. However, 
a proportion of the rebate arrangements comprise annual volume rebates, for which the end of the period is often non coterminous 
with the Group’s year-end. Additionally, in some cases the rebate rises as a portion of purchases, as higher quantities or values of the 
purchases are made. 
There is complexity in supplier rebates which give rise to management judgement and scope for fraud and error in accounting for 
this income.
Judgement is required in estimating the expected level of rebates for the rebate year, driven by the forecast purchase volumes. 
This requires a detailed understanding of the speciﬁc contractual arrangements themselves as well as complete and accurate source 
data to apply the arrangements to.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to 
the key audit matter
We assessed the design and implementation of manual and automated controls over the recording of supplier rebate income.
Our procedures on supplier rebates included:
 – evaluating the design and implementation of key controls operating across the Group over the appropriateness of supplier rebates;
 – in certain components, testing the operating effectiveness of the controls relating to supplier rebates;
 – interviewing a sample of Ferguson’s internal buyers to supplement our understanding of the key contractual rebate arrangements;
 – testing the accuracy of the amounts recognised by agreeing a sample to individual supplier agreements;
 – circularising a sample of suppliers to test whether the arrangements recorded were complete;
 – testing the completeness and accuracy of the inputs to the calculations for recording supplier rebates by agreement to supporting 
evidence, including historical volume data. We challenged the assumptions underlying management’s estimates of purchase 
volumes including looking at the historical accuracy of previous estimates and historical purchase trends and recalculation of rebates 
for a sample of suppliers;
 – consider the adequacy of rebate related disclosure within the Group’s ﬁnancial statement;
 – holding discussions with management to understand if there has been any whistleblowing; and
 – testing post year-end cash receipts, where relevant, to test the recoverability of amounts recorded.
Key observations We consider the Group’s estimation methodology to be prudent based on a number of factors, including a look back at historical cash 
receipts. However, the methodology is consistently applied year-on-year and the understatement of rebate income is not material to the 
ﬁnancial position or the reported ﬁnancial result as at 31 July 2017.

129 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Inventory provision for slow-moving and obsolete inventory 
Key audit matter 
description
The Group had inventory of £1,816m at 31 July 2017, held in distribution centres, warehouses and numerous branches, and across 
multiple product lines. Details of its valuation are included in the Audit Committee report on page 61 and the Accounting policies in note 
37 to the Financial Statements.
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. As a result, the Directors apply judgement in determining the 
appropriate values for slow-moving or obsolete items. Inventory is net of a provision of £113m which is primarily driven by comparing 
the level of inventory held to future projected sales.
The provision is calculated within the Group’s accounting systems using an automated process.
We consider the assessment of inventory provisions to require judgement based on the size of the inventory balance held at year-end 
and the manual intervention required in the calculation. There is risk that inappropriate management override and/or error may occur.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to 
the key audit matter
We challenged the appropriateness of management’s assumptions applied in calculating the value of the inventory provisions by:
 – evaluating the design and implementation of key inventory provision controls operating across the Group, including those at a 
sample of distribution centres, warehouses and branches;
 – evaluating the design and implementation of key system controls around the provision calculation and their operating effectiveness;
 – comparing the net realisable value, obtained through a detailed review of sales subsequent to the year-end, to the cost price 
of a sample of inventories and comparison to the associated provision to assess whether inventory provisions are complete;
 – reviewing the historical accuracy of inventory provisioning, and the level of inventory write-offs during the year; and
 – challenging the completeness of inventory provisions through assessing actual and forecast sales of inventory lines to assess 
whether provisions for slow moving or obsolete stock are valid and complete.
Key observations We consider the Group’s provisioning methodology to be prudent when compared with historical levels of inventory write-offs. 
However, the methodology is consistently applied year-on-year and our estimate of the potential overstatement of the provision is not 
material to the ﬁnancial position or the reported result as at 31 July 2017.
Accounting for restructuring costs 
Key audit matter 
description
As described in notes 5 and 8 to the Financial Statements, the Group has announced a restructuring plan for the UK business and the 
disposal of the Nordic region businesses.
The key judgements related to this risk lie in the estimation of the restructuring costs where they may differ from the future obligations. 
By nature, the provision is difficult to estimate and includes many variables. There is a risk that the provision could be underestimated by 
management to minimise the liabilities. Additionally, depending on timing there is a risk that costs could be provided inappropriately that 
are not yet committed.
The impact of strategic reviews within the business and other future events gives rise to a source of estimation uncertainty. The Group 
has recognised a cost of £40m in the year in respect of the UK restructuring, which is reported as an exceptional item in note 5, and 
an additional amount related to the Nordic region businesses, which is shown within discontinued exceptional items (note 8). There is 
a judgement required in determining whether disclosure as an exceptional item is appropriate. The UK business is in phase 2 of the 
restructuring and given the branch closures and expected job losses, there is judgement around the estimated costs.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to 
the key audit matter
Our procedures on restructuring costs included:
 – challenging the key judgements made by management including evaluating the positions taken on which costs were provided for;
 – determining whether what is disclosed as exceptional directly related to the restructuring was incremental;
 – checking the consistency of items included year-on-year and assessing adherence to IFRS requirements and latest Financial 
Reporting Council (“FRC”) guidance;
 – holding discussions with the ﬁnance teams on the provision recorded;
 – testing the provision in place by agreeing it to documentation to assess appropriateness of the level of provisioning; and
 – understanding if any aspects of the restructuring could result in items to be classiﬁed as impaired.
Key observations We consider the restructuring charge recorded in the year to have been appropriately calculated. 
130 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Independent auditor’s report to the members of Ferguson plc continued Our application of materiality
We deﬁne materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the ﬁnancial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably 
knowledgeable person would be changed or inﬂuenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results 
of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the ﬁnancial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality £45m (2016: £40m)
Basis for determining 
materiality
Approximately 5% of proﬁt before tax excluding exceptional items.
The proﬁt before tax excluding exceptional items was £951m, which is £229m lower than the statutory proﬁt of £1,180m.  
The exceptional items we excluded from our determination are non-recurring in nature and explained further in note 5.
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
Proﬁt before tax is a key metric for users of the ﬁnancial statements and adjusting for exceptional items is to reﬂect the manner in which 
business performance is reported and assessed by external users of the ﬁnancial statements.
Audit Committee reporting threshold £2m
£951m £45m
Component materiality range £23m to £36m
Group materiality £45m
PBT excluding exceptionals Group materiality
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £2m (2016: £1m), as well as differences 
below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. This is a change from the prior year where we reported all 
misstatements above £1m. This reﬂects the continued growth in the business.
We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identiﬁed when assessing the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks 
of material misstatement at the Group level. In addition, the understanding gained in our ﬁrst year audit was utilised in scoping our second year audit. 
Based on that assessment we focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at the three key regions of continuing businesses (USA, 
UK and Canada). Full audits were performed in these locations. At the Group level we also tested Head office entities and the consolidation process. 
Of continuing results, this provided coverage of 97% of revenue, 99% of the proﬁt before tax and 98% of the net assets. 
In 2016, Switzerland (Tobler) and the Nordic regions (Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland) were in full audit scope. Following changes to the Group 
structure as a result of completed and planned disposals, Switzerland and the Nordic regions are subject to analytical procedures in the current year, 
which is consistent with the remaining entities in the Group.
Revenue Proﬁt before tax Net assets
 Full audit scope 97% 99% 98%
 Analytical procedures 3% 1% 2%
The Group team is responsible for the Head Office entities in the UK and Switzerland and the consolidation. The Group team carried out analytical 
procedures to conﬁrm our conclusion that there were no signiﬁcant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated ﬁnancial information of the remaining 
components not subject to audit.
The component teams in the USA, UK and Canada perform audit work and report into the Group team.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that a senior member of the Group audit team visits 
each of the most signiﬁcant locations where the Group audit scope was focused every year, being the USA, UK and Canada. Senior members of the 
Group team also visited Denmark. In years when we do not visit a signiﬁcant component we will include the component audit partner in our team brieﬁng, 
send detailed instructions to our component audit teams, discuss their risk assessment, and review documentation of the ﬁndings from their work. 
For all components we attend the local close meetings. 
Strategic report Governance Financials Other information
131 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, other than the 
ﬁnancial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the ﬁnancial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our auditor’s report, 
we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the ﬁnancial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the ﬁnancial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement 
in the ﬁnancial statements or a material misstatement of other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are speciﬁcally required to report to you as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information include where 
we conclude that:
 – Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the Directors that they consider the Annual Report and Financial Statements taken as 
a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
 – Audit Committee reporting – the section describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to 
the audit committee; or
 – Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the Directors’ statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions speciﬁed for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Responsibilities of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and 
for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of ﬁnancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend 
to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error 
and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to inﬂuence the economic decisions of users taken 
on the basis of these ﬁnancial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit for the ﬁnancial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law, 1991. Our audit work has 
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and/or those 
further matters we have expressly agreed to report to them on in our engagement letter and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, 
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Ferguson plc continued Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Opinions on other matters prescribed by our engagement letter
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the provisions of the UK 
Companies Act 2006 as if that Act had applied to the Company.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 – the information given in the strategic report and the Directors’ report for the ﬁnancial year for which the ﬁnancial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the ﬁnancial statements; and
 – the strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and of the parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we have not identiﬁed any material misstatements in the strategic report or the Directors’ report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records 
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law, 1991 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or
 – the ﬁnancial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. 
Directors’ remuneration
We are also required to report, under the Companies Act 2006 (as if that Act had applied to the Company) if in our opinion certain disclosures of 
Directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns. 
We have nothing to report arising from these matters. 
Other matters
Auditor tenure
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the Company on 12 November 2015 to audit the ﬁnancial statements 
for the year ending 31 July 2016 and subsequent ﬁnancial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and 
reappointments of the ﬁrm is two years, covering periods from our appointment to 31 July 2017.
Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the Audit Committee
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee we are required to provide in accordance with ISAs (UK).

Company balance sheet
Year ended 31 July 2017 1 – Corporate information
Ferguson plc (the “Company”) was incorporated and registered in 
Jersey on 28 September 2010 under the Jersey Companies Law as 
a public company limited by shares under the name Ferguson plc with 
registered number 106605. The principal legislation under which the 
Company operates is the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended, 
and regulations made thereunder. The address of its registered 
office is 26 New Street, St Helier, Jersey, JE2 3RA, Channel Islands. 
It is headquartered in Switzerland.
The principal activity of the Company is to act as the ultimate holding 
company of the Ferguson Group of companies.
The Company changed its name from Wolseley plc to Ferguson plc 
on 31 July 2017.
2 – Company accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The Company meets the deﬁnition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 
(Financial Reporting Standard 100) issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council (“FRC”). Accordingly, the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with FRS 101 (Financial Reporting Standard 101) “Reduced 
Disclosure Framework” as issued by the FRC. 
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the 
disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to share-
based payments, ﬁnancial instruments, capital management, presentation 
of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a 
cash ﬂow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and 
related party transactions.
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis 
and on the going concern basis.
Note 4 (Operating proﬁt) on page 95, note 9 (Dividends) on page 98, 
note 27 (Share capital) on page 113, note 28 (Share-based payments) 
on page 114 and note 36 (Post-balance sheet events) on page 119 of 
the Ferguson plc consolidated ﬁnancial statements form part of these 
ﬁnancial statements.
Foreign currencies
The ﬁnancial statements are presented in sterling which was the functional 
currency of the Company at 31 July 2017.
The cost of the Company’s investments in overseas subsidiary 
undertakings is translated into sterling at the rate ruling at the date 
of investment.
Foreign currency transactions entered into during the year are 
translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates of 
the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date. All currency translation differences are charged or credited 
to retained earnings.
Investments in subsidiaries
Fixed asset investments are recorded at cost less provision for impairment. 
The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there 
is objective evidence that an investment or a group of investments 
is impaired.
Cash at bank and in-hand
Cash at bank and in-hand includes cash in-hand and deposits held 
with banks which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. 
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the 
balance sheet to the extent there is no right of offset or intention to net 
settle with cash balances.
Share capital
The Company has one class of shares, ordinary shares, which are 
classiﬁed as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue 
of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the 
proceeds, net of tax.
Where the Company or one of the Company’s trusts purchases the 
Company’s equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any 
directly attributable incremental costs (net of tax), is deducted from equity 
attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled, 
reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently disposed 
or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable 
incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in 
equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
Share-based payments
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Company’s 
executive share option, long term incentive and share purchase and 
ordinary share plans. The Company recognises a compensation cost 
in respect of these plans that is based on the fair value of the awards, 
measured using Binomial and Monte Carlo valuation methodologies. 
For equity-settled plans, the fair value is determined at the date of grant 
(including the impact of non-vesting conditions such as requirement 
for employees to save) and is not subsequently remeasured unless the 
conditions on which the award was granted are modiﬁed. Generally, the 
compensation cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period. Adjustments are made to reﬂect expected and actual forfeitures 
during the vesting period due to the failure to satisfy service conditions 
or achieve non-market performance conditions.
Dividends payable
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in the Company’s ﬁnancial 
statements in the period in which the dividends are paid or approved by 
the shareholders of the Company.
Tax
Ferguson plc is taxed as a holding company in Switzerland so no tax is 
due at cantonal or communal level. The tax charge is therefore made 
up of federal tax and capital tax. Federal tax is levied on proﬁts in the 
year subject to any participation exemption for qualifying dividends from 
subsidiaries. Capital tax is based on the value of the Company’s assets, 
primarily its investment in Wolseley Limited and Ferguson Holdings 
(Switzerland) AG.

Dividend payment methods
1. Direct payment to your bank: You are encouraged to receive your dividends directly to your bank or building society account. This is more 
convenient and helps reduce the risk of cheques becoming lost or delayed in the post. The associated dividend conﬁrmation will still be sent 
direct to your registered address. To switch to this method of payment you can download a dividend mandate form from the Shareview website  
(www.shareview.co.uk). Alternatively, you can contact Equiniti by telephone who will also be able to assist with any questions you may have.
2. Overseas payment service: If you live overseas, Equiniti offers an Overseas Payment Service which is available in certain countries. This may make 
it possible to receive dividends direct into your bank account in your local currency*. Further information can be found on the Ferguson plc website, 
Shareview website or you can contact Equiniti by telephone. 
3. Dividend Reinvestment Plan (“DRIP”): The Company offers a DRIP which gives shareholders the opportunity to use their dividend to purchase 
further Ferguson shares. Instead of receiving cash, shareholders receive as many whole shares as can be bought with their dividend, taking into 
account related purchase costs. Any residual cash will be carried forward and added to their next dividend. 
If you wish to join the DRIP , you can download copies of the DRIP terms and conditions and the DRIP mandate form from the Shareview website. 
Simply complete the DRIP mandate form and return it to Equiniti. Should you have any questions on the DRIP or wish for a paper mandate form to be 
sent to you, please contact Equiniti on 0371 384 2934. Please note that if you wish to join the DRIP in time for the 2017 ﬁnal dividend, our Registrars, 
Equiniti, must have received the instruction by 10 November 2017. Instructions received by Equiniti after this date will be applied to the next dividend.
* Please note that a payment charge would be deducted from each individual payment before conversion into your local currency.

Paper
This report is printed on Revive 50 Silk paper and cover 
board, with Revive 100 offset used in the ﬁnancial section. 
Revive 50 Silk is made from 25 per cent de-inked post-
consumer waste, 25 per cent unprinted pre-consumer 
waste and 50 per cent virgin ﬁbre.
Revive 100 offset is made from 100 per cent de-inked 
post consumer waste. Both products are fully biodegradable 
and recyclable and produced in mills which hold IS0 9001 
and ISO 14001 accreditation.
Printing 
Printed by Pureprint Group. The printing inks are made with non-
hazardous vegetable oil from renewable sources. Over 95 per 
cent of solvents and developers are recycled for further use and 
recycling initiatives are in place for all other waste associated with 
this production. Pureprint Group is FSC® with strict procedures in

The greenhouse gas emissions from the production and 
distribution of this Annual Report and Accounts have been 
neutralised through The Gold Standard Basa Magogo offsetting 
project in South Africa. 
The ﬁrst Gold Standard project of its kind in the world, this 
innovative behaviour-change programme teaches local 
communities in South Africa to burn coal differently in order 
to be more fuel efficient, thereby reducing carbon emissions. 
The technique, called Basa Magogo, means “Light it up! 
Grandmother” in Zulu. In addition to the emission reductions, 
the Basa Magogo technique also improves visibility and reduces 
health risks by producing less smoke. Ferguson plc
