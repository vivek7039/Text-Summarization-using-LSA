The Drozhilovskoye molybdenum-tungsten deposit
is located in the Denisovski rayon of the
Kostanayskaya oblast, 55km north east of Zhitigara
and 31km North West of the rayon center,
Denisovka. The small settlement of Okrainka lies
some 4km from the deposit.
The deposit area covers approximately 6.6km
2
.
In addition to the molybdenum and tungsten
content, the deposit also contains significant
quantities of lithium.
Since the deposit was discovered in 1964,
considerable exploration work has taken place
culminating in the most recent resource statement
undertaken in 2005 (using the former Soviet Union
resource and reserve classification system common
in Central Asia), which estimated a GKZ approved
Category C1 and C2 resource estimate for the
northern stockwork of 37.2Mt at 0.107%
molybdenum and 0.086% tungsten trioxide.
This assumed a 0.05% molybdenum equivalent
cut-off grade. Importantly, the first resource
estimate undertaken in 1974 defined a GKZ
approved estimate for the whole deposit at a C2
category of approximately 140Mt at 0.188%
molybdenum. Subsequently additional drilling has
been completed and the updated  February 2013
GKZ resource estimate is presented in the Chief
Executive Officer’s report.

Smirnovskoye
The Smirnovskoye deposit is located in the
Karabalyksky rayon, 120km north west of the
Kostanay oblast and some 41km north of Karabalyk,
the district centre in northern Kazakhstan. The
village of Smirnovka is in the immediate vicinity of
the deposit. The deposit area covers approximately
13.7km
2
.
The deposit has been divided into a larger northern
and a smaller southern zone. Within both zones, the
principal ore mineral is molybdenite which is
associated with chalcopyrite and pyrite. 
The deposit has been studied in less detail than
Drozhilovskoye, although a 1996, GKZ approved,
resource estimate produced a combined Category
C1 and C2 resource for both the larger northern
and smaller southern zones of approximately
109Mt at a grade of 0.1378% molybdenum using a
0.05% molybdenum equivalent cut-off grade.
A further estimate was undertaken in 2007 which
gave an estimate of 108Mt at a grade of 0.1056%
molybdenum using the same cut-off grade.
Subsequently, additional drilling has been
undertaken and the updated February 2013 GKZ
resource estimate is presented in the Chief
Executive Officer’s report.

Areas of exploration “The patience of shareholders
will be rewarded as we move
towards the production phase. ”
During the year the extension to the original
licence was approved for Smirnovskoye, and the
licence extension is valid until September 2019.
In relation to Drozhilovskoye, we do not see any
issues in obtaining the license as we have
satisfied all the requests for information from the
relevant ministry.  Administrative delays have
held up the licence and we are now expecting to
receive the signed licence in Q2 2018.   
The Company is now in a new phase of
development and moving towards production.
We have entered into talks with interested parties
in particular with China Molybdenum which has
expertise in processing our particular minerals.
The economics of moving to production have
changed as commodity prices have stabilised and
with the inclusion of Lithium in the profit
generation models the projects are more
economically viable.
One of the key steps moving forward is to update
and more clearly define the resources.  The
Company undertook exploration drilling in Q1
2018 at the Drozhilovskoye site, the results of
which were very encouraging, (as announced by
the Company on 19 March 2018). This drilling was
undertaken by an external geological firm and
the results of which will prove useful in bringing
partners on board to develop the site.  In
addition a Competent Persons Report is shortly
to be commissioned under the JORC code.  This
will provide further external verification of the
resources on both sites.
We are keen to press forward with the plans for
development.  The sourcing of a partner that has
skill and expertise in this area is seen as
extremely beneficial to moving the plans
forward.
Exploration drilling
The Company undertook exploration drilling
in Q1 2018 at the Drozhilovskoye site, the
results of which were very encouraging. 
In terms of funding the Company has sufficient
operational funds from its existing facility with
Amrita Investments.  The Company will seek to
source developmental funds as the project
moves forward and the quantum of funding
requirement becomes more transparent. 
The Board wishes to thank the shareholders for
their patience and we are confident of looking
forward to a productive 2018 as the Company
develops.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REPORT
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
“The Company is in the process of
analysing the latest drilling results,
with the next step to refine the
production techniques and
subject to sourcing additional
funding, establish a pilot plant for
production at a later stage.”
Overview
As an update on the licences:
 The extension to the Smirnovskoye licence and
associated work programmes was agreed with
the Kazakh authorities and the licence extended
to September 2019.
 The extension to the Drozhilovskoye licence and
associated work programmes is with the Kazakh
authorities, and is in the final administrative
stages of sign off.  Final sign is expected in
Q2 2018, and the licence extension will run for
2 years from the date of signing.  
The Company has been moving forward with the
development of the sites with a view to moving to
production.  The initial starting point is the analysis
of samples that were extracted at Drozhilovskoye.
Once this has been completed and the
technological basis for extracting the three
principal minerals Molybdenum, Tungsten and
Lithium from the ore a production plan will be
established.  It is envisaged subject to sourcing
additional funding, that a pilot plant will be
established with an initial run rate of 300,000t or
ore per annum.  The full production plant will be
significantly higher than this at approx. 3mt of ore
being processed.  
Exploration Work Update
The latest drilling and analysis work clarified the
geological structure of the Drozhilovskoye field and
confirmed that the tungsten and molybdenum
minerals are isolated, and that they can be
selectively mined. The work also confirmed the
presence of significant amounts of high quality
lithium. The work undertaken by the Company
internally has allowed a re-estimation of the
contained metal content of both molybdenum and
tungsten resources and provides a first estimate for
the lithium resource (all with a cut-off grade of
0.05%). The drilling consisted of number of bore
holes, totaling 534 metres and 417 samples were
taken for analytical review.  Please refer to the
Company’s RNS dated 19 March 2018 for further
information.
Further development of the asset
The Company’s lead specialists recently visited
Chinese research institutes to familiarise themselves
with the technology and discuss the detailed
procedures for processing molybdenum, tungsten
and lithium ores, and to deliver a presentation on
Kemin. 
The trip also involved a visit to an operating plant
for the beneficiation of molybdenum, tungsten and
lithium ores with the end product being flotation
concentrates of three different types of metal, i.e.
molybdenum, tungsten and lithium. The deposits
of the Drozhilovskoye field are regarded by
management to be very similar to the ores being
processed at that plant. 
This plant visited is owned by China Molybdenum,
which is the largest molybdenum mining company
in China. During the meeting, China Molybdenum
showed interest in the Drozhilovskoye field and
discussions were held in relation to a possible joint
development of the field. These initial discussions
centered on development via open pit mining, and
situation of the production complex close to good
rail links and power supplies.  This, together with
the presence of lithium, and other minerals,
indicated from the test drilling conducted, makes
the development of the field attractive to a partner,
and further discussions are planned to take place.
The following work needs to be carried out to
transition to the production phase:
 Completion of a mineral block model and
resource estimation.  As part of the process of
moving to the next stage of development the
Company will instruct a Competent Persons
Report in accordance with the JORC code, for
both sites.;
 Approval of the reserves by the Kazakh
authorities;
 Further geological exploration through drilling
confirmatory boreholes and taking further
samples for process testing and determining an
efficient technology for the extraction of
molybdenum, tungsten and lithium;
 Subject to sourcing additional funding, the
process testing will be followed by construction
of a pilot beneficiation plant with a proposed
processing capacity of 300kt per year, and which
will produce a concentrate of molybdenite,
tungsten and a concentrate of lithium;
 Completion of a feasibility study to confirm all
technical and financial results including using
the design of the pilot beneficiation plant to
develop, subject to sourcing additional funding.
A beneficiation plant with ore processing
capacity of 3.0mt per year.  Funding
Funding requirements are being assessed to
determine what additional funding is required in
the first instance in relation to the construction of
the pilot plant.
The costs of the work programs for both sites totals
approximately £2.3m for the two year licence
period.   
The Company has sufficient cash resources
available under its current facility arrangements
with Amrita (£4.5million of which is still available for
drawdown) to perform the work programmes as
currently specified.  However dependent on future
plans and in particular the setting up and operation
of a pilot plant, further funds may be raised
through equity/debt finance. During this
non-productive phase the Company will maintain a
tight control of costs in order to maintain cash
resources.  
In relation to development funding to move to the
production stage, the Company is currently
exploring and developing plans to obtain further
lines of funding, once a firmer budgeted cost of
developing the pilot plant, and production
techniques are refined. 
Summary
The Company is in advanced talks with interested
parties who have been encouraged by the recent
drill results.  The expectation is that an agreement
will be reached to progress the development of the
sites, with the aim to move towards production in
the near future initially on a pilot plant basis
Financial performance review
The consolidated loss attributable to Kemin
shareholders in the twelve months ended
31 December 2017 was £463,000 (FY 2016:
£432,000). The overall loss including that
attributable to minority shareholders was £484,000
(2016:£445,000).  The costs of servicing the debt
and administrative costs of the Group were in line
with expectations.  Of the loss £356,000 is
attributable to the head office, being administrative
costs of which the majority relates to maintaining
the professional fees and associated fees for
maintaining the London listing on the London
Stock Exchange. In addition certain costs are
incurred in supporting the administrative function
in Kazakhstan.  They have been maintained at
competitive levels. 
The other principal expense relates to finance
charges which total £287,000, (2016 £287,000). The
interest accrued on the loan in the current year has
been capitalised against the loan balance.  
As in the prior year the cash spend is kept to a
minimum at present with a limited capital
expenditure programme.  The principal cash
expenses have related to servicing the head office
administrative function, interest charges and loan
repayments have been deferred until cash
resources allow them to be repaid. It is the
intention to move forward with sample testing with
the aim of raising the necessary funds to develop
the pilot plant in the near term.
Support is still being obtained from the principal
shareholder via Amrita Investments Ltd. The current
cash balances and availability of further draw
downs (£4.5million left to drawdown) on the
Amrita loan facility if required, provides sufficient
funds for the company to continue to meet its
current obligations.
Cost control
Overall costs have been maintained in line
with the prior year. The Company is currently
developing its longer term plans of
development.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks exposed to the Company are:
 availability of future funding outside of the
Amrita facility;
 political and economic environment;
 fluctuation in commodity prices;
 financial risk;
 the resource differing in grade and quantity to
that predicted by feasibility studies; and
 fluctuations in exchange rates resulting from
changes in the value of the Kazakh Tenge.

Mitigation of risks and uncertainties
The Company’s management has analysed the risks
and uncertainties and monitors the risks as far as it
is practical do so given the early development of
the Company.
Certain factors are beyond the control of the
Company such as the fluctuations in the price of
the commodities . However the Group is aware of
these factors and tries to mitigate them as far as
possible. The plan is to move forward with test
production to encompass the production of
Lithium in the overall plan, which increases the
economics of the overall project. 
The Company cannot control the political and
economic environment of the country in which the
resources are based. However, to minimise the risk,
Kemin maintains close relationships with the
Kazakhstan authorities in order to minimise
bureaucratic delays and problems.
In the future as funds are required in order to move
to the next stage of development it is the
Company’s aim is to fix interest rates, where
possible, with the preferred option being to raise
funds via equity. As stated the Company has
sufficient working capital facilities at present to
meet its current cash flow requirements.
The Company has used independent consultants
experienced in resource reports, of the type
required by the Group, to mitigate as far as possible
any material changes in the resource estimates.
Key performance indicators
Given the stage of development of the Company,
the key performance indicators used by the
management for monitoring progress and strategic
objectives for the business are set out below:
The change in the value of the exploration
expenditure is due principally to the effect of the
change in valuation of the Kazakh Tenge against
Sterling.
The key statistic is the level of resources which has
been measured under the GKZ classification, and
will be updated shortly under JORC (2012) by an
independent consultancy once the additional
exploration and evaluation work is completed.
Given the stage of development of the Group, it
has a low number of employees who are
concentrated in the head office. Details of the
Group policy on employees are given on page 9.

Kemin Resources Plc
Annual Report 2017
Strategic Report Governance Strategic report Financial statements The Directors present their report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.
Principal activity and business review
The principal activity of the Company is that of an exploration and mine development company with a trading subsidiary in Kazakhstan. A review of the business
and future prospects is contained in the Strategic report, which includes information on the Company’s principal risks and uncertainties and performance
indicators to the extent they are relevant at this stage of the Company’s development. Although the financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis,
reference should be made to the ability of the Company to continue trading as noted below.
Going concern and the availability of project finance
The Group’s principal assets are the molybdenum and tungsten deposits at Drozhilovskoye and Smirnovskoye in Kazakhstan. The exploration and evaluation work
conducted so far indicate substantial economic exploitable reserves. This work was further enhanced by additional drilling in Q1 2018, which revealed the
presence of significant amounts of Lithium.
At current and projected future projected prices of the commodities the indicative NPV is positive.
There has been significant interest, in particular from a Chinese based Company (China Molybdenum), with a view to finalising an offtake agreement for
purchasing an initial trial batch. Subject to sourcing the necessary funding the Company is in the process of developing plans to put in place a pilot plant, with the
intention to move forward to commercial production after an assessment of the initial production results.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group had cash on hand of £16,000 (2016: £59,000) and at the reporting date the Group’s liabilities exceeded its assets by £2,991,000
(2016: £2,473,000).
The parent Company has an agreement with Amrita Investment Limited, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and ultimately controlled by the
Assaubayev family, under this facility, there is an amount of approximately £4.5m available to be applied towards working capital requirements.
The initial loan of £7m was entered into on 4 February 2013 and was repayable on the earlier of the fifth anniversary of the agreement or when an equity
fundraising is undertaken that raises at least £5,000,000 (before expenses) at which point the Lender may choose to convert the loan into the ordinary shares of
the Company at the conversion rates stipulated by the agreement. The loan was extended in May 2018 to 4 February 2020, under the same terms and conditions
of the original loan.
The Directors anticipate that while they may seek to raise further finance in the future it now has access to sufficient funds for its immediate need, and have
therefore prepared these financial statements on a going concern basis.

Service contracts
The Non-Executive Directors have contracts with a rolling one-month notice period which may be given by either party.
The Company’s policy on Executive Director Remuneration is to attract and retain high quality executives by paying competitive remuneration packages relevant
to each Director’s role and experience and the external market.
The key management personnel comprises the Directors.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held at the offices of BDO LLP at 55 Baker Street, London, W1U 7EU, United Kingdom on Friday 29 June 2018
at 9.30 am.
The details of the resolutions are given on page 37. The Directors consider that all of the resolutions to be put to the meeting are in the best interests of the
Company and its shareholders as a whole. The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of all resolutions.
At the meeting the “serious loss of capital” , where the net assets of the company are half or less than the called up share capital will be discussed.
It should be noted that the statutory provision under the 2006 Act relating to “serious loss of capital” imposes no immediate consequent risk given the current
solvency of the company’s balance sheet and cash flow. No specific proposals or agenda are being proposed at the General Meeting, but the matter will be open
for discussion and questions from Shareholders in accordance with the 2006 Act. There are no additional requirements under the 2006 Act other than raising the
matter at a general meeting. As stated above, the Company is currently renewing one of the licenses and is in discussions with interested parties with a view to
moving the project forward.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Kemin Resources Plc
Annual Report 2017
Governance Strategic report Financial statements
09 Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to prepare the group and
company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the
directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and company and
of the profit or loss of the group for that period. The directors are also required to prepare financial statements in accordance with the rules of the London Stock
Exchange for companies trading securities on AIM.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
p select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
p make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
p state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements;
p prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s transactions and disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the requirements of
the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual Report and the financial statements are made available on a website. Financial statements are published on
the Company’s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which may
vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The directors’
responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.
Communications with shareholders are considered important by the Directors. The Directors regularly speak to investors and analysts during the year.
Press releases have been issued throughout the year, a website www.keminresources.com is regularly updated and contains a wide range of information about the
Company.
Corporate governance
The Directors are aware of the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) as published by the Financial Reporting Council which is applicable to all premium
listed companies on the London Stock Exchange. Given its listing on AIM, the Company is not required to comply with the Code, so this report does not describe
the compliance with or departure from the Code. However, the Directors have a responsibility for the overall corporate governance and recognise the highest
standards of behavior and accountability so they have put in place appropriate governance structures and provide information which would be expected for
companies listed on AIM having regard to the size of the Group.
Board composition and committees
The Board has a wide range of experience directly relevant to the Group and its activities and its structure ensures that no one individual or group dominates the
decision making.
At each Annual General Meeting, one third of the Directors must retire by rotation, whereupon they can offer themselves for re-election if eligible.
The Company has established an Audit Committee which is responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the Group is properly reported and
monitored, considering and setting adequate and appropriate accounting policies and reviewing the Auditor’s report. The Audit Committee comprises two
Directors Non-Executive Vice Chairman Ashar Qureshi who is the Chairman of the audit Committee, (who has the casting vote in a deadlock situation), and 
Non-Executive Neil Herbert.
Internal controls
The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Group’s system of internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness.
The procedures which include, inter alia, financial, operational and compliance matters and risk management are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The internal
control system can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Directors do not believe an internal audit
function is practicable for a company of this size.
Likely future developments
Details of likely future developments are set out in the Chief Executive Officer’s Report.
Subsequent events
Details of events after the end of the financial year are set out in note 19 on page 36 of the financial statements.

10 Auditors
All of the current Directors have taken all of the steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any information needed by the Company’s
auditors for the purpose of their audit and to establish that the auditors are aware of this information. The Directors are not aware of any relevant audit information
of which the auditors are unaware.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of S418(2) of the Companies Act 2006.
BDO LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditors and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed in the forthcoming Annual General
Meeting.

11 Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Kemin Resources Plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) for the year ended 31 December 2017
which comprise the consolidated statement of profit or loss, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of financial
position, the company statement of financial position, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the company statement of changes in equity, the
consolidated statement of cash flows, the company statement of cash flows and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting
policies.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion:
p the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the group’s loss
for the year then ended;
p the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
p the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied in
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
p the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are
further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the parent company and
the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as
applied to listed entities and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
p the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
p the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the group’s or the parent
company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial
statements are authorised for issue.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and
include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on
the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context
of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key audit matter that the carrying value of the Group’s exploration assets require impairment
As at 31 December 2017, the group’s exploration and evaluations assets comprising the Smirnovskoye field (contract 1605) and the Drozhilovskoye field
(contract 1606) formed a significant part of the financial position and were carried at £2.3m as shown in note 9. 
At each reporting period end, Management and the Board are required to assess the exploration and evaluation assets for indicators of impairment and, where
such indicators exist, perform an impairment test. 
Given the significance of the exploration and evaluation assets on the Group’s statement of financial position and the significant management judgement
involved in the assessment of the carrying values of the assets, including the consideration of issues affecting the continuing legal title to the asset, it is
considered to be a key audit matter.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS

12 Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit and in evaluating the effect of misstatements. We consider materiality to be the
magnitude by which misstatements, including omissions, could influence the economic decisions of reasonable users that are taken on the basis of the financial
statements.  Importantly, misstatements below these levels will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also take account of the nature of identified
misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating their effect on the financial statements as a whole.
Materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at £50,000, being 2% of total assets (2016: £50,000). We consider total assets to be the most
relevant consideration of the group’s financial performance as the group continues to focus on oil and gas exploration. Materiality for the parent company financial
statements was set at £45,000, being 2% of total assets (2016: £45,000).
In performing the audit we applied a lower level of performance materiality in order to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of
uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds financial statement materiality. Each significant component of the Group including the parent company was
audited using a lower level of performance materiality ranging from £30,000 to £32,000 (2016: £20,000 to £25,000).
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the committee all individual audit differences in excess of £2,500 (2016: £2,000). We also agreed to
report differences below this threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the group and its environment and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial
statements at the group level. 
The Group’s operations principally comprise exploration & evaluation of mining assets located in Kazakhstan. We assessed there to be 2 significant components
comprising Joint Venture Kazakh-Russian Mining Company LLP (KRMC) and the parent company.
These locations, which were subject to full scope audit procedures represent the principal business units.
A non-BDO member firm performed a full scope audit of Joint Venture Kazakh-Russian Mining Company LLP (KRMC) in Kazakhstan, under our direction and
supervision as group auditors under ISA 600. The audit of the parent company and the group consolidation were performed in the United Kingdom by BDO LLP . 
As part of our audit strategy, as group auditors: 
p Detailed group reporting instructions were sent to the component auditor, which included the significant areas to be covered by the audit (including areas
that were considered to be key audit matters as detailed above).
p We performed a review of the Kazakhstan component audit files and held meetings with the component audit team during the planning and completion
phases of their audit.
p The group audit team was actively involved in the direction of the audits performed by the component auditors, along with the consideration of findings and
determination of conclusions drawn. We performed our own additional procedures in respect of the significant risk areas that represented Key Audit Matters in
addition to the procedures performed by the component auditor.
The remaining components of the group were considered non-significant and these components were principally subject to analytical review procedures to
confirm there are no significant risks of material misstatements within these components. 
How the matter was addressed in our audit
We evaluated Management and Board’s assessment of whether there were any facts or circumstances that would suggest that the assets would not be
recoverable. We critically challenged the considerations made of whether or not there were any indicators of impairment. Our specific audit testing in this
regard included:
p Confirming that the group holds a valid right to explore the Smirnovskoye field. 
p Discussing with Management the position with the renewal of the subsoil contract for the Drozhilovskoye. 
p Confirming that the Group has a right to extend to the subsoil contract under the terms of the license and the respective mining code. 
p Reviewing correspondence with the government and confirmed that the Group complied with the existing exploration subsoil contracts extension
procedure for the Drozhilovskoye field (contract 1606), that the requested amendments requested by the government has been made to the plans and
that the government had agreed in principle the work programme for the project. 
p We have noted that the Group has breached various contract terms. Our review of legal correspondence indicated that instances of non-compliance were
relatively minor and that no further action will be taken by the authorities if they are remedied. We confirmed it is within the Group’s control given their
current resources to remedy the breaches and that they will do so on the finalisation of Drozhilovskoye contract renewal; 
p We reviewed Board minutes, made specific inquiries of management and reviewed budgets and work programs submitted to the Kazakh authorities to
confirm the Group’s intention to explore the license area; and
p We checked the results of the drilling programme post year-end and considered whether these would not have a detrimental affect on the commercial
assessments of the projects.

Governance Strategic report Financial statements
13 Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial
statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise
explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we
identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial
statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of
this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
p the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the
financial statements; and
p the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not
identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
p adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited
by us; or
p the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
p certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
p we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being
satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern,
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the
group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted
in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at:
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the parent company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  Our audit work has
been undertaken so that we might state to the parent company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other
purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the parent company and the parent company’s
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Kemin Resources Plc
Annual Report 2017
COMPANY STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
year ended 31 December 2017
Governance Strategic report Financial statements
21 1.    Accounting policies
Nature of operations and general information
The Group’s principal activity is that of mining, exploration and mine development. The parent company principal activity is managing the trade and the
investment of its subsidiary company. It is incorporated in England and Wales and has its registered office and business address at 28 Eccleston Square, London,
SW1V 1NZ. The shares of Kemin Resources Plc are quoted on the AIM market which is operated by the London Stock Exchange.
Basis of preparation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are for the year ended 31 December 2017. They have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set
out below.
The Group prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis, except for the treatment of certain financial instruments. They are
presented in Pounds Sterling which is the functional currency of the parent, the functional currency of the subsidiary is the Kazakh Tenge and the figures are
rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000) except where otherwise noted.
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with adopted IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires Group
management to exercise judgment in applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas where significant judgments are estimates have been made in preparing
the financial statements and their effect are disclosed in note 2.
Going concern
The Group’s principal assets are the molybdenum and tungsten deposits at Drozhilovskoye and Smirnovskoye in Kazakhstan. The exploration and evaluation work
conducted so far indicate substantial economic exploitable reserves. This work was further enhanced by additional drilling in Q1 2018, which revealed the
presence of significant amounts of Lithium.
At current and projected future projected prices of the commodities the indicative NPV is positive.
There has been significant interest, in particular from a Chinese based Company, with a view to finalising an offtake agreement for purchasing an initial trial batch.
Subject to sourcing additional funding the Company is in the process of developing plans to put in place a pilot plant, with the intention to move forward to
commercial production after an assessment of the initial production results.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group had cash on hand of £16,000 (2016: £59,000) and at the reporting date the Group’s liabilities exceeded its assets by £2,991,000
(2016:£2,473,000).
The parent Company has an agreement with Amrita Investment Limited, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and ultimately controlled by the
Assaubayev family, under this facility, there is an amount of approximately £4.5m available to be applied towards working capital requirements.
The initial loan of £7m was entered into on 4 February 2013 and was repayable on the earlier of the fifth anniversary of the agreement or when an equity
fundraising is undertaken that raises at least £5,000,000 (before expenses) at which point the Lender may choose to convert the loan into the ordinary shares of
the Company at the conversion rates stipulated by the agreement. The loan was extended in May 2018 to 4 February 2020, under the same terms and conditions
of the original loan.
The Directors anticipate that while they may seek to raise further finance in the future it now has access to sufficient funds for its immediate need, and have
therefore prepared these financial statements on a going concern basis.
New accounting standards and amendments
The Group has adopted all of the new and revised Standards and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that are relevant to
its operations and effective for accounting periods beginning 1 January 2017. The adoption of these new and revised Standards and interpretations had no
material effect on the profit or loss or financial position of the Group.
The Group has not adopted any Standards or Interpretations in advance of the required implementation dates.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and relevant interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial
statements, were in issue but not yet effective (all standards have been endorsed by the EU):
lFRS 9 Financial Instruments
lFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts
IFRS 16 Leases
The only standard that is anticipated to be significant or relevant to the Group is IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” . This new standard will replace the existing
accounting standards IAS39. It is applicable to financial assets and liabilities and will introduce changes to existing accounting concerning classification,
measurement and impairment. The revised standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the results.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
year ended 31 December 2017
22 1.    Accounting policies continued
New accounting standards and amendments continued
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ is not expected to have a material impact on the Group at this stage of the Group’s operations. The revenue
contracts held by the Group usually contain a single performance criteria that is satisfied at a point in time. The Group will adopt the above standards at the time
stipulated by that standard. The Group does not at this time anticipate voluntary early adoption of any of the standards.
IFRS 16 will require the recognition of an asset and liability with respect to the material operating lease commitments it is not expected to have a material impact
on the Group at this stage of the Group’s operations.
Basis of consolidation
Where the Company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. The Company controls an investee if all three of the following elements are present:
power over the investee, exposure to variable returns from the investee, and the ability of the investor to use its power to affect those variable returns. Control is
reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control.
The consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) as if they formed a single entity. Intercompany
transactions and balances between group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the acquisition method. In the statement of financial position, the
acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of the acquired
operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained until control ceases.
Capital reorganisation between JV Kazakhstan-Russian Mining Company LLP (KRMC) and Kemin Resources Plc
In 2013 the Company completed the acquisition of 90 per cent of the participatory interests in the charter capital of JV Kazakhstan-Russian Mining Company LLP
(‘KRMC’), a company registered in the Republic of Kazakhstan, in a share for share exchange.
At the time of the transaction the Company was a non-operating public shell company with nominal net assets and did not meet the definition of a business. This
transaction is therefore not a business combination, as defined by IFRS 3, and has been accounted for as a capital transaction resulting in issuance of shares by
KRMC for the net monetary assets of the Company accompanied by recapitalisation. Such transactions fall within the scope of IFRS 2 which requires the deemed
shares issued by KRMC to be recognised at fair value.
Although not a business combination, the accounting result is similar to that obtained by accounting for the transaction under the reverse accounting method,
but it does not result in the recognition of goodwill.
The following accounting treatment has been applied in respect of the above capital reorganisation:
p the assets and liabilities of the legal subsidiary, KRMC, are recognised and measured in the consolidated financial statements at the pre-combination carrying
amounts without restatement to fair value;
p the deemed cost of the shares issued by the Company represents the fair value of the shares that KRMC would have had to issue for the ratio of ownership
interest in the combined entity to be the same, if the transaction had taken the legal form of KRMC acquiring 90% of the shares in Kemin;
p the retained deficit and other equity balances recognised in the consolidated financial statements reflect the retained deficit and other equity balances of
KRMC immediately before the business combination, and the results of the period from the date of the reorganisation are those of KRMC and Kemin
combined;
p the equity structure appearing in the consolidated financial statements reflects the equity structure of the legal parent, Kemin Resources Plc, including the
equity interests the legal parent issued to effect the combination.
Segmental reporting
In the opinion of the Directors, who are regarded as the chief operating decision maker, the Company has one business activity, being the exploration for, and
development of the molybdenum, copper and tungsten deposits in Kazakhstan.
The Board of Directors consider there to be only one operating segment, the exploration and development of mineral resources and only one geographical
segment, being Kazakhstan. Therefore no additional segmental information is presented.
Foreign currency translation
Transactions entered into by the Group entities in currencies other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate (their
“functional currency”) are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occurred. The functional currency of KMRC is the Kazakh Tenge which is the currency
of KMRC’s primary economic environment in which it operates, the functional currency of the parent is the British Pound. Foreign currency monetary assets and
liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are
recognised immediately in profit or loss. Retranslation of dollar denominated loans in the subsidiary are taken to the profit and loss account and shown in finance
expenses.

Foreign currency translation continued
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into Sterling at rates approximating to those ruling when the transactions took place. The loans
to the subsidiary are treated as part of the net investment in the subsidiary and the foreign currency differences are taken to the statement of comprehensive
income on consolidation. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations are translated at the rates ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on
translating the opening net assets at opening rate and the results of overseas operations at actual rate are recognised in other comprehensive income and
accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve.
On disposal of foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in the foreign exchange reserve relating to that operation up to the date of
disposal are transferred to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the statement of financial position when the Company becomes party to the contractual provision of the
instrument.
Financial assets
The Company classifies its financial assets only as loans and receivables. These are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not
quoted in an active market. They arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers (trade receivables), but also incorporate other types of
contractual monetary assets (other receivables). They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or
issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised costs using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at reach reporting date. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of
one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the asset have been impacted.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three
months and which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value; for the purposes of statement of
cash flows, cash and cash equivalents also include bank overdrafts.
Investments and loans to subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are included at cost less amounts written off. Loans to subsidiaries are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at
amortised costs. In accordance with IAS39 any expected credit losses are provided for in the income statement.
Financial liabilities
The Company classifies its financial liabilities into one of the following categories according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into:
p bank borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument. Such interest bearing
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that any interest expense over the period to
repayment is charged at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the statement of financial position. Interest expense includes initial
transaction costs and any premium payable on redemption, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is not settled;
p liability components of convertible loan notes are measured as described further below;
p trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using an
effective interest method;
p loans from related parties are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Any discount between
the proceeds and fair value is credited to other reserve as a capital contribution in the statement of changes in equity. Any subsequent modifications of the
terms of the loans will be reflected in a revision to the fair value, and adjustment to the amortised cost.
The Company does not have any financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss and does not have any financial liabilities in qualifying hedging
relationships.
Convertible debt
The proceeds received on issue of the Company’s convertible debt are allocated into their liability and equity components. The amount initially attributed to the
debt component equals the discounted cash flows using a market rate of interest that would be payable on a similar debt instrument that does not include an
option to convert. Subsequently, the debt component is accounted for as a financial liability measured at amortised cost until extinguished on conversion of
maturity of the bond. The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option and is recognised in other reserves within the shareholders’ equity, net
of income tax effects.
Share capital
Financial instruments used by the Group are classified as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial liability or financial asset. The
Company’s ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments and are recorded at proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

Exploration and evaluation assets
Exploration and evaluation assets comprise of exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred on projects where insufficient work has been performed to confirm
whether significant mineralisation exists or whether the project is economically feasible. Costs are capitalised as intangible assets until the decision is made to
proceed to development, whereupon the related expenditures are transferred to non-current assets as mining properties unless the projects are determined not
to be commercially viable, whereupon the related costs are written off to the statement of comprehensive income. Depreciation on non-current assets used on
exploration and evaluation projects is capitalised. Exploration and evaluation assets are not amortised.
Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed the recoverable
amount.
In accordance with IFRS 6 the Group firstly considers the following facts and circumstances in their assessment of whether the Group’s exploration and evaluation
assets may be impaired:
p whether the during the period the licence has expired or will expire in the near future, and is not expected to be renewed;
p whether substantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in a specific area is neither budgeted nor planned;
p whether sufficient data exists to indicate that although a development in a specific area is likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the exploration and
evaluation assets period for which the Group has the right to explore in a specific area has expired;
p is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale.
If any such facts or circumstances are noted the Group must perform an impairment test in accordance with the provisions of IAS 36, assessing the recoverable
amount of the exploration and evaluation assets together with all development and production assets, as a single cash generating unit (CGU). The aggregate
carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the CGU. The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs
to sell.
Any exploration and evaluation impairment loss would be recognised in the income statement and separately disclosed. Pre-licence costs are recognised as an
expense in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
Expenditure on research activities are recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided to write off the cost
of such assets other than land over their useful economic lives on a straight line basis. The periods generally applicable are:
Buildings 5% per annum
Machinery and equipment Between 5% and 20% per annum
Impairment of assets
The carrying amount of non-current assets is compared to the recoverable amount of the assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
net book value may not be recoverable. The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell.
In assessing the value in use, the expected future cash flows from the assets is determined by applying a discount rate to the anticipated pre-tax future cash flows.
Impairment is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets’ recoverable amount. The revised
carrying amounts are depreciated/amortised in line with accounting policies.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed if the recoverable amount increases as a result of a reversal of the conditions that originally resulted in the
impairment. The reversal is recognised in the profit and loss and is limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no
impairment loss been recognised in prior reporting years.
Assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (“cash generating units”) for the purposes of assessing impairment.
The estimates of future discounted cash flows are subject to risks and uncertainties including the future commodity prices. It is therefore reasonably possible that
changes could occur which may affect the recoverability of assets.
Income taxes
Current income tax assets and liabilities comprise those obligations to fiscal authorities in the countries in which the Company carries out its operations. They are
calculated according to the tax rates and tax laws applicable to the fiscal period and the country to which they relate provided they are enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date. All changes to current tax liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the profit or loss.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. This involves the comparison of the carrying amount of assets and
liabilities in the consolidated financial statements with their respective tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, nor
on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are always provided for in full. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available
against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective
period of realisation, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the
liability. Unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance expense in the statement of comprehensive income as it occurs.
Provisions are made for the estimated rehabilitation/decommissioning costs relating to areas disturbed during the mines’ operation up to the reporting date but
not yet rehabilitated. Such provisions are been made in accordance with local legislation.
The estimated cost of rehabilitation includes the current cost of re-contouring, top-soiling and re-vegetation in accordance with legislative requirements. Changes
in estimates are dealt with on a prospective basis as they arise.
2.    Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Company makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based on historic experience
and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In the future, actual experience may differ
from these estimates and assumptions.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next
financial year are discussed below.
(i)    Carrying values of exploration and evaluation assets and property, plant and equipment
The Company monitors internal and external indicators of impairment relating to its exploration and evaluation assets. Management has considered whether any
indicators of impairment have arisen over certain assets relating to the Group’s exploration licenses. Management consider the exploration results to date and
assess whether with the information available, there is any suggestion that a commercial operation is unlikely to proceed. In addition management have
considered the likely success of renewing the licences, the impact of any instances of non-compliance with license terms and are continuing with the exploration
and evaluation of the sites. After considering all relevant factors the management were of the opinion that no impairment was required In relation to the costs
capitalised in relation to exploration and evaluation assets.
(ii)   Decommissioning and rehabilitation
The ultimate decommissioning and site restoration costs are uncertain and can be impacted by changes to legislation, restoration techniques and changes to the
expected timing of closure resulting from changes to ore reserves. As a result there could be significant adjustments to the provisions established which would
affect future results.
(iii) Country of operation
The Company’s primary base of operations is in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan’s economy continues to display certain characteristics of an emerging market. These
characteristics include, in particular, inconvertibility of the national currency in most countries outside of Kazakhstan and relatively high inflation rates. The Kazakh
tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations and frequent changes. The financial information has been prepared on the assumption
that no significant adverse changes to the economic, regulatory and fiscal environment will arise.
(iv) Fair value of financial instruments
The Group determines the fair value of financial instruments that are not quoted, based on estimates using present values or other valuation techniques. Those
techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows. Where market prices are not readily
available, fair value is either based on estimates obtained from independent experts of quoted market prices of comparable instruments. In that regard, the
derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison with independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realised immediately.
(v)   Income taxes
The Group is subject to income tax in Kazakhstan and significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course
of business, there are any transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, tax liabilities are recognised based on
estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. These tax liabilities are recognised, when, despite the Group’s belief that its tax return positions are
supportable, the Group believes that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities.

Where a loss has been incurred the diluted loss per share does not differ from the basic loss per share as the conversion of the convertible loan would have the
effect of reducing the loss per share and are therefore not dilutive under the terms of IAS 33.

The loans, which are denominated in US Dollars, represent investments into the subsidiaries and in the opinion of the Directors the aggregate value of the
investments in the subsidiaries is not less than the amount shown in these financial statements. The Directors review the intercompany borrowings on a regular
basis, together with the associated cash flows of each company, and consider that no impairment is required.
The recent loans to subsidiaries are charged at a fixed interest rate of 5% and are repayable giving twelve months’ notice by the lender, and these are also included
within fixed assets. The foreign exchange movement on the loans/investments to subsidiaries is to revalue the amounts which are denominated in US Dollars to
the year end exchange rate. The movement is reflected within the income statement of the parent company and is treated as part of the net investment in the
subsidiary and on consolidation is taken to the translation reserve.

Exploration and evaluation assets relate to the capitalised licence costs and subsequent exploration expenditure incurred in respect of the Smirnovskoye deposit
(licence No. 1605) and the Drozhilovskoye deposit (licence No. 1606) awarded to KRMC in December 2004 for the exploration and production of tungsten,
molybdenum and copper.
Licence No. 1605: The exploration subsoil contract is approved until September 2019.
Licence No. 1606: The exploration subsoil contract has expired in May 2017. The Group has applied for the extension of the exploration contract. According to the
underlying contract the Group has a legal right to extend the exploration contract for a period not exceeding 2 years, it is awaiting approval from the relevant
government authorities. The licence will run from the date of renewal for two years.
The Group suspended exploration work during the period pending agreement on the renewal of license 1606. However in Q1 2018 drilling was undertaken at
Drozhilovskoye in order to obtain mineral samples for analysis and testing. There have been some breaches of contract terms as a result. However the renewal of
license 1606 is expected to received shortly and the Group anticipates at that time it will either remedy the non-compliance or that these will be superseded by
revised terms.
Both deposits are located in Kostanay region of Kazakhstan.

Financial liabilities refer to unsecured interest and non interest bearing loans received from related parties and other companies. Interest-free loans are initially
recognised at fair value, and subsequently accounted at amortised cost using the effective interest rate.
The effective interest rates used to measure fair value of the interest-free loans were the interest rates on long-term loans granted in Kazakhstan. The Kazakhstan
bank rates were applied at the date of receipt of the next tranche under the interest-free loan, which ranged from 10.0% to 10.8% (2016: from 10.0% to 10.8%).
As per Addendum dated 29 October 2008 to the loan agreement signed with Hawkinson Capital INC, 20% interest has not been accrued since 29 October 2008.
Loans provided as short-term are past due. As at the reporting date and signing date of the financial statements the Company had not agreed with the lenders on
repayment dates of past due financial liabilities, these amounts are currently being negotiated.
All non-current loans as noted above are controlled by the ultimate owners and agreements are currently in place or have been obtained to reschedule repayment
of the debts to a period at least one year from the date of these financial statements.
14.  Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise unsecured loans and other payables which are measured at amortised cost or fair value. Its principal financial
assets comprise cash deposits in banks and other receivables which are all categorised as loans and receivables. These instruments arise from the Group’s investing
and borrowing activities. The Company’s principal financial liability relates to an unsecured loan and its principal financial asset to the loan to the subsidiary
company.
The Company is exposed to market risk by virtue of holding financial liabilities and assets. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing the risks arising from
the holding of these instruments, such as changes in interest rates and liquidity risks. The Company does not:
p actively engage in trading of financial assets for speculative purposes;
p buy or sell derivative securities or contracts; or
p execute financial instruments or contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange rates or interest rates. The most significant financial risks to which the Group is
exposed are described below.

Kemin Resources Plc
Annual Report 2017
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
year ended 31 December 2017
32 14.  Financial risk management objectives and policies continued
b)    Interest rate risk
The Group and company’s principal liability is at a fixed 5%, subject to adjustment for Libor However, the sensitivity of the Group or Company to changes in the
Libor rate is not considered material.
c)    Foreign exchange risk
The Company and its subsidiary has transactional currency exposures. Such exposure arises from transactions in currencies other than the Company’s functional
currency which is British Pound and the subsidiary which is the Kazakh Tenge. A significant proportion of the KRMC’s funding is in British Pounds, whilst KRMC’s
principal operating costs are denominated in Kazakh Tenge which is KMRC’s functional currency. There is no foreign exchange risk in the Company as the
principal costs are incurred in British Pounds with the funding in Pounds. As the operating costs are at low levels at present the risk is not material, however it is
the intention to minimise the effect of foreign currency fluctuations for the Group and Company by maintaining its cash reserves in sufficient quantum in
currencies it expects to incur expenditure. All USD denominated liabilities are held in the subsidiary KRMC. The amounts due in foreign currencies is noted
below:

d)    Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders,
benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. Management considers as part of its capital, the financial
sources of funding from shareholders and third parties with an equity investment in the Group. Currently the Company is dependent upon its principal
shareholders for funding via its facility with Amrita as detailed in note 13. The current capital structure is set out below:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2017                                2015

e)    Credit risk
The Group’s significant credit risks relate to cash at bank and receivables. Cash at bank is held principally at an independently ‘A’ rated bank. No significant cash
amounts are held at banks rated less than ‘B’ . Cash is held either on current account or on short-term deposit at floating rates of interest determined by the
relevant prevailing base rate. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2017 and 2016 did not differ materially from its carrying value.
Due to the low level of cash balances and receivables the Group is not at present exposed to any credit risk. The Company has extended inter-company
borrowings to its subsidiary, this amount is expected to be recovered once the subsidiary produces cash flows from its operating activities or raises investment
funds.

18.  Related party transactions
For the purposes of this financial information, parties are considered to be related if one party has the ability to control or exercise significant influence over the
other party in making financial or operational decisions as defined by IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures” . In considering each possible related party relationship,
attention is directed to the economic substance of the relationship, not merely the legal form. In the normal course of business the Group enters into transactions
with its shareholders, Directors, and other related parties.
In assessing the loans from related parties an assessment is made of the market interest rates payable on the loans and the actual interest rate on the loan. The
premium between the effective interest rate and coupon rate on the loan issued by a related party is credited to equity and subsequently released to the profit or
loss over the remaining life of the financial liability. As at 2017 the amounts credited to equity for the group amounted to £1,188,000 (2016: £1,188,000) and for the
Company £396,000 (2016:£396,000).
The key management remuneration is shown in note 4.
Other related party transactions and related balances outstanding at each reporting year are as noted in note 13, being loans made to the Group by Companies
controlled by the Assaubayev family.

NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
Governance Strategic report

Financial statements 1. Members are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at the meeting. A proxy need not
be a shareholder of the Company. A shareholder may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to
exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder. To appoint more than one proxy you may photocopy the form of proxy. A
proxy form which may be used to make such appointment and give proxy instructions accompanies this notice.
2. Please indicate the proxy holder’s name and the number of shares in relation to which they are authorised to act as your proxy (which, in aggregate, should
not exceed the number of shares held by you). Please also indicate if the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All forms must be
signed and should be returned together in the same envelope.
If you do not give your proxy an indication of how to vote on any resolution, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy will
vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the meeting.
3. To be valid, the enclosed form of proxy and the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed or a certified copy of such power or
authority must be lodged at the offices of the Company’s registrars, Neville Registrars at Neville House, 18 Laurel Lane, Halesowen, West Midlands, B633 DA, or
sent by post, so as to be received not less than 48 hours before the time fixed for the holding of the meeting or any adjournment thereof (as the case may be).
4. The completion and return of a form of proxy will not preclude a member from attending in person at the meeting and voting should he wish to do so. If you
have appointed a proxy and attend the meeting in person, your proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.
5. Pursuant to regulation 41of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, only those members entered on the register of members at 6:00pm on 27 June
2018 shall be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting in respect of the number of ordinary shares of 1p each in the capital of the Company held in their
name at that time. Changes to the register after 6:00pm on 27 June 2018 shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at
the meeting. If the Annual General Meeting is adjourned, the time by which a person must be entered on the register of members of the Company in order to
have the right to attend and vote at the adjourned meeting is no later than two business days prior to the meeting.
6. To change your proxy instructions either submit a new proxy appointment form or initial any amendments to the original proxy form. Note that the cut-off
time for receipt of proxy appointments also applies in relation to amended instructions; any amended proxy appointment received after the relevant cut-off
time will be disregarded.
If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment, the appointment received last before the latest time for the receipt of proxies will take precedence.
7. In order to revoke a proxy instruction you will need to inform the Company by sending a signed hard copy notice clearly stating your intention to revoke your
proxy appointment to Neville Registrars at Neville House, 18 Laurel Lane, Halesowen, West Midlands, B633 DA. In the case of a member which is a company, the
revocation notice must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or an attorney for the company. Any power of
attorney or any other authority under which the revocation notice is signed (or a duly certified copy of such power or authority) must be included with the
revocation notice.
In either case, the revocation notice must be received by the Company no later than 9.30a.m. on 27 June 2018.
If you attempt to revoke your proxy appointment but the revocation is received after the time specified then, subject to note 4, your proxy appointment will
remain valid.
8. In the case of joint holders, the vote of the senior joint holder, whether in person or by proxy, will be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of other joint
holders. Seniority will be determined by the order in which the joint holders stand in the register of members.
9. As at 31 May 2018 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document), the Company’s issued share capital consists of 174,833,041
ordinary shares of £0.01 each and which each carry one vote. Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company as at 31 May 2018 are 174,833,041.
10. A corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise, on its behalf, all its powers as a member provided
that, on a poll, if more than one corporate representative purports to exercise powers over the same share as another corporate representative, that power will
be treated as not exercised.
11. Except as provided above, members who have general queries about the Meeting should contact rajinder@altyn.uk (no other methods of communication will
be accepted).
You may not use any electronic address provided either:
p     in this Notice of Annual General Meeting; or
p     any related documents (including the proxy form),
to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.
12. Resolutions 2 and 3 – Article 101 of the Company’s Articles of Association requires that one third (or the number nearest to, but not greater than, one third) of
the Directors of the Company who are subject to retire by rotation in accordance with Article 102, must retire and, if they are eligible, offer themselves for re-
election.
13. Resolution 5 – This resolution, to be proposed as an Ordinary Resolution, relates to the grant to the Directors of the authority to allot ordinary shares and grant
rights to subscribe for or convert securities into ordinary shares with such authority expiring at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company,
unless the authority is renewed or revoked prior to such time. This authority is limited to the issue of a maximum of 58,271,855 ordinary shares representing
one third of the Company’s entire issued ordinary share capital as at the date of this notice.
14. Resolution 6 – The Act requires that if the Directors decide to allot ordinary shares in the Company the shares proposed to be issued be first offered to existing
shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. This is known as shareholders’ pre-emption rights. However, to act in the best interests of the Company
the Directors may require flexibility to allot shares for cash without regard to the provisions of Section 561(1) of the Act. Therefore this resolution, to be
proposed as a Special Resolution, seeks authority to enable the Directors to allot equity securities for cash free of such pre-emption rights, with such authority
expiring at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2018. This authority is limited to the allotment of a maximum of
34,966,600 ordinary shares representing 20% of the Company’s entire issued ordinary share capital as at the date of this notice.
15. It should be noted that the statutory provision under the 2006 Act relating to “serious loss of capital” imposes no immediate consequent risk given the current
solvency of the Company’s balance sheet and cash flow. No specific proposals or agenda are being proposed at the General Meeting, but the matter will be
open for discussion and questions from Shareholders in accordance with the 2006 Act. There are no additional requirements under the 2006 Act other than
raising the matter at a general meeting. As stated above, the Company is currently renewing the licences which the Directors believe will add significant value
to the Company.

Annual Report 2017
COMPANY DETAILS
39 Grade The tenor or concentration by weight of a metal in a mineral deposit or ore.
masl Metres above sea level.
JORC code Australasian code for the reporting of exploration results, mineral resources and ore reserves (Joint Ore Reserves
Committee). See www.jorc.org/main.php
GKZ GKZ is a classification system used within CIS states. This system classifies mineralisation estimates into seven categories of
three major groups, based on the level of exploration performed into Explored Reserves (A, B, C1), Evaluated Reserves (C2)
and Prognostic Resources (P1, P2, P3). These categories are based on the degree of reliability of data and their
comparative importance to the national economy.
Mineral resource A concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in such form, grade (or quality), and quantity that
there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade (or quality), continuity and
other geological characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological
evidence and knowledge, including sampling.
Indicated resource That part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade (or quality), densities, shape and physical characteristics are
estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of Modifying Factors in sufficient detail to support mine
planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed
and reliable exploration, sampling and testing gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops,
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes, and is sufficient to assume geological and grade (or quality) continuity between
points of observation where data and samples are gathered. An Indicated Mineral Resource has a lower level of
confidence than that applying to a Measured Mineral Resource and may only be converted to a Probable Ore Reserve.
Inferred resource That part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade (or quality) are estimated on the basis of limited geological
evidence and sampling. Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade (or quality)
continuity. It is based on exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from
locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of
confidence than that applying to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to an Ore Reserve. It is
reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources
with continued exploration.
Ore reserve The economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral Resource. It includes diluting materials and
allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined by studies at Pre-
Feasibility or Feasibility level as appropriate that include application of Modifying Factors. Such studies demonstrate that,
at the time of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified. The reference point at which Reserves are defined,
usually the point where the ore is delivered to the processing plant, must be stated. It is important that, in all situations
where the reference point is different, such as for a saleable product, a clarifying statement is included to ensure that the
reader is fully informed as to what is being reported.
Probable reserve The economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource. The
confidence in the Modifying Factors applying to a Probable Ore Reserve is lower than that applying to a Proved Ore
Reserve.
Mineral inventory A term used to describe mineral resources and mineable reserves which are not static as additional resource delineation
is not yet complete, and engineering calculations are pending. As such what might be a mineral resource today may be a
mineable reserve tomorrow.
