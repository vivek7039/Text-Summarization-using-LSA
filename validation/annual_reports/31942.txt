Chairman’s statement 
 
The Group has made further significant progress over the last year in positioning each of the two core 
businesses for future success. Revenue from continuing operations was steady compared with the prior 
year, and the net loss for the year came in line with the Board’s expectations.  
Financial results and condition  
Revenues for the current year amounted to £2.00m, compared with £2.08m in the prior year (stated before 
the IntelliSAW related license fee of £3.04m). Administrative expenses increased to £3.32m from £2.54m 
in the prior year. This increase in expenditure reflects new product support and the commercial and 
marketing activity within Translogik to launch iTrack II and deliver effective pre-contract engagement with 
a number of key customers for this system.   
The pre tax loss from continuing operations for the year was £2.16m compared with a profit of £1.59m 
and loss in the prior year adjusted for the effects of the net IntelliSAW licence fee of £1.17m.  The total 
loss attributable to shareholders was £2.17m (2016: profit of £1.15m) resulting in a net loss per ordinary 
share of 22.84 pence (2016: earnings of 12.90 pence). The Board do not recommend payment of a 
dividend (2016: Nil). 
Net cash balances at 30 June 2017 were £2.52m (2016: £3.65m).  
Strategy 
The Group provides innovative sensor systems for various complex applications and operates two 
principal businesses, SAWSense and Translogik. 
The Group intends to continue to commercialise sensor technologies by working closely with global 
partners in order to build value for shareholders through the generation and distribution of net income, 
and/or the return of capital on realisation. 
SAWSense designs and develops Surface Acoustic Wave (or “SAW”) sensor devices that can be used to 
measure torque, pressure and/or temperature in harsh, restricted or demanding environments to very high 
accuracy. This world leading technology has a broad range of potential uses ranging from premium value 
custom applications through to high volume mass markets. 
Translogik designs and markets a range of Tyre Pressure Monitoring Systems (“TPMS”), products and 
services for heavy duty off road vehicles (particularly mine-haul trucks), commercial truck and bus as well 
as passenger cars. These comprise the iTrack system, which provides real-time tyre temperature and 
pressure measurements for mine-haul trucks in service, and a range of tyre probes and other offerings for 
the road transport sector.  
The Translogik product offerings are continually evolving with the focus on providing a comprehensive 
service to clients in the mining and truck industry and this strategy has resulted in the successful launch 
of the iTrack II system in September 2016. 
Our markets 
SAW sensing in global industries 
 
Sensor technology is widely used in virtually every industrial application across a broad range of industries, 
contributing to many billions of dollars in revenue. Sensors using SAW technology are powered by radio 
frequency and do not require a battery and are wireless. This means that the sensor has significant 
benefits, as the package can be extremely small and light and is suited to harsh environments or remote 
locations, and does not require regular maintenance. Being wireless enables the sensor to be used in 
rotating components, other moving parts, or environments where electrical wiring would pose a safety 
risk. 
These benefits are particularly appropriate in drives, motors, gearboxes, valves and couplings, which are 
in common use in the industrial equipment, energy generation, oil & gas, aviation, military and automotive 
sectors.  Transense Technologies plc

Chairman’s statement (continued) 
As Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) seek ever more data on a real-time basis to optimise the 
performance of their products, accurate and frequent measurement becomes increasingly important. The 
world’s largest and most successful companies in these fields are recognising SAW as one of the enabling 
technologies in developing the “Internet of Things” in this arena, contributing to a vision by which machines 
are networked with embedded sensors to optimise performance using real time analytical tools, algorithms 
and interactive controls. 
TPMS in Mining 
 
The original iTrack system was developed to provide tyre pressure and temperature monitoring data to 
mine haul-truck operators, primarily to reduce or eliminate the incidence of tyre failure. The associated 
benefits in tyre life management were evident, and were initially viewed as a means of payback for the 
improved safety performance achieved. 
Over recent years the collection of pressure and temperature data has become increasingly sophisticated, 
and our systems for measuring, monitoring and reporting tyre conditions are seen by key customers as a 
management tool to optimise asset utilisation and productivity, whilst continuing to make a key contribution 
to mine safety. 
This work culminated in the September 2016 launch of the iTrack II system. iTrack II collects live tyre 
performance data from sensors, and transmits this instantly to an optional in-cab display, and to web 
based applications readable in real time by the Translogik Global Control Centre, and by individual mine 
operators in their own operational control rooms.  This valuable data can be utilised to minimise truck 
down time, extend tyre life, and improve safety. Crucially, it can also be used to increase mine productivity 
by identifying opportunities to optimise routings, loadings, and even road architecture. 
During earlier stages of commercialisation, we were met with resistance to financing the outright purchase 
of equipment by mine operators under severely constrained capital budgets during what has been a 
cyclically challenging few years for the industry. Accordingly, we are now offering implementation of iTrack 
II on an operating lease financing model, which enables users to generate additional revenues and save 
costs, against which they are able to meet the ongoing operating costs associated with using the system 
at a net gain.  
During the launch and market engagement phase, we have focused most of our attention on our more 
developed markets in Chile, Australia and Southern Africa, in which we have highly effective teams and 
channel partners. We have also begun to increase resources in additional territories such as the US, 
Canada and other countries in the Latin America region during the year.  Results have been very 
encouraging, with several mine operators running successful trials and choosing to adopt iTrack II toward 
the end of the financial year. The gestation period for widespread adoption, and the lead time to translate 
positive trial outcomes and orders into revenue, have been slower than we originally may have hoped, 
however we are confident that there are encouraging signs of commercial traction with a number of major 
global mining companies.  
Tyre pressure probes 
Our tyre tread depth probes offer a fast and reliable way for mining and on the road truck service providers 
as well as passenger car tyre fitters to record and automatically transmit tread depth data by bluetooth. 
The tool has been manufactured for over 15 years during which time it has earned a reputation in the 
market place as a rugged and reliable tool. Coupled with software developed in-house we also offer a 
Passenger Car Audit System (“PCAS”), which has recently received its first significant order.

Chairman’s statement (continued) 
New Joint Brokers  
The Company announced the appointment of Beaufort Securities Limited ("Beaufort") as joint broker to 
the Company to improve the service available to the large group of private investors interested in 
Transense. Beaufort have a large network of UK retail and High Net Worth investors and will provide retail 
tailored research on Transense as part of its ongoing services to the Company. 
Capital structure 
During the year, the Company undertook a reduction in share capital by the cancellation of the deferred 
shares and the share premium account. This action should provide a better base to facilitate the Company 
having distributable reserves and in turn enabling the payment of dividends from income or return of capital 
to shareholders from major licensing transactions or partial disposals from profits arising in future. 
Additionally, the ordinary share capital was subject to a 50:1 consolidation to mitigate the effect of prior 
dilutions on the unit price per share, and to reduce trading spreads and transaction costs for shareholders 
in future dealings. 
Prospects  
The Board believes that the technology and products developed by the Group are now well positioned in 
their marketplaces. It anticipates that the market traction demonstrated to date will continue to build and 
is accordingly cautiously optimistic of future prospects.

Chief Executive’s report 
 
Towards the latter part of this breakthrough year, the Group has commenced generating commercial 
revenues from products and services that are well placed to offer unique solutions over a sustained period 
of competitive advantage in the future.   
 
SAWSense 
SAWSense is a leader in the development of Surface Acoustic Wave ("SAW") wireless, battery-less, 
sensor systems that offer significant advantages over legacy systems in common use. The business 
continues to be involved in several live projects in conjunction with major global industrial companies. In 
the short to medium term, the primary source of ongoing revenue is dependent upon the level of customer 
chargeable engineering activity and royalties, which was £0.29m in 2017 (2016: £0.42m). 
In the prior year, pilot production had commenced of sensor kits to measure temperature, vibration and 
torque on a new range of industrial equipment recently launched by a large European OEM. Whilst the 
technology continues to be under commercial evaluation, the customer has yet to determine how the 
benefits it offers are to be monetised.  Accordingly, there can be no certainty of future income from this 
source.  
We continue to develop potential applications in other sectors, most notably automotive, although 
commercialisation in these areas is not considered to be imminent. 
In July 2016, SAWSense entered into a significant licensing agreement with GE for the use of our 
patented, wireless, passive SAW technology in a certain specific torque application. The Group received 
a non-refundable license fee of $0.50m on completion in July 2016, with a further $0.25m received in 
March 2017 following successful technical validation. In addition to the fee, GE will pay to Transense a 
perpetual sales royalty in respect of unit sales upon commercialisation, although this is not likely to arise 
for several years. More recently the Group has been involved in discussions with a number of other 
divisions within GE regarding further projects and the relationship between the Group and GE continues 
to progress well. 
 
Translogik 
iTrack 
Our iTrack products provide a range of features that allow mine operators to track their vehicles’ tyre 
temperature, pressure, speed, braking and location in real-time and receive early warning of potential 
problems, hazards or opportunities. 
In September 2016, we successfully launched the new iTrack II system, a combination of sensor and 
transmission technology which we believe offers unparalleled features and benefits to mine operators 
across the world.  We set out to maximise functionality and connectivity in a single comprehensive system, 
comprising rugged and reliable hardware, connectivity with other technologies, and meaningful real-time 
output. 
The control unit is mounted in each truck, and transmits live data across various protocols to iTrack servers 
at one of three global control centres. Dedicated iTrack experts are on hand to analyse live and historic 
data, determine trends and create custom reports and warnings. Mine operations will have access to tyre 
temperature, pressure, sensor function, GPS and speed data on easy to read, customisable screens. This 
data can provide invaluable signals, not only to avoid tyre failures and increase life, but also to increase 
truck speeds, availability and productivity. Our offer provides the equipment on finance or operating lease 
although our preference will be towards operating leases with additional charges for data provision and 
monitoring.

Chief Executive’s report (continued) 
 
The market response to launch has been very encouraging and we have subsequently generated live 
trials on 14 sites covering 3 continents/territories. Trials have generally been successful, and whilst the 
rate of adoption meets our high expectations, the trial duration and lead times to roll out and revenue 
generation are often extended by understandable bureaucratic and operational delays.  
 
Probe 
During the year, several multinational tyre manufacturers have commenced the implementation of new 
software platforms that have been integrated with the probe and it has become clear that our product is 
the tread depth tool of choice for Bridgestone, Goodyear and Continental, amongst others and as a result 
our probe revenue in the final quarter of the year experienced a marked upturn. 
 
In addition to this we have, since the year end, received our first significant order for our PCAS, from Tiger 
Wheel in South Africa. PCAS is a software system coupled with our tread depth probe which enables a 
tyre fitter to complete a fast, accurate tread depth audit of a passenger car and produce a customer friendly 
report which acts as a visual aid for the garage to sell tyres and additional services such as alignments. 
We are hopeful this initial order will lead to further sales in South Africa and elsewhere.  
 Current trading and outlook 
 
 
Since the beginning of the new financial year on 1 July 2017, revenues have shown a significant increase 
on the run rate of the prior year.   iTrack II was adopted by two Glencore mines in Australia during June 
2017, and in early August 2017, a further Australian mine operated by BHP. These systems are now in 
implementation, and revenues have commenced.  Several other opportunities are at a reasonably 
advanced stage, and we expect further order activity in Australia, Latin America and Southern Africa in 
coming weeks. 
 
Furthermore, as indicated above, order intake for probes has started to build momentum, and has already 
reached a level comparable with nearly 60% of the aggregate order intake for last year. 
 
We continue to engage with GE and others on commercialisation of SAW projects in a variety of 
applications, although we do not anticipate strong growth in revenues in this area in the short term. 
 
Accordingly, we consider that the outlook for the next financial year is satisfactory.

Strategic Report 
 
Financial Review 
Results for the year  
Revenues from continuing activities totaled £2.00m (2016: £5.12m and after excluding the IntelliSAW 
license fee resulting in revenue of £2.08m). The pre-tax loss (before discontinued operations) totalled 
£2.16m (2016: profit £1.60m which included the license fee of £3.04m before costs and £2.76m after costs 
and an adjusted loss of £1.16m before the net license fee).  
Translogik revenues fell by 27% to £1.19m, and SAWSense generated £0.81m of revenues, including the 
GE license fees of £0.58m, from the design, development and low volume production activities (2016: 
£0.45m excluding the IntelliSAW license fee of £3.04m). Gross margins were 57% (2016: 64% excluding 
the IntelliSAW license fee) reflecting the change in the mix between business activities. 
Administrative overheads for the year amounted to £3.32m compared with £2.54m in the prior year. 
The fall in Translogik revenues reflected the slow down in sales during the period of upgrading iTrack from 
the original version to iTrack II (IT2). IT2 was launched in September 2016 and the additional support 
costs (including staffing overseas offices in South America, Australia and Africa) and marketing 
represented over £0.40m of the increased administrative costs. The other principal costs contributing to 
the increase were the provision for a potential bad debt of £0.09m, one off professional costs £0.09m and 
a reduction in the forex gain of £0.08m. 
 
The Earnings per share (EPS) are set out below (in Pence):

EPS (including discounted operations) 
(22.84) 18.05 
EPS (excluding discounted operations) 
(22.78) 12.90 
 
The EPS numbers are calculated after rebasing the old 1p shares reflecting the 50:1 share reduction 
carried out in November 2016. 
Taxation  
The Company has UK tax losses available to carry forward at 30 June 2017 of approximately £18.7m, 
subject to HMRC agreement. 
Certain elements of development expenditure undertaken by the Company are eligible for enhanced 
research and development tax relief which generally relates to salary costs of technical staff.  
Cash flow and financial position  
There was a net cash outflow of £1.13m (2016: inflow of £3.18m) during the year, arising from trading and 
£0.06m of proceeds arising from the exercise of warrants in January 2017. 
Net cash used in operations amounted to £0.88m (2016: inflow of £0.84m). 
At 30 June 2017 the group had net cash balances of £2.52m (2016: £3.65m).  
The forward looking cash flow forecasts based on the anticipated level of activity indicates that the Group 
should have sufficient funds available for the short to medium term. The Board are however aware that 
the affect of increased demand for iTrack rentals will put pressure on working capital due to the timeline 
between investment and recoupment.    Transense Technologies plc

Going Concern 
 
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. The Group has made a loss 
for the year of £2.17m (2016: profit of £1.15m). The Group has Accumulated Losses of £0.01m (2016: 
Accumulated Losses of £21.84m before the Share Capital reorganisation). The balance of cash and 
cash equivalents at 30 June 2017 is £2.52m (2016: Cash and cash equivalents £3.65m).  
  
The Group meets its day to day working capital requirements through existing cash reserves and does 
not currently have an overdraft facility. The directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for the period 
to 31 December 2018. These forecasts indicate that the Group will continue to be able to operate within 
its current cash resources for the foreseeable future.

Principal risks and uncertainties 
 
Risk management is essential as part of the management process. Regular reviews are undertaken to 
assess the nature and magnitude of risks faced and the manner in which they may be mitigated. Where 
controls are in place, their adequacy is monitored. 
Risk and Uncertainty Details of Risk & Impact Mitigation 
Intellectual Property The Group is focussed on the 
design and manufacture of 
technologically advanced products 
and applications. Major investment 
is made in Development and we 
have 35 granted patents and 
significant in house know how. The 
risk exists that our intellectual 
property may be infringed by third 
parties or that we may inadvertently 
infringe third party rights. The 
impact resulting in loss of 
profitability and cash flow and loss 
of market share. 
Procedures are in place to ensure 
we monitor new third-party 
applications, ensure adequate 
protection for our key intellectual 
property including registration and 
avoid infringing third party rights. 
Product Development Developing new product and 
improving existing products 
requires constant assessment of 
investments and potential returns 
which can be uncertain. Changing 
customer requirements and 
technological innovation will always 
present a challenge to developing 
market leading product. 
Development spend is regularly 
planned and reviewed. The Groups 
understanding of customer needs 
and expectations is greatly 
enhanced by working closely with 
customers on extensive product 
trials. 
People An experienced and knowledgeable 
team is essential to continually 
develop complex products for 
customers to be used in demanding 
environments. The market for 
skilled staff is extremely competitive 
and a failure to recruit and retain 
suitably qualified staff could impact 
the Groups ability to develop and 
deliver services and product. 
Providing the existing team with 
good training and incentives is a key 
priority for the business and has 
been instrumental in retaining key 
staff. The recruitment and 
development of new employees, 
when required, is done so by 
experienced staff to ensure the 
correct calibre of individual is 
identified. 
Economic The mining Industry experienced a 
major contraction in activity and 
expenditure following major falls in 
commodity prices as part of a global 
reduction in demand. Whilst the 
recovery in commodity prices has 
seen much improved levels of 
activity in the mining industry this 
continued stability is important to 
the success of the Translogik 
division. 
The development of iTrack has 
been designed to achieve greater 
efficiencies in mining and in turn 
produce substantial cost savings for 
mine owners/operators. The original 
iTrack is now being replaced by 
iTrack II which will build further on 
the achievement of both meaningful 
savings and crucial data which in 
turn will drive demand for the 
product. 
Debtor Recoverability The Group has £59k (2016: £383k) 
of debtors that are payable greater 
than 12 months. The risk of default, 
whilst small, would still have an 
impact on our future results. 
The long-term debt has been 
diligently managed by the finance 
department and as a result they 
remain up to date.

Risk and Uncertainty Details of Risk & Impact Mitigation 
Liquidity Transense is continually striving to 
achieve the point of consistent 
profitability and cash generation 
however until that point in time is 
reached the Group will be exposed 
to squeezes in liquidity. The new 
iTrack 2 has required a great deal of 
development costs and future new 
business will require working capital 
to fund the approximate 7 month 
cash flow negativity resulting from 
the rental model. The failure to raise 
additional funds for working capital, 
if required, would threaten the going 
concern status of Transense. 
During the course of FY 17 the cash 
resources have decreased by 
£1.13m. The cash resources do 
however remain strong moving into 
FY18 and the Board exert tight 
controls on overheads and monitor 
cash flow regularly and do not 
presently foresee any immediate 
requirement for raising further 
funds. 
Foreign currency fluctuation Approximately 45% of purchases 
and sales are transacted in foreign 
currency, principally USD and to a 
smaller extent Euro's and Chilean 
Peso. Significant fluctuations could 
have an impact on results. 
Transense's biggest exposure is 
with regards the USD and during 
the course of the last year the USD 
has increased by 11% against GBP 
producing foreign exchange gains. 
Should the movement reverse the 
Group will consider forward 
purchases as an effective hedge.

The Board, which presently consists of three executive and two non-executive directors, meets regularly 
throughout the year and receives timely information in a form and of a quality appropriate to enable it 
to discharge its duties. 
Non-executive directors are independent and are not appointed for specified terms nor have an 
automatic right of reappointment. 
Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment and to 
retirement by rotation and re-election by shareholders in accordance with the Articles of Association 
whereby one third of the directors retire every year or, where there is not a multiple of three, the number 
nearest to but not exceeding one third retire from office. 
Audit and Risk Committee 
 
The Audit and Risk Committee is under the Chairmanship of Rodney Westhead, with Nigel Rogers also 
sitting. The Committee meets at least twice a year and has adopted terms of reference which give it 
responsibility for reviewing a wide range of financial matters. The Committee advises the Board on the 
appointment of external auditors and it discusses the nature and scope of their work. 
Nomination Committee 
 
Given its relatively small size, the Board as a whole fulfils the function of the Nomination committee. 
Remuneration Committee 
 
The policy on directors’ remuneration is formulated by the Remuneration Committee, which consists of 
Nigel Rogers as Chairman and Rodney Westhead. The Committee is responsible for determining the 
contract terms, remuneration and other benefits of the executive directors. The non-executive directors’ 
salaries are reviewed and set by the Board. 
The report of the Remuneration Committee is set out on pages 17 to 19 below. 
Accountability, Internal Control and Risk Management 
 
The directors consider that these financial statements, reports and supplementary information present 
a fair and accurate assessment of the Company’s position and prospects.  Transense Technologies plc

Statement of corporate governance (continued) 
Internal Financial Control 
 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control including financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management, and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Board has introduced 
procedures designed to meet the particular needs of the Group in managing the risks to which it is 
exposed, consistent with the guidance provided by the Turnbull Committee. These procedures include 
an annual review of the significant risks faced by the Group and an assessment of their potential impact 
and likelihood of occurrence. The Board is satisfied with the effectiveness of internal controls but, by 
their very nature, these procedures can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. 
 
The Board has reviewed the need for an internal audit function. The Board has decided that, given the 
nature of the Group’s business and assets and the overall size of the Group, the systems and 
procedures currently employed provide sufficient assurance that a sound system of internal control, 
which safeguards shareholders’ investment and the Group’s assets, is in place. An internal audit function 
is therefore considered unnecessary.

Remuneration report 
Remuneration Policy 
The remuneration policy is to ensure that all staff, including the executive directors, are adequately 
motivated and rewarded in relation to companies of similar size and type. 
The directors salaries paid compare adequately with the salaries of directors and senior executives in 
public companies in similar development situations. Although a bonus scheme was in place during the 
year no bonuses were awarded to the directors. 
The Remuneration Committee can also grant options over ordinary shares under its Enterprise 
Management Incentive Option Schemes (EMI) and options granted outside Company schemes, but 
approved by shareholders. These schemes potentially offer long term incentives to directors and key 
personnel. 
In addition to the vote to be held on this Remuneration Report, shareholders will be given the opportunity 
to question the Remuneration Committee Chairman, Nigel Rogers, on any aspect of the Company’s 
remuneration policy. 
The Board as a whole sets the remuneration of the non-executive directors, which consists of fees for 
their services in connection with Board and Board Committee meetings. The non-executive directors are 
not eligible for pension scheme membership, but they are eligible to participate in the Company’s 
Unapproved Directors Share Option Scheme (UDSOS). 
Each element of remuneration paid to all directors is shown in detail below.  
Base Salary and Benefits  
The base salaries for the executive directors are reviewed annually, but not necessarily increased, by 
the Remuneration Committee. Salary increases based on performance may be made. 
Executive Share Option Schemes 
The Committee considers that potential for share ownership and participation in the growing value of the 
Group increases the commitment and loyalty of directors and senior executives.   
Directors’ Pension Policy 
Executive directors are entitled to participate in the Company’s pension scheme on the same basis as other 
full time employees, but during the year ended 30 June 2017 they did not choose to.  The company did 
match a one off contribution made into a personal pension scheme for Melvyn Segal during the year.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the Strategic Report, 
Directors’ Report and the Financial Statements   
 
The directors are responsible for preparing the 
 
Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.   
 
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the directors have to prepare the group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.  The 
directors have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis. 
 
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of their profit or loss of the group and parent 
company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:  
  
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;   
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;   
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to 
any material departures and explained in the Financial Statements;  
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the group and the parent company will continue in business. 
 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the parent company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for safeguarding the assets of the group 
and parent company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.   
 
The directors confirm that: 
• So far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditor 
is unaware; 
• The directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as directors in order to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company’s auditor is 
aware of that information. 
 
 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Transense Technologies plc 
 
Opinion 
Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Transense Technologies plc (the ‘parent company’) and its 
subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for the year ended 30 June 2017 which comprise the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, the consolidated and company balance sheets, the statement of changes in 
equity, the consolidated and company cash flow statements and notes to the financial statements, 
including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent Company 
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
 
In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent 
Company’s affairs as at 30 June 2017 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; 
• the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006. 
 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and 
applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the 
Group and the parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
 
Who we are reporting to 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To 
the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.  Transense Technologies plc

Conclusions relating to going concern 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us 
to report to you where: 
• the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial 
statements is not appropriate; or 
• the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that 
may cast significant doubt about the Group’s or the parent Company’s ability to continue to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when 
the financial statements are authorised for issue. 
 
 
Overview of our audit approach 
• Overall Group materiality: £60,000, which represents 3% of the 
Group’s revenue. 
• Key audit matters were identified as revenue recognition for the 
Group and parent. 
• We performed full scope audit procedures on UK based operations 
(Transense Technologies plc) and performed specified audit 
procedures on its significant component Transense Technologies 
Chile Spa which was a change from the previous year where we 
undertook analytical audit procedures. 
 
Key audit matters 
The graph below depicts the audit risks identified and their relative significance based on the extent of the 
financial statement impact and the extent of Directors’ judgement. 
 
 
 
 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our 
audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those that 
had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the 
efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters.  Transense Technologies plc

Key Audit Matter  How the matter was addressed in the 
audit  
Revenue recognition  
 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that 
economic benefits will flow to the Group 
and the revenue can be reliably measured. 
 
Revenue is a key driver of the business and 
is also a significant amount in the financial 
statements. We therefore identified revenue 
recognition (focussing on occurrence) as 
one of the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement (whether or not due 
to fraud). 
  
 
 
Our audit work included, but was not restricted 
to:  
• Evaluating the Group’s accounting policies 
for recognition of revenue for 
appropriateness in accordance with the 
requirements of International Accounting 
Standard (IAS) 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 17 
‘Leases’. 
• Agreeing as to whether revenue has been 
recognised in accordance with these policies. 
• Agreeing, on a sample basis, amounts 
recognised in revenue in the financial 
statements for each revenue stream to source 
and supporting documents including proof 
of shipment documents to support the 
sampled transaction. 
• Agreeing, on a sample basis, amounts of 
revenue recorded in the last quarter of the 
financial year to test revenue has been 
recorded in the correct period. 
  
The Group's accounting policy on revenue is 
shown in note 4 to the financial statements and 
related disclosures are included in note 5. 
 
Key Observations: 
Based on our audit work, we found the Group’s 
revenue recognition policy was consistently 
applied. There are no findings in relation to 
revenue recognition. 
 
 
 
Our application of materiality 
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable 
that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use 
materiality in determining the nature, timing and extent of our audit work and in evaluating the results of 
that work.

benchmark is considered the 
most appropriate because the

the Group. 
 
Materiality for the current year 
is lower than the level that we 
determined for the year ended

The graph below illustrates how performance materiality interacts with our overall materiality and the 
tolerance for potential uncorrected misstatements. 
 
 
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Our audit approach was a risk-based approach founded on a thorough understanding of the Group's 
business, its environment and risk profile. We performed full scope audit procedures on UK based 
operations (Transense Technologies plc). 
 
The Group has an operation in Chile, Transense Technologies Chile Spa, which makes up 22% of revenue, 
4% of loss before tax and 2% of total assets and we determined this a significant component. We performed 
specified audit procedures on the material balances of Transense Technologies Chile Spa. Our current year 
audit approach on Transense Technologies Chile Spa represents a change from the prior year where an 
analytical audit approach was taken. This is because materiality for the group has decreased in the current 
year to reflect lower revenues during the year. As a result certain balances in Transense Technologies Chile 
Spa are material to the group and specified audit procedures have been performed on these balances.

Other information 
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the annual report set out on pages 3 to 23, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to 
the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion 
thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine 
whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of 
this other information, we are required to report that fact.  
 
We have nothing to report in this regard. 
 
Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
• the information given in the strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for 
which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
• the strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable 
legal requirements. 
 
Matters on which we are required to report under the Companies Act 2006 
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent Company and its environment 
obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or 
the Directors’ report.  
 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for 
our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.  
 
Responsibilities of Directors for the financial statements 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 23, the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern 
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or 
the parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.  Transense Technologies plc

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial 
statements. 
 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms 
part of our auditor’s report.

Notes to the financial statements 
1 General Information  
Transense Technologies plc (the “Company”) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the 
Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered office is given on page 3. The consolidated financial 
statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 30 June 2017 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries 
(together referred to as “the Group” and individually as “Group entities”). The nature of the Group’s operations and 
its principal activities are discussed in the business review on page 20. 
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group operates. 
2 Basis of preparation 
Both the Parent Company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared and 
approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU 
(“Adopted IFRSs”) and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 that are relevant to companies preparing accounts 
under IFRS. On publishing the Parent Company financial statements here together with the Group financial 
statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present 
its individual statement of comprehensive income and related notes that form a part of these approved financial 
statements. 
3 Going Concern 
At 30 June 2017 the group had net cash balances of £2.52m (2016: £3.65m). Whilst it is anticipated that the 
Company will continue to consume cash to finance on-going activities in the short term, the directors have prepared 
cash flow forecasts to December 2018 and consider that there are sufficient cash resources available to reach a 
break-even level of revenues, and accordingly are satisfied that the Group can continue trading as a going concern 
for the foreseeable future. 
4 Accounting policies 
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods 
presented in these consolidated financial statements.  
The following Adopted IFRSs have been issued but have not been applied in these financial statements. Their 
adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated:  
 
Standard IASB effective 
date 
EU effective date 
IFRS 9 Financial instruments 1 January 2018  1 January 2018 
IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral accounts 1 January 2016 Deferred until final standard

IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 Not yet EU endorsed

Notes to the financial statements (continued) 
 
4 Accounting policies (continued) 
Other than in respect of IFRS 15 and 16, the Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and 
interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the Financial Statements of the Group.  With 
regards to IFRS 15 and 16, the group has commenced an assessment of the impact likely from adopting the 
standards, but it is not yet in a position to state whether the impact will be material to the Group’s reported results 
or financial position.  Certain other new standards and interpretations have been issued but are not expected to 
have a material impact on the Group’s Financial Statements. 
Significant accounting judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty 
Certain estimates and judgements need to be made by the directors which affect the results and position of the 
Group as reported in the financial statements. Estimates and judgements are required if, for example, there are 
intangible assets which are required to be amortised over their useful lives. The following judgements and 
estimates have been identified by the Group: 
 
• Determining when intangible assets are impaired is a judgement which requires an estimate of the value in use 
of the asset based on management’s best estimate of the future cash flows that the assets are expected to 
generate. This also requires significant judgement as there are limited historic cash flows on which to base the 
future cash flows on.  Discussions are held within the Group between the relevant technical, commercial and 
finance employees on the expected future cash flows of patents in individual territories;  
• Judgement is also applied when patent costs are reviewed in particular when considering patents in products 
and territories that are not integral to the future business plans. 
• Distinguishing the research and development phases of new products and determining whether the recognition 
requirements for the capitalisation of development costs are met and their subsequent amortisation period 
requires judgement. After capitalisation management monitors whether the recognition requirements continue 
to be met and whether there are any indicators that capitalised costs may be impaired. 
• Exceptional items are identified separately on the face of the statement of comprehensive income when they 
have a significant impact on the trading performance. A judgement exists as to what items may be classified 
as exceptional. 
 
Measurement convention  
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis. Non-current assets and disposal groups held 
for sale are stated at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 
Basis of consolidation 
Subsidiaries 
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the parent company and all of its subsidiaries as of 30 June 
2017. 
All transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation, including unrealised 
gains and losses on transactions between Group companies. Amounts reported in the financial statements of 
subsidiaries have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by 
the Group. 
Profit or loss and other comprehensive income of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are 
recognised from the effective date of acquisition, or up to the effective date of disposal, applicable. 
The Group attributes total comprehensive income or loss of subsidiaries between the owners of the parent and the 
non-controlling interests based on their respective ownership interests.  Transense Technologies plc

4 Accounting policies (continued) 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured: 
 
● Royalty income is recognised in the year in which the royalties have been earned; 
● Engineering support income, being payments for support work to assist third parties in the development of the 
Group’s technology for their own use, is recognised as work is completed; and 
● Product sales to customers are recognised on customer acceptance of the goods. 
● Revenue generated under finance lease agreements are recognised in full as the risks and rewards of the 
goods are transferred to the lessee. The interest element of the deal is spread over the life of the lease. 
● Revenue generated under operating lease agreements is recognised in the month that the service is provided 
to the end user. 
● License revenue is recognised in accordance with the contractual agreement for each deal.  
Revenue represents sales to external customers at invoiced amounts net of VAT and other sales related taxes. 
 
Segment reporting 
The Group has two reportable segments being the unique trading divisions, SAWsense and Translogik, which 
make use of technology developed by the Group to measure and record temperature, pressure and torque.  
The business revenues include royalties, engineering support and sale of product in relation to this technology. 
Information regarding the Group’s segments is included in the primary statements and notes to the financial 
statements. Revenue and EBITDA are the Group’s key focus and in turn is the main performance measure adopted 
by management. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. 
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 
Depreciation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the estimated 
useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Plant and Equipment 3 – 5 years; and 
Fixtures and Fitting 3 – 10 years; and 
Motor Vehicles 4 years 
The assets’ estimated residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance 
sheet date.   Transense Technologies plc

Research and development 
Expenditure on research (or the research phase of an internal project) is recognised as an expense in the period 
in which it is incurred. Development costs incurred on specific projects are capitalised when all the following 
conditions are satisfied: 
• Completion of the intangible asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale 
• The Group intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it 
• The Group has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset 
• The intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, this requires that 
there is a market for the output form the intangible asset or for the intangible asset itself, or, if it is to be used 
internally, the asset will be used in generating such benefits 
• There are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell 
the intangible asset, and 
• The expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be measure reliably. 
All new expenditure on research and development activities in the year has been capitalised. The amortisation of 
this expenditure will be over 3 years to align with the products anticipated life. 
Historic expenditure on development activities has been capitalised and is being amortised over 10 years on a 
straight line basis.  
Patent fees 
Externally acquired patent fees are capitalised at cost and treated as an intangible asset. Amortisation is charged 
to administrative expenses in the statement of comprehensive income over the period to which the patent relates 
which is generally 15 to 20 years. 
In the event that a patent is superseded and the original intellectual property is embedded in a new patent, the 
costs of that patent and the later patents are regarded as the costs of the original patent and amortised over the 
life of the new patent. 
Patents are reviewed annually, reviewing their strategic and commercial value on a territory by territory basis. Any 
impairment that is identified is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Intangible assets and goodwill 
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill represents amounts 
arising on acquisition of subsidiaries and is the difference between the consideration transferred and the fair value 
of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Identifiable intangibles are those which can 
be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable. 
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units 
and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.

Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill 
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to 
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication 
exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its net selling price and its value in use. In assessing value 
in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Where the asset 
does not generate cash flows that are largely independent from other assets, the recoverable amount is assessed 
by reference to the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
Whenever the carrying amount of an asset, or its cash generating unit, exceeds its recoverable amount, an 
impairment loss is recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Investments in subsidiary undertakings 
In the company’s financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost unless, in the 
opinion of the directors, there has been an impairment to their value in which case they are immediately written 
down to their estimated recoverable amount. 
Pension costs 
Contributions to the Company’s defined contribution scheme are charged to the statement of comprehensive 
income in the year to which they relate. 
Operating lease agreements 
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight line 
basis over the term of the lease. 
Current taxation 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit may differ from the net profit shown 
in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes income or expenses that are taxable or deductible 
in other years and furthermore it might exclude other items that are never taxable or deductible. 
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using tax rates and laws enacted or 
substantially enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred taxation 
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method. It represents the tax payable on temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements as compared to corresponding 
tax values used in the computation of taxable profit. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which the asset can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates and laws enacted or substantially enacted at the 
balance sheet date.  Transense Technologies plc

Cash and cash equivalents  
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. 
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are 
included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purposes only of the statement of cash flows. 
Foreign currencies 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arise on consolidation, 
are translated to the Group’s presentational currency Sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet 
date.  
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Sterling upon consolidation. Where significant 
exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations these are reported as an item of other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve or non-controlling interest, as the case may be.  
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of the respective group entity, using the 
exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions (spot exchange rate). Foreign exchange gains and 
losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the remeasurement of monetary items 
denominated in foreign currency at year-end exchange rates are recognised in profit or loss. 
 
Share-based payment transactions 
The Company issues equity settled share based payments to certain employees. Equity settled share based 
payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value so determined is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The amount 
recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture 
is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting. 
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is measured by reference to the fair value of 
the share options. The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on the Black-Scholes 
Option Pricing Model. This model takes into account the following variables: exercise price, share price at date of 
grant, expected term, expected share price volatility, risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield.   
 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as result of a past event, and it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of 
the expenditure. Provisions are discounted if the effect of doing so is material. A pre-tax rate that reflects risks 
specific to the liability is applied to the expected cash flows. 
Warranty provisions are made for specific product issues based on an estimate of the likely cost arising.  It has 
been deemed prudent to provide for an amount based on historical information. 
Trade receivables 
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. 
 
Trade payables 
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the first-in first-out 
principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and 
other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories 
and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. 
Leasing 
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the contract transfers substantially all the risk and 
rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other contracts are classified as operating leases. 
In accordance with IAS 17 the Company is considered to be a lessor for its arrangements with customers. The 
Company provides asset finance to its customers under finance lease and hire purchase arrangements. 
Lease contracts with customers are recognised as finance lease receivables which are included within trade and 
other receivables at the Company’s net investment in the lease which equals the net present value of the future 
minimum lease payments. Finance lease income is recognised as revenue in the period to reflect a constant 
periodic rate of return on the Company’s remaining net investment in respect of the lease. 
Short term deposit 
The short term deposit shown within other debtors in the prior year represents funds held in escrow in relation to 
the disposal of IntelliSAW fee and the associated license fee income. These funds matured in October 2016 with 
no impairment.

11 Taxation (continued) 
 
Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 21% to 20% (effective from 01 April 2015) has been enacted 
with a further reduction to 19% with effect from 01 April 2017. This will reduce the Company's future current 
tax charge accordingly. Deferred tax has been calculated at the rate of 19% substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date. The effect of this change is that the deferred tax asset as at 30 June 2017 has been 
calculated based on the rate of 19% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
 
The Group has tax losses, subject to agreement by HM Revenue and Customs, in the sum of £18.74m 
(2016: £16.76m), which are available for offset against future profits of the same trade. There is no expiry 
date for tax losses. An appropriate asset will be recognised when the Group can demonstrate a reasonable 
expectation of sufficient taxable profits to utilise the temporary differences.  
 
The June 2015 budget announced that the rate will reduce further to 18% by 2020.  
 
As a result, the effective tax rate used to calculate the current tax for the period ended 30 June 2017 was 
19.75% (2016: 20.00%)

Impairment testing 
Impairment testing has been performed over the total balance of intangible assets which are allocated to the one 
cash generating unit of the Group, that of the development and sales of SAWsense. 
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined from value-in-use calculations, which use budgeted cash flows 
for year one and cash flow projections for years 2 to 5, an average growth rate of 1% has been applied to these.  
For cash flow after year 5 and up to the useful life of the goodwill, a steady state based on year 5 cash flow has 
been assumed. 
The key assumptions forming inputs to cash flows are revenues and margins. The forecasts have been discounted 
at a pre-tax discount rate of 10%.

22 Employee benefits 
Defined contribution plans  
The Group operates a defined contribution pension plan. 
The total expense relating to these plans in the year ended 30 June 2017 was £0.03m (year ended 30 June 
2016: £0.02m). 
Share-based payments – Group and Company 
The Group and Company has two share option plans, the Unapproved Discretionary Share Option Scheme 
and Enterprise Management Incentives (EMI) Share Option scheme the principal provisions of which are 
summarised below: Options to subscribe for Ordinary Shares of the Company may be granted (at the 
discretion of the Board and with regards executive directors the remuneration committee) to selected 
employees or directors of the Company.  No consideration is payable for the grant of an option. Options 
are not transferable or assignable. 
The fair value of share options granted is recognised as an employee expense, within administrative 
expenses, with a corresponding increase in reserves. All options are settled by the physical delivery of 
shares.  
The fair value of services rendered in return for share-based payments granted is measured by reference 
to the fair value of those share-based payments. The estimate of the fair value of services received is 
measured with reference to the Black-Scholes options pricing model. The Black-Scholes model considers 
the exercise price, share price at grant date, expected term and expected share price volatility.  The volatility 
level depends on the date of grant and for the current live options has been calculated at 69%. The risk-
free interest rate adopted was 5% and an expected dividend yield of nil pence. The key variable is share 
price volatility. For the year ended 30 June 2017 the charge to the profit and loss for the year was £nil 
(2016: £nil) 
 
Unapproved Discretionary Share Option Scheme      
At 30 June 2017 the following share options remained outstanding under the Company’s Unapproved Discretionary 
Share Option Scheme. The new Share Options granted on 27 October 2014 were in respect of an US employee.

The operating lease relates to the lease of premises which is used by the Group and Company. During the period 
£0.06m was recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income in respect of operating leases 
(year ended 30 June 2016: £0.08m). 
25 Basic and fully diluted earnings/(loss) per share 
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss after taxation of £2.17m (2016: profit of £1.15m) by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 9,483,815 (2016: 9,162,170).  These 
weighted share figures have been adjusted to reflect the 50:1 consolidation that took place in the year.   
Unexercised options over the ordinary shares are not included in the calculation of diluted loss per share as they 
are anti-dilutive.

26 Financial instruments 
 
Financial risk management overview 
 
The Group has exposure to the following risks, to varying degrees, from its use of financial instruments: 
 
● Credit risk; 
● Liquidity risk; and 
● Market risk. 
 
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to liquidity and market risks, the companies’ objectives, 
policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the companies’ management of capital. 
 
Liquidity risk 
 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.   
 
The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient 
liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable 
losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group has a cash balance at period end totalling £2.52m 
(2016: £3.65m). Note 2 describes the potential uncertainties relating to the liquidity risk. The Group has no external 
borrowing and finances its operations by raising equity finance on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM). 
 
Financial Assets and Liabilities 
The carrying value and fair value for each of the trade and other payables, trade leases and unearned 
finance income and trade and other receivables are the same.   Transense Technologies plc

Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments 
Due to the current unprecedented low rates of interest a change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the 
reporting date would not have created any material change in the profit or loss for 2017 or 2016. 
The directors consider that the Group’s exposure to interest rates is low (2016: low). Cash is invested in 
deposits with UK high street banks. Low and falling interest rates will reduce returns on these balances. 
This note is in relation to the company’s compliance with IFRS 7. 
Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, equity price and interest 
rate risk will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.   
The table below shows the net un-hedged monetary assets/(liabilities) of the Group that are not denominated 
in the functional currency of the operating unit and which therefore give rise to exchange gains and losses in 
the income statement.

The short term deposit account was realised in the year £nil (2016: £0.30). 
There was £0.32m of gross trade finance lease assets held on the balance sheet at the year end date. (2016: 
£0.92m). 
 
Management of capital 
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence 
and to sustain future development of the business. In order to do this the group may issue new shares in the future. 
There were no changes to the Group’s approach to capital management during the year. The Group is not subject 
to externally imposed capital requirements. 
27 Credit risk  
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to 
meet its contractual obligations. 
Financial instruments that may subject the Group to credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, and trade and 
other receivables. The maximum credit exposure was £0.41m (2016: £1.42m) which is the respective carrying 
amounts (which is not significantly different to their fair value and contractual cash flow). There were no material 
financial assets that were past due at the period end. 
At 30 June 2017 the Group’s cash was divided between current accounts £0.60m (2016: £0.63m) and £1.92m in 
fixed rate monthly deposits (2016: £3.02m) with a weighted average interest rate for the year of 0.25% (2016: 
0.25%). Cash and cash equivalents are held only in high street banks. 
The Group offers trade credit to customers, who are well established and major companies, in the normal course 
of business. The Group operates stringent credit control procedures on potential customers before allowing credit.   
The Group continually monitors its position with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions, which are 
counterparts to its financial instruments, and does not anticipate non-performance or that there is a concentration 
of credit risk. Credit risk is considered to be low given the cash position of the Group and that there is a low 
exposure level in the trade and other receivables.    Transense Technologies plc
