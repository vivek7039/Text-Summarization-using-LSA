STRATEGIC REPORT
BUSINESS MODEL IN CONVERSATION WITH 
DAVID ATKINS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE
We delivered value  
for our stakeholders
“ 2015 has been a 
busy and successful 
year for Hammerson. 
I am delighted that 
the focus on our 
strategic priorities 
continues to deliver 
positive results for 
our stakeholders.”
8 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 8 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 8 More happened for shareholders
WHAT HAVE BEEN THE HIGHLIGHTS  
OF 2015?
Our focus on generating sustainable income growth 
continues to succeed, and we have grown EPS by 13%. 
This enables us to once more increase the dividend for 
our shareholders, which at 22.3p per share is up 9 .3%  
on last year and with compound annual growth of 7 .7% 
since 2011.
NAV per share was up 11% principally due to a total 
property return of 12.4%, significantly beating IPD .
This strong financial performance is in part thanks to 
the high quality of our portfolio. We continue to recycle 
capital into those assets and developments which are 
best positioned to create value for shareholders. A key 
highlight of this year was our acquisition in Ireland 
which provides a market-leading platform in Europe’s 
fastest-growing economy. Acquiring a portfolio of loans 
requires some extra steps before we own the properties 
but, once the transaction is complete, we will operate 
one of Europe’s leading shopping centres, Dundrum 
Town Centre, Dublin. We also increased our investment 
in the UK’s second city, Birmingham, through the 
acquisition of Grand Central shopping centre in joint 
venture with CPPIB. Birmingham offers an increasingly 
wealthy catchment and improving public infrastructure 
investment. To fund these transactions, we are on track 
with a programme of disposals and we remain focused 
on maintaining a prudent balance sheet.
Like-for-like NRI growth of 2.3% is higher than last year 
as we continue to see a growing demand for prime retail 
and leisure space. Against a backdrop of falling vacancy, 
combined with our Product Experience Framework 
initiatives, we are well-positioned to drive future rental 
income growth. 
This year we successfully relocated our UK offices  
to more cost-efficient sites, moving our London 
headquarters to Kings Place, King’s Cross. Costs were 
tightly controlled across the business and we reduced 
total administrative costs, alongside investing further in 
important areas such as digital and marketing. There is 
still more to be done however, especially as a result of 
additional property costs from the strategic 
development properties we hold. 
In 2015, we completed an impressive four developments, 
adding 64,900m
2 
of incremental retail space. This 
included Le Jeu de Paume, a new regional shopping 
centre in Beauvais; the Winter Garden restaurant and 
leisure extension at Silverburn, Glasgow; a next-
generation fashion park in Rugby with Elliott’ s Field; as 
well as an M&S-anchored extension to Cyfarthfa Retail 
Park, Merthyr Tydfil. We also made good progress at our 
major London development schemes.
HOW IS THE INVESTMENT PROPOSITION 
FOR SHAREHOLDERS IN 2016 
DIFFERENTIATED VERSUS PEERS?
We are better positioned than ever to take advantage of 
the improving consumer backdrop and to continue to 
generate earnings growth ahead of our peers. As well as 
owning prime real estate, driving rental growth requires 
a thorough and hands-on approach to asset 
management. This is where we are differentiated by our 
embedded Product Experience Framework, which is 
designed to deliver a consistently great experience for 
shoppers and retailers across our portfolio.
Furthermore, we remain the only European REIT with 
strategic exposure to the premium outlets market. Our 
investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets materially 
boosted our portfolio returns in 2015. We aim to further 
grow our exposure to this market, which is set to benefit 
from strong occupational demand driven by growing 
global tourism.
2016 will see the opening of Victoria Gate, Leeds which, 
together with Victoria Quarter, will create the leading 
aspirational retail offer in the north of England. The 
next 18 months will also see us make advancements on 
our major London development schemes including 
moving towards starting on-site at Brent Cross and 
Croydon. These schemes are set to deliver retail assets 
of the future and further differentiate our long-term 
investment proposition.

More happened for retailers
WHAT ARE THE CURRENT TRENDS FOR 
RETAILERS TAKING MORE SPACE? 
The increase in occupancy across the Group to 97 .7% 
reflects the continued strong demand from retail and 
leisure tenants for prime space. With the growth in 
multichannel retailing, tenants are looking to position a 
greater share of their stores in the best locations. This 
trend plays well to our strategy of owning and operating 
prime shopping centres in key regional destinations.  
We have successfully worked with major international 
tenants during 2015 to create flagship stores, including 
three Victoria’s Secret stores and a new two-level  
Hugo Boss at Cabot Circus. 
Retailers are also creating more innovative store 
designs and formats. We are delighted with the  
River Island Style Studio at Bullring, a new concept for 
the brand, offering customers a VIP personal-styling 
service in a relaxed and contemporary setting. The store 
has performed exceptionally well since opening, and is 
now one of the best in River Island’s portfolio. 
Increasingly discerning retailers want a portfolio of 
stores to match the full range of ways in which their 
customers shop. We are well-positioned to respond to 
retailers’ requirements for a multi-format presence.  
Fat Face is a good example of this, upsizing its footprint 
at Union Square in Aberdeen in April and also taking its 
first store on a retail park in England when we opened 
the doors at our newly developed shopping park at 
Elliott’s Field, Rugby. In fact, the trend for traditional 
fashion and department store brands to bring their full 
offering closer to the convenience shopper was evident 
throughout the year, with names such as Debenhams, 
M&S and Next all taking space across our retail parks.
Furthermore we are able to offer retailers a European 
footprint covering the UK, France and now Ireland. In 
France, our focus on reinvigorating the portfolio is 
delivering results. The team are focused on identifying 
the new and emerging international brands that will 
resonate with our pan-European customers. 
During the year, we welcomed 25 new brands to our 
French portfolio, notably including four retailers’ first 
store in France. 
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU DOING TO SUPPORT 
RETAILERS IN YOUR CENTRES?
It is our responsibility as a landlord to drive healthy 
footfall for our retail tenants and create new 
experiences for shoppers to encourage greater dwell 
time. We saw visitor numbers up 1.1% in UK shopping 
centres this year. This result was encouraging and we 
outperformed the wider market, which was down 1.9% 
year-on-year (according to Springboard). 
No doubt a significant factor in our success is our 
Product Experience Framework, which drives a 
constant and evolving programme of events, pop-ups 
and interactive experiences for shoppers. We have 
launched click & collect in four of our centres with 
strong results. More than 85% of shoppers using the 
service at Brent Cross go on to shop, drink or dine whilst 
in the centre. Our investment in digital infrastructure 
and technology across the shopping centre portfolio is 
also demonstrating encouraging results. Our ‘Plus’ app 
has now been rolled out across the entire estate of 
shopping centres in the UK and France. The app, a 
personalised shopping companion, enables us to 
communicate in real-time with our shoppers in a 
tailored way. It gives us greater insight into consumer 
shopping habits which we can then analyse and share 
with our retail tenants to improve the customer offer.  
To date, the app has achieved over 140,000 downloads.

WHAT DIFFERENTIATES YOUR OFFER  
FOR SHOPPERS?
For us, being the Best at Retail means being at the 
forefront of new retail trends and concepts. As retail 
specialists we are able to draw on the strength of our 
relationships to ensure we bring the right mix of leading 
international brands and new, innovative concepts to 
our shopping destinations across Europe. During the 
year we welcomed premium British fashion brand All 
Saints to Les Terrasses du Port in Marseille, 
representing the brand’s debut in a French shopping 
centre; and, leveraging our reputation for retail 
excellence in France, we secured leases with Sandro and 
Séraphine at Victoria Quarter, representing firsts for 
both aspirational French boutiques in Leeds. VIA 
Outlets introduced more international luxury brands, 
thanks to the partnership with Value Retail, including 
Brooks Brothers at Landquart, Zurich and Desigual at 
Kungsbacka, Gothenburg. 
To differentiate our offer and give consumers more 
reasons to visit our centres with greater frequency we 
are increasingly looking beyond pure retail to provide 
entertaining and exciting experiences. We opened the 
impressive Wintergarden at Silverburn, a £35 million 
10,900m
2
 dining and leisure development, anchored by 
a 14-screen Cineworld and featuring 11 new restaurants, 
including Carluccio’s, Five Guys and Glasgow’s first 
Thaikhun. In the first six months after opening the 
Wintergarden the centre saw a 4% increase in customer 
dwell time and a 5% increase in sales, demonstrating 
the importance of creating customer experiences that  
bring the whole family together. 
Across our UK shopping centre portfolio, leisure and 
dining now accounts for 14% of space, and with trends 
showing additional growth in the casual dining market 
we see opportunities to increase this further in 2016. 
Our restaurants and leisure team look for fresh new 
brands to attract diners as well as tried and tested 
favourites. Restaurants which debuted with us, such as 
Wham Bam Tikka at WestQuay and Thaikhun at Union 
Square, have become popular favourites and expanded 
to other parts of our portfolio.
We are also responding to this trend at our retail parks, 
introducing the latest food and beverage offerings.  
Ed’s Easy Diner, Caffé Nero and Nando’s have all taken 
space at Elliott’s Field in Rugby. Our retail parks have 
seen strong footfall up 4.2%, as they become even more 
popular for shoppers looking for convenience. This was 
nearly double the market level of 2.3%. We are now 
introducing facilities and services to our retail parks 
which are similar to those found at shopping centres 
including customer service suites, free wi-fi, mobile 
phone charging points and Amazon lockers to leverage 
the growing demand for click & collect.  
Our retail venues also give shoppers a vibrant array of 
entertainment. The Disco Bull Head, a sound and music 
installation, at Bullring (which you can see on the front 
cover of our report) was designed by leading artist Josh 
Harker and was seen by nearly two million visitors. This 
summer we also created a beach at Brent Cross, 
complete with sandy shores and seaside entertainment! 
We recognise that while these events are stimulating for 
our shoppers, we also need to ensure a comfortable and 
safe environment in which to spend time. This year we 
have undertaken a full sensory audit of our centres to 
see how light, sounds, smell and the feel of a centre 
affects our shoppers. Over the course of the year we 
have also made significant investment in upgrading our 
customer service desks. As ever, the safety of customers 
and staff in our centres is a priority and our security 
procedures are constantly reviewed in close 
consultation with local and national authorities.

STRATEGIC REPORT
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW RELOCATION OF HEADQUARTERS  
TO KING’S CROSS, LONDON
In June we moved into our new London headquarters at Kings Place, 
King’s Cross. The office, which overlooks Regent’s Canal, is set over 
2,200m
2
 and offers modern, flexible workspace for more than  
150 colleagues. 
Moving away from the property industry’s traditional Mayfair 
heartland not only allows us to benefit from significant cost savings 
but also reflects our strategic focus on retail real estate. The modern 
design provides colleagues with a digitally-enabled, agile workspace 
which enhances collaboration across our various asset, leasing and 
development projects. The Retail Showcase provides our retail leasing 
teams with a state-of-the-art marketing suite which we use to 
demonstrate the benefits of our portfolio to prospective tenants. 
Situated close to St Pancras International rail terminal, it brings us 
closer to our French business, fostering cross-border collaboration 
and partnerships.
We were awarded an SKA Gold sustainability rating at Kings Place.
More happened for our people
over a third of these employed in professional and 
senior professional roles. By the end of 2015, 27% of 
senior management roles across the Group were held 
by women, well on the way to meeting our stated 
aspiration of at least 30%. Irrespective of internal 
targets, we are never complacent and we recognise 
there is more to do in 2016. 
As a FTSE 100 employer, we take seriously our 
responsibility to train and nurture the talents of those 
embarking on a career in the property industry. Since 
the launch of our UK Graduate Programme in 2011,  
I am pleased to report that three graduates have 
successfully completed the two year programme and 
gained RICS accreditation, becoming permanent 
employees within our business. 
We also recognise our responsibility to promote the 
benefits of a rewarding career in retail real estate to the 
next generation of retail property specialists. In my role 
as President of BCSC, I was delighted to award successful 
apprentices of the Retail Path scheme with certificates at 
the BCSC Gold Awards evening in December. The 
scheme, backed by BCSC Retail Trust and the National 
Skills Academy, was piloted in shopping centres across 
the UK. These included Highcross, Leicester, where five 
apprentices took on 12-month placements giving them 
unique exposure to a range of centre management and 
retail-based skills and experiences. Two of the five have 
now graduated from the scheme and won permanent 
roles with retailers at Highcross.  
CAN YOU OUTLINE THE PROGRESS YOU 
HAVE MADE EMBEDDING YOUR VALUES?
Our values of ambition, collaboration, respect and 
responsibility continue to enhance our culture and 
influence the way we operate. The relocation of our  
UK headquarters from Mayfair to King’s Cross not only 
marked a shift in how we see ourselves as a business,  
but also introduced a more agile and collaborative 
culture and working environment. You can read more 
about the move in the case-study below. 
Our ambition is best demonstrated in the strategic 
acquisition in Ireland which was the largest in our 
history and broadens our European platform. I am 
proud of the hard work and dedication of all employees 
who came together to make the deal happen. We have 
recently established a local office in Dublin and we 
anticipate a number of opportunities for both current 
and new colleagues.
During the year we continued to develop our diversity 
and inclusion strategy, encouraging respect and 
understanding within the workplace. Unconscious bias 
workshops were held for senior managers in our UK and 
French teams, with key messages filtering through and 
embedding across our business. We are now planning to 
extend the workshops to all colleagues in 2016. 
Encouragingly, these initiatives are translating into 
positive action at a resourcing level, with half of all new 
employees recruited during the year being female, and

12 12 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 CREATIVE CAREERS AT BULLRING
We are increasingly aware of the importance of digital and creative 
development skills for the employment market. In November, 
Bullring, Birmingham, hosted ‘Creative Careers 0121’ – a careers fair 
with a difference. The event, aimed at children, young people, parents 
and educational providers, showcased the creative industries and 
provided access to a variety of professionals already shaping our 
digital world through business and enterprise. Attendees were 
provided with tips, networking connections and opportunities for 
young people looking to start a career in the digital and design sectors.  
More happened for communities
Our sustainability initiative forms part of the Product 
Experience Framework and underpins our operational 
decisions. This is particularly the case in developments 
where we look to combine thoughtful and sustainable 
building techniques with iconic design, producing 
destinations where customers feel proud to shop. We 
were delighted to achieve BREEAM Excellent at the 
design stage for Le Jeu de Paume, Beauvais, our new 
shopping centre north of Paris. This was in addition to 
receiving industry recognition for our sustainability 
initiatives throughout the year, notably for the B&Q 
Eco-learning store at Cyfarthfa Retail Park in Merthyr 
Tydfil and the Costa Eco-Pod at Wrekin Retail Park in 
Telford. These initiatives continue to demonstrate our 
commitment to sustainable development and our 
leadership of the wider sector.
During the year, we also launched the ‘Moving Towards 
Net Zero Buildings’ commitment in collaboration with 
The Prince of Wales’ Corporate Leaders Group and 
property services company Jones Lang LaSalle.   
The commitment, which seeks to drive a coordinated 
approach to the delivery of nearly zero energy  
buildings for new build by 2020, has already attracted  
a number of leading European signatories from  
across the built environment.  
HOW ARE YOU DELIVERING  
POSITIVE PLACES FOR THE COMMUNITIES 
YOU SERVE?
The positive social impacts that our business creates  
are both significant and long term.  
During the year, our investment in extensions, 
developments and refurbishments generated over  
4,500 construction jobs alone. Over 85% of these jobs 
went to local people. Once completed, these projects  
are expected to deliver a further 2,600 employment 
opportunities in the retail and hospitality sectors. This 
can only be achieved by working closely with our supply 
chain, tenants and local authority partners to ensure that 
the requisite skills and training opportunities are in 
place. For example, at Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, we 
worked with the local council, construction contractors 
BAM, and tenants M&S and Next. We invested in skills 
and training provision for the local community, resulting 
in the creation of close to 500 local jobs at the recent 
extension of Cyfarthfa Retail Park. These numbers 
demonstrate the vital role that our industry can play  
in creating sustainable careers and stimulating local 
economies across our many communities.
At a corporate level, we encourage colleagues to play a 
greater role in volunteering in the communities in which 
we operate. In 2015, staff volunteered over 400 days, a 
clear illustration of our culture and values in practice. 
Hammerson’ s Community Day, now well established, 
saw high levels of participation with colleagues taking 
part in a range of 27 activities, including a river clean-up 
and mentoring young people. 
HOW ARE YOU LEADING THE SECTOR  
ON SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVES?
As a founding member of the Better Buildings 
Partnership (BBP), we have been instrumental in 
leading the sector. The organisation, which brings 
property owners and occupiers together to share new 
ideas and importantly work together to reduce carbon 
emissions, is chaired by our Head of Sustainability, 
Louise Ellison. In 2015, members of the BBP achieved  
a 5% year-on-year reduction in energy consumption 
across their portfolio.

STRATEGIC REPORT
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW OUR MARKET
The retail landscape
2015 was another positive year for the performance of retail real estate  
across Europe, driven primarily by an improving economic backdrop.  
In a dynamic and evolving retail landscape, tenants continue to enhance  
their brand proposition by taking more space in prime retail destinations  
that meet consumer needs. 
INTRODUCTION
Our strategy focuses on high-quality property in prime 
locations across selected European retail markets. We 
operate in the retail property market because it offers 
attractive and sustainable long-term returns, with 
lower volatility than other commercial property 
markets and a granular and diverse tenant mix which 
mitigates counterparty risk. We aim to be among the 
leaders in each of our market sub-sectors so as to 
capitalise on the favourable market trends and exercise 
scale efficiencies.
ECONOMIC BACKGROUND 
Macroeconomic conditions drive consumer confidence 
and spending, which translates into retailers’ appetite 
for expansion and ability to finance new space. Chart 2 
illustrates the relative consumer spending growth rates 
for our main geographic markets. 
UK GDP growth of 2.4% for 2015 was ahead of the 
Eurozone (1.5%) (Source: OECD). Disposable income 
currently benefits from low interest rates, low fuel and 
food costs and real wage growth. Household consumer 
expenditure grew by 4.2% in 2015. The GfK UK 
consumer confidence index finished the year in positive 
territory suggesting 2016 will see continued spending 
growth by UK households. 
French GDP growth of 1.1% in 2015 was higher than  
last year (2014: 0.2%) and unemployment was flat. 
Household consumer expenditure grew by 2.0% in 2015. 
The government initiated changes to allow more Sunday 
trading, which should help future sales growth. While 
forward-looking consumer confidence finished 2015 
higher (Source: INSEE), the medium-term impact of the 
destabilising terrorist attacks in France is still uncertain. 
Ireland attracts significant inward investment due to  
a low corporate tax rate and skilled workforce. It is 
Europe’s fastest growing economy with GDP up 5.6%  
in 2015, household consumer expenditure up by 8.6% 
and sharply falling unemployment. New car sales were 
up 18% in 2015 indicating households’ confidence in 
their financial position.
Despite some macroeconomic shocks in 2015, the 
number of international tourists to Europe grew, partly 
as a result of the weakness of the Euro currency, 
supporting the continued structural growth of the 
global tourism industry.
DEMAND FOR RETAIL REAL ESTATE
The continued economic recovery in Europe supported 
attractive total returns from retail real estate in 2015. 
The UK shopping centre market saw over £4bn of 
investment (2014: £5.9bn). With a limited number of 
prime shopping centres changing hands, investment 
transactions attracted significant competition and lifted 
capital valuations across this sector. Total IPD return for 
UK shopping centres was 10.0%. 
UK retail parks investment volumes were up on last year 
at £3.6bn (2014: £2.7bn). There were signs of a divergence 
in performance across different types of retail parks with 
fashion parks delivering better returns and some 
supermarket-anchored parks seeing values fall (see page 
16 for market sub-segments). Total IPD return for the 
whole UK retail parks sector was 6.9%.
French shopping centre transaction volumes were £3.9bn 
(2014: £5.8bn). Investor appetite was strong, in particular 
with low European interest rates, and this drove capital 
value uplifts. (Total IPD returns are not yet available for 
French shopping centres.)
Irish retail transactions were £0.5bn (2014: £1.1bn) and 
retail property delivered a total IPD return of 20.9%, 
driven by strong rental and capital growth. 
An influx of capital into the premium outlets market from 
international funds and private equity firms contributed 
to a 15% rise in the volume of transactions (total c.£600m). 
The strong demand, and a lack of new supply, drove a 
sharp increase in valuations. Total property returns were 
approximately 20% (source: Cushman and Wakefield).

that match the latest trends 
driving demand for space in a 
dynamic retail environment.
CONSUMER TRENDS
Our assets are in the sub-sectors of prime shopping centres, retail parks and premium outlets. We believe that these categories are best 
positioned to match the latest trends in shopping habits of consumers. In a dynamic and evolving retail landscape, we see an opportunity 
to outperform our competitors by selecting retail assets in these categories.

HOW DOES THE GROWTH OF ONLINE SHOPPING 
IMPACT RETAILERS’ DEMAND FOR PHYSICAL SPACE?
To help us better understand the topic, we carried out research with 
the Investment Property Federation, CBRE and Conlumino.
Our survey found that 86% of customers use at least two channels 
when shopping (eg both physical stores and online). The physical 
store channel was identified as being important for more than just 
making a transaction. Shoppers use the physical space to research 
products, trial and compare different brands and for transaction 
fulfilment (eg click & collect). In fact, despite the growing share of 
sales completed online, nine out of ten shopper journeys still involve 
a physical store for at least one step of the process. 
Click & collect is a growing trend and over half of customers said they 
would use the service if it was offered. For click & collect customers, 
the store offers a fulfilment solution, however a Verdict report found 
that 32% of customers went on to make additional purchases in store 
when collecting a click & collect package.
Retailers also recognise the role a physical store plays in creating 
brand awareness and loyalty. Our research showed that sales online 
increased in the store’s catchment area by 5-6% when a new fashion 
store opened.
Overall, our findings suggest that retailers with a successful 
multichannel strategy are able to drive greater sales efficiency from 
their physical retail space.

OCCUPIER MARKETS
PRIME SHOPPING CENTRES 
Prime shopping centres are those which cover a 
sizeable catchment, include large anchor stores and 
offer consumers catering and entertainment as well  
as retail. With the emergence of multichannel 
distribution, retailers are re-evaluating the size and 
efficiency of their physical store footprint. As a result, 
there is a polarisation in demand for space, with 
retailers prioritising stores in prime shopping centres 
and reducing space in secondary centres and high street 
locations. Prime shopping centres are more likely to 
deliver higher footfall and dwell time given the range of 
leading brands, food, beverage and leisure offering, 
digital infrastructure and attractive surroundings. 
With ownership stakes in 15 of the top shopping centres 
(as designated by Property Market Analysis (PMA)), 
and a total of 1.7 million m
2
 of retail and leisure space, 
we are a leading European shopping centre owner and 
one of the top three in both the UK and France (see 
Charts 4 and 5). We have over 700 different retail and 
leisure brands across our shopping centres and 14% of 
our space is let to catering and leisure tenants. 
The rents achievable at shopping centres are driven by 
their size, location, demographic catchment and local 
competition. High tenant demand and low vacancy 
drives growth in ERV (estimated rental value). In 
France, rental growth is driven by new lettings and 
in-place leases are also linked to a price inflation index. 
RETAIL PARKS 
Retail parks are predominantly situated in out of town 
locations, which are easily accessible by car and are 
well-connected to major road networks with plentiful 
free parking. Units are on average larger and rents are 
lower per square metre than in shopping centres. 
W e are the second largest direct owner of retail parks  
in the UK with 500,000m
2
 across 21 assets. The total  
UK market comprises 11 million m
2
 and ownership  
is fragmented. 
As Chart 6 below shows, the retail park market is 
categorised into five sub-segments. We are primarily 
focused on three of the sub-segments, being shopping 
parks, hybrid parks and key homeware parks. We 
choose to operate in these segments because they offer 
the strongest occupational demand.
In hybrid and key homeware parks, improved economic 
conditions and greater consumer confidence across the 
regions in the UK are driving strong demand from 
homeware and furnishings brands. Retailers such as 
ScS, Oak Furniture Land and Tapi have all been 
expanding their portfolios. These retailers have also 
been absorbing space from DIY retailers such as B&Q 
and Homebase who are reducing their store numbers.
There is also a growing trend for fashion retailers, which 
traditionally locate in shopping centres, to take space

16 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 16 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 on retail parks. Retail parks offer a cost-effective way  
for fashion retailers to fill in the gaps in their store 
footprint between prime shopping centres in large 
towns. This strategy is also leading to improved unit 
fit-outs, more attractive surroundings and more food 
and beverage on retail parks.
PREMIUM OUTLETS 
Outlet centres offer a channel for retailers to distribute 
excess inventory by selling it at a material discount to 
original price. Furthermore, premium outlets are often 
designed to match the store-fit of a full-price store, 
hence retailers are able to retain their brand identity 
even with customers shopping at premium outlets.
There are approximately 200 outlet centres across the 
European market. The market can be broadly 
categorised according to the type of customer it serves. 
The pyramid structure in Chart 7 represents the 
European premium outlets market. Value Retail and VIA 
Outlets together are among the top three largest players  
in Europe and operate in the upper two segments. 
Premium outlets which provide international fashion 
and luxury brands are at the top of the market. Value 
Retail is positioned at this level, with its nine unique 
shopping-tourism Villages serving the international 
luxury and fashion consumer. Sales densities at Value 
Retail villages can be as high as €30,000 /m
2
.
The middle segment caters to the mainstream fashion 
customer. VIA Outlets’ six centres are in this category. 
The strategy of improving the tenant mix at VIA Outlets 
will raise the sales densities at these centres and lift 
them within this middle segment. 
The third low-end segment, which offers discounted 
high street clothes or factory surplus goods, is not 
served by Value Retail or VIA Outlets.
Outlet centre rents are, on the whole, directly linked to 
tenant sales. Tenants are on shorter leases than 
shopping centres. Outlet operators also change the 
brand line-up at outlets more frequently to match 
supply and demand. 
Sales growth has been on average 8% p.a. in the European 
premium outlets market in the last three years. A key 
driver of the market is the strong demand from 
international tourists. International visitors, in particular 
from China, the Middle East and Russia, who appreciate 
luxury design, take advantage of the opportunity to buy 
goods at a discount while travelling in Europe. 
OUTLOOK
In terms of economic backdrop, the ingredients are in 
place to support continued retail sales growth in the 
UK, with rising wages, low interest rates and low 
inflation expected to continue through 2016. In France, 
consumer confidence is more muted, in particular as a 
result of recent terrorist attacks. In Ireland, the 
economic picture is forecast to remain strong with 
continued growth in retail sales.
In occupational markets, we expect there to be greater 
polarisation in demand for prime retail space as a result 
of multichannel trends. This will favour Hammerson’s 
portfolio, and help drive above-average rental growth.
Premium outlet sales growth is expected to continue, 
supported by growth in the shopping-tourism market 
from a wide mix of global travellers. This sales growth 
will translate into growing rents, strong investment 
volumes and higher than average returns. 
However, since the start of 2016, stock markets have 
been volatile, reflecting a more uncertain global 
economic and political outlook. Downside risks 
associated with China, Brexit and the Middle East could 
impact consumer confidence and capital returns in 2016.  
We expect capital value growth in commercial property 
to slow in 2016. However, retail property has 
traditionally lagged the cycles of other more volatile 
commercial property such as office assets.

GROWTH IN LIKE-FOR-LIKE NRI (%)*
Description
The annual growth in net rental income (NRI) for investment 
properties owned throughout the current and prior periods, 
excluding the impact of acquisitions, disposals, developments and 
exchange rate movements.
Principal stakeholder focus 1
 
NRI from the property portfolio is the primary source of operating 
cash flow and the main contributor to earnings. We aim to grow 
like-for-like NRI through leasing vacant space, capturing uplifts 
from rent reviews and indexation, tenant engineering and other 
‘value-adding’ initiatives.
Performance
2.3% (2014: 2.1%) 
On a like-for-like basis, NRI grew by 2.3% in 2015, above our target 
of 2.0%. Income from UK shopping centres and retail parks grew 
by 2.1% and 2.6% respectively. Our French shopping centres 
produced income growth of 2.5%.
2016 outlook
We expect the occupational market to improve in 2016, 
particularly in the UK. Lease expiries, breaks, rent reviews and 
leasing vacant space provide the opportunity to increase rental 
income and implement tenant rotation to improve the quality of 
the retail offer across our portfolio.
Description
We compare the total return achieved by our property 
investments on a proportionally consolidated basis, including 
premium outlets, against a benchmark based on the annual IPD 
Retail Property Universe. The benchmark is weighted 70:30 
between the IPD UK and French indices to be comparable with 
the geographical allocation of our property portfolio. As the final 
2015 IPD indices are not published until after the publication of 
this Annual Report, the benchmark is management’s best estimate 
using available IPD data.
Principal stakeholder focus 1
 
We invest in, create and operate high-quality real estate which is 
attractive to both retailers and shoppers and provides a platform 
from which to deliver income and value growth in excess of 
industry benchmarks.
Performance
12.4% (Benchmark 9 .9%) (2014: 13.6% (Benchmark 12.5%)) 
During 2015, the property portfolio produced a total return of 
12.4% which was 250bp ahead of the estimated IPD benchmark. 
The outperformance was driven by premium outlets which 
delivered a total return of 23.7%.
2016 outlook
In 2016, we believe our high-quality portfolio and clear business 
model will continue to outperform the retail benchmark.

COST RATIO (%)*
Description
The cost ratio shows the total operating costs, including the cost  
of vacancy, as a percentage of gross rental income for our property 
portfolio. We have amended the calculation methodology, in line 
with EPRA best practice, to adjust for costs associated with 
inclusive leases. We have restated the prior year ratios using the 
same methodology. The ratio is not directly comparable between 
different companies, as it is impacted by different business models 
and accounting treatments. 
Principal stakeholder focus 1
 
Maintaining an efficient operating structure supports growth in 
earnings and future dividends.
Performance
23.1% (2014: 22.8%)
During 2015, our cost base has been managed effectively and the 
proportion of net administration costs as a percentage of gross 
rental income has reduced from 12.8% to 11.8%. This reduction 
was offset by an increased proportion of property costs from 10.0% 
to 11.3%. This increase is principally due to higher vacancy and 
property running costs at properties awaiting redevelopment. 
2016 outlook
The ratio is forecast to improve as additional income from recent 
acquisitions and completed developments are expected to offset 
investment in growing business areas such as digital and 
development. We will continue to manage effectively property 
costs associated with properties awaiting development ahead of 
these projects commencing on site.
Description
The annual percentage increase in adjusted earnings per share 
(EPS) compared with inflation.
Principal stakeholder focus 1
 
Adjusted EPS is our principal profit measure and an indicator  
of the level of recurring profit available for distribution to 
shareholders as dividends. Sustained growth in EPS reflects the 
effective delivery of our business model and supports strong 
financial returns and a progressive dividend policy.
Performance
12.6% (2014: 3.5%)
In 2015, adjusted EPS increased by 3.0 pence, or 12.6%, to  
26.9 pence. This increase was driven by increased rental income 
and additional earnings from our premium outlet investments. 
Earnings were further enhanced by the lower average cost of 
borrowing and lower administration expenses, but impacted by 
the dilution associated with the 2014 share placing. 
We benchmark this KPI against inflation, which for 2015 was 
0.2%, resulting in an outperformance of 12.4 percentage points. 
This benchmark was previously UK RPI, but has been changed in 
2015 to a weighted 70:30 UK: France CPI benchmark. This is also 
now reflected in the 2015 LTIP performance conditions and 
comparative benchmarks in Chart 11 have been restated.
2016 outlook
2016 EPS growth will be driven by income from recent 
acquisitions and completed developments, partly offset by lost 
income associated with recent and planned disposals.

The ratio has improved by 4% during 2015 
reflecting greater operational efficiency 
although the reduction in the ratio has 
been tempered by emissions associated 
with increased gas consumption.
2016 outlook
We expect to further reduce the ratio in 
2016 as we implement initiatives involving 
investment in renewables, energy-efficient 
technology and lighting. However, the 
absolute level of emissions is forecast to 
increase as the portfolio grows and the 
effective management of emissions at 
acquired and newly-developed properties 
will be a key area of focus.
Description
The amount of income secured through 
leasing activity during the year from both

not a like-for-like, figure.
Principal stakeholder focus 2
Leasing is directly linked to rental income 
growth and also enables us to enhance the 
retail offer across our portfolio through 
proactive tenant rotation.
Performance
£27 .9 million (2014: £29 .5 million)
Leasing volumes have remained high in 
2015, totalling £27 .9 million. Whilst 
absolute volumes were slightly lower than 
in 2014, demand for space in our prime 
properties remained strong. On average, 
principal leases signed in 2015 were 
secured at 3% above December 2014 ERVs 
and 10% above the previous passing rent.
Across the portfolio we signed 396 leases 
(UK: 260, France: 136) representing a total 
area of 136,000m
2
.
2016 outlook
We expect leasing volumes to remain high 
in 2016 with continued retailer demand 
for new space. We are focused on 
delivering tenant rotation to enhance the 
retail offer across our portfolio, although 
the absolute volume of leasing is affected 
by the timing of lease expiries.
Key Performance Indicators continued
Description
The ERV of the space in our investment 
portfolio which is currently let, as a 
percentage of the total ERV of the portfolio.
Principal stakeholder focus 2
 
We aim to maximise the occupancy 
of our properties as income lost 
through vacancy has a direct impact 
on profitability. 
However, we believe that a low level  
of structural vacancy provides an 
opportunity for us to manage the mix  
and location of retailers within a property. 
This enhances the consumer experience, 
encourages footfall and sales and is 
consistent with the strategy for 
generating income and capital growth.
Performance
97 .7% (2014: 97 .5%) 
Occupancy remains above our 97 .0% 
target, with the portfolio being 97 .7% 
occupied at the year end. This was 
marginally higher than the prior year, 
principally due to higher occupation in 
our shopping centres in both the UK 
and France.
2016 outlook
We expect occupancy to remain high in 
2016 as retailers in both the UK and 
France seek space in the best retail venues 
and we target retailers who will enhance 
the desirability of our portfolio.

22 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 22 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 NET RENTAL INCOME
On a like-for-like basis net rental income increased by 
2.1% in 2015, compared with a 2.2% increase in 2014. 
The growth in 2015 is driven by rent review settlements, 
income from new lettings and increased car park 
income. The best performing centres were Highcross, 
Monument Mall, Silverburn and Union Square which 
benefitted from recent lettings and uplifts associated 
with rent reviews. Non-rental income, being net  
income from car parks and the sale of advertising  
and merchandising opportunities at our centres,  
totalled £19 .1 million, and grew by 10% in 2015 on a 
like-for-like basis.
LEASING, OCCUPANCY AND ERVS
Tenant demand for space at our centres remained 
strong, with 151 leases signed representing £11.7 million 
of annual rental income and 47 ,800m
2
 of space. For 
principal leases, rents secured were 4% above 
December 2014 ERVs and 9% above the previous 
passing rent. Associated with this occupational demand, 
the portfolio achieved ERV growth of 2.8% compared 
with 2.6% in 2014. Occupancy levels remained high at 
98.3%, compared with 98.1% in December 2014. 
We have delivered a number of key leasing deals across 
our portfolio during the year. These targeted deals help 
strengthen and refresh our centres, drive ERV growth 
and include flagship stores for UK and international 
brands and luxury operators. Highlights included three 
Victoria’s Secret lettings at The Oracle, Cabot Circus 
and WestQuay; upsized Topshop and River Island stores 
at Bullring; and the introduction of Watchfinder and 
Séraphine at Victoria Quarter. We also signed leases 
with a range of exciting caterers including Cau at  
The Oracle, Byron at Union Square, its first Scottish 
restaurant, and TGI Friday’s restaurants at The Oracle 
and Highcross.
SALES, FOOTFALL AND OCCUPANCY COST
Consumers continue to demonstrate increasing 
confidence, and our centres have achieved sales growth 
in 2015 of 1.3%, calculated on a same centre basis. The 
strongest growth was at Silverburn and The Oracle. 
Footfall increased by 1.1%, a turnaround compared with 
the 1.3% reduction in 2014. This increased activity has 
resulted in a reduction in the occupational cost ratio 
from 20.8% at the beginning of the year to 19 .2% at  
31 December 2015.
LEASE EXPIRIES AND RENT REVIEWS
The portfolio has a diverse tenant base and offers both a 
robust income stream, with a weighted unexpired lease 
term of six years, as well as opportunities for rental 
growth. Within the portfolio, leases that are subject to 
rent reviews, break clauses or expiry offer the prospect 
to secure additional rental income. Over the three years 
to December 2018, these leases would provide additional 
annual rental income of £10.7 million if renewed, or if 
reviews are settled, at current market rents.
TENANT COVENANTS AND CREDIT 
CONTROL
There were only five units let to tenants in 
administration at 31 December 2015, nine fewer than  
at the beginning of the year. In total, these tenants 
represented just 0.1% of the Group’s total passing rents. 
Our credit control function oversees our collection 
process and collection rates remain strong, with 97%  
of billings received within 14 days of the December due 
date. It also assesses the covenant strength of 
prospective tenants and monitors the credit standing  
of our existing tenants using a credit rating agency. The 
agency has a four-point risk indicator scale, and at  
31 December 2015, 87% of our shopping centre tenants 
were rated within the two lowest risk categories. 
COMMERCIAL INITIATIVES
In line with our Product Experience Framework, we  
are enhancing the quality of customer experience and 
service across our portfolio. Key initiatives include 
upgrading our customer service desks, providing 
electric car and mobile phone charging points, and 
introducing pianos to each mall to enliven the shopping 
experience. Our customer service performance was 
recognised during the year with the Silverburn team 
winning an unprecedented fourth BCSC Achieving 
Customer Excellence award.
We are also trialling a number of new initiatives 
including a pop-up programme and click & collect 
provisions. Click & collect is available in four centres 
with performance significantly exceeding expectations. 
In Brent Cross, we are seeing an average of 400 parcels 
being handled each week, and the click & collect service 
at The Oracle, launched in November 2015, is already 
outperforming Brent Cross at the same stage of 
operation. We will be rolling out to additional sites and 
trialling new formats of click & collect in 2016.

STRATEGIC REPORT
BUSINESS REVIEW Interactive hoardings, used on a temporary basis on 
units being refurbished, are a great example of a simple, 
low-cost solution to enliven the mall. Trialled in four 
centres and retail parks over a six week period,  
they received more than two million interactions  
from shoppers. 
As retail specialists, we continue to demonstrate 
industry-leading insight and in 2015 we have:
 – Launched the Hammerson Retail Tracker (HART), 
published on a monthly basis for a national 
readership in The Times, to provide insight into UK 
spending habits and retail trends;
 – Issued our third annual retail report ‘Shopper Tribes’ 
in conjunction with retail consultant Conlumino; and 
 – Co-authored and hosted a seminar on ‘Pricing  
Retail Space’ in conjunction with the Investment 
Property Forum.
Looking ahead to 2016, we are working on a wide range of 
initiatives to deliver a consistent, high quality offer across 
the portfolio for the benefit of both retailers and shoppers. 
These initiatives are designed to extend dwell times and 
encourage loyalty . W e are enhancing the family 
experience at our centres by improving facilities, such as 
toilets, with upgrades to infant feeding and changing 
rooms. W e will extend our programme of events and 
innovative food concepts to bring our centres to life and 
drive footfall as well as providing premium services to 
better support the customer experience.
A key part of many shopping journeys involves our car 
parks. In 2016, we will be trialling a new design as well 
as upgrading the technology across our car parks. We 
will combine best in class wayfinding, lighting and 
design principles to deliver an experience that is 
welcoming, safe and easy to use.
DIGITAL ENGAGEMENT
Our integrated digital platform is now live across  
all shopping centres. The ‘Plus’ app, a personalised 
shopping companion, allows us to communicate 
directly with shoppers in real-time, providing 
personalised content and exclusive offers based on  
their interests, redemption history and stores visited, 
together with centre information such as floorplans, 
events and live centre news. The app has been well 
received by shoppers with a 140,000 downloads, well 
ahead of our expectations. We continue to see strong 
levels of customers registering their data through the 
app, and more than a quarter of those registered 
redeemed an offer. Version 2 of the ‘Plus’ app will go live 
in the Spring, with a new look and feel and additional 
functionality, including the ability to reward shoppers 
for their loyalty.

UK SHOPPING CENTRES
ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSALS AND 
COMPLETED DEVELOPMENTS
In March, we took 100% ownership of Martineau 
Galleries, Birmingham by acquiring the stakes of our 
two joint venture partners. We are considering a 
number of potential strategic development 
opportunities for the property in the medium term and 
for this reason it is classified within the UK Other 
portfolio in the segmental analysis in the accounts and 
the Additional Disclosures section of this report. 
In June, Cineworld opened its new 14-screen cinema 
completing the 10,900m
2
 leisure-led extension at 
Silverburn. The case study on page 25 gives further 
details about this exciting project.
In December, we announced the disposal of Monument 
Mall, Newcastle for £75 million, some £8 million above 
its value at the beginning of the year. The 9 ,500m
2
 centre 
was acquired in 2011 and was redeveloped in 2013. The 
sale crystallised a £24 million profit on cost and is part of 
the £500 million disposal programme announced at the 
time of the Irish loan portfolio acquisition.
In February 2016, we acquired Grand Central, 
Birmingham, a 40,400m
2 
shopping centre for a total 
cost of £350 million. The centre, which opened in 
September 2015, is anchored by a 23,200m
2
 John Lewis 
and provides a modern retail environment for  
40 premium stores including Jo Malone, Joules,  
Cath Kidston and The White Company. It also  
contains 20 casual dining brands including Yo Sushi,  
Caffe Concerto and Tapas Revolution. The acquisition 
supports our long-term commitment to Birmingham 
which is benefitting from significant inward investment. 
We have contracted to sell, subject to regulatory 
approval, 50% of the scheme to CPPIB, one of the 
existing joint venture partners in Bullring for  
£175 million.
POSITIVE PLACES
Our sustainability initiatives also have financial benefits 
for the Group and its tenants. During 2015, we saved  
£2.0 million in landfill tax through recycling and diversion 
of waste from landfill and have reduced like-for-like 
electricity consumption by 3% across our centres.
At Bullring, we upgraded the lighting with over 4,000 
new LED lights. As the most energy-hungry asset within 
the portfolio this has been a key focus area and we are 
already seeing reductions in energy consumption. The 
project won Energy Demand Reduction funding from 
the Department of Energy and Climate Change. At a 
cost of £1.5 million this has been a significant 
investment, but payback is expected within 4.5 years. 
The works on Bullring multi-storey car parks were 
completed in early October, and electricity 
consumption has fallen by almost 50%.

Ireland
INTRODUCTION
In September we announced the acquisition, in a 50:50 
joint venture with Allianz, of a €1.85 billion loan 
portfolio secured against prime Dublin retail property.
The face value of the loans acquired was €2.6 billion and 
following completion of the transaction in October, the 
joint venture has been negotiating with the borrower 
group to take ownership of the secured real estate.
RATIONALE
This acquisition provides the Group with a new Irish 
operation to broaden our European platform and the 
opportunity to become Ireland’s leading retail property 
owner. The portfolio is located in Dublin, Ireland’s 
strongest retail centre, and, in addition to the 
population of 1.3 million, the city welcomes significant 
numbers of tourists (8.6 million in 2015).
The Irish economy had the fastest GDP growth in the 
Eurozone in 2014 and has achieved further GDP growth 
of 6.9% in 2015. Retail sales have risen by 6% in the year 
to December 2015 and the portfolio offers significant 
value upside through asset management and 
development opportunities. The acquisition is consistent 
with our corporate strategy and there are significant 
synergies with our existing UK and French operations 
which will enable a swift management transition when 
the assets are acquired from the borrowers.
PROPERTY ASSETS
The transaction represents a rare opportunity to 
acquire a portfolio of quality assets in a single 
transaction. The principal property asset is Dundrum 
Town Centre which is 5km south of the city centre and 
was opened in 2005. The property is anchored by 
Harvey Nichols, House of Fraser, M&S and Penney’s 
and has 120 shops, 38 restaurants, a 12-screen VIP 
cinema and 3,400 car parking spaces. The property has 
an annual footfall of 18 million, generates £44 million  
of passing rent (100% figure) and has an average 
unexpired lease term of 12 years. Adjacent to  
Dundrum Town Centre is a six acre development  
site (Dundrum Phase 2) which previously benefitted 
from a 100,000m
2
 retail consent to extend the existing 
centre. We believe this site offers a better opportunity 
to bring forward a mixed-use development. 
The Swords Pavilions shopping centre is a 50% 
co-ownership with IPUT and Irish Life situated in  
the north of Dublin. The 45,500m
2 
centre has annual 
footfall of 12 million and generates passing rent of  
£11 million (100% figure). A 16 acre development  
site adjacent to the centre offers scope for future  
mixed-use development.
The Ilac Centre is in the heart of central Dublin on 
Henry Street and is a 50% co-ownership with Irish Life. 
The 15,000m
2
 centre has annual footfall of 18 million 
and generates passing rent of £7 million (100% figure). 
The portfolio also includes a 5.3 acre city centre 
development site, adjacent to the Ilac Centre. We 
believe this is one of the largest and best-positioned 
urban development sites in Europe and has taken over  
a decade to assemble. The site comprises multiple 
buildings along Henry Street, O’Connell Street and 
Moore Street. With its strategic location and mix of 
current tenants, the site offers the flexibility to pursue 
numerous development scenarios and deliver a modern 
landmark of international importance that is 
sympathetic to the neighbourhood’s history.
STRUCTURE
Under the terms of the joint venture, when the property 
assets are acquired from the borrowers, the Group will 
own 50% of Dundrum Town Centre and Dundrum 
Phase 2 in joint venture with Allianz and act as asset 
and development manager. We will also own 50% 
co-ownership shares in the Ilac Centre and in Swords 
Pavilions shopping centre, and 100% of the two 
remaining development sites: Dublin Central and 
Swords Pavilions. The total consideration for the 
Group’s share of the acquisition is £0.91 billion of which 
£0.69 billion had been incurred at 31 December 2015. 
We have established a new Irish team to manage the 
transition from loans to property assets and expect to 
own the properties by the summer of 2016.

STRATEGIC REPORT
BUSINESS REVIEW NET RENTAL INCOME
Like-for-like net rental income increased by 2.6% in 
2015, compared to 2.4% in 2014. The growth is due to a 
year-on-year increase in surrender premiums received 
associated with proactive tenant rotation at Imperial 
Retail Park, Bristol and Fife Central Retail Park, 
Kirkcaldy. These were partly offset by vacancy costs 
ahead of the redevelopments at Battery Retail Park, 
Birmingham and Parc Tawe, Swansea. 
LEASING, OCCUPANCY AND ERVS
Across the portfolio we signed 79 leases representing 
£8.3 million of annual rental income and 43,300m
2
 of 
space. For principal leases, rents were contracted at 4% 
above the December 2014 ERVs and 8% above the 
previous passing rent. Occupancy levels remained high 
at 98.4%, almost unchanged from the position at  
31 December 2014. 
ERV growth was 1.3% in 2015, compared with 0.5%  
for 2014. The occupational markets are improving, 
particularly homewares and we are targeting tenants 
which will enhance the retail offer at individual parks 
and grow income. Key leasing transactions during the 
year included a new 1,850m
2
 TK Maxx at Westmorland 
Retail Park, Cramlington, a 1,900m
2
 Next at Telford 
Forge Shopping Park, Telford and a 900m
2
 Tapi at  
St Oswald’s Retail Park, Gloucester. 
LEASE EXPIRIES AND RENT REVIEWS
One of the sector’s strengths is security of income.  
As at 31 December 2015, the portfolio had the longest 
weighted unexpired lease term, compared to the 
Group’s other portfolios, at nine years. 
As with the UK shopping centre portfolio, a proportion 
of the leases are subject to rent reviews, break clauses  
or expiry and offer the opportunity to secure additional 
income. Over the three years to December 2018, these 
leases would provide additional annual rental income  
of £3.5 million if renewed, or if reviews are settled at 
current market rents. 
TENANT COVENANTS AND CREDIT 
CONTROL
At 31 December 2015, there was just one tenant in 
administration representing £0.4 million of income. 
96% of billings were collected within 14 days of the 
December due date and 90% of our retail parks tenants 
were rated by the credit agency in the two lowest  
risk categories. 
COMMERCIAL INITIATIVES
As part of the Group’s Product Experience Framework, 
we are reducing the amount of space let to DIY 
operators and reconfiguring this to enhance the retail 
offer at our parks. An example of this is at Fife Central 
Retail Park, Kirkcaldy where we are reconfiguring a 
former Homebase unit to create four new units and 
increase the passing rent from this space by 150%.
We are also keen to collect more insightful information 
about the portfolio and are undertaking a series of 
in-depth customer surveys to better understand 
consumer opinions about facilities and existing or 
prospective tenants. Consistent with our strategy at 
shopping centres, we are introducing mobile phone 
chargers, wi-fi and click & collect lockers at a number  
of our parks to enhance the customer experience.
DISPOSALS AND COMPLETED 
DEVELOPMENTS
In April, we sold Drakehouse Retail Park, Sheffield for 
gross proceeds of £62 million, generating a £2 million 
profit compared with the 31 December 2014 valuation.
At Cyfarthfa Retail Park, Merthyr Tydfil we completed  
a £30 million, 14,500m
2 
extension in August. The 
extension includes B&Q’s first Eco-learning store, a 
full-line 4,600m
2
 M&S store and five fashion units 
including Next and River Island. The scheme has a yield 
on cost of 7% and generated a profit on cost of 34%.
The redevelopment of Elliott’s Field, Rugby opened at 
the end of November. The scheme accommodates  
16 fashion, homeware and catering brands and is 
anchored by a 5,600m
2
 Debenhams and a 4,600m
2
 
M&S. The scheme includes new retailers to the Group’s 
retail park portfolio including H&M, Fat Face and  
Ed’s Easy Diner. The scheme has a BREEAM Excellent 
rating and generated a profit on cost of 24%. Further 
details about the project are provided on page 29 .
POSITIVE PLACES
Working with our contractor and retailers at the 
extension project at Cyfarthfa Retail Park in Merthyr 
Tydfil, we have created substantial training and 
employment opportunities for local residents. In total, 
722 jobs were created which saw 19 unemployed 
individuals supported into work and two 
apprenticeships. 50% of contractors employed on-site 
lived locally and eight local businesses have received 
training in digital skills.

30 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 30 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 NET RENTAL INCOME
On a like-for-like basis net rental income increased  
by 2.5% in 2015, compared to 2.0% in 2014. Tenant 
rotation undertaken over the past 24 months has 
helped increase income. Les Trois Fontaines,  
Cergy Pontoise was the strongest performing centre 
with new tenants including Free, Levi’s and André.  
As with our UK shopping centres, we have been 
focusing on increasing non-rental income and  
in 2015 this revenue stream has increased to  
£4.7 million, compared to £3.1 million in 2014.
LEASING, OCCUPANCY AND ERVS
Against an unfavourable macroeconomic backdrop, we 
continue to sign new leases across the portfolio. In 2015, 
we contracted 136 leases, representing £7 .2 million of 
annual rental income and 37 ,600m
2
 of space. For 
principal leases, the new income was 2% above 
December 2014 ERVs and 10% above the previous 
passing rent. 
ERV growth remains challenging, particularly given  
the low level of indexation growth. In 2015 like-for-like 
ERVs were unchanged. Occupancy levels at 96.9% were 
marginally higher than in 2014.
One of the key objectives for the French portfolio is to 
rotate tenants, enabling us to introduce new leisure and 
catering brands to enliven the retail offer at our centres. 
Key leasing deals during the year include All Saints and 
Tiger at Les Terrasses du Port, Marseille and seven new 
international brands taking their first stores in France 
including Tuc Tuc and Punt Roma. 
TENANT COVENANT AND CREDIT CONTROL
Associated with the more challenging economic 
environment in France, at 31 December 2015 there  
were 49 units in administration across the portfolio,  
an increase of 16 during the year. All of these units 
continue to trade and represent only 0.8% of the 
Group’s passing rent. These units provide opportunities 
to introduce new tenants to enhance the tenant mix. 
86% of billings were collected within 14 days of the 
December due date and 83% of the tenants are deemed 
low risk, using ratings from an external credit agency. 
SALES, FOOTFALL AND OCCUPANCY COST
Over the course of 2015, retail sales increased by 0.6%, 
calculated on a same centre basis, but footfall was 0.6% 
lower. The sales improvement has been driven by our 
leasing strategy with new tenants boosting sales as well 
as a strong performance from Les Terrasses du Port, 
Marseille (see case study on page 33) which opened in 
May 2014. The sales and footfall performance was 
adversely impacted by the terrorist attacks in Paris in 
November. Prior to this, sales and footfall growth were 
1.6% and 0.4% respectively for the ten months to 
October 2015. 
Consistent with the increase in sales, the occupational 
cost ratio decreased during 2015 from 14.4% to 14.0%  
at 31 December 2015.
LEASE EXPIRIES AND RENT REVIEWS
Leases in France tend to be shorter than in the UK retail 
market, and across our portfolio the average unexpired 
lease term is three years, or six years excluding tenant 
break options. The portfolio offers opportunities for 
rental growth with an average reversion of 10%. Leases 
expiring, or subject to tenants’ break clauses, over the 
three years to December 2018 would provide additional 
annual rental income of £2.5 million if renewed at 
current market rents. Most of our French leases are 
subject to annual indexation, which will be nil in 2016.

STRATEGIC REPORT
BUSINESS REVIEW COMMERCIAL INITIATIVES
In addition to the tenant rotation initiatives, we are 
applying our Product Experience Framework to the 
French portfolio, in order to enhance the retail and 
customer experience. We approach this from a Group 
perspective with an ambition to deliver a more 
consistent retailer and shopper experience across our 
entire shopping centre portfolio. However, we recognise 
the importance of providing tailored facilities and 
services which are particularly relevant to each  
centre’s catchment. 
We are in the process of rolling out mobile phone 
charging units across all our French assets, and are 
trialling click & collect lockers in two of our shopping 
centres. We are also developing retail design guidelines 
for each of our centres, and have been using interactive 
hoardings to enliven empty units and create an 
engaging experience for our shoppers. 
Our recent acquisitions of Saint Sébastien, Nancy, and 
Nicetoile, Nice, acquired in February 2014 and January 
2015 respectively, have benefitted from our Product 
Experience strategy. At Saint Sébastien, works have 
started to enhance the interior of the centre and are 
expected to complete in May 2016.
At Nicetoile, we have introduced a new management 
structure, implemented a range of Hammerson 
marketing tools including an upgraded website, and 
launched our portfolio-wide ‘Plus’ app. The centre is 
currently fully let although we are in discussion with a 
number of aspirational retailers to further enhance the 
tenant mix. 
We are also negotiating with local authorities to enable 
year-round Sunday trading across the portfolio. During 
2015 we were granted permission to trade on Sundays 
at O’Parinor and Italie Deux. In total, five of our centres 
can now trade throughout the week.
ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSALS AND 
COMPLETED DEVELOPMENTS
In line with our strategy of actively managing our 
portfolio and focusing on leading retail destinations,  
in January 2015 we acquired a 10% interest in Nicetoile 
shopping centre in Nice, in conjunction with our 
partner, Allianz. The 17 ,600m
2
 centre attracts 13 million 
visitors each year and generates passing rent of  
£14 million. We manage the centre and our share  
of the acquisition cost was €31 million (£24 million). 
In October, we completed the disposal of two smaller 
shopping centres, Bercy 2, Paris for €64 million  
(£47 million) and Grand Maine, Angers for €63 million 
(£46 million). Both disposals were ahead of the  
31 December 2014 valuations and resulted in a 
combined profit on disposal of £11 million.
In November, we opened Le Jeu de Paume, a 23,800m
2
 
scheme in the centre of Beauvais, 60km north of Paris. 
The new centre, which is anchored by a Carrefour 
Market, has attracted high-quality tenants, the majority 
of which are new to Beauvais or the Oise region. Key 
retailers include H&M, Sephora, Superdry, New Yorker, 
iSwitch and G-Star Raw. The centre incorporates a 
number of new initiatives including car park guidance 
technology, interactive kiosks, mobile phone charging,  
a dedicated welcome desk and a children’s play area. 
Initial trading is positive and the scheme welcomed 
over 200,000 shoppers in the first two weeks of trading.
In January 2016, we exchanged contracts for the sale  
of Villebon 2 retail park for €159 million (£117 million). 
The disposal was the final part of the £200 million 
initial tranche of the £500 million disposal programme 
announced to part-fund the Irish loan portfolio 
acquisition and the disposal is expected to complete  
in the Spring.
POSITIVE PLACES
63% of leases in our French portfolio include 
environmental clauses.
The development at Beauvais created 500 construction 
jobs and 27 apprenticeships, with 73% of roles being 
taken by local people.
Our cradle-to-grave carbon lifecycle assessment of  
Les Terrasses du Port has helped our development 
teams to remove carbon from projects during the design 
process. Embodied carbon, from concrete and steel,  
can be reduced by up to 50% through optimised design.

34 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 34 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 INTRODUCTION
The Group has a large number of development opportunities in both the UK and France, including two on-site 
schemes and three major London developments. These would require expenditure of approximately £1.5 billion and 
have the potential to significantly grow the business and create iconic retail destinations. In addition, we are working 
to bring forward a number of potential future development projects, but maintain a tight control of expenditure 
while these opportunities are fully assessed.
COMPLETED DEVELOPMENTS
We completed four developments during 2015 in Beauvais, Glasgow, Merthyr Tydfil and Rugby. For further details 
see the UK Shopping Centres, UK Retail Parks and France sections of this Business Review. The teams which 
delivered these schemes have been redeployed to the Group’s on-site and pipeline schemes. This approach provides 
new challenges for our people and ensures the experience gained and lessons learnt are retained by the Group.
Victoria Gate, Leeds is a £165 million scheme adjacent 
to Victoria Quarter arcade. The 35,400m
2
 development 
is anchored by a 24,200m
2
 flagship John Lewis store, 
the first in Leeds and largest outside London. The 
scheme includes more than 30 high-end retailers and 
restaurants to complement the offer at Victoria Quarter 
as well as an 850-space multi-storey car park. The 
scheme is 68% pre-let to brands including Maje, Cos, 
Anthropologie, The White Company, & Other Stories 
and Hackett and is due to open in Autumn 2016. We are 
targeting BREEAM Excellent for the development  
and have managed to divert 98% of construction and 
demolition waste from landfill. When combined  
with Victoria Quarter the new scheme will create  
the largest premium retail and leisure destination  
in Northern England.
WestQuay Watermark is a 17 ,000m
2
 leisure and catering 
scheme next to our jointly-owned WestQuay shopping 
centre. The scheme includes 23 new restaurants, which 
will open in late 2016, and a 10-screen Showcase 
Cinema de Lux which will open in early 2017 . The 
project will create a new city centre leisure and dining 
destination for Southampton. Leasing continues to 
progress well, and the scheme is 80% pre-let. Key 
tenants already secured include Wahaca, Byron, Bill’s, 
Cabana, Cau, Five Guys and Red Dog Saloon. We are 
targeting BREEAM Excellent when the scheme fully 
opens next year. Further details about the development 
are on page 38.
MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS
We have made further progress with our three major 
London developments. These are forecast to deliver 
attractive financial returns for the Group and create 
new iconic destinations. These complex, long-term 
projects have the potential to deliver significant 
benefits for their localities and catalyse wider  
urban regeneration.

DEVELOPMENTS
Table 21
The redevelopment of Croydon town centre is an 
opportunity to deliver a major destination fulfilling  
the current and future retail, leisure and social 
requirements of the local community and wider 
catchment. The scheme involves the redevelopment  
of the Whitgift Centre and refurbishment of Centrale 
shopping centre by the Croydon Partnership, a 50:50 
joint venture with Westfield, which will establish 
Croydon as the principal retail and leisure hub for 
South London. The new Whitgift Centre will underpin  
a fundamental shift in the perception of Croydon, 
attracting new residents and businesses and fuelling 
further investment. Croydon town centre is a strategic 
growth area in the GLA London plan. A growth fund was 
announced in the Autumn Statement to enable the 
London Borough of Croydon, in partnership with the 
GLA, to deliver key infrastructure projects to 
regenerate the wider town centre.
In 2015, significant progress has been made in 
advancing the scheme. In September, the Secretary  
of State confirmed Croydon Council CPO powers to 
purchase the land required to undertake the project. 
This followed the CPO inquiry which concluded in 
March. Also in March, the Croydon Partnership 
acquired a further 50% long leasehold interest in the 
Whitgift shopping centre and assumed operational 
control of the centre. The partnership now owns or 
controls the majority of the land interests required for 
the 200,000m
2
 scheme. Given the extended planning 
process and discussions with a number of potential 
anchor tenants, the scheme timetable has been revised. 
Works are now expected to start in 2017 with potential 
completion in 2020 /21.
In 2015, we continued to discuss the planning 
application for redevelopment of The Goodsyard, 
London E1 with the local authorities of Hackney and 
Tower Hamlets. 
The scheme, being advanced in conjunction with our 
joint venture partner, Ballymore Properties, is a 
270,000m² mixed-use development, which includes  
a 20,000m² retail ‘village’, 1,350 residential units and 
substantial public realm including a new park. The 
development will cater for the growing Tech City media 
and technology start-ups attracted to the local area  
with the provision of 80,000m
2
 of workspace.
In June, a revised planning application was submitted 
which reduced the residential provision on the 4.2ha 
site by 100 homes and increased the office element of 
the scheme to more than 76,000m
2
. We welcomed the 
decision in September by the Mayor of London to call  
in the scheme due to non-determination by the local 
authorities and are working to achieve the planning 
consent by Spring 2016 enabling a potential start 
on-site in 2017 . 
In conjunction with our joint venture partner, Standard 
Life, work continues on the regeneration of Brent Cross 
Cricklewood in north-west London. Following 
extensive local consultation, consent was granted by 
Barnet Council in September for a major investment in 
the local transport infrastructure and the first section  
of a new riverside park. 
An outline masterplan planning permission for the 
regeneration scheme was granted in 2010 and amended 
in 2014. A key element of the new town centre 
masterplan is a 90,000m
2
 extension to Brent Cross 
shopping centre. The extension and refurbished 
existing centre will result in a retail-led, dining and 
leisure destination for North London. 
The new retail destination will form an integral part  
of the wider regeneration of the area and will provide 
offices, 7 ,500 homes, schools, new parks, sports and 
other community facilities. As announced in the UK 
Government’s March budget a commitment was made 
by the Treasury to support a new Brent Cross 
Overground station. Barnet Council has approved the 
use of CPO powers to acquire the remaining land to 
deliver the extension. The CPO inquiry will be held  
in May 2016 and subject to the confirmation of CPO 
powers and agreements with key tenants, works could 
start on-site towards the end of 2017 with potential 
completion in 2021.

We have a number of potential pipeline schemes which we continue to advance. The nature and design of these projects are fluid and the 
speed of delivery will be dependent on a variety of factors including planning permission, retailer demand, anchor tenant negotiations, 
land assembly and scheme design. The Group’s principal opportunities are shown in table 22.
Table 22
POSITIVE PLACES
To reduce the number of heavy goods vehicles at our 
Victoria Gate development, the demolition team  
re-used 99% of demolition waste for the piling mat. This 
avoided 650 vehicle journeys, cut traffic congestion, 
prevented 14 tonnes of carbon emissions and an adverse 
impact on air quality and saved £247 ,000 on disposal  
and materials costs. We also reduced mains water 
consumption by 900,000 litres during dust suppression 
works by reusing on-site ground water.
W e are working with Leeds City Council and John Lewis to 
provide employee opportunities in Leeds. In October 2015, 
the Hammerson Employment and Skills Charter was 
established to provide skills training for local residents and 
access to jobs being created by the new scheme.

STRATEGIC REPORT
BUSINESS REVIEW INTRODUCTION
As part of our strategy, the Group has been increasing 
its exposure to the premium outlets sector over recent 
years. Our exposure is gained through our long-term 
partnership with Value Retail and also through VIA 
Outlets, a joint venture established in 2014.
The Outlet sector has many similarities with our 
directly-managed properties and we benefit from the 
relationship with Value Retail management. We utilise 
the knowledge gained to enhance the brand experience 
across our portfolio, for example the inclusion of key 
aspirational brands at Victoria Gate, Leeds. 
The Financial Review, on pages 53 to 61, provides 
further information on how our investments in Value 
Retail and VIA Outlets have benefitted the Group’s 
financial performance during 2015.
VALUE RETAIL (“VR”)
Overview
VR operates nine high-end shopping tourism Villages  
in the UK and Western Europe which provide over 
180,000m
2
 of floor space and more than 1,000 stores.  
VR focuses on international fashion and luxury brands 
and on long-haul tourism. The Villages, which include 
Bicester Village outside London and La Vallée Village 
near Paris, are among the most successful outlet  
centres in Europe. The average sales density for the 
Villages is €15,000 /m
2
 with densities at Bicester Village 
around €30,000 /m
2
. 
The Villages are close to Europe’s wealthiest cities  
and major tourist attractions and targeted marketing 
enables VR to benefit from the rapidly-growing 
shopping-tourism market. In total, 163 million 
residents live within a 120 minute drive of a Village,  
and the major cities served by the Villages attract 100 
million tourists each year. The total footfall across the 
Villages in 2015 was 33.3 million (2014: 32.5 million). 
This strategy has enabled VR to deliver annual 
compound brand sales growth of 17% since 2006.
VR manages the Villages and controls their operations, 
but through our board representation and financing 
agreements we have significant influence and treat  
our investment as an associate. 
In December, we acquired an additional 21% interest  
in Kildare Village, Dublin for £12 million. We expect  
the Village to perform strongly, supported by the 
expansion of the Irish economy and the recently 
completed extension.
Performance in 2015
The Villages have continued to perform strongly during 
2015 with brand sales growth of 11% and year-end 
occupancy at 95%, which was unchanged from the 
beginning of the year. Future growth is expected to be 
supported by global tourism, new emerging brands, 
consumers’ more considered approach to shopping and 
the importance of perceived value. Trends in tourism 
show that visitor numbers continue to grow with a 
widening spread of nationalities visiting Europe. 
Chinese visitors continue to represent the largest share 
of overseas retail spending in Europe, with growth of 
32% in 2015 (source: Global Blue). Spending by Middle 
Eastern tourists has been resilient despite the 
reduction in the oil price, although there has been  
a fall in spending by visitors from Russia and Brazil. 
Developments and extensions
The €50 million extension at Kildare Village, Dublin, 
opened in November 2015. The 6,100m
2
 new phase has 
introduced 33 new boutiques and two restaurants to  
the Village as well as a new visitor centre and 400 extra 
parking spaces. Initial trading has significantly 
exceeded expectations. Further details about the 
extension are on page 42.
At Bicester Village, the approved planning permission 
for a major extension was revised in April to increase the 
car parking provision to 519 new spaces. The 5,600m
2
 
extension will include 33 new boutiques and enhanced 
road access to reduce congestion. Construction is 
expected to begin in the second half of this year, with the 
extension completed in late 2017 . A new rail station also 
opened adjacent to the Village in October bringing 
shoppers directly from London Marylebone. 
At Fidenza Village, Milan, work has started on a 3,300m
2
 
extension which will add 26 units and is due to open in 
October 2016.

VR is continuing to expand in China following the 
opening of Suzhou Village in May 2014. The 
construction of Shanghai Village, a 50,000m
2
 scheme 
adjacent to Shanghai Disney Resort, is underway with 
the Village due to open this summer. We have an 
investment of £5 million in these Chinese Villages.
POSITIVE PLACES
VR has been working hard to enhance its sustainability 
performance in many of the same key areas that the 
Group focuses on. As a result, over recent years, VR has 
achieved a significant improvement in its GRESB score 
to reach Green Star status in 2015.
VIA OUTLETS (“VIA”)
Overview
VIA is an outlets joint venture formed in 2014 in 
partnership with APG, Value Retail and Meyer 
Bergman. VIA’s strategy is to create a c.€1 billion 
portfolio by acquiring existing European outlet centres 
with strong catchments focused on mainstream fashion 
brands and with potential for growth. Under the 
partnership agreement, we are able to exercise joint 
control in the partnership and account for our interest 
as a joint venture.
Once acquired, VIA utilises the outlet expertise from 
VR to enhance the overall centre management, physical 
appearance, leisure and catering offers and tenant mix 
of the centres to deliver sales, income and value growth. 
The strategy also involves work to right-size units, the 
introduction of more flagship stores and targeted 
marketing to increase tourist visits.
At 31 December 2015, VIA had five outlet centres 
providing 160,000m
2 
of floor space and over 500 stores 
across five European countries. The major assets are 
Alcochete, near Lisbon, Batavia Stad, near Amsterdam, 
F ashion Arena, near Prague, and Landquart, near Zurich. 
Performance and investment activity
VIA’s portfolio has performed strongly during 2015, 
particularly Batavia Stad and Fashion Arena, and  
sales densities in the VIA centres have increased  
by 11% year-on-year. Significant upgrades are  
being implemented at Batavia Stad including  
38 remerchandising projects in 2015, upgraded façades,  
a new information centre and a new tourist marketing 
strategy. VIA has recently started a 5,500m
2
 extension 
to the centre which will introduce 45 new units, 
increase space by 22% and which will open in early 2017 .
Occupancy at 87% was 5% lower than at the  
beginning of the year as a result of the phasing of 
remerchandising initiatives.
In late 2015, VIA sold Excalibur, in the Czech Republic 
near the Austrian border, for €10 million (Hammerson’s 
share). In January 2016, VIA exchanged a conditional 
contract to acquire Festival Park, Majorca for  
€44 million (Hammerson’s share). The 32,000m
2
 centre 
includes a 8,000m
2 
cinema and attracts 3.8 million 
visitors each year. VIA intends to enhance the brand 
mix and reinvigorate the food and beverage offer.

OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY
The environmental and social impacts of our business 
operations are significant, presenting both risks and 
opportunities. We work consistently through our 
Positive Places framework to ensure we manage and 
mitigate the risks and capitalise on the opportunities. 
The outcome is a consistently strong track record for 
sustainability that makes us attractive to investors, 
particularly those with a sustainability mandate.
Our business has five major sustainability impact areas: 
energy security and demand
waste management
water consumption
investment in our local communities
materials use and procurement
Our sustainability initiatives reflect these issues and go 
beyond them. Our stakeholders expect us to maintain 
our leadership position as a sustainability innovator by, 
for example, working collaboratively with our retailers 
and suppliers, driving high sustainability standards 
with our on-site teams and contractors and ensuring 
our employees have the right sustainability skills and 
knowledge for each role. By taking a collaborative 
approach, assets across the business have benefitted 
from sustainability initiatives, as illustrated through 
the report. 
The strength of this approach can be seen in the 
activities and achievements we are able to report for 
2015. Our scores against all key industry benchmarks 
have improved and we have made significant progress 
against our corporate targets, with particular successes 
in supplier engagement. Waste management has been 
more challenging, particularly in France, as has water 
management in the UK. The influence of weather  
on carbon emissions is also becoming increasingly 
important as we face more extreme conditions. These 
will all be areas of particular attention in 2016. 
New annual and five-year targets have been set, an 
overview of which are in the following pages. More 
extensive information on these and our portfolio and 
asset level sustainability projects and initiatives can be 
seen on the sustainability pages on our website via this 
link: www.sustainability.hammerson.com.

UPSKILL AND INSPIRE
Investing in our people, and recognising and 
rewarding those that deliver change
Effective delivery of our sustainability strategy requires 
all our staff to understand our ambitions and their role 
in achieving them. 
To support them during 2015 we:
 – Extended role-focused sustainability training to  
all new starters
 – Enabled three of our senior management team to 
attend the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability 
Leadership (CISL) training programme
 – Launched an updated environmental training 
package for all our on-site teams
 – Implemented a new software platform in the UK  
to support volunteering activity and community 
engagement work, leading to a significant increase  
in the number of volunteering days delivered by  
our staff
We were delighted that in our 2015 staff survey 89%  
of staff considered Hammerson to be serious in its 
commitment to sustainability. This score exceeds the 
survey benchmarks and is indicative of success in 
embedding sustainability across our teams. 
Plans for 2016 include:
 – Further senior leaders attending the CISL programme
 – Extending the sustainability training programme  
to all staff to ensure all teams are sufficiently skilled 
to support delivery of Positive Places
 – Implementing our volunteering software in France

44 44 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 PARTNER AND COLLABORATE
Taking a stakeholder-led approach to create 
collaborative projects and evolve from client  
to partner
Collaboration with key stakeholders is fundamental to 
delivering ambitious, innovative sustainability outputs. 
In 2015 we:
 – Engaged with 54 new suppliers through our Supply 
Chain survey and published our 2nd Annual  
Supplier Report
 – Worked closely with key retailers through our retailer 
forum, the Hospitality Forum, and through our 
Positive Growth awards
 – Successfully expanded our investor engagement 
programme 
 – Engaged with 276 local community groups with 
connections to our assets
In 2016 we will:
 – Continue to work with retailers through our retailer 
forum and our retail delivery process to address 
in-store environmental impacts 
 – Review and update our Supply Chain survey and 
publish our 3rd Annual Supplier Report
 – Deliver at least one innovation project with  
a key supplier
 – Continue to deliver market-leading community 
engagement activity for all our sites
SERVE AND INVEST
Delivering social value to the communities  
we serve, measured in jobs, skills, civic pride  
and investment
Our properties are significant elements of local physical 
and social infrastructure and the catalyst for important 
investment in our local communities. Over 30,000 
people are employed across the portfolio. 
In 2015 we:
 – Supported over 4,500 people into employment 
through investment in developments, extensions and 
refurbishments. These projects are expected to 
deliver a further 2,500+ jobs post opening 
 – Successfully piloted a new, retail-focused 
apprenticeship scheme at Highcross, Leicester  
(see Page 51)
 – Made direct community investments of £2.2 million
 – Made indirect community investments of £350,000
During 2016 we will update and expand our True Value 
of Shopping Centres research, originally published in 
2013. This will be used to establish employment and 
skills baseline data against which we will measure the 
positive impacts of our investment in local 
communities on an ongoing basis. 
COSTA ECOPOD, WREKIN RETAIL PARK, TELFORD
 – Net zero energy building 
 – EPC rating A+ (-5).
 – Circa 50% more energy efficient than a comparable unit
The combination of enhanced insulation within the shell, natural 
ventilation, roof lights and energy efficient lighting, reduce the energy 
consumption of the unit significantly. Sufficient clean energy is 
generated by photovoltaic panels on the roof to supply the remaining 
regulated electricity demand. 
We plan to take knowledge gained from this project and use it more 
widely. We are already in talks with Costa to deliver a second EcoPod.
REDUCING EXPOSURE TO ENERGY 
PERFORMANCE CERTIFICATE RISK 
As minimum energy efficiency standards 
approach we are working to remove the 
associated risk from the portfolio. With over 
1,000 EPCs across our UK assets this is an 
extensive project. Our ‘at risk’ units have been 
identified and a programme of work has been  
put in place to utilise appropriate points in the 
management cycle to ensure they are upgraded 
at minimum additional cost. We are targeting a 
minimum EPC rating of D for all units as this has 
been identified as providing protection against 
early obsolescence of systems and more 
cost-effective energy savings for occupiers  
than a rating of E.

MAJOR CHALLENGES IN 2015
Two key areas have been a significant challenge in 2015: 
water consumption and heating and cooling related 
energy consumption, particularly in France. 
Low water costs challenge the business case for 
extensive metering. However, the increase in 
restaurants across the portfolio drives up water 
demand. In 2016 we will extend the water sub-metering 
and monitoring programme to address this.
Gas consumption in the UK and electricity in France  
is impacted substantially by weather. Intelligence from 
our energy audits combined with better understanding 
of weather-related demand fluctuations will be used  
to prioritise work in this area in 2016.

In line with requirements set out in the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013, this statement 
reports the Company’s GHG emissions for the reporting period 1 October 2014 to 30 September 2015. A different reporting period from 
our financial reporting year has been selected, in accordance with the DEFRA Environmental Reporting Guidance, to avoid the use of 
estimated utility consumption data. The data has been calculated and recorded in accordance with the GHG Protocol and ISO 14064.  
We are required by the new Scope 2 GHG Protocol to report our Scope 2 emissions using both market-based and location-based methods. 
However, our utility provider has been unable to provide specific emissions factors for our renewable energy contract to calculate 
emissions using the market-based approach.
INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE
Total Scope 1, Total Scope 2, Total Scope 3 and Total GHG emisssions intensity data have been independently assured by Deloitte LLP 
who have carried out Limited Assurance in accordance with the International Standards on Assurance Engagements 3000. Their 
Assurance Statement is available on the sustainability pages of our website at www.sustainability.hammerson.com.
REPORTING BOUNDARIES
We have adopted operational control as our reporting approach. GHG emissions data is provided for those assets where we have authority 
to introduce and implement operating policies. This includes properties held in joint ventures where JV Board approval is required. We 
have reported 100% of GHG emissions data for these reported assets. 
A detailed basis of reporting statement and full list of operating entities and assets included within the reporting boundary can be found 
on the Positive Place pages of our website at www.sustainability.hammerson.com.

CAPABILITY
During 2015 we continued to invest heavily in 
developing our managers. Our Management 
Development Programme, launched in the autumn  
of 2014, was a major part of this effort, with 74 managers 
across the UK and France participating during the 
course of the year. 
We also continued to focus on management skills when 
recruiting new managers, most notably via our 
competency-based selection processes. We successfully 
recruited 14 new managers in the UK, all of whom 
completed one of our management assessment centres. 
Executive coaching and 360-degree appraisals 
remained constant features throughout the year. To 
further enhance our training and development offering 
we entered a partnership arrangement with Capita 
Learning and Development which gives us access to 
their extensive suite of management development 
programmes and materials.
To help meet our Diversity and Inclusion objectives,  
our senior management teams in the UK and France 
attended workshops on unconscious bias. The knowledge 
and insight gained is already helping us to achieve our 
ambition of creating a more diverse workforce.
CULTURE AND VALUES
Our values continued to enhance our culture and 
influence our actions during 2015.
The most significant event was June’s relocation of our 
UK headquarters to King’s Cross. This gave us the 
opportunity to introduce a more agile and collaborative 
working environment enabling our London, Reading 
and Paris based teams to work more closely together 
than ever before.
OUR PEOPLE
Talented people
Our people are one of our most important assets, enabling us 
to deliver our strategy and create value for our stakeholders. 
Through our engaging culture, common values and ongoing 
investment in nurturing talent we create an environment where 
everybody is able to develop and maximise their contribution.

One of our core values is ambition, and this was evident 
throughout the year as we continued to grow in size, 
productivity and efficiency. The scale of our ambition 
was best demonstrated by our acquisition of the Irish 
loan portfolio which will require a new operating 
platform to be established in Dublin as well as being 
integrated into the wider Group. 
On a more operational level, we insourced the 
management of our shopping centres in France, 
enabling a more aligned management approach and 
greater financial efficiencies across the portfolio.  
We also improved our approach to portfolio based 
procurement during the year, which allowed us to 
leverage our purchasing power more effectively and  
to deliver greater consistency across the organisation. 
On a day-to-day basis, we embedded our values ever more 
deeply within the business. They are a core component  
of our performance-management processes and the two 
day Corporate Induction Programme attended by all  
new employees. The values continue to drive positive 
behaviours and outcomes across the Group.

STRATEGIC REPORT
OUR PEOPLE RESOURCING, TALENT MANAGEMENT  
AND SUCCESSION PLANNING
As in previous years, we successfully retained and 
developed our talent during 2015 whilst strengthening 
our teams with the appointment of many experienced 
and talented individuals. 
Voluntary staff turnover in both the UK and France 
remained low at 11.5% and 6.2% respectively. However, 
with a number of people leaving the business as a result 
of us relocating our UK headquarters, the progression of 
our development projects and further investments in our 
multichannel and IT teams, resourcing requirements 
were high. 135 new people joined the Group during the 
course of the year, many of whom successfully completed 
a competency based assessment centre.
Our improved approach to senior management 
succession planning started to pay dividends in 2015. 
This involves using job evaluation to help identify 
possible career paths for high potential employees and 
engaging with them about their own aspirations and 
development needs. As a result, we started the process 
of mapping out structured development plans for all 
concerned. We filled all of our senior management 
vacancies via internal promotion during the year, 
including our new Director of Retail for Ireland.
Launched in 2011, our established UK Graduate 
Programme continued to flourish in 2015. One highlight 
saw Tom Webster, who joined the Company in 2012, 
gain RICS accreditation and move into an asset 
management role in our UK Retail Parks team.
All senior management 
vacancies filled via internal 
promotions in 2015
We conducted our employee survey during 2015  
using the globally established ‘Great Place to Work’ 
programme. In the UK, we achieved a positive 
engagement score of just under 70% which is 13% 
higher than the average for organisations with a  
similar headcount. 
Further analysis showed particularly high levels of 
engagement in the areas of Strategy and Direction, 
Diversity and Corporate Social Responsibility; the  
latter score exceeding the average of similarly sized 
organisations by an impressive 34%.
In France, employee engagement was even higher and 
we achieved a positive engagement score of 79%. In 
addition, 89% of employees responded positively to the 
statement “Taking everything into account, I would say 
this is a great place to work”. 
In our 2014 Annual Report we stated the clear objective 
that any gender gap in employee engagement should be 
no greater than 5%. This was one of three Diversity and 
Inclusion targets that we set ourselves to achieve on an 
ongoing basis. When considering our combined UK and 
France results, the gender gap in our 2015 employee 
survey was 4.5%.
Our collaborative and inclusive approach to internal 
communications was ever present during the course of 
2015, enhanced by the greater use of audio visual 
technology. Briefings were held regularly throughout 
the year in order to keep employees updated on key 
business issues and results. In addition, we further 
embedded the Group intranet as a key communication 
tool and developed a new, internally branded 
communication channel: Hammerson Inside.
From a reward perspective, we continue to offer 
employees the opportunity to share in the growth and 
profitability of the Company as we believe this further 
engages our people. This is evidenced by the inclusion 
of the organisation’s key KPIs in our annual incentive 
plan and the availability of a number of all employee 
and restricted share plan schemes.

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT
The Company recognises the benefits of having highly 
engaged teams as we strive to achieve our business 
goals. Our positive culture, clarity of strategy and 
ongoing focus on improving management capability  
all contribute towards this objective. 
50 50 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
We have long understood and embraced the benefits  
of maintaining and nurturing a diverse workforce. It is 
therefore not surprising that 2015 was a year during 
which we continued to develop our strategy and build 
on the good practices already in place. In addition, we 
implemented a number of key initiatives designed to 
drive meaningful and sustainable change.
Following the success of the unconscious bias 
workshops attended by our Group Executive 
Committee in 2014, similar sessions were held for our 
entire UK and France senior management teams during 
the first half of the year. These had the objective of 
further broadening diversity awareness within the 
workplace, while further engaging senior management 
in the process of enhancing inclusion. Diversity training 
for all employees will be introduced in 2016.
When appointing new talent, we continue to base  
our recruitment decisions on our long established 
competency based approach to selection. Of the 135 
new employees recruited in 2015, 66 were female. Of 
these, over a third were employed in professional or 
senior professional roles. In addition, we wrote to all  
of our recruitment partners stating our diversity and 
inclusion related aspirations. In doing so, we challenged 
them to submit more diverse candidate shortlists for all 
roles, including people from ethnic minorities and from 
backgrounds that are not always associated with the 
property industry. 
In recognising the benefits of gender diversity the 
Company has previously stated the aspiration that at 
least 30% of our senior managers should be women.  
By the end of 2015, this figure stood at 27%. 
Within the UK, women occupy 37% of such roles and 
three of our ten Shopping Centre General Managers  
are female. 
Female representation in senior management roles  
in France currently stands at just over 7%. While we  
are looking to improve this figure over time, with the 
introduction of assessment centres in 2016 anticipated 
to contribute towards this, we are pleased that four of 
our nine French Shopping Centre General Managers 
are female. 
We have also stated the objective that women should be 
represented in at least 30% of the roles identified in the 
Company’s senior management succession plan. The 
plan considers the key senior management positions 
across the entire organisation, including all Executive 
Director and Group Executive Committee roles. By the 
end of 2015, this figure stood at just over 30%, a fact  
that we find extremely encouraging.
We welcome and fully consider all suitable applications 
for employment, irrespective of gender, race, ethnicity, 
religion, age, sexual orientation or disability. All 
employees are eligible to participate in career 
development and promotion opportunities. Support 
also exists for employees who become disabled to 
continue in their employment or to be retrained for 
other suitable roles.
HIGHCROSS APPRENTICES
To attract young people 
into the property 
industry from a more 
diverse range of 
backgrounds, we piloted 
the British Council of 
Shopping Centres Retail 
Trust and National Skills 
Academy Retail Path 
apprenticeship scheme at Highcross Shopping Centre in Leicester 
during 2015. 
Five apprentices won 12 month placements, giving them shopping 
centre management experience as well as front of house retail 
exposure and college based training. Three of our retailers 
participated in the pilot scheme: TM Lewin, Love Aroma and 
Goldsmiths. Each provided valuable training and insight for the 
apprentices, two of whom have now graduated from the scheme, 
winning permanent roles with TM Lewin and Hotel Chocolat. The 
three who remain will graduate from the scheme in early 2016. 
Everyone involved has been delighted with the success of this 
initiative in its first year and we intend to run the programme again  
in 2016 with an extended group of retailers.
Joe Creasey, who was an apprentice on the scheme, is now a 
permanent employee at TM Lewin and he said:
“Working as an apprentice has given me more of an insight into the 
retail business and this has helped me build a greater foundation for  
a future in Retail Management.”
Holly Furnival, who is an apprentice with Goldsmiths, added:
“The application process was very hard, but I’m really glad I stuck at it 
and I love working here. I never thought it would be as enjoyable, but 
it’s great being able to help customers, and everybody has made me 
feel really welcome.”

STRATEGIC REPORT
OUR PEOPLE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT
In line with our corporate values and our commitment 
to Serve and Invest the communities in which we are 
located, we offer employees three days of paid 
volunteering a year. We believe that having the 
opportunity to participate in voluntary activity 
generates positive outcomes; from team building 
through to wellbeing and corporate pride.
In 2015 we launched a new approach to volunteering, 
using our own bespoke version of The Butterfly Bank 
Engagement Platform. Designed to inspire and reward 
volunteering, this was actively promoted throughout 
the year in addition to our annual Community Day.
2015 saw our ninth annual Community Day in the UK 
while our French team ran their third. In a continued 
effort to collaborate for greater impact, we were joined 
by colleagues from the British Council of Shopping 
Centres (BCSC) and from our waste, facilities and 
security teams across the UK.
In the UK a total of 27 activities were available for 
employees to choose from, ranging from river clean-ups 
to organising a fashion show. In France, nine activities 
were offered. 63% of employees across the UK and an 
impressive 82% in France took part in Community Day 
and, as always, feedback was extremely positive  
from both our own people and the organisations  
we worked with.
As one Hammerson team member said:
“It was a really successful and worthwhile day. 
Everyone pulled their weight and was motivated to get 
the job done in the allotted time but also to do more 
than anticipated at the start of the day. It also struck me 
that this is an environment where teamwork and 
Hammerson’s culture and values come to the fore. 
Importantly, it was also great fun.” 
Following Community Day we have continued to bring 
employees opportunities to support local and national 
organisations. In October we celebrated volunteering 
achievements across the Group with the Hammerson 
Butterfly Banking awards bringing together all our 
shopping centre teams. 
Our employees are enthusiastic about supporting 
charities and voluntary organisations. As well as a local 
charity bursary run by each of our shopping centres, we 
also have national charity partners. Every two years our 
employees select two charity partners, giving them a 
real sense of engagement with the chosen charities.
The selected charities receive a cash donation and, 
more importantly, the opportunity to develop a 
relationship with Hammerson, our employees and our 
shopping centre teams. We feel two years gives us an 
excellent chance to establish a productive working 
relationship and provides a great platform for the 
charities to work from.
The charities selected for 2014 – 2016 were Samaritans 
and Elifar; the latter of which helps to improve the lives 
of children and adults with severe learning difficulties 
and associated physical disabilities. Samaritans was a 
new relationship for us, which is very exciting. Elifar is  
a continuing relationship, employees having elected to 
continue supporting this small but highly impactful 
charity for a further two years.
Over the course of 2015 the Group contributed more 
than £150,000 to charitable causes, £34,000 of which 
went to our two main partners.

52 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 52 PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The information presented in this Financial Review is derived from the Group’s financial statements, prepared under IFRS. However, 
management principally reviews the performance of the business on a proportionally consolidated basis, including the Group’s share  
of joint ventures and associates, but not proportionally consolidating our investments in premium outlets. We classify the Group’s 
proportionally consolidated joint ventures and associates as “Share of Property interests”. Further explanations of terms used in this 
section are in the Glossary on pages 181 and 182.
To provide a clear explanation of the performance of the business during 2015, the tables in this Financial Review state whether the 
information has been presented on a proportionally consolidated basis and whether it includes the premium outlet investments. 
At 31 December 2015, the property ownership associated with the Irish loan portfolio, acquired in October 2015 in a 50:50 joint venture, had  
yet to be transferred from the borrowers and these loans are accounted for as current receivables of the joint venture, and included within the 
Group’ s investment in joint ventures. Details of the movement in the Group’ s investment in joint ventures are shown in table 55 on page 59 .
PROFIT FOR THE YEAR
The Group’s profit for the year, attributable to equity shareholders, under IFRS was £726.8 million, £27 .7 million higher than 2014.  
This includes income from operations and financing costs as well as one-off gains realised on the sale of properties and unrealised 
property valuation changes. As with other property companies, and in line with EPRA guidance, we review the Group’s profit on an 
adjusted basis, which best reflects underlying earnings and table 46 shows a reconciliation of IFRS profit to adjusted profit for the year. 
Analysis of the Group’s income statement under IFRS split between underlying “Adjusted” profit and “Capital and other” profit is shown 
in note 2 to the accounts on page 128 and further details of the EPRA adjustments are provided in note 10A on page 136 to the accounts.

Adjusted profit – Year ended 31 December 2015 76.1 116.7 18.1 210.9 26.9
The increase in adjusted profit was driven by additional net rental income, principally from the acquisition of the additional 40% stake in 
Highcross in September 2014 and income from Les Terrasses du Port which opened in May 2014. The Group’s premium outlet 
investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets, the latter acquired in July 2014, contributed an additional £5.9 million of earnings. Lower 
finance costs, reflecting the refinancing activity undertaken to reduce the Group’s average cost of debt to 3.8%, increased earnings by £12.3 
million. These positive factors were partly offset by the impact of the euro depreciating against sterling during 2015 which reduced 
earnings by £2.3 million, although the Group’s hedging strategy provided an approximate two-thirds hedge against the adverse currency 
movement. Overall, the 21.0% increase in adjusted profit resulted in a 12.6% increase in adjusted EPS, after taking account of the dilutive 
effect of the September 2014 share placing.

In 2015, net rental income increased by £13.0 million, or 4.3%, to £318.6 million. Acquisitions contributed £10.3 million of additional 
income, principally relating to the £180 million acquisition in September 2014 of our former joint venture partner’s 40% stake in 
Highcross, Leicester. Disposals reduced net rental income in 2015 by £4.8 million, reflecting the 2015 sales of Drakehouse Retail Park, 
Sheffield, Bercy 2, Paris and Grand Maine, Angers. 
Additional net rental income from developments of £9 .7 million mainly relates to Les Terrasses du Port in Marseille, which opened in 
May 2014 and has traded strongly during 2015. Development income also came from our joint venture property interests in Croydon 
whilst the major regeneration scheme is progressed. Net rental income from the like-for-like portfolio increased by 2.3% during the year, 
with the most significant contributions made by rent reviews at Union Square and tenant rotation at Les Trois Fontaines. Like-for-like 
income also benefitted from the growth in car park and commercialisation net income which increased by 5% and 24% respectively on a 
like-for-like basis. Like-for-like net rental income growth on the Reported Group properties was 3.4%, whilst for properties held by the 
Group’s proportionally consolidated joint ventures and associates, like-for-like net rental income growth was 0.6%. Further analysis of 
net rental income is provided in tables 103 and 104 of the Additional Disclosures on page 167 .

In 2015, underlying administration expenses, net of management fees receivable, were £42.3 million, a decrease of £1.2 million, or 2.7%, 
compared to 2014. This reduction was associated with cost-saving initiatives undertaken since the beginning of 2014 including relocating 
our London headquarters to King’s Cross, additional management fee income, principally from the Nicetoile joint venture, and 
favourable foreign exchange movements. 
COST RATIO
The EPRA cost ratio for the year ended 31 December 2015 was 23.1%, an increase of 30bp compared to 2014. The ratio is calculated  
on a proportionally consolidated basis excluding premium outlets, and reflects total operating costs, including the cost of vacancy, as a 
percentage of gross rental income. The ratio is not necessarily comparable between different companies as business models and expense 
accounting and classification practices vary. The calculation methodology has been amended in 2015 to adjust for inclusive lease costs 
recovered through rent, this is in line with EPRA best practice and comparative ratios have been restated. The cost ratio calculation is 
included as table 106 of the Additional Disclosures on page 168.
Whilst the ratio of net administration costs to gross rental income fell from 12.8% to 11.8% associated with the cost saving initiatives noted 
above, the ratio of property costs increased from 10.0% to 11.3%. This reflects additional expenditure associated with vacancy and running 
costs at properties awaiting redevelopment such as in Croydon, as well as the impact of an increased portfolio weighting to shopping 
centres which have higher running costs than retail parks. 
SHARE OF RESULTS OF JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN  
PREMIUM OUTLETS
As explained on page 53, for management reporting purposes we proportionally consolidate the results of our investments in joint 
ventures and associates, except for our premium outlet investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets. The nature of the control over our 
premium outlet investments means that VIA Outlets is accounted for as a joint venture, whilst Value Retail is accounted for as an 
associate. We refer to the Group’s proportionally consolidated share of its joint ventures as “Share of Property joint ventures”.  
The operating performance of our investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets is described on pages 39 to 42 of the Business Review  
and the aggregated financial contribution to the Group is shown in table 109 of the Additional Disclosures section on page 170. 
Share of results of joint ventures, including VIA Outlets
The Group has interests in 12 joint ventures and the share of results of joint ventures for the year ended 31 December 2015 was  
£246.8 million (2014: £279 .0 million) as summarised in table 50. Further details are provided in note 12 to the accounts.

STRATEGIC REPORT
FINANCIAL REVIEW Financial review continued
The reduction in the share of results of joint ventures of £32.2 million during 2015 was principally due to property revaluation gains from 
the Group’s share of Property joint ventures which were £31.8 million lower in 2015, this is consistent with the year-on-year revaluation 
gains on the Group’s wholly-owned property portfolio. Net rental income from the Group’s share of Property joint ventures was  
£8.7 million lower than in 2014, associated with the acquisition by the Group of the former joint venture partner’s 40% stake in Highcross, 
Leicester in September 2014. This was offset by an increase in profit of £14.2 million from VIA Outlets, which was acquired in July 2014,  
of which £11.7 million related to property revaluation gains. On an adjusted basis, profit was £1.9 million higher in 2015. 
Share of results of associates, including V alue Retail
The Group has two associates: Value Retail PLC and its group entities (‘VR’), and a 10% interest in Nicetoile, which was acquired in 
January 2015 and where the Group is the asset manager. The share of results of associates for the year ended 31 December 2015 was 
£160.6 million (2014: £109 .9 million), of which £159 .3 million related to VR and principally related to the property valuation uplift of 
£163.7 million. 
On an adjusted profit basis the results of associates were £18.1 million (2014: £16.0 million), of which £17 .1 million related to VR.  
The additional adjusted profit was due to strong trading, particularly at La Vallée, Paris and the two Spanish Villages, La Roca and  
Las Rozas. See note 13 of the accounts for further details on the Group’s associates.
The Group also provides loans to Value Retail from which the Group received £5.3 million (2014: £5.8 million) of interest receivable  
in 2015. 
T otal investment in premium outlets
In 2015, the Group’s two investments in premium outlets contributed £28.5 million to adjusted profit, £5.8 million higher than 2014 
principally due to a full year’s profit contribution from VIA Outlets and the continued strong underlying trading performance from Value 
Retail. Further details of the aggregated profit contribution from our premium outlets investment is provided in table 109 of the 
Additional Disclosures section on page 170.
FINANCE COSTS
Underlying net finance costs, comprising gross interest costs less finance income, including the Group’s share of Property interests,  
were £89 .4 million compared with £108.9 million in 2014, a reduction of £19 .5 million. 
During 2015, the Group’s weighted average interest rate was reduced to 3.8%, compared to 4.7% for 2014. This was primarily due to the 
refinancing of the €480 million 4.875% bond, redeemed in December 2014, with the issue of the €500 million 2% bond in  
July 2014. Finance costs have also reduced due to a new £415 million revolving credit facility (“RCF”), signed in April 2015, having an 
initial margin of 80 basis points, which is 70 basis points lower than the previous £505 million facility it replaced. Finally, the increased 
use of floating rate debt at low rates of interest has also acted to reduce the weighted average cost of borrowing.
There was a £13.9 million (2014: £8.7 million) exceptional finance cost, principally associated with the early redemption of a £272 million 
5.25% bond which was due to mature in December 2016. This is excluded from adjusted profit.
Interest capitalised during the year was £5.3 million and principally related to the Group’ s developments in Beauvais, Leeds, Rugby and 
Southampton. This is £3.5 million lower than in 2014 when interest was capitalised on the development of Les Terrasses du Port, Marseille.
TAX
The Group is a UK REIT and French SIIC for tax purposes and is exempt from corporation tax on rental income and gains arising on 
property sales. The tax charge for 2015 remained low at £1.6 million (2014: £1.0 million).
DIVIDEND
The Directors have proposed a final dividend of 12.8 pence per share. Together with the interim dividend of 9 .5 pence, the total for 2015 is 
22.3 pence, representing an increase of 9 .3% compared with the prior year. The final dividend is payable on 29 April 2016 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 18 March 2016. 6.4 pence will be paid as a PID , net of withholding tax where appropriate, with the 
balance of 6.4 pence paid as a normal dividend. 
The Company will be offering a scrip dividend alternative, and for shareholders who elect to receive this, the entire dividend will be 
treated as a normal (non-PID) dividend. As the Company is offering a scrip dividend alternative, the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) 
will be suspended.

Chart 53 analyses the sources of the valuation change for the property portfolio, on a proportionally consolidated basis, during 2015. 
During 2015, the Group’s portfolio, excluding premium outlets, achieved a revaluation gain of £368 million, of which £195 million was 
from the UK shopping centres and £117 million from our French portfolio. Improvements in investment yields accounted for 78% of this 
gain, with the remainder of the valuation uplift principally associated with leasing and ERV changes. 
For UK shopping centres, investment yields fell by an average of 25 basis points, contributing £127 million, or 65% of the revaluation gain. 
The benefit of leasing and market income growth produced a valuation increase of £67 million. The UK retail parks valuations increased 
by £19 million associated with an uplift from leasing and ERV changes as yields were virtually unchanged.
In France, investment yields reduced by an average of 40 basis points during 2015, generating a £161 million valuation increase. This uplift 
was partly offset by a valuation reduction of £15 million associated with reductions in ERVs and £29 million associated with local taxation 
changes and refurbishment expenditure ahead of retenanting at a number of centres.
Developments and the UK Other portfolio achieved a revaluation gain of £37 million, following letting and construction progress at 
Victoria Gate, Leeds and Watermark WestQuay, Southampton.

58 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 Property returns
Table 54 compares the financial returns generated in 2015 with benchmark IPD indices. The returns include development properties and 
the Group’s returns include those from the properties held through its investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets. The Group’s weighted 
IPD All Retail Universe total return benchmark of 9 .9% is weighted 70:30 between the UK and French indices. The All Retail Universe 
indices includes returns from all types of retail property.
As the Annual IPD benchmarks for both countries are not available until after this Annual Report has been published, the benchmarks 
have been estimated and are subject to revision. The UK IPD data is based on the Quarterly All Retail Universe to December 2015. As 
there is less data available for France, for the purposes of calculating the Group IPD benchmarks, we have assumed that the French 
benchmark is equal to the returns generated by our French portfolio.
The Group’s total return was 12.4%, 250 basis points higher than the estimated benchmark. The Group’s outperformance was driven  
by the property portfolio held by our premium outlet investments which produced a total return of 23.7%. The total return for the UK 
portfolio was 10.2% which was higher than the UK IPD index, although the income return was 30 basis points lower, reflecting the prime 
nature of the Group’s UK portfolio. The French portfolio generated a total return of 12.0%.
In 2015, the Reported Group portfolio generated a total return of 10.6%, whilst properties held by our joint ventures and associates 
generated a total return of 14.3%. Both portfolios exceeded the estimated benchmark, the performance of the latter portfolio being 
boosted by the strong return from premium outlets.
+
  An analysis of the capital and total returns by business segment is included in table 107 on page 169
Shareholder returns
For the year ended 31 December 2015, the Group’s return on shareholders’ equity was 14.3%, which compares to the Group’s estimated 
cost of equity of 8%. The income element of the return on equity tends to be relatively low given the prime nature of the property 
portfolio. The capital element of the return was driven by the portfolio’s strong valuation performance during the year. 
Hammerson’s total shareholder return for 2015 was 2.4%, which represents an underperformance of the FTSE EPRA/NAREIT UK index 
by 970 basis points. Over the last five years, the Group’s average annual total shareholder return has been 11.4%, compared to 15.0% for the 
FTSE EPRA/NAREIT UK index. 
INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN PREMIUM OUTLETS
Investment in joint ventures, including VIA Outlets
At 31 December 2015, the Group’s investment in joint ventures totalled £3,214 million compared with £2,341 million at the beginning  
of the year, an increase of £873 million. The key change during 2015 was the acquisition of the Irish loan portfolio in a new 50:50 joint 
venture with Allianz for a cost of £690 million, further details of this transaction are given on page 26 of the Business Review.

Investment in associates, including V alue Retail
The Group’s investment in associates principally relates to the Group’s investment in Value Retail PLC and its group entities (‘VR’)  
and totalled £768 million at 31 December 2015, an increase of £139 million during 2015. The increase was largely due to the revaluation  
gain on VR’s property portfolio which totalled £164 million, of which 42% was due to yield movements and the balance associated with 
income growth. 
During the year, acquisitions increased the investment by £37 million, of which £24 million related to the acquisition in January of a 10% 
interest in Nicetoile, and the remainder related to an additional VR stake in Kildare Village acquired in December. Distributions totalled 
£45 million, which principally related to funds received by the Group in December, following a debt refinancing by VR in relation to 
Bicester Village. Further analysis is provided in note 13 to the accounts on pages 145 and 146.
T otal investment in premium outlets
At 31 December 2015, on an EPRA adjusted basis, the Group’s total investment in premium outlets, representing our share of VR and  
VIA, and including the Group’s loans to VR and the investment in VR China, totalled £1,003 million (2014: £832 million). The property 
portfolios produced a combined valuation surplus of £174 million and produced a combined capital return of 16.4% and a total return  
of 23.7%. Further details of the Group’s aggregated investment are provided in table 110 of the Additional Disclosures on page 170.
FINANCING AND CASH FLOW
Our financing strategy is to generally borrow on an unsecured basis on the strength of the Group’s covenant to maintain operational 
flexibility. Borrowings are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short-term liquidity. Acquisitions may be 
financed initially using short-term funds before being refinanced for the longer term when market conditions are appropriate. Short-term 
funding is raised principally through syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions with which we 
maintain strong working relationships. Long-term debt mainly comprises the Group’s fixed rate unsecured bonds. Derivative financial 
instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but are not employed for 
speculative purposes.
The Board approves financing guidelines against which it monitors the Group’s financial structure. These guidelines, together with the 
relevant metrics, are summarised in table 56 which illustrates the Group’s robust financial condition.

Through active treasury management, we have continued to reduce the Group’s average cost of debt as well as ensuring a solid funding 
platform. Key transactions during 2015 included the signing of a new £415 million unsecured revolving credit facility in April, at an initial 
margin of 80 basis points with a syndicate of nine banks. The facility has a maturity of five years which may be extended to a maximum of 
seven years at the Group’s request and on each bank’s approval of their participation. The new facility replaced the existing £505 million 
revolving credit facility with an initial margin of 150 basis points which would have matured in April 2016. The cancellation of this existing 
facility resulted in a one-off exceptional interest charge of £1.0 million associated with the write-off of unamortised fees.
In the second half of the year we undertook a number of financing transactions, principally to support the acquisition of the Irish loan 
portfolio. To fund the acquisition we raised a new €1.5 billion revolving credit facility, of which €1.0 billion matures in March 2017 and 
€0.5 billion in September 2017 . This is expected to be refinanced through a £500 million disposal programme, of which £200 million has 
already been contracted. In October, we issued a ten-year £350 million bond at a coupon of 3.5%. This bond was subsequently swapped 
into euros resulting in a net coupon cost of 2.5%. In December, we redeemed an outstanding £272 million bond due to mature in 
December 2016 with a coupon of 5.25% for a total consideration of £284.6 million. This resulted in a one-off exceptional finance cost of 
£12.9 million.
Exposure to exchange translation differences on euro-denominated assets is managed through a combination of euro borrowings and 
derivatives. At 31 December 2015, the value of euro-denominated liabilities compared to the value of euro-denominated assets was 90%, 
an increase of 2% from the position at the beginning of the year. Interest on euro debt also acts as a hedge against exchange differences 
arising on rental income from our French business. Approximately two-thirds of the relevant income was hedged in this way during 2015, 
compared to an average of 82% during 2014. Whilst the overall level of euro-denominated debt grew during 2015 to increase the hedge  
of assets, the reduction in the hedge of income was due to increased rental income from our French business, predominantly due to the 
opening of Les Terrasses du Port in May 2014.
The Group’s unsecured bank facilities and the US private placement senior notes contain financial covenants that the Group’s gearing, 
defined as the ratio of net debt to shareholders’ equity, should not exceed 150% and that interest cover, defined as net rental income 
divided by net interest payable, should not be less than 1.25 times. The same gearing covenant applies to three of the Company’s 
unsecured bonds, whilst the remaining bonds contain a covenant that gearing should not exceed 175%. These figures are on a 
proportionally consolidated basis and the bonds have no covenant for interest cover. Hammerson’s financial ratios are comfortably within 
these covenants. Fitch and Moody’s rate Hammerson’s unsecured credit as A- and Baa1 respectively. Moody’s upgraded its rating from 
Baa2 in February 2015 to recognise “Hammerson’s high-quality retail portfolio with a strong focus on outlet retail, its progress in reducing 
leverage and improving fixed charge coverage, and the expectation of continued stable performance of its core UK assets”, and reaffirmed 
this rating in October following the Irish loan portfolio acquisition.
As explained at the beginning of this Financial Review, we do not proportionally consolidate our two premium outlet investments for 
reporting purposes. These are financed independently from the rest of the Group and both Value Retail and VIA Outlets utilise a 
combination of secured borrowings and partner loans as funding. At 31 December 2015, the Group’s share of net debt in VR and VIA 
totalled £362 million. Including the Group’s share of the net assets of VR and VIA on a proforma basis would increase the Group’s gearing 
from 54% to 60%, whilst the loan to value would reduce from 38% to 37%.

FINANCIAL REVIEW PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Managing uncertainty
Effective risk management underpins our business model. Our risk management policies are designed to reduce the chances of financial 
loss, protect our reputation and optimise performance when opportunities arise. The Board assesses and controls the Group’s risk 
appetite and regularly monitors our Risk Management Framework to ensure risks are being appropriately mitigated and new risks 
identified. The framework is reviewed by our management teams and communicated to all our staff. 
RISK MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
The responsibility for risk management rests ultimately with the Board. However, the foundations of our approach are instilled in our 
culture and values. The relatively low number of personnel across the Group encourages effective collaboration and the flat management 
structure means that the senior team is actively involved in ensuring adherence to the Group’s risk management policies and procedures, 
including risk identification and mitigation.
Chart 59 summarises the key roles and responsibilities for the Group’s risk management strategy and demonstrates the interaction 
between the Board and management teams in ensuring effective risk management is applied across the Group’s activities. 
 
The assessment and management of risk underpins our operating,

62 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 CASE STUDY – HEALTH AND SAFETY IN ACTION
We are committed to managing health and safety risks 
throughout our operations. The Board approves the health and 
safety strategy which is administered by the Health and Safety 
Committee, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer. It is our goal 
to ensure that we cause no harm to our staff or to visitors to our 
properties. We achieve and measure this through maintaining 
high safety and welfare standards which include:
 – The employment of a Chartered Professional Health and 
Safety Practitioner and specialist team to provide strategic 
and operational support to all areas of the business;
 – Developing a comprehensive safety and emergency 
preparedness training programme; 
 – Regular reporting and monitoring of adherence to the 
Group’s health and safety policies including the use of 
external and internal audits; and 
 – Accreditation of the Hammerson Health and Safety 
management system against ISO18001.
This continual focus on health and safety has helped ensure that 
during 2015 we have maintained a 100% compliance record with 
all regulatory requirements and had no major injuries to our 
employees. W e have also reduced the number of visitor accidents 
at our portfolio by 16% to 486, which is very low compared to 
footfall levels, and only 32 were RIDDOR reportable incidents.
CRISIS MANAGEMENT
The risk of a catastrophic event, such as a terrorist incident  
at one of our properties, has increased during 2015. We have 
comprehensive emergency plans in place including the 
formation of a Core Crisis Group (CCG) to react to a range  
of major incidents. During an incident, the CCG would provide 
direction to our property-based teams as well as managing 
customer and media relations.
The CCG includes the Executive Directors who are responsible 
for key decisions within previously agreed strategic principles 
which place the protection of life above any other 
consideration. This team must be properly equipped to address 
any major incident.
In October, we organised an externally-facilitated exercise  
to simulate a plausible incident at one of our shopping centres 
which involved life safety issues, disruptions to normal 
operations and extensive media coverage. The CCG worked 
through the scenario, whilst receiving additional updates from 
key external organisations and the media, to determine 
response priorities and organise the responses needed for  
a full recovery and resumption of business. The event affirmed 
the strength of the Group’s plans, although a number of 
improvements were identified which are being implemented.
RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
Our Risk Management Framework is structured around eight principal risk areas, contains mitigating actions and allocates management 
responsibility for each individual risk. The framework is subject to regular management review, including at each Risk and Controls 
Committee and Audit Committee meeting. The framework designates a level of residual risk to each principal risk area, taking account  
of mitigation actions, and this residual risk is considered in the context of our risk appetite. During 2015, the Board carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks and determined that the level of residual risk associated with our principal risk areas has generally 
increased, although each remains within our risk appetite. An assessment of the potential impact and probability associated with each  
of our principal risks is shown on chart 60.

PRINCIPAL RISKS
Further details of the key risks within each of the Group’s principal risk areas is shown below.
Risk and impact Mitigation Change during 2015 and outlook
1. BUSINESS STRATEGY
Executive responsibility: David Atkins Impact Probability
 – Our retail strategy of investing in 
shopping centres, retail parks and 
premium outlets in selected European 
countries results in underperformance 
relative to other sectors or markets, 
eroding shareholder value.
 – The macro-economic environment 
declines, impacting consumer 
spending and property values, 
adversely impacting earnings and net 
asset value.
 – Failure to anticipate and address 
developments in consumer and 
occupational markets, such as  
multichannel retailing and digital 
technology results in obsolescence and 
financial underperformance.
Link to business model
1
 
2
 
3
 – We focus on prime shopping centres in the best 
locations, convenient retail parks and premium 
outlets, all with experienced management.
 – We commission and evaluate research into the 
economy and investment and occupational markets 
and use this when preparing our annual Business 
Plan and regular financial forecasts.
 – Within our Business Plan we stress-test our 
projections against a severe downside economic 
scenario. This has confirmed that our current and 
projected financial position is robust. We have low 
gearing, effective foreign currency hedging, 
long-term secure income streams, a good spread of 
debt maturities and the flexibility to phase or halt 
our development programme, all of which point to 
resilience to market shocks.
 – We monitor closely developments in the retail 
environment and apply our Product Experience 
Framework to ensure our portfolio remains 
attractive to both retailers and consumers.
The UK economy has seen solid growth during  
2015, although the recovery in France has been  
less pronounced.
Stock markets have been volatile, especially in the 
second half of 2015 and beginning of 2016 due to a range 
of conflicting economic data and external shocks.  
Whilst growth is forecast in the UK, France and Ireland 
there are downside risks associated with China, Brexit 
and the Middle East which could adversely impact 
economic stability.
UK and French retail sales have grown during 2015 
which has strengthened the occupational retail market. 
Retailers continue to seek new space, and physical real 
estate remains central to their plans. Retailers are 
concentrating their requirements on properties which 
can support their multichannel sales offer and are able 
to attract consumers. 
See Our market section on page 14
+
2. PROPERTY AND CORPORATE INVESTMENT 
Executive responsibility: David Atkins/Peter Cole
 – Investment decisions result in 
inadequate returns or the adoption of 
unforeseen liabilities.
 – Opportunities to divest of properties 
are missed, or are limited by market 
constraints, which reduces potential 
returns and adversely impacts the 
Group’s funding strategy.
Link to business model
2
 – Acquisitions are thoroughly evaluated and are 
supported by detailed review, financial appraisals, 
due diligence and a risk assessment prior to  
Board approval.
 – The performance of individual properties is 
benchmarked against target returns.
 – Properties are held in a ‘ready for sale’ state,  
with documentation supporting leases, rights  
and obligations readily accessible.
 – Our property portfolio is high-quality, and 
diversified by market sector and geography, 
reducing the impact of a downturn in a single 
market.
We have recently completed a number of significant 
acquisitions, principally the Irish loan portfolio and 
Grand Central in Birmingham. The performance of 
these large transactions will be closely scrutinised. 
Borrowing levels are forecast to reduce in 2016 through 
the completion of the major disposals programme 
announced in September.
Real estate investment demand, particularly for prime 
assets, remains strong in the UK, France and Ireland. 
This is further supported by the continuing low interest 
rate and inflation environment. These factors have 
contributed to a rise in real estate values during 2015. 
Future valuation growth is forecast to be more subdued 
and be driven more by income growth than inward yield 
movements. Also, any macroeconomic uncertainty 
could adversely impact investment markets.

3. PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT
Executive responsibility: Peter Cole
 – Over-exposure to developments, 
particularly major long-term schemes, 
increases the impact of an economic 
downturn which would adversely 
affect scheme viability and increase 
financing and cash flow pressures. 
 – Poor development management and 
inadequate resourcing leads to failed 
or sub-optimal projects.
 – Increasing construction activity and 
raw material prices result in 
construction price inflation adversely 
impacting the viability and financial 
returns of projects.
 – Failure to achieve key project 
milestones, such as planning consents, 
land acquisitions and leasing targets, 
on a timely basis damages project 
viability and corporate reputation.
Links to business model
3
 – Our exposure to developments and the phasing  
of projects is considered as part of our annual 
Business Plan and reviewed throughout the year. 
This process also considers future resourcing 
requirements.
 – We produce regular management reporting, 
including risk reporting, to enable effective 
monitoring of development projects.
 – Multi-disciplinary teams are assembled for each 
development under a designated ‘project owner’, 
and these are supported by external expertise.
 – Detailed analysis, including market research, is 
undertaken prior to the approval of expenditure  
for each key milestone for development projects.
 – Where possible, guaranteed maximum price 
contracts are agreed with building contractors and 
fixed prices agreed for other advisers.
 – Constructive relationships are maintained with 
local councils and government.
 – Post-completion reviews are undertaken for all 
significant projects and presented to management, 
including the Audit Committee. These ensure 
potential improvements to processes are identified 
and considered for future projects.
During 2015 we have reduced the level of risk associated 
with developments by progressing the development 
pipeline and have successfully completed four 
developments. At 31 December 2015, two further 
schemes are on-site and the development portfolio 
represents only 5% of our property portfolio.
As we approach the commencement of our major 
development schemes we will only commit when sound 
financial and risk analysis demonstrates scheme 
viability and good returns. The progress made with our 
three major London schemes during the year coincides 
with improving demand from retailers for new prime 
trading locations. However, a number of key milestones 
including further planning consents, anchor tenants 
agreements and leasing targets are required to bring 
these schemes to fruition.
We have allowed appropriate cost inflation 
contingencies within the scheme appraisals and to lock 
in competitive pricing we will look to secure 
construction contracts well ahead of schemes going 
on-site. Cost inflation should be tempered by the 
reduction in the oil price and lower global demand for 
raw materials.
See Business Review on page 34

4. TREASURY
Executive responsibility: Timon Drakesmith
 – Poor treasury planning or external 
factors, including failures in the 
banking system, lead to a liquidity 
squeeze preventing the refinancing of 
maturing debt or leading to 
insufficient liquidity to progress the 
development programme.
 – Adverse currency or interest rate 
movements result in financial losses.
 – Deterioration in our financial position 
may result in a breach of borrowing 
covenants which triggers default and/
or repayment of facilities or bonds and 
inhibits corporate strategy.
Links to business model
4
 – The Board approves our treasury strategy and 
regularly monitors guidelines for financial ratios. 
These guidelines include ensuring we maintain an 
appropriate debt maturity profile, and manage the 
exposure to fixed and floating interest rates and the 
level of foreign exchange hedging. 
 – Credit ratings are set and monitored for lending 
counterparties and we use diverse sources  
of funding.
 – The Board approves all major investment decisions 
which are supported by a financing plan and takes a 
proactive approach to refinancing.
 – Our annual Business Plan includes stress tests 
considering the impact of a significant 
deterioration in the markets in which we operate.
 – The high quality and diversification of our portfolio 
should help to protect our financial position, 
particularly from falling property values. At  
31 December 2015, gearing stood at 54%, 
significantly lower than the Group’s most stringent 
borrowing covenant that gearing should not exceed 
150%. We estimate that property values (including 
premium outlets) could fall by 42% from their 
December 2015 levels before covenants would  
be endangered.
Our borrowing levels and near-term refinancing 
requirements have increased during 2015, principally 
associated with the Irish loan portfolio acquisition. 
However, at 31 December 2015, our balance sheet and 
financial ratios remain robust. We have access to a wide 
range of funding sources including bank lending, bond 
and equity market, and private placements and we 
completed a number of significant financing 
transactions during 2015. We expect to maintain a 
strong financial position during 2016 and credit rating 
agencies have recently reaffirmed our ratings.
The macro-economic environment has continued to 
provide historically low interest rates and the financial 
markets have good levels of liquidity for companies in a 
strong financial position. However, macro-economic 
uncertainties could adversely impact future liquidity 
and pricing.
Whilst there is an expectation, particularly in the UK, of 
future interest rates increases, these are forecast to be 
gradual and dependent on the underlying strength of 
the wider economy. 
Sterling has strengthened by 5% against the euro during 
2015 and remains volatile with continued challenges 
within the eurozone and the current wider global market 
uncertainties. However, we mitigate our foreign exchange 
risk by maintaining a high level of currency hedge.

5. OWNERSHIP STRUCTURES
Executive responsibility: Peter Cole
 – Joint control reduces liquidity  
and could impact operational 
effectiveness, especially if joint 
venture partners are not  
strategically aligned.
 – Lack of direct control over externally 
managed premium outlet interests 
reduces transparency of performance 
and governance and may result in 
inconsistent strategies.
Links to business model
1
 
2
 
3
 
4
 – We undertake an annual liquidity review of all our 
properties. We have a diverse range of joint venture 
partners and documentation is drafted to ensure 
strategic alignment and to provide liquidity for 
partners whilst protecting our ownership. 
 – We maintain strong working relationships and hold 
regular meetings with our partners to proactively 
manage any issues. Annual business plans are used 
to ensure operational and strategic alignment.
 – We have an increasingly close working relationship 
and have formal influence over strategy and 
governance through board representation for both 
Value Retail and VIA Outlets. Our investment in 
VIA Outlets contains provisions to enable effective 
joint governance and control.
 – Our premium outlet investments are both subject 
to external audit and the properties are 
independently valued for us by Cushman and 
Wakefield with the valuations reviewed by 
management and the Audit Committee.
Joint ventures reduce the exposure risk associated  
with owning major shopping centres and we have a  
long and successful track record of working effectively 
with a variety of partners.
During 2015, the proportion of properties held within 
joint ventures or associates has increased to 45%  
(by value) at 31 December 2015, principally due to  
the sales of wholly-owned properties: Drakehouse,  
Bercy 2 and Grand Maine. This figure will increase 
further in 2016 when the Irish properties are secured 
and with the completion of the acquisition of Grand 
Central, Birmingham. 
We are confident that joint venture ownership 
structures do not adversely impact liquidity with  
a number of joint venture stakes successfully traded  
in the investment market during 2015.
See notes 12 and 13 to the accounts +
7. CATASTROPHIC EVENT
Executive responsibility: David Atkins
 – Our operations, reputation or financial 
security could be significantly affected 
by a major event such as a terrorist or 
cyber attack, power shortage or civil 
unrest. 
 – Climate change could adversely 
impact our operations, through an 
environmental incident such as 
flooding or changes in consumer or 
investor behaviour.
Links to business model
1
 
 – We have continuity plans at both corporate and 
individual property levels and have established a 
Core Crisis Group for dealing with a major incident.
 – We have enhanced the physical security measures 
at our properties and maintain an on-going 
dialogue with security agencies to assess threat 
levels and best practice.
 – Our insurance policies include cover for property 
damage, including from terrorism and climate 
change, such as flooding.
 – We have a clear sustainability strategy which is 
integrated within our business model and 
addresses on-going climate change matters.
Whilst the overall probability of a major incident at one 
of the Group’s properties remains low, the threat level 
has increased during 2015. Also the wider use of digital 
technology across the Group increases the risks 
associated with cyber security.
We have thoroughly reviewed and improved our 
processes and procedures to counter the threat of a 
major incident. However, it is not possible to fully 
mitigate the risk and impact if an incident were to occur. 
See Health and Safety case study on page 63 +
6. TAX AND REGULATORY
Executive responsibility: Timon Drakesmith
 – Loss of tax-exempt status due  
to change in legislation or  
non-compliance. 
 – EU/UK regulation, including 
environmental matters, acts as a brake 
on growth and an administrative 
burden for the real estate sector.
Links to business model
4
 – Compliance with rules for maintaining tax-exempt 
status monitored by in-house tax specialist and 
external advisers.
 – Speculation and comment relating to changes in 
tax regimes in the UK and Europe is monitored 
with the help of external advisers. 
 – Developments in regulation are monitored and 
governments and regulators lobbied through 
representation by UK and European real estate 
trade bodies.
 – Monitoring of exposure to key regulations and 
mitigation planning is undertaken at a portfolio 
level. We also undertake active participation in 
policy consultations and in industry-led dialogue 
with policy makers.
No significant changes during 2015, although 
governments continue to seek to reduce fiscal deficits.
The real estate sector is sometimes perceived by 
regulators to be part of the financial services sector 
rather than as an operating business and the industry 
could be adversely affected by misdirected regulation 
designed to stabilise financial markets, such as the 
proposed OECD BEPS project.
Changes in the UK associated with the living wage, 
apprenticeships and business rates, whilst not having a 
significant direct impact on us, may have an adverse 
financial impact in the wider retail sector. Negotiations 
associated with Brexit are also likely to impact existing 
legislation.

TIMON DRAKESMITH
Director
GOING CONCERN
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in 
the Business Review, the Financial Review and the Principal Risks and Uncertainties sections of the Annual Report. The financial position 
of the Group, its liquidity position and borrowing facilities are also described on pages 60 and 61 and in notes 17 , 19 and 20 to the accounts.
The Directors have reviewed the current and projected financial position of the Group, making reasonable assumptions about future 
trading performance. As part of the review, the Directors considered the Group’s cash balances, its debt maturity profile, including 
undrawn facilities, and the long-term nature of tenant leases. After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
VIABILITY STATEMENT
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2014 revision of the Code, the Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a longer 
period than the 12 months required by the ‘Going Concern’ provision. The Board conducted this review, taking account of the Group’s 
current position, future plans and the potential impact of the Principal Risks documented within this section. Based on this review, the 
Directors have concluded that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over a five-year period to 31 December 2020. This period was selected for the following key reasons: 
i) The Group’s annual Business Plan covers a five-year period and considers the Group’s cash flows and key financial metrics and 
includes sensitivity analysis to validate the Group’s resilience and mitigation options to adverse events.
ii) The Group has a stable, secure income stream with five-year, upward only, rent reviews and has an average unexpired lease term of six 
years at 31 December 2015.
iii) The time-scale for the delivery of the Group’s major development schemes is approximately five years and currently extends  
beyond 2020.
iv) Whilst £1.6 billion of the Group’s borrowings are due to mature within the five-year period, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation, and have assumed, that these can be refinanced on normal market terms during that period, and as at 31 December 2015 
the Group’s weighted average debt maturity was six years.
v) Most leases contain a five-year rent review pattern and therefore five years allows for the forecasts to include the reversion arising 
from those reviews. The five-year strategic review considers the Group’s cash flows, dividend cover, REIT compliance and other key 
financial ratios over the period.

8. BUSINESS ORGANISATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES
Executive responsibility: David Atkins
 – Management structures or resourcing 
levels are inappropriate for achieving 
business objectives.
 – Failure to recruit and retain key 
executives and staff with appropriate 
skills and calibre undermines 
corporate strategy.
Links to business model

 – A human resources plan is included within  
the annual Business Plan. This considers  
team structures, training requirements and  
talent management.
 – The Nomination Committee approves succession 
plans for senior roles.
 – Significant changes to the management structure 
are approved by the Board.
 – We periodically review the remuneration structure, 
including an annual review by the Remuneration 
Committee and benchmarking against industry, or 
other relevant, comparatives.
 – We have established a management competency 
framework and management skills are formally 
assessed within the annual appraisal process.
During 2015, we have successfully completed the 
relocation of our London headquarters and established 
our new operations centre in Reading. 
We recognise the importance of motivating and 
developing our staff and have plans in action to help to 
mitigate the impact of third party recruitment 
approaches in a strong recruitment market. We have 
had improved employee engagement scores from our 
employee surveys undertaken during the year and will 
implement a number of enhancements based on the 
feedback received.
2016 will require significant effort to establish and 
integrate our new Irish platform with our existing 
Group structures and processes.

68 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 BOARD EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW
Our General Counsel and Company Secretary, Sarah Booth, 
facilitated the 2015 Board effectiveness review. In it, Directors 
discussed various topics focused on themes drawn from the Code. 
These included how the Board works together, influences 
Hammerson’s culture and values, sets the Company’s strategic 
aims and assesses risk. She reviewed the responses and discussed 
them with me before tabling a report and recommendations to the 
Board. Actions were agreed and incorporated where appropriate 
into the 2016 Board work plan. These included:
 – Further enhancements to our strategic planning process;
 – Continued focus on the talent-development aspects of 
succession planning;
 – A presentation by external advisers to the Board on culture  
and ethics;
 – An on-going programme of engagement and site visits; and
 – Preparation of a list of discussion topics for Board dinners.
Progress on the actions arising from the 2014 Board effectiveness 
review was also considered as part of the 2015 review. Further 
details can be found in this report as set out below: 
 – Succession planning – see Nomination Committee Report,  
page 79 .
 – Improving the structure of the Board strategy day – see page 76.
 – Further engagement with colleagues – see page 76.
The next Board effectiveness review will take place in 2016 and 
will be conducted by an external facilitator.
I would like to conclude by thanking my colleagues on the Board, 
the management team and all our colleagues in the Group for 
delivering yet another strong performance in 2015.
David Tyler
Chairman
We have recently seen a much greater recognition among the 
investor community of the importance of corporate culture in 
how businesses manage risk and secure a strong performance. In 
part, this is being driven by the Financial Reporting Council which 
has a major initiative under way on this topic. 
I believe that strong corporate governance, underpinned by a 
sound culture, is fundamental to our success and helps ensure we 
can meet our business goals and generate value over the longer 
term. Your Board plays a key role in shaping Hammerson’s culture 
both in the boardroom and across the wider organisation. 
During the year, the Board considered as part of the 2015 Board 
effectiveness review how effectively it sets the tone from the top. 
You can read more about this in the Board’s roundtable discussion 
on page 70. The Board also had a number of opportunities during 
the year to engage with colleagues across the business, both 
formally and informally. These meetings gave Directors further 
insight into how Hammerson’s values are embedded in the 
business and you can read more about this on page 75.
CHANGES TO THE BOARD
Effective boards need directors who bring the right balance of 
skills, experience and knowledge, enhanced by a range of diverse 
backgrounds. During the year, we welcomed two new Non-
Executive Directors to the Board, Pierre Bouchut and Andrew 
Formica. The work associated with making changes to the Board 
and monitoring succession planning across the business were 
important elements of the Nomination Committee’s activity – 
further details can be found on page 78.
Jacques Espinasse will retire from the Board at the conclusion  
of this year’s Annual General Meeting, after nine years of service 
as a Non-Executive Director. He has also been a member of the  
Audit Committee since 2007 , and chaired that Committee since 
April 2014. I would like to record my thanks to Jacques for the 
significant and valuable contribution he has made to the Board 
and the Company.
Dear Shareholders,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present Hammerson’s Corporate 
Governance Report which aims to provide an insight into how the Board spent 
its time during 2015. As in previous years, details of how we discharged our 
governance duties and applied the principles of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the Code) are contained in a separate section from page 102. 
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
The Company complied in full with the provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code published in September 
2014 which applied throughout the financial year ended  
31 December 2015.

CHAIRMAN’S LETTER In conversation with  
the Board
Sarah Booth, the General Counsel and Company Secretary, talks to the Directors about  
their views on several aspects of the Board’s activities. These include how the Board works 
together and achieves effective decision-making, its role in promoting Hammerson’s culture 
and values, how effectively risk is managed and strategy is set, and the Board’s input into 
succession planning.
Sarah Booth
Let’s start by considering how well you think the Board works 
together and achieves consensus.
Pierre Bouchut 
During my first year on the Board I have found the dialogue and 
debate open and constructive. Board members bring diversity of 
talents, backgrounds and style but all approach meetings ready to 
contribute to and challenge the debate. There is also a balance of 
interaction between all the Directors and our relationship with 
management is healthy.
Peter Cole
David Tyler encourages a collaborative and collegiate 
environment on the Board which fosters open discussion. I find 
discussion about key risks facing the business, the economic 
environment and the changing nature of occupier and investment 
demand is very helpful in shaping the Company’s investment and 
development activities.
Andrew Formica
I have also recently joined the Board. During the interview process 
and in my initial meetings with fellow Directors, I was impressed 
by everybody’s collegiate, friendly but professional attitude. The 
Board is clearly unified in its thinking around strategy and 
direction but each Director brings their own experiences and 
perspectives to the Board table.
Gwyn Burr
The Board’s diversity helps inform our debates and we have a wide 
range of experience to draw on. As newer members of the Board, 
Pierre and Andrew will both add to its capability, bringing 
financial and real estate experience to complement further our 
existing skills.
David Atkins
Discussions are positive, transparent and open. We also use 
informal Board dinners to discuss wider business topics and  
we hope to have more opportunities to do so in 2016.
T erry Duddy
I agree. The recent Board discussion on Ireland and the 
opportunities there was underpinned by very informative papers 
prepared by management which enabled us to consider the risks 
involved in what I thought was a well-balanced way. This resulted 
in clear decision-making. The Chairman is skilled at encouraging 
all members to contribute to the debate and at bringing the 
discussion to a timely conclusion.
Judy Gibbons
Yes, that is a good example. It required the Board to absorb a 
considerable amount of background information and understand 
the implications of a major acquisition in a new market. The 
Board’s discussion was robust and sufficient time was allowed for 
everyone to become fully-briefed and have the confidence 
individually to give their approval to the project.

70 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 Sarah Booth
The UK Corporate Governance Code states that one of the key 
roles for the Board is to establish the culture, values and ethics of 
the Company and to set the tone from the top. How well does the 
Board do in this area?
David Tyler
Hammerson’s values are central to the way we run the business. 
We make a point of setting them out clearly: ambition, 
responsibility, collaboration and respect. However, I recognise 
that the way we live these values and our behaviours are even 
more important than the statement of our values. Hammerson’s 
financial success must continue to be built on ethical behaviours. 
We deal with our business partners with respect and treat them as 
we would hope and expect to be treated ourselves.
Andrew Formica
As Chief Executive, David Atkins provides strong leadership and 
instils the culture that makes Hammerson such an attractive place 
to work. He is ably supported by David Tyler and the rest of the 
Board, who all share his vision.
Timon Drakesmith
I agree. Given his long experience in the property industry and in 
the Company itself, David Atkins is a key culture champion at 
Hammerson. I am particularly encouraged by the opportunities 
we have for Non-Executive Directors to interact with colleagues 
and set the tone from the top when they visit our assets, such as 
the recent Board visit to Reading. 
David Atkins
I think we are doing well but there is more work to do to get our 
values fully embedded through every part of the business. 
Engagement between the Board and colleagues throughout the 
organisation is important and allows everybody to see how the 
Board works. For example, when colleagues attend Board 
meetings, they are encouraged to explain any problems 
encountered, to take responsibility for outcomes and to share 
lessons learnt with the Board.
Pierre Bouchut
An example of our ethical stance came at a recent Board meeting 
where we debated an opportunity to accelerate a deal. There were 
aspects of the proposed scheme which didn’t fit with the Company’ s 
values and ethics, so we all agreed not to proceed. This is a good 
example of where the Company’ s values influenced our decision.
T erry Duddy
The Executive Directors have worked hard and successfully on 
establishing the vision, mission and objectives of the business and 
the values that underpin our strategy. The recent office moves in 
Reading and London have been important in that process and the 
work involved has been done with substantial and overt 
encouragement from the Board.
Jacques Espinasse
The head office move to Kings Place has enabled a significant  
shift in culture. As we look ahead to a more geographically  
diverse business in the future, it will become more important  
to have a single aligned Hammerson culture and values system. 
We will stay vigilant to monitor how well-aligned we are across  
the whole Group.
Judy Gibbons
Yes, we have many opportunities to hold informal meetings with 
management that help us assess the underlying perceptions of our 
culture and values.
Gwyn Burr
I agree – getting out and about more as a Board acts as a cultural 
barometer and that is a good thing. The annual colleague survey also 
gives us a good insight into the tone and culture of the organisation.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
IN CONVERSATION WITH THE BOARD Corporate Governance Report continued
Sarah Booth
Turning to strategy and long-term thinking, how well do you think 
the Board performs in these areas?
David Atkins
The annual strategy day in October included a good balance of 
opportunities to think in the long and short term as we considered 
what the retail environment of the future will look like. We also 
discussed the development pipeline and opportunities in this area. 
We have a clear strategy which is measured by clear targets and 
KPIs. We ensure that new Non-Executive Directors have a 
sufficiently full understanding of our business, assets and 
competitors to enable them to make a full contribution in  
all meetings.
Andrew Formica
As a new Director, I see a consistent message from the Board 
around Group strategy and direction. It is apparent that much 
debate and discussion goes into the formulation of strategy and 
that every Director is fully committed to its delivery.
David Tyler
The Board’s thinking on long-term strategy doesn’t happen in 
isolation. It is influenced by the changing economic backdrop  
both in the UK and Europe and the fast evolving nature of retail 
and customer behaviour. Recently we have also looked at what the 
impact might be of an exit by the UK from the European Union. 
This year, we are planning to make a number of disposals from  
our property portfolio and our programme will, of course, be 
influenced by our view of property investment markets in  
2016 and beyond.
Peter Cole
Setting, evolving and changing the Company’s strategy is clearly a 
critical area for Hammerson’s success. I find the Board works well 
in delivering in this area. As well as the process during formal 
Board meetings, strategy and long-term thinking result from a 
process of less formal discussion during visits to the Group’s 
offices in Reading and Paris, our shopping centres and the focused 
review and challenge during the course of the Board’s annual 
strategy day. The introduction of new Directors to the Board 
ensures that there is fresh thinking and challenge in our 
discussions. It is particularly in areas like strategy where the 
individual experience and specialist skills of the Non-Executives 
allow them to make a significant contribution.
Pierre Bouchut
We are focused on the longer term and consider key questions that 
will affect the long-term sustainability of the business model – the 
impact of online and e-commerce development and the 
digitalisation of retail, for example. The Group is developing 
digital tools which are being implemented in our centres. I am 
sure there will be a further comprehensive review of digital 
developments to assess future opportunities.
Gwyn Burr
The nature of the business is long-term investment and I think we 
do take a long-term view. Our developments in Croydon and Brent 
Cross are good examples of this. We have extended opportunities 
to assess our strategic aims at our annual strategy day where there 
is usually a vigorous debate including senior managers who  
also attend.
Judy Gibbons
Yes, we have a well-articulated strategy which is well understood 
by the Board. I think we are effective at discerning whether a 
proposal is aligned with our strategy and then moving to review 
the proposal.
Sarah Booth/Jean-Philippe Mouton/Pierre Bouchut
72 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 Sarah Booth
In terms of risk management, how well does the Board assess the 
risks we are taking ? To what extent do we apply sufficient 
challenge to major proposals?
Timon Drakesmith
This is a positive area for management reporting and Board 
engagement. I feel that we do a good job of highlighting the issues 
and debating the range of outcomes. In this year’s Annual Report 
we have enhanced our risk reporting by introducing a risk heat 
map to show how risks changed during 2015.
Peter Cole
In our capital allocation and particularly when considering major 
developments or investment acquisitions, the risks involved are a 
key area of challenge and debate. For example, the acquisition of 
the Irish loan portfolio in 2015 was preceded by a number of 
strategic discussions, involving both internal and external input, 
relating to the assessment of the risks involved. These included 
moving into a new territory, the loan structure, the assets 
themselves and the potential impact on the Company of  
financing decisions.
Jacques Espinasse
We take a robust approach to all aspects of risk management, 
giving it an appropriate level of weight when making major 
decisions. The process is well-framed and quantified and it  
is regularly updated as the business evolves and develops.
David Atkins
While we always do a thorough evaluation, we naturally recognise 
that we cannot eliminate all risk, although we hope we always 
identify the risks we take and are confident these are within our 
risk appetite.
Sarah Booth
Let’s move on to succession planning. How confident are we that 
we have identified a talent pipeline below the Board? 
David Tyler
As Chairman, there is nothing more important to me than the 
people agenda. Our aim is for Hammerson to have the most 
talented people in the sector. I make a point of frequently meeting 
senior members of the management team and I know my fellow 
Directors do so as well. With my colleagues, I ensure that we 
review the performance of the whole management cadre regularly 
to ensure that we identify and give our many talented people an 
opportunity to develop within the business.
T erry Duddy
Yes, we have a very solid and detailed succession planning and 
talent review discussion at the Nomination Committee. All 
Non-Executive Directors attend this, giving them the opportunity 
to voice their views and air any concerns.
Judy Gibbons
I think the process for identifying talent below Board level is a 
solid one. In 2016 we will work on reviewing progress on the 
development of key individuals and their ability to move into their 
next roles. At the entry level, it’s good to see the investment in the 
graduate programme is giving such a positive outcome. 
Gwyn Burr
We are seeing much more evidence than in the past of deep 
thinking about our colleagues and their development needs and 
opportunities. We should maintain a good level of visibility in this 
area to facilitate continued informed debate.
Jean-Philippe Mouton
The annual review of succession planning down to senior 
managers is thorough. Identifying gaps is positive as it encourages 
talented individuals across the Group to consider new 
opportunities in the Company.
Jacques Espinasse
The size of the Company is such that we cannot always have ready 
successors for every role, but we do focus on a couple of levels 
below the Board. I feel that succession planning is carried out in 
an appropriate manner for the size of our Company.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
IN CONVERSATION WITH THE BOARD Your Board’s year
This section of the Corporate Governance Report focuses on the activities of 
the Board during the year, highlighting key activities and events. It should be 
read in conjunction with the section on the UK Corporate Governance Code 
on pages 102 to 105 which explains how the Board complied with the Code 
during the year.
THE ACQUISITION OF A LOAN PORTFOLIO SECURED 
AGAINST RETAIL ASSETS IN DUBLIN, IRELAND
The Board regularly reviews potential acquisition opportunities. In April, 
following early monitoring by the UK New Business team, the Board began 
considering a potential opportunity to acquire a portfolio of loans secured 
against prime Dublin retail property. These included Dundrum Town 
Centre. The portfolio offered a compelling blend of best-in-class shopping 
centres with opportunities for asset improvement and development. 
The Board considered the investment opportunity in June and reviewed 
key considerations including:
 – The quality of the retail assets connected with the potential acquisition;
 – The strategic fit of the potential acquisition within the Group;
 – The Irish economy and real estate investment market;
 – The likely sale process; and
 – Potential joint venture partners.
Management produced a number of detailed papers to help the Board consider the various aspects of the acquisition opportunity. 
In particular the Board assessed various options for funding the acquisition, a risk analysis, how the assets would be integrated into 
the Group’s portfolio, and expected returns. 
A number of Board meetings were held to discuss and review the progress of the acquisition project and to approve the next steps. 
In between meetings, the Chief Executive and other members of senior management kept the Board fully informed of 
developments. The Board challenged and scrutinised the rationale for the acquisition and whether it was a good strategic fit, 
considered investor views, reviewed pricing and financing, assessed the likely approach from other potential bidders, and assessed 
the potential financing and resourcing impact of the transaction on the Group as a whole. The Board had oversight of the work 
carried out by the project teams. This enabled them to ensure to their satisfaction that the underlying assumptions relating to due 
diligence, market conditions and taxation were robust. 
The Board approved the recommendation that the Company should acquire the loan portfolio. During the project, Hammerson’s 
UK New Business team was supported by the Group’s property and operational colleagues as well as internal legal, tax, treasury 
and finance functions. Hammerson’s external legal team, valuer, tax advisors and corporate brokers also provided advice  
and guidance.
On 29 September 2015, the Company announced  
the joint-venture acquisition together with Allianz Real Estate  
of the Irish loan portfolio for
€1.23 billion

74 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 BOARD VISITS
As an important part of the Board’s work plan in 2015, two Board 
meetings were scheduled at locations away from the Company’s 
head office in London – in Leeds in June and in Reading in October.
Such meetings provide an important opportunity for the Board  
to see the Group’s portfolio first-hand and to engage formally  
and informally with colleagues. They help the Non-Executive 
Directors in particular to deepen their knowledge of the  
Group’s operations.
In Leeds, the Directors began their visit with a tour of Victoria 
Quarter and the Victoria Gate development project. At the 
meeting the Board received a project update from the project’s 
asset management and development teams. The background to 
the project was explained in the presentation, providing context 
and detailing how the strategic decision to create a premium 
destination influences all design and leasing decisions. The Board 
reviewed the timetable and key risks concerning the targeted 
completion date and letting. As well as the asset’s brand plans, 
they also reviewed further opportunities to enhance the 
development and ensure that the centre opens with an experience 
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ENGAGEMENT
Following the Board effectiveness review in 2014, it was agreed that there should be as many opportunities as possible for 
colleagues at all management levels in the Group to meet the Non-Executive Directors. 
During 2015, a number of such opportunities allowed the Non-Executive Directors to meet with management and colleagues both 
formally and informally. In June, the Non-Executive Directors joined the head office team at a celebratory event to mark the 
opening of the new head office at Kings 
Place. The entire Leeds project team 
attended the Board dinner and site visit 
during the Board’s visit to Leeds in June. 
The Oracle shopping centre team attended 
the Board’s site visit when it visited 
Reading in October and the Board also met 
the full Reading team at a buffet lunch. 
Colleagues from management have also 
attended and presented at Board meetings, 
enabling the Non-Executive Directors to 
engage with colleagues across the 
business. Overall, getting out and about in 
the business and listening to colleagues 
talking outside the Board room has given 
the Non-Executive Directors a useful 
cultural barometer and an insight into the 
business that they could get no other way.
for retailers and consumers in line with the Product Experience 
Framework. The day ended with a dinner where the Board and 
wider team were able to engage informally.
In October, the Board held its meeting at the Company’s new 
offices at Aquis House in Reading, followed the next day by the 
annual Board strategy day. The visit included a tour of the Oracle 
shopping centre, a presentation from the asset and leasing team 
and centre manager covering the centre’s history and the vision 
for its future, Product Experience Framework initiatives and 
sustainability plans, marketing opportunities and operations. 
The Board also saw a presentation on the project to relocate  
the head office finance and IT teams to Aquis House in Reading, 
covering how the project was planned and executed, and how 
effectively risks were managed and lessons learnt. 
A lunch at the new Reading offices enabled local colleagues to 
meet and talk to the Board informally. The Group Executive 
Committee and a number of senior managers attended a Board 
dinner in the evening where the Board was able to meet  
colleagues informally.

STRATEGIC REPORT OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
YOUR BOARD’S YEAR DAVID ATKINS’ PERSPECTIVE
My aim in preparing for this year’s annual Board strategy day was to get the Board prepared and thinking in advance about key 
topics for discussion by providing targeted reading material focusing particularly on performance to date and options and trends 
for the business. 
This year’s strategy day was held in our new offices at Aquis House, Reading which gave the Board and especially the Non-Executive 
Directors an opportunity to meet new colleagues, see the style of the new offices and similarities with our London headquarters 
and get an opportunity to see one of our centres. Visiting the Oracle shopping centre added an important dimension to the day’s 
activities and allowed the Directors to see strategy in action including marketing, digital initiatives and new retailer formats and 
simply experiencing a busy shopping centre first-hand.
Our discussions were structured with pauses for reflection and focused questions to prompt and guide the Directors and provide 
further support and challenge to the debate.
Important elements of the day’s debate were an opportunity to look into the future and consider the Irish business environment. 
‘What if’ scenarios were discussed and we were able to consider the possible consequences of future technological advances on our 
business and the risks of major disruption to our business model. In light of our recent Irish acquisition, we had a very fruitful 
discussion led by an invited speaker with expertise  
in the political, economic and business environment 
in Ireland.
The feedback on the format of this year’s strategy day 
was favourable and all the Directors found it useful. 
Exploring and challenging different options for the 
business can be quite tactical but also allows 
strategic thinking about what could or might happen 
and how we could orientate the business accordingly.
I think we were all energised by the opportunity to 
discuss ideas together and, importantly, the day also 
helped support working relationships on the Board. 
It provided an opportunity for Directors to work 
together which is harder to replicate in a routine 
Board meeting.
BOARD STRATEGY DAY
Ensuring that the Company delivers its mission to create 
desirability for its consumers and commercial partners and 
positive value for all stakeholders, depends on the successful 
implementation of the strategy set by the Board. While the 
Group’s strategy is continuously discussed and refined throughout 
the year, the Board takes time out of its regular schedule every 
year to debate and reflect on broader strategic issues.
The objective of the 2015 strategy day was to discuss and evaluate 
the key decisions which will be required to be made during 2016 in 
order for the Group to deliver on its stated strategic objectives 
over the next three to five years. The agenda for the day included:
 – A review of progress against strategy over the last year;
Corporate Governance Report continued
 – A market overview and latest forecasts for the investment and 
consumer markets;
 – Opportunities arising from emerging trends and technologies;
 – Priorities and opportunities for deploying capital and likely 
challenges; and
 – An overview of the Irish market.
In response to comments received in last year’s Board 
effectiveness review, the structure of the day was refined. In 
addition a number of key questions were posed to enable the 
Board to focus its thinking on specific areas and encourage active 
discussion. Insights and ideas generated in this way were further 
debated and refined and incorporated into the Business Plan for 
2016. Positive feedback was received from the Directors on the 
structure of the day’s activities.

76 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 HAMMERSON’S APPROACH TO SHAREHOLDER 
ENGAGEMENT
The Company has a comprehensive investor relations 
programme. The Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer and 
the Head of Investor Relations meet regularly with institutional 
shareholders to discuss strategic issues and present the 
Company’s results. The Company also engages with all 
shareholders through regular communications, the Annual 
General Meeting and investor relations activities. The Chairman 
and the General Counsel and Company Secretary also each have 
an annual engagement with major shareholders.
BOARD OVERSIGHT
The Board is committed to ensuring that the Company engages 
with shareholders and other key market participants, such as 
research analysts, to learn and understand their views. The Board 
reviews an investor relations report at each Board meeting. The 
Group Executive Committee also reviews these matters at its 
monthly meetings. The investor relations report includes  
details of:
 – The latest share price performance, benchmarked against peers;
 – Recently published analyst research, including analyst views, 
and any changes in analyst forecasts for the Company;
 – Any significant changes to the shareholder register;
 – Recent investor relations activity, such as road shows and 
conferences; and
 – Feedback from institutional investors.
The Chairman also meets with shareholders independently  
of the Executive Directors. In April 2015, he met institutional 
shareholders in London and Amsterdam. Topics discussed 
included strategic goals, the geographical focus of the Company’s 
portfolio, the appropriate size of the Company and governance 
topics such as the composition of the Board. Shareholder feedback 
from these meetings was positive.
The General Counsel and Company Secretary also acts as a focal 
point for communications on corporate governance matters. She 
met or spoke with a number of major shareholders during 2015 to 
discuss corporate reporting and governance matters.
INVESTOR RELATIONS PROGRAMME
The Company continues to make full and transparent disclosure 
despite the decision taken in 2015 to cease publishing quarterly 
Interim Management Statements. As well as the full-year and 
half-year results, the Company publishes Regulatory News Service 
(RNS) announcements and continues to run a comprehensive 
investor relations programme. The Company believes the new 
approach has worked well and will continue it in 2016. 
Hammerson’s investor relations programme includes the 
following activities:
 – Bi-annual investor roadshows after full-year and half-year 
results;
 – Industry conferences in UK, Europe and US;
 – One-to-one meetings with management at the request  
of institutional shareholders;
 – Meetings on sustainability with Socially Responsible 
Investment fund managers;
 – Salesforce briefings at leading equities brokers;
 – Investor tours of assets, organised as necessary, accompanied  
by centre managers and other colleagues;
 – Panel discussions with executive management at investor 
conferences and events;
 – An annual Capital Markets Day;
 – An annual sustainability report and investor webinar; and
 – Bespoke research into themes and trends in the retail sector.
In 2015, the annual Capital Markets Day involved a trip to  
Elliott’s Field, Rugby, and Victoria Gate, Leeds. It included 
presentations on how the Company is performing against strategy 
and progress on-site at Victoria Gate, as well as a thorough 
discussion of the dynamics in the UK retail parks market. Investor 
feedback was positive with investors commenting that they found 
it useful to see two key schemes under development and meet 
operational colleagues.
The Company’s website is an important means of communication 
and a key source of information for shareholders and prospective 
investors. It contains RNS announcements, a live share price feed 
and other information including an archive of published results 
and reports, press releases, details about the Group’s assets and 
contact information for the Company’s operational teams. 
Webinars, which include the full-year and half-year results, are 
streamed live to shareholders and analysts and are available for 
playback on the website. 
In October, the Company launched a dividend reunification 
programme with its registrar, Capita. The programme has 
successfully reunited a number of shareholders with their 
unclaimed dividends. The Company plans to launch a sale and 
purchase programme during 2016 for shareholders holding small 
numbers of shares.
The Annual General Meeting provides all shareholders with an 
important forum where they can put questions to the Board. The 
proxy voting results are available shortly after the meeting and are 
published at www.hammerson.com.

STRATEGIC REPORT OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DEAR SHAREHOLDERS
I am pleased to present the Nomination Committee Report which 
summarises our work during the year. This report should be read in 
conjunction with the separate report on page 102 which describes 
our compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
CHANGES TO THE BOARD
A number of Board changes took place during the year. Pierre 
Bouchut was appointed to the Board as a Non-Executive Director 
in February 2015. His appointment process, led by the Committee, 
was described in last year’s Annual Report. Following the Annual 
General Meeting, Tony Watson stepped down after nine years on 
the Board. Terry Duddy took on Tony’s former role as Senior 
Independent Director.
In November 2015, the Board was further strengthened by the 
appointment of Andrew Formica as a Non-Executive Director and 
he also joined the Audit and Nomination Committees. The 
Committee led the process which resulted in Andrew Formica’s 
appointment. Spencer Stuart was appointed to facilitate and 
advise in the process. Spencer Stuart has no other connection  
with the Group and is a signatory to the Voluntary Code of 
Conduct of Executive Search Firms. Andrew’s appointment was 
the culmination of a process which began following the 2013 
Board external effectiveness review when the Board concluded 
that the next two Board appointments should bring further 
European experience and investment and banking skills to the 
Board. The Committee believes this has been achieved with the 
appointments of Pierre Bouchut and Andrew Formica who bring  
a range of skills including financial experience to strengthen 
existing expertise on the Board.
Jacques Espinasse will retire from the Board following the 2016 
Annual General Meeting. The Committee has considered a 
successor for Jacques’ role as Chairman of the Audit Committee 
and decided that Pierre Bouchut has the right mix of skills and 
experience for the role and recommended Pierre’s appointment  
to the Board. Pierre has confirmed that he is able to make the time 
commitment required as Audit Committee Chairman and will 
assume the role following the Annual General Meeting.
BOARD BALANCE AND ARRAY OF SKILLS
This year, as it does annually, the Committee has also reviewed the 
composition of the Board. As part of this review, the Committee:
 – Considered the number of Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors on the Board and whether the balance is appropriate;
 – Reviewed the membership of the Committees;
 – Considered the background professions and core skills and 
experience of the Directors to ensure the right mix of skills;
 – Considered and confirmed that all the Non-Executives remain 
independent; and
 – Considered diversity, including gender.
Following this review the Committee has concluded that the 
Board continues to have an appropriate mix of skills and 
experience to operate effectively. The Directors collectively bring 
a range of expertise and experience of different business sectors  
to Board deliberations which helps to ensure constructive and 
challenging debate around the boardroom table. This array of 
skills is illustrated in chart 61 on the next page.

78 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 SUCCESSION PLANNING
Succession planning was a particular area of focus for the 
Committee during 2015. The Committee reviewed a formal report 
on the subject in respect of the Executive Directors and senior 
colleagues, subsequently receiving an update on progress during 
the year. Considerations included a review of the Company’s plans 
aiming to ensure that key roles at Board and Group Executive 
Committee level can be filled by other colleagues on an interim 
basis. A review of the talent in the Company was also considered  
to identify those individuals with the potential to fill more senior 
roles over the medium and long term. The Committee 
acknowledges the size of the organisation means there are not 
obvious successors for every senior role. Discussions were also 
held about more junior individuals with high potential and plans 
were reviewed to help with their development. The Committee 
will continue to focus on this area during 2016.

aspirations with the Chief Executive. Further opportunities 
for expanded roles and responsibilities are explored,  
if appropriate.
An annual review of Executive Director and Group  
Executive Committee (GEC) roles is undertaken to ensure 
interim short-term cover is available in the business for  
these roles. Medium and longer-term successors are identified 
for roles, where possible. 
The Chief Executive presents a discussion paper to  
the Committee on the longer-term career aspirations of  
the Executive Directors.
A review of talent in the wider business is undertaken  
and GEC members engage with high potential individuals  
to discuss their career aspirations. Personal development 
plans are drawn up.
The Committee reviews succession plans. High potential 
individuals are noted and the Committee takes opportunities 
to get to know these individuals.

DIVERSITY
There are currently two female Directors on the Board 
representing 18% of its composition. This will increase to 20% 
when Jacques Espinasse steps down at the Annual General 
Meeting. As previously stated, our aim is to maintain at least this 
level of female representation on the Board. However, the 
paramount consideration is to maintain the right mix of skills, 
knowledge, independence and experience on the Board. For that 
reason, recommendations for any future appointments will 
always be made on merit. You can read more about the Company’s 
diversity and inclusion strategy on page 51 of the Our People 
section of the Strategic Report.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Overseeing effective  
controls
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS
I am pleased to present this report on behalf of the Audit Committee 
for the year ended 31 December 2015. This should be read in 
conjunction with the report on how we have complied with the  
UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) which is on page 102.
This is my last report as Chairman of the Committee as I shall be 
stepping down from the Board at the conclusion of the Annual 
General Meeting on 25 April 2016. Pierre Bouchut, who fulfils the 
Code requirement of having recent and relevant financial 
experience, will succeed me as Chairman of the Committee. He  
has also confirmed that he is able to make the necessary time 
commitment to the role. In addition, the other members of the 
Committee also combine knowledge and experience of financial 
matters, financial reporting, risk management and internal controls.
The Committee met four times in the year with the meetings at 
appropriate times in the Company’s financial and regulatory 
reporting cycle. As I mentioned in the 2014 Annual Report, an 
additional meeting was included in January to allow the 
Committee extra time to scrutinise and debate the valuation 
process by the Company’s external valuers, DTZ Debenham Tie 
Leung Limited and Cushman & Wakefield LLP (the Valuers).
The Committee met privately with the Company’s internal and 
external auditors during the year. I also met privately with the 
Valuers to ensure that they were comfortable with the 2015 year 
end valuation process. The Executive Directors and other senior 
managers were invited to attend as appropriate to provide updates 
on various matters, participate in debate and answer questions 
posed by the Committee.
During the year the Committee paid particular attention to the 
significant financial judgements in relation to the financial 
statements and how they were addressed. Their impact on the 
Group’s results and the remuneration of senior management 
makes the significant financial judgements particularly important. 
The main areas of focus and how the Committee addressed those 
issues are set out in table 64 on page 81. 
Another important aspect of the Committee’s work during 2015 
was to approve an approach and management’s plan for tendering 
for the external auditor, which will not include the incumbent 
auditor, Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) as a participating firm in the 
process. Further details of the approach and timetable are 
provided on page 83 of this report.
The Company is mindful of the Code’s new requirements in 
relation to risk and the monitoring of internal control systems. 
During 2015, the Committee and the Board reviewed the Group’s 
Risk Management Framework thoroughly at each Committee 
meeting. Having monitored the Group’s risk management and 
internal controls system, and having reviewed the effectiveness of 
material controls, the Committee has not identified any significant 
failings or weaknesses in the Group’s control structure during  
the year.
A further new reporting requirement for 2015 is the Viability 
Statement. During the year the Committee considered and 
discussed the requirements for the statement and further details 
are provided on page 67 in the Strategic Report and on page 83  
of this report.
The Committee undertook its annual performance and 
effectiveness review, based on a questionnaire which was 
completed by the Committee and regular attendees. The results 
indicated that the Committee was effective and carrying out its 
duties. I am confident that the Committee continues to play a key 
role in ensuring that the appropriate governance and challenge 
around risk and assurance is embedded throughout the Group. 
I would like to extend my personal thanks to my fellow Committee 
members for their support. I would also like to thank Deloitte, on 
behalf of the Board, for the continuing high quality of the audit 
services they have provided to the Group during the year.

80 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL JUDGEMENTS
During the year the Committee considered the appropriateness of significant financial judgements made in connection with the financial 
statements as set out below:
Table 64
Significant financial judgement considered How the Committee addressed the issue
Valuation of the Group’ s property portfolio 
(including properties held by joint ventures  
and associates)
The valuation of the Group’s property portfolio, 
including properties held in the Group’s joint ventures 
or associates, is a key risk due to its significance in the 
context of the Group’s net asset value. Although 
valuations are conducted by the Valuers, and 
thoroughly reviewed by the auditor, the valuation 
process requires a number of key judgements which 
are inherently subjective. 
The Valuers also value the Group’s development 
properties and these are subject to the same level  
of review as the investment portfolio. 
The Committee has a robust process to satisfy itself that the external 
valuation of the Group’s property portfolio is appropriate. The Committee 
recognises that the Group operates in liquid and mature markets, in which 
there are well-established valuation practices. The Committee is also familiar 
with the processes by which management provides information to the 
Valuers. The Committee reviewed the outcomes of the Valuers’ valuations, 
challenged their assumptions and was satisfied that the procedures and 
methodologies used were appropriate. Current market conditions and recent 
transactions were reviewed to provide context. The Valuers were asked to 
highlight any significant judgements and disagreements with management 
and the Committee satisfied itself of the Valuers’ independence. The 
Committee was satisfied that the valuation of the Group’s portfolio was 
prudent and reasonably-based.
Accounting for acquisitions and disposals
During the year the Group made a number of 
acquisitions and disposals, including interests in joint 
ventures and associates. There are risks in the 
accounting process for these complex transactions. 
The Committee reviewed and challenged management’s accounting 
proposals and key judgements in relation to acquisitions and disposals, in 
particular, the acquisition of the Irish loan portfolio (see below). The 
Committee was satisfied that the approach adopted was appropriate.
Accounting for premium outlet investments 
(Value Retail and VIA Outlets)
The Group’s premium outlet interests are through 
investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets. These 
investments are externally managed and due to the 
complexity of the underlying structures, there is a risk 
of inaccurate and inconsistent reporting.
The Committee reviewed management’s paper explaining the accounting 
treatment for the two investments which is based on the nature of the Group’s 
control over those investments. For Value Retail (VR), the Group is able to 
exert significant influence through its VR Board representation and through 
the terms of its loan agreements to VR and hence accounts for the investment 
as an associate. VIA Outlets is accounted for as a joint venture as the terms of 
the partnership agreement provide the Group with joint control. The paper 
explained management’s approach to consolidating the financial information 
received and the complexities and judgements required to produce the 
information to incorporate into the Group accounts. The Committee also 
reviewed the valuations (see above) and results of the two investments and 
was satisfied that the investments had been recognised appropriately.
Accounting for the acquisition of the Irish loan 
portfolio
In October 2015, the Group acquired a portfolio of 
Irish loans. The loans were acquired in a 50:50 joint 
venture with Allianz with the Group’s total cost being 
£690 million. The accounting for this large transaction 
required consideration of both the Group level and 
joint venture level accounting for incorporation into 
the Group accounts.
The Committee reviewed management’s paper explaining the proposed 
accounting treatment for the transaction. For Group accounting purposes, 
given the control provisions in the joint venture agreement, the acquisition  
is to be equity-accounted as an investment in a joint venture. The value at  
31 December 2015 would be based on the Group’s share of the net asset value 
of the joint venture.
For joint venture accounting purposes, the loans are accounted in accordance 
with IAS39 “Financial Instruments – Recognition and Measurement” being 
initially recognised at fair value, equating to the cost of the acquisition, and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost. The Valuers provided a valuation 
of the secured property assets and the Committee was satisfied with the 
proposed accounting treatment, and in particular that there were no 
indicators of impairment requiring a full impairment test.
The description of the significant financial judgements above should be read in conjunction with the Auditor’s Report on page 114 
and the significant accounting policies disclosed in note 1 to the accounts on pages 124 to 127

AUDIT COMMITTEE Audit Committee Report continued
REVIEW OF EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL  
AUDIT PROCESS
As noted in last year’s Annual Report, the Committee 
determined to carry out a formal review of the effectiveness 
of the internal auditor EY during 2015. The internal audit 
function has been outsourced since 2006 with EY providing 
internal audit services to the Group for the past two years. 
In the second half of 2015, a detailed questionnaire was 
issued to members of the Committee, senior management 
and those other managers involved in the internal audit 
procedure. As part of this review, EY and Deloitte were also 
asked to provide feedback on the Group’s current internal 
audit arrangements.
Questions covered the following areas:
 – Understanding and experience;
 – Planning and communications; and
 – Audit work and reporting.
Responses to the questionnaire were collated and reviewed 
at the Risk and Controls committee and at the Audit 
Committee. While the outcome of the review was positive, 
given the increasing scale of the Group, the Committee 
approved a proposal to adopt a new hybrid internal audit 
provision, overseen by a new Risk and Compliance 
manager. The new internal audit arrangements will utilise a 
combination of internal and external resource to enhance 
and monitor the Group’s internal audit procedures.
Each of these audits confirmed that appropriate controls were in 
place in these areas. Recommendations for improvement were 
agreed by management and assigned for implementation. When 
EY’s experience of best practice enabled the identification of 
potential enhancements to existing processes or procedures, these 
were reviewed by the Risk and Controls committee before being 
approved by the Audit Committee. 
FAIR, BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE
One of the key compliance requirements of a group’s financial statements is for the Annual Report to be fair, balanced and 
understandable. The process for the 2015 Annual Report was enhanced with the establishment of an editorial team made up of 
members drawn from Group Finance, the Company Secretariat, Corporate Communications and Marketing, all responsible for 
reviewing the Report. Regular meetings were held during the preparation and compilation period to ensure balanced reporting 
and that there were appropriate links between the various sections of the Annual Report. Extensive verification was carried out to 
ensure accuracy. Drafts were reviewed by senior management, followed by reviews by the Audit Committee in both January and 
February 2016. This provided an opportunity to challenge the fair, balanced and understandable assessment and test whether 
there was an appropriate balance throughout the Annual Report. Following further discussion the Committee and then the Board 
were able to confirm that the Annual Report taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
The Risk and Controls committee sets the internal audit 
programme by reviewing potential audit topics before they are 
presented to the Audit Committee for approval. The Risk and 
Controls committee supports the Audit Committee as part of the 
Group’s risk management strategy and more information on this 
committee can be found in the Strategic Report on page 62 and on 
page 105 in the Code compliance section of this Annual Report. 
The internal audit programme for 2015 was compiled by reviewing 
key risk areas in the Group’ s risk management framework to 
determine which would most benefit from a review. Proposals were 
debated at the November 2014 Risk and Controls committee and it 
was agreed that particular attention in 2015 should be focused on 
areas of change and key business areas. The Committee then 
approved the internal audit programme. The Committee was 
satisfied that the programme resulted from a thorough review of 
the Group’ s key business activities and addressed a number of 
related topical risk areas. 
During the year, the Committee monitored the internal audit 
process through management updates and reviewing reports 
prepared by the internal auditor, Ernst & Y oung LLP (EY).
During 2015, audits were carried out on:
 – The effectiveness of governance, risk management and reporting 
controls in relation to UK and French development projects;
 – The effectiveness of key controls for UK shopping  
centre operations;
 – The controls within the new in-house property management 
function in France;
 – The effectiveness of key financial controls following the 
relocation of head office finance and IT functions to  
Reading; and
 – Activities in relation to the Group’ s digital engagement activities.
82 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 THE VIABILITY STATEMENT
The UK Corporate Governance Code has introduced a new 
requirement for the Board to consider the period over 
which it is able to conclude that the Company will remain 
viable. In developing the Viability Statement, the 
Committee reviewed with management the 
appropriateness of the Company’s choice of, and reasons 
for, a five-year assessment period. The Group’s current 
position, future plans and potential impact of risks to the 
business were reviewed, including the rationale for the 
Viability Statement assessment period which was based on:
 – The Company’s five-year planning period;
 – A clear, strategic focus on retail which has traditionally 
been less volatile than other property sectors;
 – The geographical diversity of the Group’s property 
portfolio;
 – Five-year timescales which support major developments;
 – A stable income stream;
 – A strong capital base; and
 – Leases which contain a five-year rent review pattern.
Having reviewed and considered the proposed draft 
Viability Statement, the Committee approved it for 
inclusion in the 2015 Annual Report.
 The Viability Statement, together with further details of 
the Group’s approach and the Going Concern statement, 
appear on page 67 of the Strategic Report.

EXTERNAL AUDIT TENDERING –  
APPROACH AND PLAN
Over recent years there has been a significant change to the  
rules regarding the provision of external audit services for listed 
companies. In the new regulations, under the transitional 
arrangements, the latest date by which the Company is required  
to tender and appoint a new external auditor is for the financial 
year beginning 1 January 2021.
Deloitte or its predecessor firms have been the Company’s 
external auditor since the Company was founded in 1942. In last 
year’s Annual Report the Company stated that management and 
the Committee were satisfied with both Deloitte’s quality of 
service and their independence and objectivity. During 2015, the 
Committee considered tendering and rotation options in advance 
of the required rotation date of 2021. Following a decision to 
undertake a tender process in 2016, management presented a 
proposed plan which the Committee approved and recommended 
to the Board. The Committee recommended that a tender process 
should be undertaken in 2016, to align with the current Deloitte 
audit partner rotation and strategic priorities of the Group. The 
new appointment would be effective for the 2017 audit. Having 
complied with the requirement to undertake a tender process for 
the provision of the external audit, the Company’s statement of 
compliance with the Competition and Markets Authority Order 
can be found on page 111.
AUDIT TENDER PROCESS – TIMELINE
During the Committee meeting in November, key steps in the 
timetable for the audit tender plan were agreed and approved 
including the appointment of a selection sub-committee of the 
Audit Committee to lead the process, chaired by Pierre Bouchut. 
The key steps in the timetable are set out below.
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EXTERNAL  
AUDIT PROCESS
The Committee recognises the importance of having a high  
calibre external audit. It therefore assessed the effectiveness of 
the external audit process during the year, monitoring Deloitte’s 
fulfilment of the agreed audit plan and its reports on the 
conclusions of the arising significant financial judgements. The 
Committee received regular feedback from management on the 
level of support provided by Deloitte and it determined that 
Deloitte provides an appropriate level of service.
In forming its opinion of the independence and objectivity of 
Deloitte the Committee reviewed:
 – The independence safeguards operating within Deloitte;
 – Deloitte’s Audit Transparency Report for the year ended  
31 May 2015; and
 – The extent of non-audit services provided by Deloitte.
The Committee has concluded that the external audit was carried 
out effectively and efficiently with the necessary objectivity and 
independent challenge in respect of the 2015 financial year and it 
has recommended to the Board the reappointment of Deloitte at 
the 2016 Annual General Meeting.
NON-AUDIT SERVICES
The Committee recognises the need for objective and independent 
auditors and how such objectivity might be, or appear to be, 
compromised through the provision of non-audit services. Details 
of the policy on the provision of non-audit services are included in 
the section of the Annual Report on compliance with the Code on 
page 106 and the full policy is available at www.hammerson.com. 
Details of Deloitte’s remuneration, including remuneration for 
non-audit services, are also on page 106.

STRATEGIC REPORT OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
AUDIT COMMITTEE DEAR SHAREHOLDERS
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 
the year ending 31 December 2015.
REMUNERATION OUTCOME: AIP
You will have read earlier in this Annual Report that the Company 
delivered another strong performance in 2015 with adjusted 
earnings per share growing to 26.9 pence, up 13% on the prior 
year. Although the Company has final information on its own 
Total Property Return (TPR), the Remuneration Committee 
(Committee) uses estimated information regarding benchmark 
performance for the purposes of reporting the likely bonus (AIP) 
payment, and based on these estimates TPR is showing a strong 
performance against that benchmark. No AIP payments for TPR 
are made until the actual benchmark data becomes available and 
we have included in the implementation report the final outturn 
on this measure for 2014 AIP . AIP is also payable in respect of the 
Group operational targets of growth in like-for-like net rental 
income and reduction in the cost to income ratio. The final 
component of AIP is personal performance, which is assessed not 
only for specific personal objectives, but also includes an 
assessment of behaviours based on the Company’s values as well 
as how each Executive Director has led and maximised the 
contribution of colleagues. The average pay out for AIP for 2014 
was 66%, and using estimated information for TPR, the strong 
financial performance of the Company in 2015 is reflected in a 
higher average pay out of 77%.
One of the responsibilities of the Committee is to ensure that 
Executive Directors’ remuneration reflects achievements against 
long-term strategic success. Table 65 at the end of this letter shows 
the aggregate of short and long-term variable reward taken home 
by each Executive Director in 2015. This consists of the AIP for 
2014 that was paid in 2015 and the 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) awards that vested in 2015. These amounts differ from the 
statutory disclosure in table 66 which includes within it elements 
earned but not paid in 2015. Also shown in table 65 is the on-target 
and maximum opportunity for each of these areas of variable 
reward. Although Executive Directors had an opportunity to earn 
substantial variable reward in 2015, the actual amount earned 
generally represented approximately 88% of on target and 32% of 
maximum. It is worth noting that table 87 on page 97 shows the 
remuneration of the Chief Executive over the last seven years. In 
the last four years, the average amount earned represented 72% of 
maximum for AIP and 26% of maximum for LTIP .
REMUNERATION OUTCOME: LTIP
It was disappointing to note that, yet again, there was no material 
vesting of the LTIP in 2015. One of the reasons for this was that the 
LTIP awards made in 2011 measure TPR relative to an All 
Property Index, although the Company disposed of its non-retail 
assets in 2012. The Committee debated in April 2015 whether it 
was appropriate to amend the TPR performance measures for the 
2011 and 2012 LTIP awards to reflect this but concluded that there 
should be no change to those performance measures. It is likely 
that the 2012 LTIP also will not vest under the TPR performance 
measure, although there will be a partial vesting under the 
Absolute Net Asset Value performance measure. The TPR 
performance measure was changed for awards made from 2013 
onwards and the Committee is hopeful that LTIPs will start to vest 
under the TPR performance measure, reflecting the steady 
performance of the Company in delivering total property returns 
to shareholders.

84 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 2016 PAY APPROACH
With effect from 1 April 2016, and after no increases in 2015, 
Executive Director base salaries will increase by 2.5%, in line with 
that of colleagues generally.
One particular point to note is that you will have read in the 
Strategic Report that during 2015 the Company acquired a 
portfolio of loans secured on various Irish retail properties. At the 
time of this report the timetable to convert these loans to direct 
ownership and management of the real estate was not agreed. The 
Committee considered how it could measure property returns for 
assets in Ireland and decided that there was no appropriate Irish 
benchmark. As such it has decided to measure the performance of 
Irish assets against the same index used for UK assets, but will 
review and, if it considers appropriate, exercise its discretion in 
the 2016 AIP and 2016 LTIP if it considers that comparison of 
Irish assets against a UK index has led to an unintended outcome.
REMUNERATION REVIEW IN 2016
The current LTIP was approved by shareholders in 2007 and 
expires in May 2017 . In the period since its approval, the Company 
has changed its focus to retail property, and shareholders and 
institutional groups have provided greater and more specific 
insight into their views on appropriate structures for overall 
executive reward.
During 2016, the Committee will review the rules of the LTIP 
scheme and prepare a new scheme for approval by shareholders  
at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in 2017 . The Remuneration 
Policy is in the third year of its operation and will also be reviewed 
and will require to be presented for approval by shareholders at 
the AGM in 2017 . In both cases we will consult with major 
shareholders and appropriate institutional groups.
I hope that you will agree with the Committee that the outturn  
for Executive Directors reflects the performance of the Company 
and that you will support the Directors’ Remuneration Report at 
the AGM.
Gwyn Burr
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Table 65
Variable reward taken home by Executive Directors in 2015
The table below shows the total variable remuneration received by Executive Directors during 2015. It compares this with the on-target 
and maximum opportunities for the Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) that was paid in 2015 and the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) that 
vested in 2015. The table is provided for illustrative purposes only and should be considered in conjunction with the explanatory footnotes.
Explanatory footnotes:
Actual AIP corresponds to the Executive Directors’ single figure remuneration table for 2014, table 66 on page 86. Actual LTIP corresponds to the LTIP that vested in 
2015, table 72 on page 90, and is different to the numbers shown in table 66, which shows some elements earned but not paid in 2015.
The AIP maximum opportunity has been calculated as 200% of 2014 base salary. The on-target opportunity is calculated as 50% of the maximum.
The LTIP maximum opportunity has been calculated by multiplying the aggregate of the shares that vested and lapsed in 2015 (refer to tables 80 to 83 from page 94) by 
the relevant share price. The relevant share prices used in the calculation are 672.80 pence for David Atkins, Peter Cole and Jean-Philippe Mouton and 654.40 pence 
for Timon Drakesmith. The on-target opportunity is calculated as 25% of the maximum.

Benefits Taxable benefits available to all Executive Directors include a company car or a car allowance and private medical health 
insurance. Jean-Philippe Mouton receives a seniority allowance and welfare contribution.
UK Executive Directors are entitled to participate in the Company’s all-employee share plan arrangements (SIP and 
Sharesave). Jean-Philippe Mouton participates in a profit-sharing scheme in France and receives an employer’s contribution 
to a French employee savings scheme.
During the year, no payments were made to Executive Directors for expenses other than those incurred wholly and directly 
in the course of their employment.
AIP Achievements against Company financial targets and personal objectives for 2015 resulted in an average entitlement for 
Executive Directors of approximately 77% of the maximum bonus opportunity. However, the data above estimates the Total 
Property Return (TPR) outcome because not all relevant data was available for that measure at the date of this report. 
Further information concerning the annual bonus outcomes for 2015 can be found on page 89 .
In the 2014 Annual Report, the TPR element was estimated at IPD+1.1%, resulting in a payout level estimated at 40% for that 
measure. The final closing measurement for TPR during 2014 was IPD+1.09%, resulting in a final payout level of 39 .75%. The 
data for 2014 has therefore been updated to reflect the actual TPR outcomes. 
LTIP 2014 figures in the 2014 Annual Report included estimated numbers for the TPR performance measure as final data was not 
available at the date of that report. The estimated value was ‘nil’. The 2014 figures reflect the actual outcome using final TPR 
data. The actual outcome was ‘nil’.
The basis for calculating the values attributable to the 2014 and 2015 LTIP figures above is set out in table 67 on page 87 . 
Estimates are for reporting purposes only. Final figures for 2015 will be presented in the 2016 Annual Report.
Pension Details of pension provision and the method for calculating the pension figures above can be found on page 92.
Other David Atkins has external non-executive appointments, disclosed in the Directors’ Biographies on page 108. He does not 
receive a fee for any of these appointments. 
Timon Drakesmith acts as the Company’s representative as a non-executive director of Value Retail PLC. He does not receive 
a fee for this appointment. 
Jean-Philippe Mouton’s salary, benefits, annual bonus and pension contributions are paid in euro. This data has been 
converted into sterling using the average exchange rate for 2015 (£1: €1.378). Equivalent data for 2014 has been converted  
at the exchange rate for that year (£1: €1.241). For further details, see note 1 to the accounts on page 125.

TSR The 2015 figure for Total Shareholder Return (TSR) is for the 2011 LTIP awards that vested in 2015. The performance period 
for awards to David Atkins, Peter Cole and Jean-Philippe Mouton ended on 1 April 2015. Performance conditions for this 
measure were not satisfied, resulting in a ‘nil’ vesting. 
For Timon Drakesmith, the performance period for the 2011 LTIP award ended on 6 June 2015 and vested on 8 June 2015. 
Performance conditions for this measure were partially satisfied. The value is calculated using actual performance and the 
share price on the date of vesting.
TPR The 2015 figures for Total Property Return (TPR) are estimated values for the 2012 LTIP awards scheduled to vest in 2016, 
where the performance period ended on 31 December 2015, as final IPD data was not available at the date of this report. The 
estimate compares the Company’s actual TPR figures with the best available information. The estimated vesting for TPR is 
0%. Final IPD data will be available in April 2016 and the award will vest in that month. The actual 2015 TPR figure will be 
reported in the 2016 Annual Report.
The 2014 figures for TPR where the performance period ended on 31 December 2014 were estimated ‘nil’ in the 2014 Annual 
Report, as some IPD data was not available at the date of that report. When IPD data became available, the performance 
conditions for this measure resulted in a ‘nil’ vesting.
Absolute 
NAV
The 2015 figures for Absolute Net Asset Value (Absolute NAV) are the values for the 2012 LTIP awards that are scheduled to 
vest in 2016 where the performance period ended on 31 December 2015. This measure is calculated to vest at 70.4%. The 2015 
figure has been estimated using the average share price over the three months prior to 31 December 2015. 
BASE SALARY
In February 2016, the Remuneration Committee determined that an increase in base salaries of 2.5% was appropriate for Executive 
Directors. This increase is broadly in line with increases in salaries awarded across the Group. A number of factors influenced this 
decision, including the effect of inflation and evidence of salaries within the real estate sector. Executive remuneration benchmarking 
data was also considered in making the decision to approve the increase, which takes effect from 1 April 2016.

Table 69 details the performance measures and composition of financial targets for the AIP . This is the Company’s annual bonus scheme, 
which is awarded as a mixture of cash and deferred shares. The deferred shares element of the AIP is granted as an award under the 
Deferred Bonus Share Scheme (DBSS), which is not subject to further performance conditions. Further details on the AIP and the DBSS 
are in the Remuneration Policy summary on page 174.
AIP awards partly reflect the Company’s performance with reference to a number of financial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

88 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 AIP (BONUS) OUTCOME: PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS FOR 2015
Details of the AIP outcome for 2015 are provided in table 70 below. The TPR performance is measured relative to the IPD UK Retail 
Property (70%) and France Retail Property (30%) indices. Annual data for the IPD UK Retail Property and IPD France Retail Property 
index is not available at the date of this report. Accordingly, the closing measurement for TPR for the year to 31 December 2015 is based  
on management’s best estimate using available data (see pages 58 and 59 for property returns data).

AIP: EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ PERSONAL OBJECTIVES
Executive Directors are able to earn up to 30% of the maximum award for achieving personal objectives. These are designed to focus not 
only on the delivery of the Business Plan and strategic priorities for 2015 (refer to ‘Our business model in action’ on pages 6 and 7), but 
also include an assessment of behaviours based on the Company’s values as well as each Executive Director’s capability in managing 
colleagues to maximise their contribution. Where it is possible to apply a meaningful measurement, personal objectives incorporate 
environmental, social and governance parameters. 
The personal objectives for each Executive Director during 2015 were not disclosed in the 2014 Annual Report as the Board considered 
them to be commercially sensitive. Payout levels were 90% for David Atkins, 90% for Peter Cole, 90% for Timon Drakesmith and 90%  
for Jean-Philippe Mouton.
Table 71
Executive Directors’ personal objectives
The Executive Directors are responsible for the leadership of the Company and management of colleagues to ensure that the actual 
financial performance of the Group meets the expectations of the Board set at the start of the year. Executive Directors were responsible 
in 2015 for the following significant strategic priorities:
 – Identifying and executing opportunities for acquisition, including in relevant new territories and premium outlets;
 – Recycling capital by disposal of identified assets;
 – Completing four developments, and progressing key London pipeline developments;
 – Continuing focus on asset management and developing venues in line with Product Experience Framework;
 – Reinforcing Culture and Values; and finalisation and roll out of rebrand exercise;
 – Optimising the funding structure to support the growth plans; and
 – Ensuring that the portfolio is managed in a sustainable manner consistent with the Sustainability Strategy.

L TIP structure: summary and details of performance measures and conditions
The structure of the 2016 awards remains the same as in 2015 with awards returning to the normal level of 200% of salary as specified in the 
Remuneration Policy. The comparator group for the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measure focuses on major European retail real estate 
companies. The Total Property Return (TPR) measure compares performance against a retail-only property index. With regard to the 
absolute performance measure, earnings per share (EPS) continues to align the interests of Executive Directors with those of shareholders.

LTIP performance measures
TSR Performance is measured over the four-year period from the date of grant in comparison with a comparator group, 
including some European real estate companies. See table 73 on page 90 for details.
TPR Performance is measured over the four financial years commencing with the year of grant and in comparison with a 
composite index: 
 – For awards granted from 2013: Investment Property Databank’s UK Annual Retail Property Index and France Annual 
Retail Property Index.
 – For awards granted in 2012: Investment Property Databank’s UK Annual All Property Index and France Annual All 
Property Index.
The relative composition of the indices may vary with each grant to ensure that it reflects the Group’s portfolio.
EPS / 
Absolute 
NAV
Performance is measured over the four financial years commencing with the year of grant. It is calculated with reference  
to the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) Best Practices recommendations:
 – For awards granted from 2013, the performance measure is EPS growth above the benchmark. From 2015, the 
benchmark is a blend of UK and French Consumer Price Inflation (CPI), whereas in 2012 to 2014 the benchmark was 
Retail Price Inflation (RPI).
 – For awards granted in 2012, the performance measure is Absolute NAV growth above the benchmark. Absolute NAV  
is calculated as adjusted shareholders’ funds divided by the adjusted number of shares in issue.
The relative composition of the indices may vary with each grant to ensure that it reflects the Group’s portfolio.

Vesting for intermediate performance between median and upper quartile-ranked entities is on a linear scale between 25% 
and 100%. For awards made from 2014 onwards, interpolation is between the TSR of the median and upper quartile-ranked 
companies on a straight-line basis on performance of those positions between 25% and 100%.
Vesting under the TSR performance condition is subject to the Remuneration Committee’s satisfaction that the Company’s 
underlying performance has been satisfactory in comparison with that of the FTSE Real Estate sector.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION STRATEGIC REPORT OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PENSION*
Executive Directors receive a salary supplement in lieu of pension benefits. Salary supplements for the year ended 31 December 2015 are 
detailed in table 76 below and are reflected in the single figure remuneration table on page 86 (table 66). All salary supplements paid to 
Executive Directors in lieu of pension benefits are subject to deductions as required for income tax and social security contributions in 
the UK and France. 
Jean-Philippe Mouton also participates in a legacy collective supplementary defined contribution pension scheme, operated by 
Hammerson Asset Management, France, which is the French company that employs him and which makes employer contributions at the 
annual statutory limit. 
Salary supplements received by all Executive Directors and the pension benefit received by Jean-Philippe Mouton do not qualify for AIP 
purposes or entitlements under the LTIP .

Note
1.  David Atkins and Peter Cole each receive a salary supplement of 30% of base salary. Timon Drakesmith receives a salary supplement of 20% of base salary. 
Jean-Philippe Mouton receives a salary supplement of €80,000 (2014: €80,000) and a legacy collective supplementary defined benefit scheme contribution  
of €12,264 (2014: €12,105), which is included in his total shown above.
Executive Directors’ deferred pension benefits
Following the closure of the Company’s defined benefit pension scheme (Scheme) in 2014, David Atkins and Peter Cole remain eligible  
for a deferred pension based on their pensionable salary and service at the point they ceased to accrue further benefits in the Scheme. The 
normal retirement age under the Scheme is 60; members may draw their pension from the age of 55, subject to actuarial reduction and 
the Trustees’ consent. Further information concerning the Scheme can be found in note 6 to the accounts on page 133. 
Table 77 below shows the total accrued benefit at 31 December 2015 representing the annual pension that is expected to be payable on 
retirement, given the length of pensionable service and salary of each Executive Director at the date each ceased to accrue further benefits 
under the Scheme. The increase in accrued benefit earned during the year represents the statutory increase applied as a result of changes 
in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Such increases are subject to statutory limits.
Table 77 also shows the transfer values of Executive Directors’ accrued entitlements under the Scheme calculated under the Companies 
Act 2006. The figures represent the value of assets that the Scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring 
the Scheme’s liability in respect of each Executive Director’s pension benefits. The figures do not represent sums paid or payable to 
individual Executive Directors but represent a potential liability of the Scheme. The statutory disclosures are based on required 
assumptions. Any increase or decrease in transfer value over the year represents a change in the transfer value assumptions that the 
Scheme applies.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION STRATEGIC REPORT OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ SHARE PLAN INTERESTS (INCLUDING SHARE OPTIONS)*
Tables 80 to 83 below set out the Executive Directors’ interests under the Deferred Benefit Share Scheme (DBSS), the Long Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP) and the Sharesave scheme. Awards under the DBSS and Sharesave scheme are not subject to any performance 
conditions (other than continued employment on the vesting date). The LTIP awards are subject to performance conditions, details of 
which can be found on page 91. 
The TPR element of any bonus payment to Executive Directors (including the deferred shares element awarded under the DBSS) is made 
only when all IPD index data is available for calculation of actual performance against the TPR performance measure. The DBSS ‘B’ award 
below is that part of the award payable when final TPR data is available.
Face values shown in tables 80 to 83 below are calculated by multiplying the number of shares granted during 2015 by the relevant share 
price. For the DBSS, the average share price for the three business days preceding the award is used. For the LTIP , the average share price 
for the five business days preceding the award is used. Notional dividend shares accruing are not included in the face value calculations for 
either scheme. Face value for the Sharesave scheme is calculated by reference to the exercise price of options granted in 2015. 
Awards to UK Executive Directors under the DBSS and since 2012 for the LTIP are made in the form of nil cost share options. All awards 
up to and including those made in 2013 accrue notional dividend shares to the date of transfer. Awards made from 2014 onwards accrue 
notional dividend shares to the date of vesting. The Sharesave scheme does not accrue notional dividend shares. 
For French tax reasons, LTIP awards granted to Jean-Philippe Mouton are in the form of conditional awards of free shares. Notional 
dividend shares accrue to the date of vesting in respect of 2014 LTIP awards and subsequent awards. For the DBSS, notional dividend 
shares accrue to the date of transfer in respect of 2013 awards and to the date of vesting for subsequent awards.

Notes
1.  The opening balance for awards held at 1 January 2015 has been adjusted to account for a rounding error in calculating the number of notional dividend shares that 
accrued during 2014. 
2.  The opening balance for awards held at 1 January 2015 has been adjusted to reflect an administrative error whereby notional dividend shares were not accrued 
during 2014 in respect of the dividend paid in August 2014.
3.  Jean-Philippe Mouton’s entitlement to awards arising under the LTIP and DBSS is calculated in euro. The prevailing exchange rate at grant is used to determine the 
number of shares to award.
4.  On 12 March 2015, Jean-Philippe Mouton was granted an additional award under 2015 DBSS (A) award to correct an administrative error made in the original award.
5.  The opening balance for the award held at 1 January 2015 has been adjusted to reflect an administrative error whereby notional dividend shares were not accrued 
during 2014.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION STRATEGIC REPORT OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY IN 2016
Shareholder approval for the Remuneration Policy was received at the 2014 Annual General Meeting and the Company is not making 
changes to the Remuneration Policy that require shareholder approval at the 2016 Annual General Meeting.
A statement on the implementation of the Remuneration Policy during 2016 is presented in table 93. The remuneration scenarios shown 
in the Remuneration Policy have been updated on page 101 of this Annual Report to reflect planned implementation for 2016. For ease of 
reference, a summary of the main provisions of the Remuneration Policy can be found on pages 174 to 177 .
The objective of the Remuneration Committee in implementing the Remuneration Policy during 2016 is to ensure that the design of 
Executive Directors’ remuneration promotes the long-term success of the Company and that all performance-related elements are 
transparent, stretching and rigorously applied. This is in line with Main Principle D .1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The variable 
pay arrangements reflect the Company’s strategic priorities, taking suitable account of environmental, social and governance risk and 
corporate social responsibility factors. Variable pay structures include provision for malus and claw-back.
In implementing the Remuneration Policy, the Remuneration Committee will continue to take into account factors such as remuneration 
packages available within comparable companies, the Company’ s overall performance, internal relativities, achievement of corporate 
objectives, individual performance and experience, published views of institutional investors and general market trends and performance.

102 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 A.4 Non-Executive Directors
The Senior Independent Director, Terry Duddy, is available to 
address shareholders’ concerns on governance. When and if 
necessary, he can also address concerns on other issues that have 
not been resolved through the normal channels of communication 
with the Chairman, Chief Executive or Chief Financial Officer, or in 
cases when such communications would be inappropriate. He can 
also deputise for the Chairman in his absence, act as a sounding 
board for the Chairman and advise and counsel all Board colleagues.
The Senior Independent Director also chairs an annual meeting  
of Executive and Non-Executive Directors without the Chairman 
to appraise the Chairman’s performance and address any other 
matters which the Directors might wish to raise. The Senior 
Independent Director conveys the outcome of these discussions 
to the Chairman.
Anthony Watson retired from the Board following the 2015 AGM 
when Terry Duddy succeeded him as Senior Independent Director.
The Chairman meets with the Non-Executive Directors as 
necessary, but at least twice a year without the Executive  
Directors present.
If any Director has concerns about the running of the Company or 
a proposed action which cannot be resolved, these will be recorded 
in the Board minutes. No such concerns arose in 2015.
B. EFFECTIVENESS
B.1 The composition of the Board
During the year the Board reviewed the overall balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the Board and 
Committee members.
The Board is satisfied that the Non-Executive Directors, each  
of whom is independent from management and has no material  
or other connection with the Company, are able to exercise 
independent judgement.
The Board reviews the independence of its Non-Executive 
Directors each year in accordance with the criteria set out within 
the Code.
Jacques Espinasse will retire following the 2016 AGM. There are 
currently seven Non-Executive Directors (including the 
Chairman) and four Executive Directors on the Board.
B.2 Appointments to the Board
The Nomination Committee, which is chaired by the Chairman 
and comprises all Non-Executive Directors, leads the process for 
Board appointments and makes recommendations to the Board. 
The Committee’s terms of reference can be found at  
www.hammerson.com.
+
    Further details of the work of the Nomination Committee can 
be found on pages 78 to 79
+  Disclosures on diversity can be found on pages 51 and 79
During the year the Nomination Committee appointed an 
independent executive search firm, Spencer Stuart, which has no 
other connection with the Company, to identify non-executive 
director candidates. Following a thorough search and interview 
process, Pierre Bouchut and Andrew Formica were identified as 
potential candidates and recommended to the Board by the 
Committee. Pierre Bouchut was appointed as a Non-Executive 
Director and member of the Audit and Nomination Committees 
on 13 February 2015. Andrew Formica was appointed as a 
Non-Executive Director and member of the Audit and 
Nomination Committees on 26 November 2015.
B.3 Commitment
The Board is satisfied that all the Non-Executive Directors are 
able to devote sufficient time to the Company’s business. 
Non-Executive Directors are advised when appointed of the time 
required to fulfil the role and asked to confirm that they can make 
the required commitment. Each individual’s commitment to their 
role is reviewed annually as part of their annual appraisal. Letters 
of appointment for the Non-Executive Directors are available for 
inspection at the AGM.
+    Positions held by Non-Executive Directors are set out on 
pages 108 and 109
All Executive Directors are encouraged to take a non-executive 
position in another company or organisation. These appointments 
are subject to the approval of the Board which considers 
particularly the time commitment required.
B.4 Development
All Directors receive an induction programme when appointed  
to the Board, which takes into account their qualifications and 
experience. All Directors are kept informed of changes in relevant 
legislation and regulations and of changing financial and 
commercial risks. Where appropriate the Company’s legal 
advisors and external auditor assist in this regard. Executive 
Directors are also subject to the Company’s annual performance 
development review process in which their performance is 
reviewed against pre-determined objectives and their personal 
and professional development needs are considered.
The Chairman undertakes an annual appraisal of Non-Executive 
Directors’ performance, in which their training and personal 
development requirements are reviewed and agreed.  
Non-Executive Directors are also encouraged to attend seminars 
and undertake external training at the Company’s expense in 
areas considered appropriate for their professional development. 
These include issues relevant to the Board and the Committees  
to which they belong.

internal performance evaluation of the Board and its Committees 
in 2015. The next externally facilitated performance evaluation  
of the Board and its Committees will take place in 2016.
The Chairman carries out a formal performance evaluation 
individually with each Non-Executive Director every year to 
review whether the Non-Executive Director continues to 
contribute effectively and demonstrates commitment to the role.
The Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent 
Director, are responsible for the annual evaluation of the 
Chairman’s performance. The Chairman’s performance 
evaluation for 2015 was carried out in early 2016 and the Board 
was subsequently updated.
Following the internal Board effectiveness review in 2015, the 
Directors concluded that the Board and its Committees operate 
effectively and that each Director continues to contribute 
effectively and demonstrates commitment to the role. 
+    More details of the internal Board effectiveness review are 
provided on page 69
B.7 Election and re-election

effectiveness of the systems in place within the Group. A robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Company has been 
carried out during the year.
The Directors have assessed the prospects of the Company over  
a five-year period and have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period of this assessment.

Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code continued
104 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 The Group’s risk management and internal control systems are 
designed to:
 – Safeguard assets against unauthorised use or disposition;
 – Ensure the maintenance of proper accounting records;
 – Provide reliable information;
 – Identify and, as far as possible, mitigate potential impediments 
to the Group achieving its objectives; and
 – Ensure compliance with relevant legislation, rules and 
regulations.
It must be recognised that the Group’s internal controls provide 
reasonable but not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Management has established a risk management framework  
and put in place sufficient procedures necessary to enable the 
Directors to report in compliance with the Code on internal 
controls. These involve the analysis, evaluation and management 
of the key risks to the Group, including a review of all material 
controls. They also include plans for the continuity of the 
Company’s business in the event of unforeseen interruption. 
Having monitored the Group’s risk management and internal 
controls, and having reviewed the effectiveness of material 
controls, the Audit Committee has not identified any significant 
failings or weaknesses in the Group’s internal control structure 
during the year.
The Risk and Controls committee supports the Audit Committee. 
It is not a committee of the Board but of executives from across 
the business and is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer. The 
committee reports its activities to the Group Executive 
Committee. The committee’s role is to:
 – Promote the application of the risk management framework 
throughout the business; 
 – Encourage pro-active discussion of risk around the business;
 – Manage the annual internal audit programme; 
 – Consider the results and recommendations of reviews; and
 – Monitor the implementation of recommendations. 
The Audit Committee regularly reports to the Board on key risks 
to the Group. The Board allocates responsibility for the 
management of each key risk to the Executive Directors and 
senior executives across the Group. 
The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its 
responsibilities relating to the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
control environment and the Group’s compliance.
Throughout the year the Committee monitored the effectiveness 
of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems, 
including material financial, operational and compliance controls. 
In particular the Committee reviewed:
 – The external auditor’s management letters;
 – Internal Audit reports including monitoring the 
implementation of recommendations arising from them;
 – Reports on the system of internal controls and the risk 
management framework;
 – The Company’s approach to compliance with legislation and 
the prevention of fraud;
 – Business continuity and cyber risk; and
 – Gifts and entertainment and expenses registers.

management is on pages 62 to 67

COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE C.3 Audit Committee and Auditors
The Audit Committee comprises five independent Non-Executive 
Directors. It holds four scheduled meetings per year, organised 
around the Company’s reporting schedule. During 2015 the Audit 
Committee met four times. 
The Audit Committee Chairman regularly reports details of the 
work carried out by the Audit Committee to the Board in 
accordance with its terms of reference.
Jacques Espinasse, the Chairman of the Audit Committee,  
has been determined by the Board to have recent and relevant 
financial experience as required by the Code. Jacques Espinasse 
will retire as Chairman of the Audit Committee and as a Non-
Executive Director at the conclusion of the 2016 AGM. He will  
be succeeded by Pierre Bouchut.
The Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive, the Chief 
Financial Officer and other members of the senior finance 
management team together with senior representatives of 
Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) are invited to attend all or part of meetings 
as appropriate. In order to fulfil its duties as defined in its terms  
of reference, the Audit Committee receives presentations and 
reviews reports from the Group’s senior management, consulting 
as necessary with Deloitte.
The Audit Committee meets at least once a year with Deloitte  
and with the internal auditor, Ernst & Young LLP (EY), which 
undertakes the majority of the Company’s internal audit reviews, 
with no Company management present. 
DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited and Cushman & Wakefield 
LLP (the Valuers) and Deloitte have full access to one another and 
the Chairman of the Committee meets with the Valuers and 
Deloitte as part of the half-year and year-end valuations to ensure 
each is satisfied that there has been a full and open exchange of 
information and views.
The Audit Committee has regard to the recommendations  
of the Financial Reporting Council on regular and open 
communications between audit committees and external auditors 
and it has concluded that the relationship with Deloitte meets 
these recommendations.
+    Details of the composition of the Audit Committee are  
set out on page 80
+    The experience and background of members of the  
Audit Committee are on pages 108 to 109 
The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its 
responsibilities in relation to: 
 – Ensuring that management has systems and procedures in 
place to ensure the integrity of financial information; 
 – Reviewing the Company’s internal audit arrangements;
 – Maintaining an appropriate relationship with the Group’s 
external auditor Deloitte; and
 – Reviewing the effectiveness, objectivity and independence of 
Deloitte including the scope of work and the fees paid to Deloitte. 
The Committee is responsible for developing, implementing and 
monitoring the Group’s policy on the engagement of the external 
auditor to supply non-audit services. The principal requirements 
of the policy are that:
 – The external auditor may not provide a service which places  
it in a position where it may be required to audit its own work, 
such as book keeping or valuation services; and
 – Some services may be provided in specific or exceptional 
circumstances and may include tax compliance work, due 
diligence and property-related consultancy. Each occasion is 
specifically assessed and authorised by an Executive Director 
up to a limit of £50,000 and above that level by the Chairman  
of the Audit Committee.
Deloitte’s remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2015 was 
£0.6m. Consideration is given to the nature of and remuneration 
received for other services provided by Deloitte to the Company. 
Confirmation is also sought that the fee payable for the annual 
audit is sufficient to enable Deloitte to perform its obligations in 
accordance with the scope of the audit. 
+    See note 4 to the accounts on page 132 for further 
information on Deloitte’s remuneration
During 2015 non-audit services provided by Deloitte to the 
Company included acting as reporting accountants for tax-related 
work and reviewing the Group’s sustainability reporting. Fees for 
non-audit services provided to the Company by Deloitte for the 
year ended 31 December 2015 were £0.1m.
The Audit Committee considered the reappointment of Deloitte 
and recommended it to the Board. Deloitte is willing to be 
reappointed as the external auditor to the Company and a 
resolution concerning Deloitte’s reappointment will be proposed 
at the 2016 AGM.
+    Further details are provided in the terms of reference for the 
Audit Committee and the full policy on non-audit services, 
available at www.hammerson.com
The Committee oversees and monitors the policies and 
procedures which form the core components of the Group’s 
adequate procedures under the Bribery Act including the Code  
of Conduct and Whistleblowing policy. The Code of Conduct 
explains how employees are expected to fulfil their responsibilities 
by acting in the best interests of the Group and in line with its 
corporate and financial objectives. 
+    A summary of the Code of Conduct is available at  
www.hammerson.com
The Whistleblowing policy sets out the procedures for employees 
to report any suspicions of fraud, financial irregularity or other 
malpractice. No reports of any such matters were received during 
the year. The Company subscribes to the independent charity 
Public Concern at Work so that employees may have free access to 
its helpline.

The principal responsibility of the Remuneration Committee is  
to determine and agree with the Board the overall remuneration 
principles and the framework for remuneration of the Executive 
Directors, the General Counsel and Company Secretary and the

E. RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
E.1 Dialogue with shareholders
The Company actively engages with shareholders.
Throughout 2015 the Company attended a wide variety  
of meetings, presentations and road shows.
The Board receives reports of meetings with institutional 
shareholders together with regular market reports and brokers’ 
reports which enable the Directors to understand the views of 
shareholders. The Board takes account of corporate governance 
guidelines of institutional shareholders and their representative 
bodies such as the Investment Association and the Pensions and 
Life Savings Association (formerly National Association of 
Pension Funds or NAPF).
Hammerson’s website contains information of interest to both 
institutional and private shareholders.
+    Further details about relations with shareholders can be  
found in the Corporate Governance Report on page 77  
and in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy available at  
www.hammerson.com
E.2 Constructive use of general meetings
At general meetings, the proxy appointment form gives 
shareholders options either to direct their proxy vote for each 
resolution or against the resolution or to withhold their vote.  
The Company will ensure that the proxy appointment form and 
any announcement of the results of a vote will make it clear that a 
‘vote withheld’ is not a vote in law; it will therefore not be counted 
when calculating the proportions of votes that were for and 
against the resolution. All valid proxy appointment forms are 
properly recorded and counted. After the vote has been counted,

the Company will explain when announcing the results of the 
vote, the actions it intends to take to gain an understanding  
of the reasons behind the result.

  HAMMERSON.COM 113 
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN RESPECT OF THE 
PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required  
to prepare the Group financial st atements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted  
by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and  
have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements  
in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 (FRS101) 
“Reduced Disclosure Framework”. Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to: 
– Select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently; 
– Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; 
– State whether Financial Reporting Standard 101 (FRS101) 
“Reduced Disclosure Framework” has been followed, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and 
– Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors: 
– Properly select and apply accounting policies; 
– Present information, including accounting policies, in a  
manner that provides relevant , reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
– Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the  
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users  
to understand the impact of partic ular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and 
– Make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as  
a going concern. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reas onable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT  
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:  
– The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view  
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; 
– The Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face; and 
– The Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are 
fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.

GOING CONCERN AND THE DIRECTORS’ 
ASSESSMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL RISKS THAT 
WOULD THREATEN THE SOLVENCY OR LIQUIDITY 
OF THE GROUP 
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ 
Statement contained on page 124 regarding the appropriateness of 
the going concern basis of accounting contained within note 1 to the 
financial statements and the Directors’ statement on the longer-
term viability of the Group contained within the Strategic Report  
on page 67.  
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
– The Directors’ confirmation on page 63 that they have carried out 
a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity; 
– The disclosures on pages 62 to 67 that describe those risks and 
explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
– The Directors’ statement in note 1 to the financial statements 
about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their 
identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s ability 
to continue to do so over a period of at least 12 months from the 
date of approval of the financial statements; 
– The Director’s explanation on page 67 as to how they have 
assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have 
done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and 
their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions. 
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of 
accounting and we did not identify any such material uncertainties. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. 
INDEPENDENCE 
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm that we are 
independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with those standards. We also 
confirm we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit 
services referred to in those standards. 
OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL 
MISSTATEMENT 
The key risks we identified were: 
– Valuation of the property portfolio 
– Accounting for the acquisition of the Irish loan portfolio 
– Accounting for the investment in Value Retail 
There has been no significant change in the Group’s operations and 
our assessed risks of material misstatement described on page 115, 
which are those that had the greatest effect on the audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team. We do however note the complex nature of the 
transaction to acquire the 50% intere st in the Irish loan portfolio 
and have included detail on how th e scope of our audit addressed the 
specific risks relevant to that transaction within the ‘Accounting for 
the acquisition of the Irish loan portfolio’ risk on page 115. All other 
risks are the same as the prior year. 
The description of risks on page 115 should be read in conjunction 
with the significant issues cons idered by the Audit Committee 
discussed on page 81 and the significant accounting policies 
disclosed in note 1 of the financial statements. These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audi t of the financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.

OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT (CONTINUED) 
Risk  How the scope of our audit responded to the risk 
Valuation of the property portfolio 
– Hammerson plc ("Hammerson") owns a portfolio of retail  
property assets valued at £7,255.8 million at 31 December 2015  
(31 December 2014: £6,849.4 million) of which £4,652.1 million  
are held by subsidiaries (31 December 2014: £4,427.3 million)  
and £2,603.7 million by joint ventures (31 December 2014:  
£2,422.1 million). The valuation of the portfolio (including a 
number of development properties) is a significant judgement  
area and is underpinned by a number of assumptions.  
– The Group uses professionally qualified external valuers to fair 
value the Group’s portfolio at six-monthly intervals. The portfolio 
(excluding development properties) is valued using the ‘investment 
method’ of valuation, in which the principal assumptions are 
estimated rental values and capitalisation yields. Development 
properties are valued by applying the same methodology, but with a 
deduction for all future costs necessary to complete the 
development together with an allowance for remaining risk, 
developers’ profit and purchasers’ costs (‘the residual method’).  
– Please see notes 11 and 12 to the financial statements. 
  
– We assessed management’s review of the work of the external 
valuer and development appraisals; 
– We met with the external valuers of the portfolio to discuss and 
challenge the valuation process, performance of the portfolio and 
significant assumptions and critical judgement areas, including 
estimated rental values and capitalisation yields. We benchmarked 
these assumptions to relevant market evidence including specific 
property sales and other external data;  
– For development properties we assessed future costs to complete 
on a sample of development pr operties based on development 
appraisals. We assessed the classification of development 
properties and whether the methodology applied (i.e. investment o r 
residual method) was appropriat e. We also challenged the 
allowances in the valuation for developers’ profit;  
– We assessed the competence, independence and integrity of the 
external valuer; and  
– We performed audit procedures to assess the integrity of 
information provided to the independent valuer including 
agreement on a sample basis back to underlying lease agreement. 
Accounting for the acquisition of the Irish loan portfolio 
– Hammerson continued to implement its strategy of capital 
recycling, with a number of acquisitions and disposals completing 
during the year, the most significant of which was the acquisition of 
a 50% interest in an Irish loan portfolio at a cost of £690.2 million. 
The loan portfolio, which is in default, is secured on a number of 
prime Irish retail properties. Negoti ations to secure the consensual 
conversion of the loan portfolio into the retail properties are 
ongoing. The acquisition was undertaken by a joint venture set up 
by Hammerson and Allianz to acquire the Irish loan portfolio. The 
Group funded the acquisition through a loan provided to the joint 
venture of £690.2 million. 
– Hammerson’s accounting policy in respect of the transaction is 
detailed in note 1 on page 125. The complexity of the transaction, 
together with the unique nature of the asset from the Group’s 
perspective, result in increased ri sk of inaccurate presentation  
of the transaction. This includes initial recognition of the loans 
(including interest and transaction costs) at fair value together with 
accounting for credit risk and impairment indicators. 
  
– In respect of the acquisition of the Irish loan portfolio, we have 
reviewed the terms of the loan instruments acquired and assessed 
whether the Group’s accounting policy for the acquisition of the 
loans is in accordance with IAS39 ‘Financial Instruments 
Recognition and Measurement’. This included assessing, on 
acquisition, the initial fair valu e of the loans of the Irish loan 
portfolio and the loan provided to fund the acquisition. We also 
assessed the loan provided by the Group to the joint venture for 
credit risk and impairment indicators based on the valuation of the 
underlying properties; and 
– We tested the accuracy and completeness of the disclosures in the 
financial statements. 
Accounting for the investment in Value Retail  
– Hammerson’s interest in Value Retail (carrying value of  
£743.8 million) (31 December 20 14: £628.8 million) is equity 
accounted as an associate.  
– The valuation of the Group’s investment in Value Retail is primarily 
driven by the valuation of the Value Retail property portfolio of 
£3,333.1 million (31 December 2014: £2,835.4 million) of which 
Hammerson’s share is £1,095.0 million  
(31 December 2014: £884.7 million). This is subject to similar 
judgements to those of the Group’s property portfolio above, 
including future net operating income and capitalisation yields.  
– Other key balances which impact the valuation of the Group’s 
investment in Value Retail incl ude borrowings, deferred tax and 
derivative financial instruments.  
– Please see note 13 to the financial statements. 
  
– We planned the scope of the audit and instructed the auditor  
of Value Retail accordingly;  
– We met with the auditor, Value Retail management and the 
external valuer of the Value Retail property portfolio to discuss and 
challenge the valuation assumptions including future net operating 
income and capitalisation yields;  
– We assessed the competence, independence and integrity of the 
external valuer; and 
– We assessed the quality of the work performed by the auditor  
of Value Retail in the areas of borrowings, deferred tax and 
derivative financial instruments.

116  HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY 
– We determined materiality for the Group to be £40 million  
(2014: £30 million) 
– We reported all audit differences in excess of £0.8 million  
(2014: £0.6 million) 
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed  
or influenced. We use materiality b oth in planning the scope of our 
audit work and in evaluating the results of our work. 
We determined materiality for the Group to be £40 million (2014: 
£30 million), which is below 1% (2014: below 1%) of shareholders’ 
equity. We determined materiality based on shareholders’ equity  
as net asset value is a key performance indicator as it takes into 
consideration the valuation of the Group’s property portfolio and  
the investment in premium outlets. 
In addition to net assets, we cons ider EPRA Adjusted Profit Before 
Tax as a critical performance measure for the Group and a measure 
used within the Real Estate industry. We applied a lower threshold of 
£10.9 million (2014: £7.8 million) which equates to 5.1% (2014: 4.5%) 
of that measure for testing all balances impacting that measure. 
Group and component materiality 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the 
Committee all audit differences in ex cess of £0.8 million (2014:  
£0.6 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our 
view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to 
the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when 
assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
 
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT 
– We performed a full scope audit on the UK and French 
components. Value Retail and VIA Outlets were subject  
to audit of specific account balances. There is no change  
from 2014 
– All components were audited to component materiality 
which ranged from £10 million to £22 million  
(December 2014: £12.6 million to £16.5 million) 
– Together these four components account for 99% of the 
Group’s net assets and 100% of profit before tax 
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the 
Group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the group level. 
Based on that assessment, we focused our group audit scope 
primarily on the audit work at fo ur significant components being  
the UK, France, Value Retail and VIA Outlets (VIA) (2014: four). 
Together these components comprise 99% (2014: 99%) of the 
Group’s net assets and 100% (2014: 100%) of profit before tax.  
The UK and French components were subject to a full scope audit, 
whilst Value Retail (accounted for as an associate and audited by EY) 
and VIA (accounted for as a joint venture) were subject to an audit of 
specified account balances, where the extent of our testing was based 
on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the 
materiality of the Group’s operations at those components. The UK 
and French components account for 85% of net assets. Our audit 
work on Value Retail is specified in the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement section above. 
Our audit work at the four locations was executed at levels of 
materiality applicable to each in dividual entity which were lower 
than group materiality and ranged from £10 million to £22 million 
(2014: £12.6 million to £16.5 million). For those balances impacting 
Adjusted Profit Before Tax the materiality range was £2.6 million to 
£6.0 million (2014: £3.2 million to £4.35 million). 
The group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned 
visits that has been designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor  
or a senior member of the group audit team visits each of the 
locations where the group audit scope is focused at least once every 
two years. In years when we do not visit a significant component we 
will include the component audit team in our team briefing, discuss 
their risk assessment, and review documentation of the findings 
from their work. 
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process 
and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion  
that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the 
aggregated financial information of the remaining components not 
subject to audit or audit of specified account balances. We have 
obtained an understanding of the Gr oup’s system of internal controls 
and undertaken a combination of procedures, all of which are 
designed to target the Group’s identified risks of material 
misstatement in the most effective manner possible.

OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE 
COMPANIES ACT 2006 
In our opinion: 
– The part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in acco rdance with the Companies Act 
2006; and 
– The information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements  
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO 
REPORT BY EXCEPTION 
Adequacy of explanations received and  
accounting records 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion: 
– We have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or 
– Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
– The parent company financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns. 
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. 
Directors’ remuneration 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if, in 
our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have not 
been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited is not in agreement with th e accounting records and returns. 
We have nothing to report arising from these matters. 
Corporate Governance Statement 
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of  
the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review. 
Our duty to read other information in the  
Annual Report 
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual 
Report is: 
– Materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or 
– Apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in  
the course of performing our audit; or 
– Otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified 
any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the 
audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual 
Report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the Annual 
Report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated 
to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been 
disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such 
inconsistencies or misleading statements. 
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND 
AUDITOR 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, 
the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us 
to comply with the Auditing Practi ces Board’s Ethical Standards for 
Auditors. We also comply with International Standard on Quality 
Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim  
to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, 
understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include 
our dedicated professional standards review team and independent 
partner reviews. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body,  
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to  
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility  
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members  
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed. 
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS 
An audit involves obtaining ev idence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fr aud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness  
of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financia l statements. In addition, we read 
all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the co urse of performing the audit.  
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 
 
124  HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 
1:  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Statement of compliance 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS and interpretations adopted by the European 
Union. During 2015, the following new and revised Standards and 
Interpretations have been adopted but these have not affected the 
amounts reported in these financial statements: 
– Amendments to IAS19 Employee Benefits – Contributions from 
employees or third parties that are linked to service 
– Amendments to IFRS (Annual Im provements cycle 2010-2012) 
– Amendments to IFRS (Annual Improvements cycle 2011-2013) 
Issued, not yet effective and not yet endorsed for use in the 
European Union 
At the date of approval of these financial statements the following 
Standards and Interpretations relevant to the Group were in issue 
but not yet effective and in some cases had not been adopted for use 
in the European Union: 
– Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiatives; effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016 
– IFRS 9 Financial Instruments; effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2018 
– IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers; effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. 
These pronouncements, when applied, will either result in changes  
in presentation and disclosure, or are not expected to have a material 
impact on the financial statements.  
Basis of preparation 
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as 
explained in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section of the 
Strategic Report on page 67. 
The financial statements are presented in sterling. They are prepared 
on the historical cost basis, except that investment and development 
properties, other investments and derivative financial instruments 
are stated at fair value. 
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to the results, 
other gains and losses, assets, liabil ities and cash flows of entities 
included in the consolidated financial statements. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the 
estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period. If the 
revision affects both current and future periods, the change is 
recognised over those periods. 
Significant judgements and key estimates 
The preparation of the financial statements requires management  
to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that may affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The following accounting 
policies are the critical accounting policies of the Group. 
Property valuations 
The property portfolio, which is carried in the balance sheet at fair 
value, is valued six-monthly by professionally qualified external 
valuers and the Directors must ensure that they are satisfied that the 
valuation of the Group’s properties is appropriate for the accounts. 
Investment properties, excluding properties held for development, 
are valued by adopting the ‘inves tment method’ of valuation. This 
approach involves applying market-derived capitalisation yields to 
current and market-derived future income streams with appropriate 
adjustments for income voids arising from vacancies or rent-free 
periods. These capitalisation yields and future income streams are 
derived from comparable property and leasing transactions and are 
considered to be the key inputs in the valuation. Other factors that 
are taken into account in the valuations include the tenure of the 
property, tenancy details and ground and structural conditions. 
In the case of on-site developments, the approach applied is the 
‘residual method’ of valuation, which is the investment method of 
valuation as described above with a deduction for all costs necessary  
to complete the development, toget her with a further allowance for 
remaining risk, developers’ profit and purchasers’ costs. Properties 
held for future development are ge nerally valued by adopting the 
higher of the residual method of valuation allowing for all associated 
risks, or the investment method of valuation for the existing asset.  
Accounting for acquisitions 
Management must assess whether the acquisition of property 
through the purchase of a corporate vehicle should be accounted for 
as an asset purchase or a business combination. Where the acquired 
corporate vehicle contains significant assets or liabilities in addition 
to property, the transaction is accounted for as a business 
combination. Where there are no such significant items, the 
transaction is treated as an asset purchase.  
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition 
method. Any excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value 
of the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill, and reviewed 
annually for impairment. Any discount received or acquisition 
related costs are recognised in the income statement.

  HAMMERSON.COM 125 
Accounting for acquisition of Irish loan portfolio 
During the year, the Group acquired a joint venture interest in a 
portfolio of loans (“Irish loan portfolio”) which are secured on Irish 
retail assets. The Group funded the acquisition of the Irish loan 
portfolio by providing the joint venture with loans of £690.2 million. 
The loans were initially measured at fair value and have subsequently 
been measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, 
less any impairment. 
Accounting for joint ventures and associates 
The accounting treatment for joint ventures and associates requires  
an assessment to determine the degree of control or influence that 
the Group may exercise over them and the form of any control. The 
Group’s interest in its joint ventures is commonly driven by the 
terms of partnership agreements, whic h ensure that control is shared 
between the partners.  
Associates are those entities over which the Group is in a position  
to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control. 
REIT and SIIC status 
The Company has elected for UK REIT and French SIIC status.  
To continue to benefit from these tax regimes, the Group is required 
to comply with certain conditions as outlined in note 8A to the 
accounts. Management intends that the Group should continue  
as a UK REIT and French SIIC for the foreseeable future. 
Basis of consolidation 
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group. Control is 
assumed when the Group has the power to govern the financial  
and operating policies of an entity , or business, to benefit from its 
activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in  
the consolidated financial statements from the date that control 
commences until the date that control ceases. All intragroup 
transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated  
on consolidation. 
Joint ventures and associates 
The results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures and associates  
are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in joint 
ventures and associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as 
adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net 
assets of the joint venture or associate, less any impairment. Losses 
of a joint venture or associate in excess of the Group’s interest in that 
entity are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred 
legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of  
the entity. Loans to joint ventures and associates are separately 
presented from equity interests within the notes to the accounts.  
The Group eliminates upstream and downstream transactions with  
its joint ventures, including interest and management fees. 
Foreign currency 
Foreign currency transactions 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at 
exchange rates approximating to the exchange rate ruling at the date  
of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into 
sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date and, unless they  
relate to the hedging of the net in vestment in foreign operations, 
differences arising on translation are recognised in the  
income statement. 
Financial statements of foreign operations 
The assets and liabilities of foreig n operations, including goodwill  
and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated  
into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.  
The operating income and expenses of foreign operations are 
translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the year. 
Significant transactions, such as property sales, are translated at the 
foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of each transaction. The 
principal exchange rate used to translate foreign currency-
denominated amounts in the balance sheet is the rate at the end of 
the year, £1 = €1.357 (2014: £1 = €1.289). The principal exchange rate 
used for the income statement is the average rate, £1 = €1.378 (2014: 
£1 = €1.241). 
Net investment in foreign operations 
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net 
investment in foreign operations are taken to the translation reserve. 
They are released to the income statement upon disposal of the 
foreign operation. 
Receivables, payables and borrowings 
Trade and other receivables and payables 
Trade and other receivables and payables are initially measured at 
fair value, subsequently measured at amortised cost and, where the 
effect is material, discounted to reflect the time value of money. 
Loans receivable 
Loans receivable are financial assets which are initially measured  
at fair value, plus acquisition costs and are subsequently measured  
at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less  
any impairment. 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, after taking account 
of any discount on issue and attributable transaction costs. 
Subsequently, borrowings are held at amortised cost, such that 
discounts and costs are charged to the income statement over the 
term of the borrowing at a constant return on the carrying amount  
of the liability. 
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to economically 
hedge its exposure to foreign currency movements and interest rate 
risks. Hedge accounting is applied in respect of net investments in 
foreign operations and of debt raised in non-functional currencies. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value, 
which equates to cost and subsequently remeasured at fair value, 
with changes in fair value being included in the income statement, 
except that a gain or loss on the portion of an instrument that is an 
effective hedge is recognised in the hedging reserve.

1:  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
(CONTINUED) 
Finance costs 
Net finance costs 
Net finance costs include interest payable on borrowings, debt and  
loan facility cancellation costs, net of interest capitalised, interest 
receivable on funds invested, and changes in the fair value of 
derivative financial instruments. 
Capitalisation of interest 
Interest is capitalised if it is directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of development properties or the 
redevelopment of investment properties. Capitalisation commences 
when the activities to develop the property start and continues until 
the property is substantially ready for its intended use. Capitalised 
interest is calculated with reference to the actual rate payable on 
borrowings for development purposes or, for that part of the 
development cost financed out of general funds, at the average rate. 
Property portfolio 
Investment and development properties 
Investment properties are stated at fair value, being market value 
determined by professionally qualified external valuers, and changes  
in fair value are included in the income statement.  
Properties acquired with the intention of redevelopment are 
classified as development properties and stated at fair value, being 
market value determined by prof essionally qualified external 
valuers. Changes in fair value are included in the income statement. 
All costs directly associated with the purchase and construction  
of a development property are capitalised. When development 
properties are completed, they are reclassified as investment 
properties. Further details are given in note 11. 
Leasehold properties 
Leasehold properties that are leas ed out to tenants under operating 
leases are classified as invest ment properties or development 
properties, as appropriate, and included in the balance sheet at fair 
value. The obligation to the freeholder or superior leaseholder for the 
buildings element of the leasehold is included in the balance sheet  
at the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception. 
Payments to the freeholder or superior leaseholder are apportioned 
between a finance charge and a reduction of the outstanding liability. 
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term 
so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability. Contingent rents payable, such as rent 
reviews or those related to rental income, are charged as an expense 
in the period in which they are incurred. An asset equivalent to the 
leasehold obligation is recorded in the balance sheet within ‘Interests 
in leasehold properties’, and is amortised over the lease term. 
Tenant leases 
Management has exercised judgement in considering the potential 
transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership, in accordance with 
IAS 17 Leases, for properties leased to tenants and has determined 
that such leases are operating leases. 
Depreciation 
In accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property, no depreciation is 
provided in respect of investme nt and development properties, 
which are carried at fair value.  
Net rental income 
Rental income from investment property leased out under an 
operating lease is recognised in the income statement on a straight-
line basis over the lease term. Contingent rents, such as turnover 
rents, rent reviews and indexation, are recorded as income in the 
period in which they are earned. Rent reviews are recognised when 
such reviews have been agreed with tenants. Lease incentives and 
costs associated with entering into tenant leases are amortised over 
the lease term or, if the probability that the break option will be 
exercised is considered high, over the period to the first break option. 
Property operating expenses are expensed as incurred and any 
property operating expenditure not recovered from tenants through 
service charges is charged to the income statement. 
Gains or losses on the sale of properties 
Gains or losses on the sale of properties are taken into account on  
the completion of contract, and are calculated by reference to the 
carrying value at the end of the previous year, adjusted for 
subsequent capital expenditure. 
Plant and equipment  
Plant and equipment is stated at co st less accumulated depreciation. 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful life, which is generally between three 
and five years, or in the case of leasehold improvements, the  
lease term. 
Employee benefits 
Defined contribution pension plans 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans 
are charged to the income statement as incurred. 
Defined benefit pension plans 
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension 
plans comprises the amount of future benefit that employees have 
earned, discounted to determine a present value, less the fair value  
of the pension plan assets. The calculation is performed by a qualified 
external actuary using the projected unit credit method. Actuarial 
gains and losses are recognised in equity. Where the assets of a plan 
are greater than its obligation, the asset included in the balance sheet 
is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or 
reduction in future contributions to the plan. 
Share-based employee remuneration 
Share-based employee remuneration is determined with reference  
to the fair value of the equity inst ruments at the date at which they 
are granted and charged to the income statement over the vesting 
period on a straight-line basis. The fair value of share options is 
calculated using the binomial option pricing model and is dependent 
on factors including the exercise pric e, expected volatility, option life 
and risk-free interest rate. The fair value of the market-based 
element of the Long-Term Incentive Plans is calculated using the 
Monte Carlo Model and is dependent on factors including the 
expected volatility, vesting period and risk-free interest rate.

1:  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
(CONTINUED) 
Finance costs 
Net finance costs 
Net finance costs include interest payable on borrowings, debt and  
loan facility cancellation costs, net of interest capitalised, interest 
receivable on funds invested, and changes in the fair value of 
derivative financial instruments. 
Capitalisation of interest 
Interest is capitalised if it is directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of development properties or the 
redevelopment of investment properties. Capitalisation commences 
when the activities to develop the property start and continues until 
the property is substantially ready for its intended use. Capitalised 
interest is calculated with reference to the actual rate payable on 
borrowings for development purposes or, for that part of the 
development cost financed out of general funds, at the average rate. 
Property portfolio 
Investment and development properties 
Investment properties are stated at fair value, being market value 
determined by professionally qualified external valuers, and changes  
in fair value are included in the income statement.  
Properties acquired with the intention of redevelopment are 
classified as development properties and stated at fair value, being 
market value determined by prof essionally qualified external 
valuers. Changes in fair value are included in the income statement. 
All costs directly associated with the purchase and construction  
of a development property are capitalised. When development 
properties are completed, they are reclassified as investment 
properties. Further details are given in note 11. 
Leasehold properties 
Leasehold properties that are leas ed out to tenants under operating 
leases are classified as invest ment properties or development 
properties, as appropriate, and included in the balance sheet at fair 
value. The obligation to the freeholder or superior leaseholder for the 
buildings element of the leasehold is included in the balance sheet  
at the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception. 
Payments to the freeholder or superior leaseholder are apportioned 
between a finance charge and a reduction of the outstanding liability. 
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term 
so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability. Contingent rents payable, such as rent 
reviews or those related to rental income, are charged as an expense 
in the period in which they are incurred. An asset equivalent to the 
leasehold obligation is recorded in the balance sheet within ‘Interests 
in leasehold properties’, and is amortised over the lease term. 
Tenant leases 
Management has exercised judgement in considering the potential 
transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership, in accordance with 
IAS 17 Leases, for properties leased to tenants and has determined 
that such leases are operating leases. 
Depreciation 
In accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property, no depreciation is 
provided in respect of investme nt and development properties, 
which are carried at fair value.  
Net rental income 
Rental income from investment property leased out under an 
operating lease is recognised in the income statement on a straight-
line basis over the lease term. Contingent rents, such as turnover 
rents, rent reviews and indexation, are recorded as income in the 
period in which they are earned. Rent reviews are recognised when 
such reviews have been agreed with tenants. Lease incentives and 
costs associated with entering into tenant leases are amortised over 
the lease term or, if the probability that the break option will be 
exercised is considered high, over the period to the first break option. 
Property operating expenses are expensed as incurred and any 
property operating expenditure not recovered from tenants through 
service charges is charged to the income statement. 
Gains or losses on the sale of properties 
Gains or losses on the sale of properties are taken into account on  
the completion of contract, and are calculated by reference to the 
carrying value at the end of the previous year, adjusted for 
subsequent capital expenditure. 
Plant and equipment  
Plant and equipment is stated at co st less accumulated depreciation. 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful life, which is generally between three 
and five years, or in the case of leasehold improvements, the  
lease term. 
Employee benefits 
Defined contribution pension plans 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans 
are charged to the income statement as incurred. 
Defined benefit pension plans 
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension 
plans comprises the amount of future benefit that employees have 
earned, discounted to determine a present value, less the fair value  
of the pension plan assets. The calculation is performed by a qualified 
external actuary using the projected unit credit method. Actuarial 
gains and losses are recognised in equity. Where the assets of a plan 
are greater than its obligation, the asset included in the balance sheet 
is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or 
reduction in future contributions to the plan. 
Share-based employee remuneration 
Share-based employee remuneration is determined with reference  
to the fair value of the equity inst ruments at the date at which they 
are granted and charged to the income statement over the vesting 
period on a straight-line basis. The fair value of share options is 
calculated using the binomial option pricing model and is dependent 
on factors including the exercise pric e, expected volatility, option life 
and risk-free interest rate. The fair value of the market-based 
element of the Long-Term Incentive Plans is calculated using the 
Monte Carlo Model and is dependent on factors including the 
expected volatility, vesting period and risk-free interest rate.

Management fees 
Management fees are recognised in the period to which they relate. 
Performance fee related elements are recognised at the end of the 
performance period when the fee can be reliably estimated and is  
due for payment.  
Tax 
Tax is included in the income statement except to the extent that  
it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the 
related tax is recognised in equity.  
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the 
period, using tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date, together 
with any adjustment in respect of previous periods.  
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, 
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the 
amounts used for tax purposes. Th e following temporary differences 
are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes; the 
initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither 
accounting nor taxable profit; and differences relating to 
investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably  
not reverse in the foreseeable futu re. The amount of deferred tax 
provided is based on the expe cted manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax 
rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is 
settled or the asset is realised.  
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised.

3: SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS 
The factors used to determine the Group’s reportable segments ar e the geographic locations, UK and France, and sectors in which it operates, 
which are generally managed by separate teams and are the basis on which performance is assessed and resources allocated. Gross rental 
income represents the Group’s revenue from its tenants and customers. Net rental income is the principal profit measure used to determine 
the performance of each sector. Total assets are not monitored by segment and resource allocation is based on the distribution of property 
assets between segments. 
As stated in the Financial Review on page 53, management reviews the business principally on a proportionally consolidated basi s, except  
for its interests in premium outlets held through its investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets, where the Group has less day -to-day 
involvement in the financial performance and which have differen t operational characteristics compared with the Group’s propert y portfolio. 
The segmental analysis has been prepared on the basis that management uses to review the business, rather than on a statutory b asis. 
Property interests represent the Group’s non-wholly owned properti es which management proportionally consolidate when reviewing the 
performance of the business. For reconciliati on purposes the Reported Group figures, being wholly-owned properties, are shown i n the 
following tables.  
During the year, the Group acquired an interest in a loan portfo lio secured on retail properties located in Ireland in a 50% jo int venture. The  
loans did not generate any rental income in 2015, and at the balance sheet date the loan portfolio was included within current receivables on a 
proportionally consolidated basis, and is therefore not included in notes 3A and 3B. Note 3C includes the Group’s investment in the new Irish 
joint venture at 31 December 2015.

C:  Unrecognised deferred tax 
A deferred tax asset is not recognised for UK revenue tax losses and UK capital losses where thei r future utilisation is uncert ain. At  
31 December 2015, the total of such losses was £315 million (2014: £320 million) and £480 million (2014: £450 million) respecti vely, and  
the potential tax effect of these was £57 million (2014: £64 million) and £86 million (2014: £90 million) respectively.  
Deferred tax is not provided on potential gains on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures when the Group can control wh ether gains 
crystallise and it is probable that gains will not arise in the foreseeable future. At 31 December 2015, the total of such gain s was £290 million  
(2014: £250 million) and the potential tax effect before the offset of losses was £52 million (2014: £50 million).  
If a UK REIT sells a property within three years of completion of development, the REIT exemption will not apply. There were no such 
properties at 31 December 2015 or 2014. 
9:  DIVIDENDS  
The proposed final dividend of 12.8 pence per share was recommended by the Board on 12 February 2016 and, subject to approval b y 
shareholders, is payable on 29 April 2016 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 18 March 2016. 6.4 pence per share will  
be paid as a PID, net of withholding tax at the basic rate (cur rently 20%) if applicable, and 6.4 pence per share will be paid as a normal dividend. 
The Company will be offering a scrip dividend alternative and for shareholders who elect to receive this, the dividend will be treated entirely  
as a normal dividend. The aggregate amount of the 2015 final dividend is £100.4 million. This assumes no shareholders elect to receive the 
scrip dividend alternative and has been calculated using the total number of eligible shares outstanding at 31 December 2015.  
The interim dividend of 9.5 pence per shar e was paid on 1 October 2015 as a PID, net of withholding tax where appropriate. 
The total dividend for the year ended 31 December 2015 would be 22.3 pence per share (2014: 20.4 pence per share).

In the case of leasehold properties, valuations are net of any obligation to freeholders or superior leaseholders. To comply wi th IAS 40 and  
IAS 17 these obligations and the related leasehold assets are included in the balance sheet within ‘Obligations under finance l eases’ (note 21) 
and ‘Interests in leasehold properties’ respectively. Further information is provided in ‘Significant accounting policies’ on p age 126. 
Valuation fees are based on a fixed amount agreed between the Group and the valuers and are inde pendent of the portfolio value. Summaries 
of the valuers’ reports are available on the Company’s website: www.hammerson.com. 
As noted in ‘Significant judgements and key estimates’ on page 124, real estate valuations are complex, derived from data which is not widely 
publicly available and involve a degree of judgement. For these reasons, and consistent with EPRA’s guidance, we have classifie d the 
valuations of our property portfolio as Level 3 as defined by IF RS 13. Inputs to the valuations, some of which are ‘unobservabl e’ as defined by 
IFRS 13, include capitalisation yields (nominal equivalent yield) and market rental income (ERV). These inputs to the valuation s are analysed 
by segment in the valuation and rental data tables on pages 166 and 169 and the valuation change analysis in the Financial Revi ew on page 58. 
All other factors remaining constant, an increase in rental inco me would increase valuations, whilst increases in capitalisatio n yields and 
discount rates would result in a fall in values and vice vers a. However, there are interrelati onships between unobservable inputs as they are 
determined by market conditions. The existence of an increase of more than one unobservable input would augment the impact on v aluation. 
The impact on the valuation would be mitigated by the interrelationship between unobservable inputs moving in opposite directio ns. For 
example, an increase in rents may be offset by an increase in yield, resulting in no net impact on the valuation. A sensitivity analysis showing 
the impact on valuations of changes in yi elds and rental income is shown below.

in 2015 was 3.8% (2014: 4.7%). At 31 Dece mber 2014 the historic cost of investment and development properties was £3,830.0 mill ion  
(2014: £3,930.1 million). 
At 31 December 2015, the investment properties shown above included Monument Mall, Newcastle where a sale contract for a total value  
of £75 million had been exchanged in December 2015 and which co mpleted in January 2016. In addition, a sale contract was exchan ged in 
January 2016 for the sale of Villebon 2, Paris for a value of £117 million, with completion expected in March 2016.

The analysis above reflects the effect of currency and interest rate swaps in place at 31 December 2015 and 2014, further detai ls of which are 
set out in note 20. The interest rates shown are the weighted av erage for fixed rate borrowings. Floating rate borrowings bear interest based on 
LIBOR, with the exception of certain euro borrowings whose interest costs are linked to EURIBOR. 
20: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT 
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the Group’s business. Derivative financial instruments are 
used to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exch ange rates and interest rates, but are not employed for specula tive purposes. 
Further discussion of Treasury risks is set out in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section of the Strategic Report on page 65. The Group’s 
risk management policies and practices with regard to financial instruments are as follows: 
A: Debt management 
The Group generally borrows on an unsecured basis on the strength of its covenant in order to maintain operational flexibility. Borrowings  
are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to main tain short-term liquidity. Acqu isitions may be financed initi ally using 
short-term funds before being refinanced fo r the longer term when market conditions are appropriate. Short-term funding is rais ed 
principally through syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial in stitutions with which the Grou p maintains 
strong working relationships. Long-term debt mainly comprises the Group’s fixed rate unsecured bonds. 
B: Interest rate management 
Interest rate swaps are used to manage the interest rate basis of the Group’s debt, allowing changes from fixed to floating rat es or vice versa. 
Clear guidelines exist for the Group’s ratio of fixed to floating rate debt and management regularly reviews the interest rate profile against 
these guidelines. 
At 31 December 2015, the Group had interest rate swaps of £250.0 million (2014: £250.0 million), maturing in 2020 under which t he Group 
pays interest at a rate linked to LIBOR and receives interest at 6.875%. At 31 December 2015, the fair value of interest rate s waps was an asset 
of £13.8 million (2014: £15.0 million). The Group does not hedge account for its interest rate swaps and states them at fair va lue with changes 
in fair value included in the income statement. 
C: Foreign currency management 
The impact of foreign exchange movements is managed by financin g euro-denominated assets with euro borrowings. The Group borrow s in 
euro and uses currency swaps to match foreign currency assets with foreign currency liabilities. The Group also hedges the impa ct of foreign 
exchange movements in debt raised in fore ign currencies through the use of derivatives to swap the cash flows back to either st erling or euro.

C: Foreign currency management (continued) 
To manage the foreign currency exposure on its net investments in euro-denominated entities, the Group has designated all euro borrowings, 
including euro-denominated bonds, senior notes (USPP), bank loans and currency swaps, as net investment hedges. This designatio n allows 
exchange differences on hedging instruments to be recognised directly in equity and offset the exchange differences on net inve stments in  
euro-denominated entities also recognised in equity. The notional and carrying amount of these euro-denominated liabilities is shown below.

Notes 
1. The euro notional is the amount due at maturity without ne tting any receivable of different currency under the same instrume nt. 
2. The carrying amount is the book value at which euro denominated financial instruments are recognised within borrowings.  
3. The fair value of euro-denominated bonds at 31 December 2015 was £767.6 million (2014: £829.8 million). 
D: Profit and loss account and balance sheet management 
The Group maintains internal guidelines for interest cover, gear ing and other ratios. Management monitors the Group’s current a nd 
projected financial position against these gu idelines. Further details of these ratios are provided in the Financial Review on pages 53 to 61. 
E: Cash management and liquidity 
Cash levels are monitored to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet the Group’s operational requirements. Short-term money 
market deposits are used to manage liquidity while maximising th e rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to risk. Longer-
term liquidity requirements are met with an appropriate mix of short and longer-term debt as explained in note 20A.  
F: Credit risk 
The Group’s principal financial assets are trade receivables, restricted monetary assets, cash and deposits, balances due from joint ventures, 
other investments, loans receivable, participative loans to associates and derivative financial instruments. The Group’s credit risk is 
attributable to its trade receivables, restricted monetary assets , cash and deposits and derivative financial instruments. The credit risk on 
balances due from joint ventures, other investments, loans receivable and participative loans is limited as they are supported by investment 
properties held within the joint ventures and associates.  
Trade receivables consist principally of rents due from tenants. The balance is low relative to the scale of the balance sheet and the Group’s 
tenant base is diversified geographically, with tenants generally of good financial standing. The majority of tenant leases are long-term 
contracts with rents payable quarterly in advance. Rent deposits and personal or corporate guarantees are held in respect of some leases. 
Taking these factors into account, the risk to the Group of indi vidual tenant default and the cr edit risk of trade receivables are considered low. 
Trade receivables are presented net of allowances for doubtful re ceivables and allowances for impairment are made where appropr iate, as set 
out in note 15. The Group’s most significant tenants are set out in the Additional Disclosures section on page 168.  
The credit risk on cash and deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks, who are committed 
lenders to the Group, with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The credit risk on restricted monetary assets, 
being cash held by the Group and its managing agents on behalf of third parties, is si milarly considered low. At 31 December 20 15, the Group’s 
maximum exposure to credit risk was £335.8 million (2014: £243.5 million) which excludes those balances supported by investment properties.

H:  Sensitivity analysis 
In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Group’s earn ings. Over the 
longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings. The tables 
below provide indicative sensitivity data.

There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity. The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the i nterest rate 
change to the floating rate borrowings, net of interest rate swaps, at the year end.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 
 
160  HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 
A: ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Basis of accounting 
Although the consolidated Group accounts are prepared under IFRS, the Hammerson plc company accounts presented in this section are 
prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 (FRS101) “Reduced Disclosure Framework” as issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council. The prior year financial statements were prepar ed in accordance with UK GAAP and have been restated for mate rial 
adjustments on adoption of FRS101 in the current year. The last financial statements under a previous GAAP (UK GAAP) were for t he year 
ended 31 December 2014 and the date of transi tion to FRS101 was therefore 1 January 2014. 
There has been no movement in total equity due to the change in accounting framework from UK GAAP to FRS101. Movements in equit y are 
detailed within the statement of changes in equity on page 159. Previously unde r UK GAAP the Company’s derivatives were held at fair value

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 
 
160  HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 
A: ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Basis of accounting 
Although the consolidated Group accounts are prepared under IFRS, the Hammerson plc company accounts presented in this section are 
prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 (FRS101) “Reduced Disclosure Framework” as issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council. The prior year financial statements were prepar ed in accordance with UK GAAP and have been restated for mate rial 
adjustments on adoption of FRS101 in the current year. The last financial statements under a previous GAAP (UK GAAP) were for t he year 
ended 31 December 2014 and the date of transi tion to FRS101 was therefore 1 January 2014. 
There has been no movement in total equity due to the change in accounting framework from UK GAAP to FRS101. Movements in equit y are 
detailed within the statement of changes in equity on page 159. Previously unde r UK GAAP the Company’s derivatives were held at fair value 
and the investments in subsidiary companies and other related unde rtakings at valuation. Consequently there has been no effect on the 
balance sheet as a result of the change in accounting framework. 
The financial statements are presented in sterling. They are prepar ed on the historical cost basis, except that the investments in subsidiary 
companies and other related undertakings are included at valuation. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration 
given in exchange for the goods and services.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT PRESENTATION OF INFORMATION
As explained in the Financial Review on page 53 and consistent with the presentation in the Business Review, management reviews the 
performance of the business on a proportionally consolidated basis, including the Group’s share of Property interests, but excluding the 
Group’s interest in premium outlets held through investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets. This is because the Group has less 
day-to-day involvement in the operational activities and the premium outlets sector has different operational characteristics compared 
with the Group’s other property sectors. The information in the following tables has been prepared on this basis and further details of the 
definitions for information contained within this section can be found in the Glossary on pages 181 and 182.

* The calculation methodology has been amended to adjust for inclusive lease costs recovered through rent. This amendment is in line with EPRA best practice.
Staff costs amounting to £1.9 million (2014: £1.5 million) have been capitalised as development costs and are excluded from table 106.  
Our business model for developments is to use a combination of in-house staff and external advisers. The cost of external advisers is 
capitalised to the cost of developments. The cost of staff working on developments is generally expensed, but is capitalised subject to 
meeting certain criteria related to the degree of time spent on and the stage of progress of specific projects.

TEN-YEAR FINANCIAL SUMMARY SUMMARY OF DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy was approved at the 2014 Annual General Meeting and the summary below is presented for ease of 
reference. The Remuneration Policy is reproduced in full in the 2013 Annual Report (pages 74 to 86) and can be found on the Company’s 
website www.hammerson.com. The summary below should be read in the context of the full Remuneration Policy, which contains 
footnotes that form part of the Remuneration Policy and help to explain elements of the Remuneration Policy.
Summary of approach to Remuneration Policy
Objective To attract, retain and motivate quality leaders capable of making a major contribution to the Company’s 
success whilst avoiding paying more than the Remuneration Committee considers necessary. 
Implementation The Remuneration Committee considers a variety of factors, including remuneration packages available at 
comparable companies, overall Company performance, internal relativities, achievement of corporate 
objectives, individual performance and experience, published views of institutional investors and general 
market trends and performance.
Performance-related 
elements
Generally, two-thirds of Executive Director total target remuneration (excluding pension and benefits) is 
considered to be appropriate.
Limits and flexibility Sufficient flexibility is retained to act in the interests of shareholders and the Company. Limits will not lead 
to pressure on reward levels and the Remuneration Committee adopts a suitably conservative approach.
Executive Directors’ Remuneration
Element and overview Opportunity
Base Salary
 – Paid monthly in cash in 
arrears
 – Pensionable
 – Reviewed annually by 
the Remuneration 
Committee
Subject to a maximum of £850,000 per annum.
Reviews account for factors such as market conditions, salary increases to other Group employees and 
comparison against both a relevant property peer group and a market capitalisation group selected by the 
Remuneration Committee. 
Benchmarking considers base salary as well as total remuneration and is generally within  
(but is not constrained by) a range of +/- 10% of median.
Benefits
 – Contractual and 
non-contractual as 
appropriate and 
consistent with local 
market practice
 – Non-pensionable
 – Where provided by  
third parties, cost 
covered by the Company 
at market rates
Subject to an aggregate maximum of £100,000 per annum as measured by the individual’s P11D tax 
calculation (or local equivalent for non-UK Executive Directors). The maximum is increased  
annually by RPI.
Benefits include a car allowance or company car, private medical insurance (to include spouse/life partner), 
permanent health insurance and life assurance.
Hammerson France employees may receive additional benefits including a seniority allowance and an 
employer’s contribution of up to €2,000 per annum to an employee savings scheme.
Relocation benefits may include global relocation support (maximum £400,000) and/or tax equalisation 
arrangements across all elements of remuneration.
Whilst not considered by the Remuneration Committee to be a benefit in the normal sense, Directors may 
participate in corporate hospitality (including travel and, where appropriate, with a family member) 
whether paid for by the Company or another, within its agreed policies.
Pension
 – Non-contributory 
allowance subject to a 
maximum threshold
 – Salary supplements are 
non-pensionable and do 
not qualify for AIP or 
LTIP entitlements
 – No compensation for 
public policy or tax 
changes
 – Company will comply 
with any local legal 
obligations in respect  
of pensions
An allowance (Pension Choice) paid as a combination of any or all of the following, but subject to an 
aggregate limit of 30% of base salary:
 – Employer contribution to the Company’s defined contribution pension plan;
 – Payment to a Self-Invested Personal Pension Plan; and
 – A salary supplement.
Jean-Philippe Mouton receives a salary supplement and participates in a legacy collective supplementary 
defined contribution retirement plan operated by his French employing company, which makes employer 
contributions at the annual statutory limit.
Pension arrangements are kept under review to ensure they remain appropriate.

Annual Incentive Plan 
(AIP) with deferral 
under the Deferred 
Bonus Share Scheme 
(DBSS)
 – Annual performance-
based award paid as a 
mixture of cash and 
deferred shares
 – Awards subject to 
continued employment 
save in the leaver 
circumstances per the 
Remuneration Policy*
 – Deferred shares are 
subject to leaver 
conditions per the 
Remuneration Policy* 
 – Non-pensionable
Award:
 – Maximum opportunity is currently 200% of base salary. The Remuneration Committee reserves the 
power to increase this to a maximum of 300%. Increases above 200% would only occur after appropriate 
consultation with shareholders.
Performance:
 – Measures and conditions are set annually by the Remuneration Committee. Performance conditions are 
assessed over a period of one year and may consist of a combination of financial measures (at Group or 
divisional level), operational measures and individual performance objectives.
 – The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to include such other measures as it considers to be an 
appropriate means of assessing performance. Other than in exceptional circumstances, performance 
measures and conditions, once set, will generally remain unchanged for the year. 
 – No further performance targets apply to the deferred shares element, as this represents previously-
earned bonuses.
 – The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to amend the vesting level (up or down) where 
considered appropriate but not so as to exceed the maximum bonus potential.
Deferred shares element:
 – Representing at least 40% of the total award and delivered under the DBSS (but may be delivered under  
a different plan with equivalent terms).
 – Deferred shares are structured as nil-cost share options with a deferral period of no less than two years. 
Participants are entitled to a dividend equivalent for the period from the grant date until the vesting date, 
delivered as additional shares upon transfer.
Clawback and malus:
 – Provisions cover personal misconduct and/or where accounts or information relevant to performance are 
shown to be materially wrong resulting in the payment of a higher bonus than should have been the case.
Long Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP)
 – Discretionary annual 
award
 – Subject to continued 
employment, save in the 
leaver circumstances per 
the Remuneration 
Policy*
 – Non-pensionable
Award:
 – Maximum discretionary award up to a value of 200% of base salary. In exceptional circumstances, the 
Remuneration Committee can increase this to 300%. The extent of vesting is determined by the 
performance conditions.
 – Normally structured as nil-cost share options but can take other forms. Participants are entitled to a 
dividend equivalent for the period from the grant date to the vesting date, delivered as additional shares 
upon transfer. The Remuneration Committee has discretion to settle awards as cash.
Performance:
 – Minimum performance period of three years. In practice, the Remuneration Committee has determined 
that the minimum period should be four years.
 – Consisting of a combination of financial and non-financial measures, the Remuneration Committee has 
discretion to amend: 
 – The performance measures and/or conditions used; and/or
 – The weighting of each for future awards; and/or
 – The performance measurement periods.
 – Performance conditions in respect of outstanding awards can be amended due to exceptional 
circumstances, provided that the amendment is not materially less difficult to satisfy.
Vesting:
 – Vesting under each performance condition is on a straight-line basis with no more than 25% vesting at 
threshold performance.
Clawback and malus:
 – Provisions cover personal misconduct and/or where accounts or information relevant to performance are 
shown to be materially wrong and vesting was higher than should have been the case.

There is no formal sanction for non-compliance.

Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration
Element and overview Opportunity
Fees
 – Paid monthly in arrears  
in cash 
 – Non-pensionable
 – Reviewed periodically
The Chairman’s fee is determined by the Remuneration Committee. Other Non-Executive Director fees are 
determined by the Board on the recommendation of the Executive Directors. 
Aggregate total annual fees to Non-Executive Directors are subject to the limit in the Company’s Articles of 
Association. The Remuneration Committee may provide additional fees within the stated limit including for 
membership of any additional Board committees that may be established.
Fees to the Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors are intended to be competitive with other fully 
listed companies of equivalent size and complexity, but are not set by reference to a prescribed benchmark.  
Periodic reviews take into account independent advice and the time commitment required of Non-
Executive Directors.
Expenses The Company may reimburse travel and accommodation expenses (including to the Company’s London 
office) and may settle the liability from any assessment to tax made on such reimbursement.
Additional fees The Chairman receives no additional fee for membership of any of the Committees.
Other Non-Executive Directors may receive additional fees for membership and/or chairmanship of the 
Remuneration and Audit Committees. An additional fee is payable to the Senior Independent Director. The 
level of additional fees is set to reflect the responsibilities of the role.
Other benefits No other benefits are currently available to any of the Non-Executive Directors. 
The Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for performance-related bonuses or participation in the  
Company’s share plans.
The Non-Executive Directors may participate in corporate hospitality (including travel and, where 
appropriate, with a family member) whether paid for by the Company or another, within its agreed policies.
 A departing gift may be provided up to a value of £5,000 (plus related taxes) per Non-Executive Director on 
termination of office.
Summary of Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued
176 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 Service agreements: new Executive Directors
Overview The Committee’s approach is for new Executive Directors to have service agreements that have regard to 
market practice at the date of appointment. Terms summarised below will be subject to any local statutory 
(or collective bargaining) requirements where applicable.
Expiry date and notice 
period
No fixed expiry date. Either party may terminate an appointment by providing 12 months’ notice. A longer 
initial notice period may be applied by the Company to new appointments for a limited time if the 
Remuneration Committee considers this appropriate.
Retirement date No default retirement date. Retirement requests are considered on a case-by-case basis and 12 months’ 
notice is anticipated.
Post-termination 
restrictions
To protect the Group’s confidential information for an appropriate period and to prevent poaching of the 
Group’s senior workforce and its customer and supplier connections for 12 months after termination.
Payment in lieu of notice 
(PILON)
Employment can be terminated immediately by paying a PILON comprising base pay, pension, medical 
insurance and car allowance. A PILON will not apply on termination for gross misconduct, in which case no 
compensation will be due. The Company has discretion to pay on a phased basis, subject to mitigation.
Change of control and 
liquidated damages
No right to liquidated damages on a change of control.
Other appointments External non-executive appointments that do not lead to a conflict of interest are permitted with the 
consent of the Company’s Board of Directors on the basis that such appointments can enhance experience 
and skills and add value to the Company. Fees for external appointments can be retained, except where the 
appointment is as the Company’s representative.
Appointment terms: new Non-Executive Directors
Overview The Chairman and Non-Executive Director appointments are governed by letters of appointment. 
Appointments are for a term of three years. Letters of appointment are reviewed by the Chairman and the 
Executive Directors every three years.
Notice period and 
termination
No less than three months’ notice must be given by either party. Immediate termination can occur should a 
conflict of interest arise and appointments will cease automatically at an Annual General Meeting where a 
Non-Executive Director is not re-elected.
Fees on termination Entitlement is limited to such fees as have accrued at the date of termination, together with the 
reimbursement of expenses properly incurred prior to that date.
Payment for loss of office: Executive Directors
AIP Where notice of termination is given by either the Company or the Executive Director prior to the end of the 
performance period, or employment ceases due to death, ill-health, injury or disability; bonus entitlement 
remains, subject to performance conditions. Any bonus payable is pro-rated, unless the Remuneration 
Committee decides otherwise. 
Where employment ceases after the end of the performance period, but prior to payment, entitlement to 
any bonus payment remains if the reasons for employment ceasing are as above but also where the reason 
for employment ceasing is retirement, redundancy or sale of the company or business for which the 
Executive Director works.
Unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise at its discretion, no bonus is payable in other 
circumstances.
DBSS (deferred share 
element of AIP)
Deferred share awards lapse where an Executive Director resigns or gives notice; although the 
Remuneration Committee has discretion to treat the Executive Director as a good leaver. Deferred share 
awards lapse where dismissal is for cause. Otherwise, share awards vest in full on the normal vesting date. 
The Remuneration Committee can decide to accelerate vesting.
LTIP Good leaver status will be given where employment ceases due to death, retirement, ill-health, injury  
or disability, redundancy or the sale of the company or business for which he works and awards will vest on 
the normal vesting date. Awards remain subject to performance conditions and will be time pro-rated 
unless the Remuneration Committee decides otherwise. The Remuneration Committee can decide to 
accelerate vesting. 
Where employment ceases for any other reason, the Remuneration Committee retains discretion to treat 
the Executive Director as a good leaver.

178 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 UK Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) taxation
As a UK REIT, Hammerson plc is exempt from corporation tax  
on rental income and gains on UK investment properties but is 
required to pay Property Income Distributions (PIDs). UK 
shareholders will be taxed on PIDs received at their full marginal 
tax rates. A REIT may in addition pay normal dividends.
For most shareholders, PIDs will be paid after deducting 
withholding tax at the basic rate. However, certain categories of 
shareholder are entitled to receive PIDs without withholding tax, 
principally UK resident companies, UK public bodies, UK pension 
funds and managers of ISAs, PEPs and Child Trust Funds. Further 
information on UK REITs is available on the Company’s website, 
including a form to be used by shareholders to certify if they 
qualify to receive PIDs without withholding tax. 
Unsolicited mail
Hammerson is obliged by law to make its share register available 
on request to other organisations. This may result in shareholders 
receiving unsolicited mail. To limit the receipt of unsolicited mail 
shareholders may register with the Mailing Preference Service, an 
independent organisation whose services are free, by visiting 
www.mpsonline.org.uk. Once a shareholder’s name and address 
details have been registered, it will advise the companies and other 
bodies that subscribe to the service not to send unsolicited mail to 
the address registered. 
Shareholder security
Share fraud includes scams where fraudsters cold-call investors 
offering them overpriced, worthless or non-existent shares, or 
offer to buy shares owned by investors at an inflated price. We 
advise shareholders to be vigilant of unsolicited mail or telephone 
calls regarding buying or selling shares. For more information 
visit: www.fca.org.uk/scams or call the FCA Consumer Helpline 
on 0800 111 6768.
Capita share dealing services
An online and telephone dealing facility is available, providing 
shareholders with an easy-to-access and simple-to-use service. 
There is no need to pre-register and there are no complicated 
forms to fill in. The online and telephone dealing service allows 
shareholders to trade ‘real time’ at a known price that will be given 
to them at the time they give their instruction. This is subject to a 
credit check for shareholders dealing in shares valued at more
