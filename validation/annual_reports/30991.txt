The Global Leader  
in pharmacovigilance.
In order to move from a major independent 
pharmacovigilance provider to the world’s 
#1 pharmacovigilance provider, we plan to 
take the following strategic steps:
1   Increase investment in people, attracting  
the best talent worldwide, and fostering 
talent/personal growth within our 
organisation.
2  Incr ease investment in technology, 
becoming a leader in process automation 
and the use of artificial intelligence in our 
services.
3  Increase growth, both organically and 
through acquisitions, resulting in a larger 
presence in major markets, and achieving 
further benefits from economies of scale. 
People
PrimeVigilance’s reputation is built 
on the quality of its people. The 
senior leadership team includes 
leading pharmacovigilance experts 
and former senior regulators 
with over 300 years of combined 
industry experience. 
Fundamental to its medic-led  
approach, PrimeVigilance 
employs 44 physicians and over 
300 pharmacists and other 
life sciences professionals. Its 
network of Qualified Persons in 
Pharmacovigilance (QPPV) is the 
most extensive in Europe and 
includes 16 in-house and over 100 
outsourced professionals covering 
60 countries.
The CEO of PrimeVigilance, Dr Jan 
Petracek, is the former Head of  
Risk Management at the European 
Medicines Agency and has, 
and continues to, contribute to 
many national and international 
guidelines.
Technology (automation)
PrimeVigilance has long had a 
technology driven approach to 
pharmacovigilance with speed, 
consistency and accuracy being  
the goal. Adverse event case 
processing can be executed either 
in an in-house validated database 
or in the client’s own database, as 
required. PrimeVigilance is able to 
offer case processing in either of 
the two leading global databases.
More recently, PrimeVigilance has 
been identified as an industry 
leader in the deployment of robotic 
process automation (RPA) software 
in routine pharmacovigilance 
processes. In pilots, PrimeVigilance 
has been able to demonstrate 
very significant improvements in 
efficiency through time savings  
and in accuracy.
PrimeVigilance’s strategy is to 
continue to invest in technology 
to drive efficiency, enhance quality 
and, as a result, competitiveness.

by its innovative Study Site Management model and the use of Study Physician Teams 
resulting in a closer relationship between Ergomed and the physicians involved in 
clinical trials. As well as providing high quality clinical development services, Ergomed 
is building a portfolio of co-development partnerships with pharma and biotech 
companies which share the risks and rewards of drug development. Ergomed leverages 
its expertise and services in return for carried interest in the drugs under development.
OUR KEY DIFFERENTIATORS  8 Ergomed plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Haemostatix has developed a new class of 
peptide based coagulant, or ‘haemostat’, 
for the control of bleeding in surgery.
The Company has pioneered a new approach to haemostasis 
that is based on a peptide that binds to the protein fibrinogen, 
inducing the rapid and targeted formation of clots. This 
innovative technology platform is being used to develop a 
pipeline of topical products to treat surgical bleeding with 
further applications in tissue repair and regenerative medicine.
Surgical bleeding and its markets
The haemostat market is worth $2.5Bn and is expanding 
globally at 6 to 8% per annum. Growth in several market 
segments, and emerging economies has exceeded 10% 
per annum. The market leader is blood derived thrombin, a 
relatively fragile molecule requiring storage in a dry or frozen 
form. Haemostatix’s peptide-based coagulants are blood-free, 
have greater stability enabling the formulation of ready-to-use 
liquids and gels, and have a mode of action that is faster than 
thrombin-mediated clotting.

PeproStat™
Reduced time to

1.6 minutes versus 
standard of care.
PRODUCT PIPELINE
PeproStat™ Liquid
A topical liquid haemostat that is applied to wounds to 
control bleeding during surgery. PeproStat has a novel 
mode of action that is fast and effective. The peptide-
based coagulant is manufactured from blood-free 
components and is formulated as a ready-to-use solution, 
to be used with commercially available resorbable 
sponges. Current products are typically blood-derived 
and often require re-constitution or thawing prior to use. 
Positive PeproStat Phase II results
In October 2017, we announced positive Phase II results 
of PeproStat in surgical bleeding. The trial met its primary 
endpoint and was completed approximately six months 
ahead of schedule. PeproStat showed a reduction in time 
to haemostasis by 1.6 minutes compared with standard 
of care time to haemostasis of 5.8 minutes. It also met 
key secondary endpoints and was highly rated by 
investigators. No treatment related serious adverse events 
or re-bleeding were observed. These results reinforce 
PeproStat’s potential as a safe, blood-free, ready-to-use 
and cost-effective method of controlling bleeding during 
surgery.
HXP12 ReadyFlow™ 
A flowable gel-based haemostat that is applied with a 
syringe and nozzle enabling less accessible wounds to be 
treated, as well as wounds with uneven surfaces. HXP12 
ReadyFlow is composed of a heat-stable peptide active 
substance mixed with a transparent particulate gel and 
pre-filled in a ready-to-use syringe. Current products 
in this rapidly expanding market segment require eight 
preparation steps prior to use, are blood derived, and 
opaque, obscuring the wound site. HXP12 ReadyFlow 
won first prize in the pan European Emerging Technology 
Competition run by the Royal Society of Chemistry.

PARTNERSHIPS
Ergomed has developed an innovative  
model for sustainable drug development  
and is a source of potential upside.
Ergomed has established a portfolio of co-development 
partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotech companies.  
By reducing service fees, Ergomed has secured either a  
share in future revenues derived from the product or, in the 
case of single product companies, an equity stake in the 
partner company.
The Ergomed team screen up to 100 co-development 
candidates in any given year and may carry out detailed  
due diligence on a dozen or less with a view to concluding 
one or two deals per annum.
Expansion of the co-development pipeline will not be a 
strategic priority for the Company going forward.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
FOCUSED
ON STRATEGY
2017 saw continued very strong performance 
for Ergomed in the services business and 
particularly in the Drug Safety and Medical 
Information business. The Board sees this 
area and specialist CRO services such as 
orphan drug development as significant 
opportunities where Ergomed can take 
global leadership positions and continue 
to grow.
The appointment of Stephen Stamp as CEO and Dr Jan 
Petracek as COO was a catalyst for the re-aligned Board to 
review Ergomed’s growth opportunities and set strategic 
priorities which will see greater focus on the services business 
and a targeting of the Company’s resources at those areas.
The co-development pipeline continues to represent a 
differentiator for the CRO business and is a source of 
potential upside but with increased focus on the services 
business, expansion of the pipeline will not be a strategic 
priority. Having delivered strong Phase II clinical trial results 
for PeproStat, the Company intends to pursue further 
development of the Haemostatix assets through partnerships 
and collaborations.
The integration of pharmacovigilance services under the 
PrimeVigilance brand, which commenced during 2017, was 
successfully completed in 2018 and the acquisition of PSR, a 
specialist orphan CRO, contribute to a firm foundation for the 
Company’s strategic priorities. 
I look forward to further progress this year and in the future.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
DELIVERING ON GROWTH
I am pleased to report on another year of 
strong growth in our service businesses and 
one which has also seen clinical success. We 
see significant opportunities to build on the 
foundations we have established in high-
growth areas within the pharmaceutical 
services market and, specifically, to take 
leadership positions in pharmacovigilance 
and orphan drug development services. We 
believe this will deliver further growth and 
shareholder value in the future.
Services
Overall it was a strong year within the services businesses. 
New business won in 2017 of £54 million, up 29% on 2016, 
helped drive net service revenue growth of 36% to £39.6 
million. Total service revenue, including reimbursement 
revenue, increased 21% to £47.6 million.
EBITDA (adjusted) for the year was £2.8 million compared 
with £2.8 million in 2016. R&D expense, related to the 
development of the Haemostatix products, was £2.7 million 
in 2017 and £1.2 million in 2016. The EBITDA (adjusted) of our 
services businesses (excluding R&D) was £5.5 million in 2017 
compared with £4.0 million in 2016.
Drug Safety & Medical Information (DS&MI)
The DS&MI business, which comprises the PrimeVigilance and 
PharmInvent companies, performed exceptionally strongly. Net 
service revenue from the DS&MI segment, increased 68% to 
£22.2 million in 2017 from £13.3 million in 2016. Excluding the 
PharmInvent acquisition (completed in November 2016), organic 
growth of the DS&MI segment was 35%. 
PharmInvent was acquired in November 2016, and 
immediately successfully collaborated with PrimeVigilance 
to provide a comprehensive pharmacovigilance service 
offering to existing and new clients of both companies. The 
integration was completed early in 2018, with both companies 
now operating under the PrimeVigilance brand led by Dr Jan 
Petracek. PrimeVigilance now employs over 450 employees 
with hubs in Guildford, UK; Belgrade, Serbia; Prague, Czech 
Republic; Boston, USA; and Zagreb, Croatia.
PrimeVigilance, which is already a significant investor in 
information technology, has initiated the implementation of 
robotic process automation for certain routine pharmacovigilance 
processes, resulting in significant improvements in efficiency and 
accuracy. PrimeVigilance’s strategy of investing in people and 
technology is designed to drive further growth with the aim of 
becoming the global leader in pharmacovigilance by 2020. The 
global pharmacovigilance market is forecast to grow to more than  
$8Bn by 2024 from around $3Bn in 2015, with contract 
outsourcing forecast to expand from around 30% of the market 
in 2015 to approximately 50% in 2024. (Source: Global Market 
Insights 2016.)
Contract Research Services (CRS)
Net service revenue from the CRS segment increased 9% to 
£17.4 million in 2017 from £15.9 million in 2016. Excluding the 
PSR acquisition (October 2017), organic growth was 3%.
Consistent with our acquisition strategy of adding specialist 
skills and/or geographic coverage, PSR was acquired in 
October 2017 for a total consideration of up to €5.7 million 
(£5.1 million). PSR is a specialist contract research organisation 
based in The Netherlands that specialises in the development 
of orphan drugs for rare diseases. Orphan drug development 
is a growing area, with up to 30 million people worldwide 
estimated to suffer from rare diseases (Source: Evaluate 
Pharma Orphan Drug Report 2017). The logistical, regulatory 
and operational complexities associated with orphan drug 
trials require specialised approaches. PSR, combined with 
Ergomed’s site management organisation and study physician 
groups, is ideally suited for efficient management of these 
types of trials.
The Company’s goal is to become the leading global contract 
research organisation for orphan drug development and, 
overall, to continue to outpace the market for clinical 
research services.

Product development
Co-development
A new co-development deal with Allergy Therapeutics plc 
(LSE: AGY) was announced in December 2017.The multi-
study co-development partnership is aimed at supporting the 
commercialisation of Allergy Therapeutics’ OraiVac platform 
and could include studies of three OraiVac products.
The Company also announced the following updates during 
the year:
  Ferrer: In February 2017, Ferrer announced data from the 
successful Phase II study of lorediplon in insomnia.
  Aeterna Zentaris (NASDAQ: AEZS; TSX: AEZ): In May 
2017, Aeterna Zentaris announced termination of their 
programme after Zoptrex™ showed no treatment benefit 
over doxorubicin control.
  CEL-SCI (NYSE: CVM): The FDA lifted the clinical hold for 
Multikine® in August 2017 and the Phase III study in head 
and neck cancer is continuing as initially planned.
We believe our co-development pipeline continues to offer 
potential upside as programmes progress and move towards 
commercialisation. However, as we increase our focus on the 
opportunities within our service businesses to take leadership 
positions in high-growth markets, the Board has concluded 
that expanding the co-development pipeline is no longer 
a strategic priority for the Company. We do not anticipate 
announcing new co-development deals, unless material, but 
will continue to benefit from our experience and ability to 
engage in co-development selectively as a differentiator for 
our CRO offering.
Haemostatix
In October, the Company announced positive Phase II results 
of PeproStat in surgical bleeding, the first product to come 
from the Haemostatix portfolio. The trial met its primary 
endpoint and was completed approximately six months ahead 
of schedule. PeproStat showed time to haemostasis of 4.2 
minutes, a reduction of 1.6 minutes compared with standard 
of care time to haemostasis of 5.8 minutes. It also met key 
secondary endpoints and was highly rated by investigators. 
No treatment related serious adverse events or re-bleeding 
were observed. These results reinforce PeproStat’s potential 
as a safe, blood-free, ready-to-use and cost-effective method 
of controlling bleeding during surgery.
The second product, HXP12 ReadyFlow™, a flowable gel, is 
proceeding with preclinical development and is expected to 
be ready for Phase I in 2018.
A license for rights to PeproStat and HXP12 ReadyFlow in 
South Korea was signed in October 2017.
The Company’s strategy is to pursue further development 
of the Haemostatix assets through partnerships and 
collaborations. We anticipate further modest investment in 
R&D related to Haemostatix during 2018, in line with current 
market expectations. 
Outlook
A contracted backlog of £88 million underpins Ergomed’s 
ability to deliver its targets for 2018. Drug safety and medical 
information services make up an increasing proportion of our 
overall revenues and owing to their greater predictability and 
exceptional growth we benefit from greater visibility than with 
clinical research services which, although capable of attractive 
margins are lumpy by nature and highly competitive.
More generally during the coming period we expect to 
continue to deliver on our strategy of focusing on the growth 
and profitability of our services businesses, supplemented by 
acquisitions that expand the services offering or geographical 
coverage, or both.

GROWTH
Building a profitable services

leadership in pharmacovigilance 
services and orphan drug 
development by 2020.
OUR MISSION
The Board continually looks for 
opportunities to capitalise on 
Ergomed’s expertise with the 
following key components:
Augment the organic growth of its services 
business with selective acquisitions to add 
complementary services and/or geographical 
coverage to the Company’s current offering. 
The Board is committed to pursuing both
components of the growth strategy in parallel and
maintaining a balance between services income
and development costs.

Optimise value
Growth must be the foundation of any healthy
company and is the primary focus of the Board. We
constantly measure ourselves against prior period
performance and against our peers and competitors.
The market for out-sourced clinical research is
relatively mature and is dominated by mainly large
US-based companies. To compete effectively, we
must play to our strengths, including our innovative
Study Site Management model, and utilise our Study
Physician Group to competitive advantage.
The market for out-sourced pharmacovigilance and
medical information, while smaller, is less competitive.
PrimeVigilance is a leading independent pharmacovigilance 
and medical information provider in Europe.
Services acquisitions are a key component of
Ergomed’s growth strategy with an emphasis on: 
  Services and skills which complement our existing 
services. We can offer a broader (‘one-stop-shop’) suite 
of services to customers, reducing reliance on partners 
and expanding margins. 
  Geographical expansion. Although we have preferred 
subcontract providers in some markets, having our own 
presence in certain key markets ensures quality control, 
scalability and, again, enhanced margins.
The co-development pipeline continues to represent a 
differentiator for the CRO business and is a source of 
potential upside but with increased focus on the services 
business, expansion of the pipeline will not be a strategic 
priority.
The Company’s strategy is to optimise the value of the 
Haemostatix assets by pursuing their further development 
through partnerships and collaborations.

STRATEGY IN ACTION
Acquisition of PSR Group BV,  
a specialist orphan drug CRO.
Overview
The acquisition is consistent with Ergomed’s  
strategy to grow its existing, profitable services business 
both organically and through bolt on acquisitions. PSR’s 
extensive expertise in orphan drug development complements 
Ergomed’s services and will further strengthen Ergomed’s 
orphan drug development capability in addition to expanding 
its current services portfolio.
The acquisition
PSR was acquired in October 2017 for up to €5.7 million, 
including initial consideration of €3.2 million. Ergomed’s 
strategy is to continue to grow PSR’s global orphan drug 
development business under the PSR brand and will remain 
focused on its two divisions: (1) PSR Orphan Experts, which is 
a leading expert in supporting biotech and pharma companies 
with their regulatory and clinical development of orphan 
drugs; and (2) PSR Pharma Resource, which complements 
PSR Orphan Experts as a niche staffing provider, focused on 
orphan drug specialised staff.
Background
PSR, established in 1998, and based in The Netherlands, is 
a specialist orphan drug CRO and recognised as a leading 
expert in rare diseases. PSR specialises in running complex 
orphan drug development programs requiring innovative 
regulatory and clinical approaches as well as pricing and 
reimbursement strategies. Besides outsourced project 
solutions, PSR provides insourced staffing solutions  
(orphan drug teams), temporary and permanent staffing,  
interim management solutions as well as training/coaching 
career programs.
PSR’s dedication to the rare disease landscape is  
exemplified by an extensive track record of orphan drug 
projects in a wide range of therapeutic areas, its continued 
efforts to achieve true patient centricity and its societal 
commitments by participation in fundraising activities and 
public-private partnerships. For further information, visit:

Orphan diseases are severe, debilitating or even  
life-threatening conditions which affect fewer than 1 in 2000 
people (EU definition) or fewer than 200,000 people in the 
US (US definition). Although patient numbers in individual 
indications are limited, there are a total of 30 million people 
worldwide suffering from rare diseases. 
Orphan drugs represent approximately 21% of all prescription 
drugs with the market growing at 11% pa and expected to 
reach $200Bn by 2022 driven, in part, by the trend towards 
personalised medicine.
The nature of orphan drug trials requires highly specialised 
providers due to the regulatory, logistical and operational 
complexities of conducting clinical trials in these indications. 
Studies typically are complex and run in small patient cohorts 
and Ergomed’s Site Management model and Study Physician 
group can be key success factors in recruiting and managing 
orphan drug trials.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
SOLID RESUL TS 
UNDER-PINNED BY DS&MI
Key Performance Indicators
The Directors consider the principal financial performance 
indicators of the Group to be:
£m 2017 2016
Net service revenue 39.6 29.2
Gross profit 14.6 12.0
Research and development 
expenditure 2.7 1.2
EBITDA (adjusted) (note 38) 2.8 2.8
Cash and cash equivalents 3.2 4.4
The Directors have substituted total revenue with net 
service revenue as a key financial performance indicator. 
In line with industry practice, net service revenue excludes 
reimbursement revenue and also excludes licence revenue, 
providing a clearer picture of underlying services growth.
The Directors consider the principal non-financial 
performance indicators of the Group to be:
  The delivery of high quality services that continue to meet 
the highest industry standards as evidenced by internal 
and external quality audits.
  The development or acquisition of new and/or the 
expansion of existing service offerings.
Non-financial performance indicators are routinely reviewed 
by the Directors at Board meetings.
During 2017, the Group was audited multiple times by 
customers and regulators, with no critical findings. In 
addition, during 2017, the Group expanded its specialist 
orphan drug development capabilities through the 
acquisition of PSR.
Consolidated income statement
Net service revenue for the year ended 31 December 2017 
was £39.6 million (2016: £29.2 million), an increase of 
36%, driven by 68% growth in Drug Safety and Medical 
Information, complemented by 9% growth from Clinical 
Research Services. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, net 
service revenue grew at 18%.
Total revenue, including reimbursement revenue and licensing 
income for the year ended 31 December 2017 was £47.6 
million (2016: £39.2 million), an increase of 21%. 
Reimbursement revenues are explained in note 1.
Gross profit from service revenue was £14.3 million and gross 
margin was 36% (2016: gross profit £12.0 million and gross 
margin 41%). T o support future growth, the Company made 
substantial investments in its Clinical Research Services business, 
particularly in the US. Compared to a traditional clinical research 
organisation (CRO) service provider, Ergomed’s gross margin 
can fluctuate because of its co-development activities, where 
Ergomed undertakes clinical studies at reduced fees in return 
for carried interests in the partnered product. In addition, the 
Company’s Drug Safety & Medical Information business made 
significant investments in headcount, particularly in Serbia, to 
support impending new contracts.
Administration expenses were £16.0 million (2016 restated: £10.8 
million), an increase of £5.2 million. Included in administrative 
expenses are increases in amortisation of acquired fair valued 
intangible assets of £0.4 million, share-based payment charge 
of £0.1 million, deferred consideration for acquisitions relating 
to post acquisition remuneration of £0.2 million, revaluation 
of deferred consideration of £2.9 million offset by a reduction 
in acquisition costs and exceptional items of £0.3 million.The 
increase in other administrative expenses of £1.4 million was 
driven by an additional £0.9 million of overhead in acquisitions, 
£0.1 million additional recruitment costs, £0.2 million increase 
in investor relations and public relations activities, £0.2 million 
increase in depreciation and foreign exchange losses of £0.5 
million (compared to foreign exchange gains of £0.3 million 
in 2016), offset by a £0.8 million reduction in provision for 
doubtful debts.
Research and development costs expensed in the year 
were £2.7 million (2016 restated: £1.2 million) relating to 
Haemostatix and included chemistry, manufacturing and 
controls (CMC) costs for clinical trial material, the costs of the 
Phase II clinical trial of PeproStat and pre-clinical formulation 
development costs for ReadyFlow.
 
Other operating income includes £0.1 million in respect of 
an R&D tax credit. In 2016, an R&D credit of £0.2 million was 
included in the tax charge.
Cash settled deferred consideration for achieving 2017 
financial targets of £0.8 million (2016: £0.6 million) in respect 
of Pharmlnvent has been charged to profit and loss in the 
year as it is tied to the continued employment of the vendors. 
Equity settled deferred consideration is included within the 
share-based payment charge for the year.
The Company incurred acquisition costs totalling £0.3 million 
(2016: £0.6 million) in the year, primarily in respect of the PSR 
acquisition. In addition, £0.1 million in respect of severance 
costs in relation to the former CEO were recognised as an 
exceptional item.
Included in finance charges is £0.5 million (2016: £0.3 
million) relating to the unwinding of the discount applied to 
contingent consideration for Haemostatix and £0.1 million 
(2016: £nil) relating to the unwinding of the discount applied 
to contingent consideration for PSR.
Consolidated balance sheet
As at 31 December 2017 total assets less total liabilities 
amounted to £34.8 million (2016 re-stated: £34.4 million see 
note 14) including cash and cash equivalents of £3.2 million 
(2016: £4.4 million).
The principal movements in the Consolidated balance sheet 
during the year were:
  Acquisition of PSR in October 2017 and the associated 
goodwill of £2.5 million and intangible assets of 
£0.7 million.
  Increase in trade and other receivables by £4.8 million 
reflecting higher trading levels, a reduction in bad debt 
provision of £0.8 million and a £0.3 million increase in other 
current assets. 19 Ergomed plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report
  An increase in trade and other payables of £3.6 million 
reflecting higher trading levels.
  An increase in deferred consideration (current and 
non-current) of £0.6 million in respect of PSR and 
£3.4 million in respect of Haemostatix, comprising 
£0.5 million for the unwinding of the discount applied 
and an additional £2.9 million revaluation increase.
  An increase in share premium, arising from the institutional 
placing in October 2017, net of costs.
  An increase in merger reserve, arising from the acquisition 
of PSR and contingent share issues in settlement of 
deferred consideration in relation to the acquisitions of 
Pharmlnvent and PSR.
Consolidated cash flow statement
At present, the Group does not have any borrowings or long 
term debt apart from a few immaterial fixed asset finance leases.
Cash Inflows from operating activities before changes in 
working capital in the year were £1.3 million (2016 restated: 
£2.5 million). Changes in working capital included a £3.5 
million increase in trade and other receivables, a £0.3 million 
increase in other current assets and a £2.8 million increase in 
trade and other payables.
Cash outflows from investing activities were £3.9 million 
(2016: £5.8 million) including £2.0 million related to the 
acquisition of PSR and £0.5 million related to a Pharmlnvent 
earn-out payment, £0.7 million for the acquisition of tangible 
assets and £0.7 million for the acquisition of intangible assets.
Cash inflows from financing activities included proceeds of a 
placing of £1.9 million net of expenses to fund the acquisition 
of PSR.
The Group also paid taxation of £0.4 million in 2017 
(2016: £0.9 million).
Going concern
As at 31 December 2017 the Group had £3.2 million in 
cash and cash equivalents and a strong backlog of signed 
contracts. The Directors therefore expect Ergomed’s services 
business to be cash generative.

PRINCIPAL RISKS
There are number of risks and uncertainties associated with the Group’s 
activities. The Board believes the following are the principal risks, along with 
the mitigation actions being pursued.
Strategic priorities Movement Mitigation of risk
Competition
Ergomed’s competitors and potential competitors 
include companies which may have substantially 
greater resources. Generally, the ability of 
Ergomed to win new business or repeat business 
from existing customers is a key risk and if the 
business development function fails to deliver new, 
profitable contracts then Ergomed’s profits and 
cash flows will suffer.
Ergomed employs an experienced team of business 
development executives to generate leads and 
close contracts for new business. 
Ergomed aims to provide high quality services at 
competitive rates, drawing upon its differentiators 
in the marketplace, as appropriate.
Cancellation or delay of clinical trials  
or projects by customers
The customers of Ergomed may cancel or delay 
proposed clinical trials or pharmacovigilance 
projects without notice or upon short notice. The 
cancellation or delay of a clinical trial may result 
in a risk of Ergomed having to reduce its staff 
overheads which could in turn have a negative 
impact on the Group’s profitability.
The terms of Ergomed’s contracts seek to mitigate 
the impact of cancellation or delay by structuring 
standard study close down procedures with the 
customer.
In addition, pharmacovigilance contracts contain 
provisions for transition of services.
Foreign currency risk
A significant proportion of Ergomed’s business is 
carried out outside the UK and in the relevant local 
currency. To the extent that there are fluctuations 
in exchange rates, this may have a material impact 
on Ergomed’s financial position or results of 
operations. 
Ergomed seeks advice from specialist foreign 
currency brokers, regularly reviewing the 
geographical mix of its operational costs and  
also its currency revenue streams and by the 
inclusion of exchange rate reviews in its major 
commercial contracts.
Dependency on pharmaceutical industry
Ergomed’s current revenue results from 
expenditure by pharmaceutical and biotech 
businesses on research and development and 
regulatory compliance. If customers or potential 
customers in this sector were to:
  reduce such expenditure, in particular by 
reducing the numbers of drugs put into  
clinical trials;
  seek to retain work in-house rather than 
outsourcing it; and/or
  consolidate through the vertical integration  
of their businesses and choose not to  
engage Ergomed
then Ergomed’s business could be negatively 
impacted.
Ergomed seeks to maintain diversification in  
all aspects of its customer base including:
  Large pharmaceutical vs biotech vs  
generics customers
  US vs European based customers
  Pre-product approval clinical trials vs  
post-approval trials and pharmacovigilance 
services
and actively engages with its customers to protect 
its existing relationships and build new ones.

Financial statements Governance Strategic report
Strategic priorities Movement Mitigation of risk
Legislation and regulation 
of the pharmaceutical and 
biotechnology industries
An element of Ergomed’s competitive advantage 
stems from its ability to navigate the regulated 
medicinal products approval processes and 
pharmacovigilance regulations which are expensive 
and complex. If there were to be substantial 
relaxation of such processes, cross jurisdictional 
harmonisation or simplification of the legislative 
or regulatory framework, this could reduce the 
barriers to entry which prospective competitors 
face, thereby eroding the Group’s competitive 
advantage. 
Ergomed is a strong advocate of rigorous 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and 
pharmacovigilance regulation. 
Our management team includes former senior 
regulators in the European Medicines Agency 
and, through industry associations, remain active 
promoters of regulation.
Licences, approvals and compliance
Ergomed is dependent on certain licences and 
regulatory approvals. Non-compliance with those 
licences could, in extreme cases, be restricted or 
revoked, which could adversely affect Ergomed’s 
business and future prospects. More generally, 
Ergomed operates in an environment which is 
subject to detailed and complex regulation. 
Ergomed maintains a highly professional Quality 
Assurance team and self-audit programme which 
checks on all aspects of compliance on a structured 
basis. 
In addition, customers audit Ergomed’s compliance 
on a weekly basis.
Customers, pricing and payment terms
Some of Ergomed’s customers may have 
substantial purchasing power and negotiating 
leverage. While Ergomed has historically been able 
to secure good contractual terms, there can be no 
assurance that it will continue to be able to do so 
in the future. In certain cases Ergomed may accept 
payment terms which impact adversely upon the 
revenue received by, the margins achieved by, and 
the cash flow of, Ergomed in any given period.
Ergomed has experienced proposal development 
and budgeting personnel within each of its clinical 
research and pharmacovigilance teams tasked with 
preparing bids for new work with target margins.
In addition, Project Managers are tasked with 
ensuring that relevant costs are passed through to 
customers and all billable tasks are recorded and 
appropriately billed.
Dependence on a limited number  
of key clients
A significant proportion of the Group’s revenue is 
derived from a relatively small number of clients. 
The percentage of the Group’s total revenue 
generated by the top five clients in the year ended 
31 December 2017 was 40% (2016: 51%). The loss 
of any client who represent a significant proportion 
of Ergomed’s revenue could have a negative 
impact on operating results and cash flows.
A significant part of the business development 
team’s focus is generation of leads and requests 
for proposals from new clients to diversify the 
Company’s customer base. 
The Company’s organic growth combined with 
acquisitions is naturally diluting reliance on 
relatively few large clients.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
Corporate governance
The Company is listed on the Alternative Investment Market (‘AIM') and is not required to comply with the provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 2010 (2010 Code), as set out in the Financial Services Authority Listing Rules. However, the 
Directors recognise the importance of sound corporate governance and intend to comply with the Corporate Governance 
Guidelines, to the extent appropriate for a company of its nature and size. The Corporate Governance Guidelines were devised 
by the Quoted Company Alliance (‘QCA’), in consultation with a number of significant institutional small company investors, as 
an alternative corporate governance code applicable to AIM companies. An alternative code was proposed because the QCA 
considers the 2010 Code to be inappropriate to many AIM companies. The Corporate Governance Guidelines state that: ‘‘The 
purpose of good corporate governance is to ensure that the company is managed in an efficient, effective and entrepreneurial 
manner for the benefit of all shareholders over the longer term.’’
The Board comprises two Non-Executive Directors (including the Chairman) and four Executive Directors. The Board meets 
regularly to consider strategy, performance and the framework of internal controls. To enable the Board to discharge its duties, 
the Directors receive appropriate and timely information. Briefing papers are distributed to the Directors in advance of Board 
meetings. The Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and the Chief Financial Officer, who 
are responsible for ensuring that the Board procedures are followed and that applicable rules and regulations are complied 
with. In addition, procedures are in place to enable the Directors to obtain independent professional advice in the furtherance 
of their duties, if necessary, at the Company’s expense.
The Board considers Peter George and Christopher Collins to be independent Directors.
Board committees
The Company has Audit and Risk, Nomination, AIM Compliance and Remuneration Committees. The Audit and Risk Committee 
has Christopher Collins as Chairman, and has primary responsibility for monitoring the quality of internal controls, ensuring 
that the financial performance of the Company is properly measured and reported on and reviewing reports from the 
Company’s auditors relating to the Company’s accounting and internal controls, in all cases having due regard to the interests 
of shareholders. The Audit and Risk Committee meets at least twice a year. Peter George is the other member of the Audit and 
Risk Committee. The Nomination Committee identifies and nominates for the approval of the Board, candidates to fill Board 
vacancies as and when they arise. The Nomination Committee meets at least twice a year. Rolf Stahel was Chairman of the 
Nomination Committee until 31 March 2017 and was succeeded as Chairman by Peter George. Miroslav Reljanovic, Christopher 
Collins, and, until 16 April 2017, Neil Clark are the other members of the Nomination Committee. The Remuneration Committee 
has Christopher Collins as Chairman, and reviews the performance of the Executive Directors and determine their terms and 
conditions of service, including their remuneration and the grant of options, having due regard to the interests of shareholders. 
The Remuneration Committee meets at least twice a year. Peter George, Stephen Stamp and, until 31 March 2017, Rolf Stahel 
are the other members of the Remuneration Committee.
The Company has established an AIM Compliance Committee to ensure that the Company is complying with the AIM Rules. 
In addition, the Committee assesses the Company’s Corporate Governance obligations every year. The AIM Compliance 
Committee is chaired by Christopher Collins and its other member is Peter George.
The Directors understand the importance of complying with the AIM Rules relating to Directors’ dealings and have established 
a share dealing code which is appropriate for an AIM listed company. 25 Ergomed plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Strategic report Governance
Internal control and risk management
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for safeguarding the shareholders’ investments and the Group’s assets. In applying 
this principle, the Board recognises that it has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains a system of internal 
control that provides it with reasonable assurance regarding effective and efficient operations, internal financial control 
and compliance with laws and regulations. The system of internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate the 
risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Through the Audit and Risk Committee, the Directors have reviewed the effectiveness of the internal controls. Since admission 
to AIM in July 2014, management is continuing to invest significant time in further developing the Group’s internal control 
environment. The key features of the internal control system are described below:
  control procedures and environment – the Group has an organisational structure with clearly drawn lines of accountability 
and authority. Employees are required to follow well-defined internal procedures and policies appropriate to the business 
and their position within the business and management promotes the highest levels of professionalism and ethical standards;
  identification and evaluation of risks – the Group employs Executive Directors and senior management with the appropriate 
knowledge and experience required for a medical and scientific research group. Identification and evaluation of risk is a 
continuous process running in parallel with the significant organic growth of the Group;
  risk register – senior management works with the Audit and Risk Committee to identify key risks facing the Group, any 
mitigating controls and persons responsible for reviewing and managing such risks. The risk register is reviewed periodically 
and updated and reviewed by the Board no less than annually;
  financial information – the Group prepares detailed budgets and working capital forecasts annually. These are based upon 
the strategy of the Group and are approved by the Board. Detailed management accounts and working capital re-forecasts 
are reviewed at least quarterly for each Board meeting, with any variances from budget investigated thoroughly and a 
summary provided to the Board. Annual Reports, Preliminary Statements and Half-year Reports prepared by the Group are 
reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee prior to approval by the Board;
  monitoring – the Board monitors the activities of the Group through the supply of reports from various areas of the business 
as contained in the Board papers. The Executive Committee performs a more detailed review, taking corrective action if 
required; and
  financial position and prospects memorandum – senior management works with the Audit and Risk Committee to produce 
a comprehensive review of risks and internal procedures to control financial reporting in compliance with ICAEW Technical 
Release TECH 14/14 CFF. 
The Board, through the Audit and Risk Committee, reviews the effectiveness of the systems of internal control. Given the 
Group’s relative small size, the Board does not consider it either necessary or practical at present to have its own internal audit 
function. The Board continues to monitor the requirement to have an internal audit function.
Communication with shareholders
The Board attaches great importance to communication with both institutional and private shareholders. Regular 
communication is maintained with all shareholders through Company announcements, the Annual Report and Accounts, 
Preliminary Statements and Half-year Report. The Directors seek to build on a mutual understanding of objectives between 
the Company and its shareholders, especially considering the long term nature of the business. Institutional shareholders are in 
contact with the Directors through presentations and meetings to discuss issues and to give feedback regularly throughout the 
year. With private shareholders this is not always practical. The Board, therefore, intends to use the Company’s Annual General 
Meeting as the opportunity to meet private shareholders who are encouraged to attend, after which the Chief Executive 
Officer will give a presentation on the activities of the Group. Following the presentation there will be an opportunity to ask 
questions of Directors on a formal and informal basis and to discuss the development of the business.
The Company operates a website at www.ergomedplc.com. The website contains details of the Group and its activities, 
regulatory announcements and Company announcements, Annual Reports and Half-year Reports, and the Terms of Reference 
of the Audit and Risk Committee and of the Remuneration Committee.
Going concern
As disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, having made relevant and appropriate enquiries, including 
consideration of the Company and Group current resources and working capital forecasts, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that, at the time of approving the financial statements, the Company has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for at least the next 12 months. Accordingly, the Board continues to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements. 26 Ergomed plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT (UNAUDITED)
Ergomed has elected voluntarily to prepare an unaudited Directors’ remuneration report as set out below.
Remuneration policy overview
The aim of the remuneration policy is to encourage and reward superior performance by the Executive Directors and senior 
management, with performance being measured by reference to the achievement of corporate goals, strong financial 
performance and the delivery of value to shareholders.
The policy is designed to offer rewards that:
  enable the Group to attract and retain the management talent it needs to ensure its success;
  incentivise the achievement of the Group’s strategy and the delivery of sustainable long term performance of the Group by 
the executives; and
  have flexibility to accommodate the changing needs of the Group as it grows and its strategy evolves.
Remuneration levels are benchmarked against a subset of companies in the UK life sciences and biotechnology sectors with 
the aim of achieving the following:
  Base salary between average and upper quartile.
  Performance-based bonus between average and upper quartile.
  Share incentives industry average.
  Total compensation between average and upper quartile.
The Remuneration Committee has established a policy that enables the Group to retain and motivate the Executive Directors 
and senior management appropriately while still maintaining a strong ‘pay-for-performance’ culture within the Group. The 
remuneration policy is reviewed by the Remuneration Committee on an annual basis to ensure that it is in line with the Group’s 
objectives and shareholders’ interests.

proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Company financial statements for each financial 
year. The Directors are required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange to prepare Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’) and have 
elected under company law to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU.
The financial statements are required by law and IFRS adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position of the Group 
and the Company and the financial performance of the Group. The Companies Act 2006 provides in relation to such financial 
statements that references in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to 
their achieving a fair presentation. Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Group for that period. In preparing each of the Group and Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
  state whether they have been prepared in accordance with applicable IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
and the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and 
the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole;
  the Strategic report includes a fair view of the development and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face; and
  the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Approved by the Board of Directors and signed on behalf of the Board.

Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion:
  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2017 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
  the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements of Ergomed plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) which 
comprise:
  the consolidated income statement;
  the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
  the consolidated and parent company balance sheets;
  the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity;
  the consolidated and parent company cash flow statements; and
  the related notes 1 to 39.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report.
We are independent of the Group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to 
our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
 Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
  Haemostatix goodwill impairment review
  Revenue recognition: CRO service contracts
  Acquisition accounting
  Haemostatix contingent consideration
 Materiality The materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was £595,300 which was 
determined on the basis of 1.25% of revenue for the year.
 Scoping Full scope audit procedures have been performed on four components and represent 89% 
of Group revenue. Six components were subject to an audit of specified balances in order 
to achieve sufficient coverage of the Group’s absolute profit before tax and net assets. The 
remaining Group entities were subject to analytical procedures.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We are required by ISAs (UK) to report in respect of the following matters where:
  the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of the 
financial statements is not appropriate; or
  the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material 
uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the Group’s or the parent 
company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for 
a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are 
authorised for issue.
We have nothing to report in respect 
of these matters.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF ERGOMED PLC 32 Ergomed plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
 Haemostatix goodwill impairment review
 Key audit matter 
 description
The Group recognised goodwill of £2,143k and intangible assets of £15,200k from the acquisition of 
Haemostatix Ltd in 2016. Given that the clinical trials of Peprostat and ReadyFlow are still ongoing, 
significant assumptions, judgements and estimates are required to be made by management in order 
to calculate the expected value in use of Haemostatix. Following the profit warning announced on 
5 March 2018, there is an increased risk of current year forecasts being inaccurate, also increasing the 
risk that indicators of impairment exist.
Under IAS 36 an impairment review is required to be completed annually and/or whenever there is 
an indication that the unit, or Group of units, may be impaired. In preparing the cash flow forecasts, 
management judgement is involved in the determination of the discount rate, terminal growth rate, 
the timing of drugs coming to market, and forecast cash flows for each cash generating unit (‘CGU’).
Further details are included within the critical accounting judgements in note 2 and note 14 to the 
financial statements.
  How the scope of our 
audit responded to  
the key audit matter
 
We have assessed whether the CGU’s identified are appropriately disaggregated and whether the 
assets included in the impairment model are complete by reconciling the assets to the consolidation 
and considering the disaggregation in line with the requirement of IAS 36. We have further evaluated 
the existence and accuracy of the CGU assets by tracing them to supporting evidence.
We have challenged the cash flow forecasts by referencing to historical performance and external 
market data, and an assessment of the Group’s future strategy and budgets.
We performed sensitivity analysis around the key variables within the Goodwill impairment model 
(such as when development costs are incurred, when Peprostat and ReadyFlow come to market, and 
when expected peak sales are reached) to evaluate whether a reasonable change would trigger an 
impairment.
 Key observations
 
We are satisfied that there is no impairment required for the goodwill balance allocated to 
Haemostatix.

 Revenue recognition: Open CRO service contracts
 Key audit matter 
description
There is a risk that revenue from Clinical Research contracts (see note 4 for segmental CRO 
revenues) has not been appropriately recognised in line with the percentage completed, as 
required by IAS 18: Revenue. The percentage completed is an estimate based on management’s 
judgements surrounding the costs incurred to date and the costs left to complete the contract. 
The risk is that revenue is recognised on the basis of units completed, which may not be indicative 
of the percentage of the contract that is actually complete.
IAS 18, para 20 states that “when the outcome of a transaction involving the rendering of services 
can be estimated reliably, revenue associated with the transaction shall be recognised by reference 
to the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period”.
Further details are included within the critical accounting judgements in note 2 to the financial 
statements.
  How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
 
We have selected a sample of key revenue generating contracts during the year for testing. For 
these contracts we have obtained the relevant project tracker and reconciled the value of services 
provided to the value of revenue recognised within the financial statements.
We have traced a sample of services provided in the year within the sampled contracts to 
supporting evidence (such as external hospital data and timecards) to evaluate whether the 
project tracker accurately reflects the work performed by the Group.
We have enquired of project managers as to the status of the project, any on-going concerns, and 
the expected remaining duration of the project.
Considering all of the above we have assessed whether the revenue recognised by the Group is in 
line with evidence received and supports the percentage of completion that has occurred to date.
 Key observations
 
We concluded that the Group has recognised revenue on service contracts at an appropriate 
percentage completion rate.
 Acquisition accounting
  Key audit matter 
description
Significant judgement is required in respect of the purchase price allocation process on the 
acquisition of PSR Group BV (note 34). The acquisition was completed for a total consideration 
of €4.1m, with €2.9m paid as initial consideration and the balance as deferred consideration. 
Intangible assets valued at €0.7m and goodwill valued at €2.9m were recognised as a result of the 
acquisition. The identification of intangible assets, related deferred tax charges, and fair valuation 
of the goodwill acquired and related assumptions (such as the weighted average cost of capital 
and growth rates used) is a key area of focus due to the judgemental nature of the assumptions 
used by management.
Further details are included within the critical accounting judgements in note 2 to the financial 
statements.
  How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
 
For the acquisition of PSR Group BV we have obtained the share purchase agreement (‘SPA’), 
as well as a management valuation paper detailing the purchase price consideration, contingent 
consideration, financing, and the allocation of intangible assets and goodwill.
We have further assessed the purchase price allocation of goodwill and acquisition intangible 
assets by reviewing acquisition models and forecasts, engaging a Deloitte valuation specialist to 
support where appropriate. We also reviewed management’s models for mathematical accuracy, 
challenged the reasonableness of the assumptions made, including the appropriateness of the 
forecasts, and agreed consideration paid in the year to supporting evidence.
  K e y observ a tions
 
Based on work performed we consider the valuation and allocation of goodwill, acquisition 
intangibles, purchase price consideration, and contingent consideration to be appropriate for the 
acquisition of PSR Group BV in the period. 34 Ergomed plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
  Haemostatix contingent consideration
  Key audit matter 
description
Contingent consideration is required to be fair valued at each period end, with the fair value being 
calculated based on management’s forecasts. A maximum value of £20m is payable as contingent 
consideration as part of the acquisition of Haemostatix and, as such, any inaccuracies in the 
forecasts could have a significant impact on the fair value of contingent consideration. Following 
the profit warning announced on 5 March 2018, there is an increased risk of current year forecasts 
being inaccurate, also increasing the risk that indicators of impairment exist.
Further details are included within the critical accounting judgements in note 2 and note 26 to the 
financial statements.
  How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
 
We have obtained management’s updated fair value calculation for the Haemostatix contingent 
consideration, which include updated forecasts, and challenged the key assumptions and 
judgements made (i.e. the discount factor and the timing of when Peprostat and ReadyFlow 
come to market). Our internal valuations specialists were engaged to assist in reviewing and re-
performing the fair value calculation.
Further to this, we have also checked the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, agreed 
whether the forecasts are consistent with those used within the goodwill impairment assessment, 
and agreed whether the accounting adjustments have been appropriately recognised in the 
financial statements.
  K e y observ a tions
 
Our audit procedures concluded that an updated fair value calculation of the contingent 
consideration is appropriate as a result of progress of the clinical trials of Peprostat.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Materiality £595,300 £350,300
Basis for determining 
materiality
We determined materiality based on 1.25% of 
revenue.
We determined materiality based on 1.40% of 
revenue.
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
Revenue is considered the most appropriate 
benchmark as it is the key performance metric 
for users of the financial statements.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT continued
TO THE MEMBERS OF ERGOMED PLC 35 Ergomed plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £30,000 for the 
Group and £18,000 for the parent company, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting 
on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the 
overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our audit scope 
on the UK, Croatian, and Czech trading entities. As such Ergomed plc, PrimeVigilance Limited, Haemostatix Limited, and 
European PharmInvent Services were subject to a full audit. The six additional components for which specified procedures 
were performed were chosen in order to provide sufficient coverage over the Group’s key financial statement lines. These 
components were selected for being the next most significant to the Group, in terms of financial performance, risk and 
geographical location. Our audit work at the entities was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity 
which were lower than Group materiality and ranged between £177k and £350k.
We have engaged Deloitte Czech Republic as component auditors for the year ended 31 December 2017 to report on European 
PharmInvent Services s.r.o.
The locations subject to full scope audit procedures represent the principal business units and account for 89% of the Group’s 
revenue for the year ended 31 December 2017. They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit 
work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our 
conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the 
remaining components not subject to audit.
The parent company is located in Guildford, UK, but operated out of Zagreb, Croatia during 2017. The parent company has 
been audited directly by the Group audit team.

Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the 
extent otherwise explicitly stated in our auditor’s report, we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required 
to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that  
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to 
report in respect of 
these matters.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
  the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
  the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and or the parent company and their environment obtained in 
the course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
1. Accounting policies
Group
Ergomed plc is a public company limited by shares. Its registered address is 26-28 Frederick Sanger Road, Surrey Research 
Park, Guildford, Surrey, GU2 7YD, UK. Ergomed plc and its wholly owned subsidiaries provide a full range of clinical trial 
planning, management and monitoring, as well as drug safety and medical information services. The Group has a worldwide 
presence with operations in the UK, Poland, Germany, Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Russia, 
Switzerland, Ukraine, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and the USA. Ergomed plc is a company incorporated and domiciled  
in the UK.
The Group financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 14 May 2018.
Basis of accounting
Consolidated financial statements
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) and the 
Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European 
Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. The principal accounting policies are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved when the Company:
  has the power over the investee;
  is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee; and
  has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to 
one or more of the three elements of control listed above.
When the Company has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it considers that it has power over the investee 
when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. 
The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not the Company’s voting rights in an 
investee are sufficient to give it power, including:
  the size of the Company’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders;
  potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties;
  rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and
  any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Company has, or does not have, the current ability to direct the 
relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous shareholders’ meetings.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company 
loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in 
the Consolidated income statement from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to 
control the subsidiary.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company. Total 
comprehensive income of the subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company.
All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transitions between the members of the 
Group are eliminated on consolidation.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in profit or loss is calculated as the 
difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest 
and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), less liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling 
interests. All amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted 
for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss 
or transferred to another category of equity as specified/permitted by applicable IFRSs). The fair value of any investment 
retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for 
subsequent accounting under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement or, when applicable, the costs on 
initial recognition of an investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity. 47 Ergomed plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will have sufficient 
funds to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, being a period of no less than 12 months from the date 
of signing of the financial statements. The Directors have reviewed a cash flow forecast (the ‘Forecast’) for the period ending 
31 December 2019. The Forecast represents the Directors’ best estimate of the Group’s future performance and necessarily 
includes a number of assumptions, including the level of revenues, which are subject to inherent uncertainties. However, the 
Forecast demonstrates that the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to meet its liabilities as 
they fall due, for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements.
On the basis of the above factors and, having made appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.
Compliance with accounting standards
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been 
applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 11 (amendments) Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations
IAS 1 (amendments) Disclosure Initiative
IAS 16 and IAS 38 (amendments) Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation
IAS 16 and IAS 41 (amendments) Agriculture: Bearer Plants
IAS 27 (amendments) Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements
IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (amendments) Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate 
or Joint Venture
IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 (amendments) Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exemption
Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2012–2014 Cycle Amendments to: IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, 
IAS 19 Employee Benefits and IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial 
statements of the Group in future periods, except that IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial 
instruments. IFRS 15 may have an impact on revenue recognition and related disclosures, and IFRS 16 will have an impact on 
the measurement and recognition of leases and related disclosures. Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to 
provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 until a detailed review has been completed.
Re-statement of prior year income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement
Certain Directors, former Directors and the Company Secretary hold options over shares held by Dr Miroslav Reljanovic under 
agreements between those parties. The grant and vesting of such options was dependent on their continued employment by 
the Company. Although these options are not dilutive and the Company is not party to the arrangements, in accordance with 
IFRS 2, a share-based payment charge arises. No such charge was shown in the financial statements for the years ended 31 
December 2015 and 31 December 2016.
In November 2016, the Company acquired European PharmInvent Services s.r.o. Deferred consideration payable to the vendors 
is dependent on their remaining employees of the group. The total amount payable to vendors for the year ended 31 December 
2016 was charged to the income statement. However, a proportion of that deferred consideration is payable in equity. In 
accordance with IFRS 2, this proportion should be treated as a share-based payment.
In 2016, the raw material and manufacturing costs of clinical trial material to be used in clinical studies were capitalised 
and categorised as Clinical Trial Inventory. However, under IFRS, the raw material costs were not eligible for capitalisation. 
Therefore, a prior year adjustment has arisen and the remaining capitalised amount is categorised as ‘Other current assets’. 48 Ergomed plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Property, plant and equipment and depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation less any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided 
on assets at rates calculated to write off the cost, less their estimated residual value, over their expected useful lives on the 
following bases:
Leasehold improvements 2.5% straight line or over the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter
Motor vehicles 8.33–50% straight line
Computer equipment 8.33–50% straight line
Fixtures and fittings 10–50% straight line
Laboratory equipment 20% straight line
Business combinations
Acquisitions of companies are accounted for in accordance with the principles of IFRS 3, as the Directors consider it reflects 
the economic substance of transactions.
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in 
a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of assets 
transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued 
by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Deferred consideration in a business combination is measured at fair 
value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of assets expected to be transferred by the Group to 
the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest to be issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. 
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 55 Ergomed plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the 
acquisition date, except that:
  deferred tax assets or liabilities and assets or liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and 
measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively; and
  assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale 
and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests 
in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the 
acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after reassessment, the net of the 
acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration 
transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held 
interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination 
occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts 
are adjusted during the measurement period (see above), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new 
information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected 
the amounts recognised as of that date.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-
controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over 
the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill 
is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. 
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there 
is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying 
amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit 
and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment 
loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell, and the value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have 
not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment in value.
Intangible assets acquired separately
Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Software   20–30% straight line
The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any 
changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives that are acquired 
separately are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Costs associated with the development of computer software are initially capitalised at cost which includes the purchase 
price (net of any discounts and rebates) and other directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for its intended use. 
Direct expenditure, including employee costs, which enhances or extends the performance of computer software beyond 
its specifications and which can be reliably measured, is added to the original cost of the software. Costs associated with 
maintaining the computer software are recognised as an expense when incurred. 56 Ergomed plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
1. Accounting policies continued 
The computer software under development is currently under construction and so no amortisation has been recognised in the 
current year. The asset will subsequently be carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. 
These costs will be amortised to profit or loss using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives of five years, once 
the asset is in use.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at their 
fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately, as 
follows.
Customer contracts  20-66.7% straight line
Customer relationships  20-50% straight line
Brand    12-13.3% straight line
Technology   40% straight line
In-process R&D   Not currently amortised
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount 
of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows 
that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the 
asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to 
individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a 
reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell, and the value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have 
not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is 
treated as a revaluation decrease.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the 
acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, 
on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Financial assets
The Company classifies its financial assets in the following categories:
  at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’)
  loans and receivables
  available-for-sale financial assets (‘AFS’)
  held-to-maturity investments
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the 
classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 57 Ergomed plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit or loss 
at inception. A financial asset is classified in this category if it was acquired principally for the purpose of selling it in the short 
term or if so designated by management. Financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss comprise of ‘derivative 
financial instruments’. Assets in this category are classified as current assets, if they are either held for trading or are expected 
to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. 
These are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables comprise of ‘trade and other receivables’ and ‘cash and cash 
equivalents’ in the balance sheet.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial 
assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial 
recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
For listed and unlisted equity investments classified as AFS, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security 
below its cost is considered to be objective evidence of impairment.
For all other financial assets, including redeemable notes classified as AFS and finance lease receivables, objective evidence of 
impairment could include:
  significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or
  default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
  it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are, 
in addition, assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could 
include the Group’s past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio 
past the average credit period of 60 days, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate 
with default on receivables.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the differences between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception 
of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable 
is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written 
off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in 
profit or loss.
Financial liabilities and equity
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the 
contractual arrangement.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its 
liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Repurchase of the Company’s own equity instruments is recognised and deducted directly in equity. No gain or loss is 
recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities ‘at FVTPL’ or ‘other financial liabilities’.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest 
expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest 
expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount 
on initial recognition. 58 Ergomed plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
1. Accounting policies continued 
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or 
they expire.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short term highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for 
services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and estimated credit notes.
Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract based on 
time spent. Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate 
applicable.
Amounts received from customers before the related work is performed are included in the Consolidated balance sheet as 
deferred revenue. Amounts billed for work performed but not yet invoiced to the customer are included in the Consolidated 
balance sheet under Trade and other receivables as accrued income.
Reimbursement revenue and reimbursable expenses
Reimbursable expenses are reflected in the Consolidated income statement as ‘Reimbursement revenue’ in total revenue and 
as ‘Reimbursable expenses’ separately from cost of sales as the Company is the primary obligor for these expenses despite 
being reimbursed by its clients. Reimbursable expenses are comprised primarily of payments to physicians (investigators) 
who oversee clinical trials and travel expenses for our clinical monitors and other employees. Costs for such activities are 
recorded based upon payment requests or invoices that have been received from third parties in the periods presented or 
accrued based on patient recruitment. Reimbursed expenses may fluctuate from period-to-period due, in part, to the lifecycle 
of contracts that are in progress at a particular point in time. Service revenues or revenues before reimbursements (‘net service 
revenues’) include any margin earned on reimbursed expenses. When such an expense is not reimbursed, they are classified as 
costs of sales on the Consolidated income statement.
Operating (loss)/profit
Operating (loss)/profit is stated before investment income, finance costs and tax.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income and expenditure 
that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences 
and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences 
arise from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a 
transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Foreign currency translation
The functional currency of the Company is the Euro, and the presentational currency is UK Sterling, meeting the requirements 
of shareholders. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. All differences are taken to the income statement.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 59 Ergomed plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report
The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation 
currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
  assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date;
  income and expenses for each income statement are translated on a monthly basis at average exchange rates (unless this 
average is not a reasonable approximation of the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions, in which case income and 
expense items are translated at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions); and
  all resulting exchange differences are recognised directly in Other comprehensive income.
Pensions
The pension costs charged in the financial statements represent the contributions payable by the Company during the year in 
accordance with lAS 19.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments
Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are capitalised as tangible assets and depreciated over their 
useful lives. Obligations under such agreements are included in creditors net of the finance charge allocated to future periods. 
The finance element of the rental payment is charged to the income statement so as to produce a constant periodic rate of 
charge on the net obligation outstanding in each period.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged against income on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Share-based payments
The Group operates an equity-settled share-based option scheme under which the Group receives services from employees in 
consideration for equity instruments (options) of the Company. The fair value of the employees’ services received in exchange 
for the grant of options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the 
fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market service and performance vesting conditions. The 
total amount expensed is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all the specified conditions are 
satisfied. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based 
on the vesting conditions.
The Group has acquired entities under terms which include equity-settled deferred consideration payable to vendors. 
Where settlement of such deferred consideration is dependent on the continued employment by the Group of that vendor, 
a share-based payment charge arises. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the 
deferred consideration at the date of the acquisition. The total amount expensed is recognised over the period from date of 
acquisition to the date the conditions are met for settlement of the deferred consideration.
Under IFRS 2, where such share options relate to employees of group companies other than the Company, a charge arises. 
Where such charge is not reimbursed by the entity, a capital contribution arises.
Exceptional items
Significant non-recurring transactions undertaken by the Group during the year are classified as exceptional items.
Company
The financial statements have been produced in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, the Companies 
Act 2006 and under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies adopted are the same as those for the 
Group consolidated financial statements except as noted below.
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment in value.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Income Statement and Statement of comprehensive income of 
the parent company is not presented as part of these financial statements. The parent company’s loss after tax for the financial 
year was £4,050,000 (2016: £1,977,000). 60 Ergomed plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
2. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 1, the Directors are required to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are 
considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future 
periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with separately below), that 
the Directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect 
on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Revenue recognition
The amount of revenue to be recognised is based on, inter alia, management’s estimate of the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable, the stage of completion and of the point in time at which management considers that it becomes 
probable that economic benefits will flow to the entity (as the outcome is not always certain at the inception of a contract).
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting period, that may 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year, are discussed below.
Bad debt provision
Group
In determining the level of provisioning for bad debts, the Directors have considered the aging of trade receivables, and 
the payment history and financial position of debtors. The provision against trade receivables as at 31 December 2017 was 
£214,000 (2016: £1,016,000) (note 21).
Company
In determining the level of provisioning for bad debts, the Directors have considered the aging of trade receivables, and 
the payment history and financial position of debtors. The provision against trade receivables as at 31 December 2017 was 
£212,000 (2016: £1,013,000) (note 21).
Impairment of goodwill
Under IFRSs, goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an 
estimation of the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. The calculation of the 
recoverable amount requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a 
suitable discount rate in order to determine whether the recoverable amount is greater than the carrying value. 
The key inputs for estimating the future cash flows of operating businesses are revenue growth over the next five years, 
terminal revenue growth, working capital changes and discount rate.
  PrimeVigilance, PharmInvent and Sound Opinion have been merged into a single cash generating unit. If revenue growth 
rates (including terminal growth) are reduced to zero, there would be no impairment to goodwill. 
  If revenue growth rates for Ergomed Virtuoso were reduced by 20% (including terminal growth) from -10% to -30%, an 
impairment to goodwill would be required.
  If revenue growth rates for O+P and GASD were reduced by 3% from 5% to 2% and terminal growth rate from 2% to zero, an 
impairment to goodwill would be required.
The key inputs for estimating the cash flows of Haemostatix, a development company, are the probabilities of clinical success, 
expected market launch date, the expected royalty rate and the discount rate. The impact on the present value of Haemostatix 
projected cash flows is as follows:
  If the probability of clinical success at each stage of development is reduced by 14% (from Phase I 50%, Phase III 80%), an 
impairment to goodwill would be required.
  If the expected market launch date of PeproStat (2021) and ReadyFlow (2023) are each delayed by more than one year, an 
impairment to goodwill would be required.
  If the expected royalty rate was reduced by 3% from 20%, an impairment to goodwill would be required.
  If the discount rate was increased by 3.2% from 19.7%, an impairment to goodwill would be required.
The impairment provision against goodwill as at 31 December 2017 was £nil (2016: £nil). The carrying amount of goodwill and 
any impairment loss is disclosed in note 15.

Fair value measurements
Some of the Group’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value for financial reporting purposes. In estimating the fair 
value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market-observable data to the extent it is available, and management estimates 
of commercial and development risk where appropriate. Where Level 1 inputs are not available, the Group engages third 
party qualified valuers to perform the valuation. The Directors work closely with the qualified external valuers to establish the 
appropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the model. This includes fair valued acquired intangible assets with a net value 
of £18,217,000 and deferred consideration relating to acquisitions valued at £11,761,000.
Deferred consideration relates to the acquisitions of Haemostatix and PSR (note 26). The deferred consideration for 
Haemostatix comprises milestones of up to £4.0 million at start of Phase III (dependent on the Company’s market 
capitalisation); plus £16.0 million sales-based milestone payments and an additional sum in the event that the enlarged group is 
able to utilise certain existing tax losses that are currently available to Haemostatix. The deferred consideration for Haemostatix 
was revalued at the year-end giving rise to an increase in value of £2,875,000 reflecting the successful progress of PeproStat 
through the Phase II study.
The Group incurs share-based payment charges in relation to share options awards made in the current and prior periods. 
This charge is based on the fair value of such share options for financial reporting purposes. In estimating the fair value of a 
share-based payment, the Group engages third party qualified valuers to perform the valuation. The Directors work closely 
with the qualified external valuers to establish the appropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the model.

The goodwill arising during the year ended 31 December 2017 relates to an adjustment arising on the acquisition of 
Haemostatix and to the acquisition of PSR on 2 October 2017.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) that are 
expected to benefit from that business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows:

5,781 3,028 455
Drug Safety and Medical Information 9,488 9,257 7,033
15,269 12,285 7,488
The goodwill associated with the Drug Safety and Medical Information segment has arisen from the acquisitions of 
PrimeVigilance, Sound Opinion and PharmInvent. These businesses trade as a single cash generating unit and the associated 
goodwill is combined.
The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use 
calculations are those regarding discount rates and growth rates. 68 Ergomed plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
15. Goodwill continued
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the CGUs. The growth rates are based on management’s estimates based on the Group’s planned 
organic expansion of its operations and broadened overall offering, and the increased demand for services. Profit margins 
included in the projections are based on industry standards.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts for the next five years, derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by 
the Board, and forecasts cash flows for the following five years based on a terminal growth rate of 2%, except for the Ergomed 
Virtuoso Sarl CGU and the Haemostatix Limited CGU, both of the CRS segment. This rate does not exceed the average long 
term growth rate for the relevant markets. The Ergomed Virtuoso Sarl CGU forecasts cash flows over the remaining life of the 
Customer Contract using a terminal growth rate of 0%. The Haemostatix Limited CGU forecasts cash flows over the patent life 
of the In-process research and development using a terminal growth rate of 0%.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows from the CGUs of both the CRS and DS&MI segments is 19.7%.

As at 31 December 2017, the Company does not hold any Goodwill.

at least 25 hours per week or, if less, at least 75% of his or her working time on the business of the Company (or Group 
company) and, at the grant date, does not either individually or together with his associates control more than 30% of the

Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme 2007
The Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme 2007 is an unapproved equity-settled share option scheme for the benefit of 
employees. Grants are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors, or an authorised committee thereof.
Options are forfeited (even if already vested) if the employee ceases employment with the Company and can only be exercised 
upon a sale, listing or the passing of a resolution for the voluntary winding-up of the Company or making of an order for 
the compulsory winding up of the Company. The employee retains the options vested at the time of the cessation of the 
employee’s employment for a six month period. The movement on options in issue under these schemes is set out below:

Deferred consideration for acquisitions
The terms of the acquisitions of PSR Group BV and European Pharminvent Services s.r.o. (now PrimeVigilance s.r.o.) included 
provisions for deferred consideration payable in cash and in equity. Where that deferred consideration is contingent upon the 
continued employment of the vendors, in accordance with IFRS 3, a charge through the income statement arises. The element 
that is repayable in equity and that is contingent on the continued employment of the vendors is included as part of share-based 
payments in accordance with IFRS 2. A charge of £304,000 arises in the year ended 31 December 2017 (2016 re-stated: £140,000).
The element that is repayable in cash and that is contingent on the continued employment of the vendors is charged 
separately to the income statement and is shown a deferred consideration for acquisitions expense (note 7).

The Group’s financial assets held for managing liquidity risk, being loans and receivables, are considered to be readily saleable 
or are expected to generate cash inflows to meet cash outflows on financial liabilities within six months.
Financial risk management objectives
The Group’s Finance function provides services to the business, monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of 
the Group. These risks include market risk (including currency risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
(see below).
Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently exposures to exchange rate fluctuations 
arise. Exchange rate exposures are managed by natural hedging in currency accounts. The carrying amounts of the Group’s 
financial assets and financial liabilities by currency at the reporting date are as follows:

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group is mainly exposed to the GBP currency, Euro currency and the US Dollar currency.
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in Sterling, being the reporting currency, 
against the relevant foreign currencies. 10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key 
management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange 
rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities and adjusts 
their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. A positive number below indicates an increase in 
profit and other equity and a negative number indicates a decrease in profit and other equity.

Interest rate risk management
The Group and the Company are exposed to the interest rate risks associated with its holdings of cash and cash equivalents 
and short term deposits and finance leases payable.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which regularly monitors the Group’s 
short, medium and long term funding, and liquidity management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by 
maintaining adequate cash and cash equivalents and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching 
the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The impact on profit and other comprehensive income due to interest rate exposure is not considered significant, and no 
interest rate sensitivity has been performed.
Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. 
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties. The Group and the Company assesses the 
creditworthiness of customers in advance of entering into any contract. During the life of a contract, the customer’s financial status 
is monitored as well as payment history. The Group does have some larger customer balances representing more than 15% of the 
trade receivables at a particular time, but these will be large profitable pharmaceutical companies with good credit ratings or smaller 
biotech companies with supportive shareholders and a history of successful fundraising, and this is not considered indicative of an 
increased credit risk. Credit information is supplied by independent rating agencies where appropriate and if available. Alternatively 
the Group uses other publicly available financial information and its own trading records to rate its major customers.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse geographical areas. Ongoing credit evaluation 
is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international 
credit rating agencies.
There has been no history of bad debts as the majority of its sales are to multinational pharmaceutical companies and as a 
consequence the Directors do not consider that the Group has a significant credit risk.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the 
Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk as no collateral or other credit enhancements are held.

Financial statements Governance Strategic report
Liquidity and interest risk tables
The Group and the Company has no significant long term financial liabilities.
Fair value estimation
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values. 
The fair value of long term trade receivables and payables is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the 
current market interest rate for the underlying currency of the transaction.
Fair value measurements
The financial instruments measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value comprise investments. The fair value hierarchy 
of these assets is Level 2. The valuation technique is market value, based on the most recent investment price. The Group and 
the Company did not have any other financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value. An 
analysis of the fair value hierarchy has therefore not been presented.
33. Acquisition of subsidiary – Haemostatix
On 24 May 2016, Ergomed plc acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Haemostatix Limited (‘Haemostatix’), a research 
and development company based in Nottingham, UK developing novel products for the surgical bleeding market. The 
acquisition of Haemostatix enhances Ergomed’s portfolio of development products with the potential to generate significant 
shareholder value.
Goodwill in relation to the acquisition of Haemostatix was increased by £57,000 during the period, following a re-assessment 
of the deferred tax asset arising on the transaction during the measurement period, which ended on 23 May 2017.

The provisional fair value of intangible assets relates to Customer Relationships of £162,000, Orders Backlog of £189,000 
and the Trade Name of £349,000. The provisional fair value of the financial assets includes receivables with a fair value of 
£879,000 and a gross contractual value of £879,000. The best estimate at acquisition date of the contractual cash flows not to 
be collected is £nil.
Goodwill is provisionally valued at £2,535,000. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. 
Deferred consideration represents the provisional fair valuation of the additional consideration payable which could be 
between £nil and an aggregate maximum undiscounted amount of £2,806,000, subject to the future performance of 
the business.
Ergomed plc has a 12 month measurement period from the date of acquisition, and therefore the measurement period ends on 
1 October 2018.
PSR contributed revenues of £977,000 and profit before tax of £38,000 to the results of the group for the year. If 
the acquisition of PSR had been completed on the first day of the financial year, group revenues for the year ended 
31 December 2017 would have been £3,302,000 higher and group profit before tax would have been £309,000 higher.

The Directors make certain adjustments to EBITDA to derive adjusted EBITDA which they consider more reflective of the 
Group’s underlying trading performance and enables comparisons to be made with prior periods. Certain items, such as share-
based payment charge, revaluation of deferred consideration for acquisition and write-back of deferred consideration for 
acquisition are non-cash items and reflect adjustments to expected future deferred consideration payments.
Deferred consideration for acquisitions expense relates to the cash component of deferred consideration which is payable 
contingent on the continued employment of the vendors (note 7). These costs, together with acquisition costs and exceptional 
items, are all cash costs but are not considered trading items and therefore not included in adjusted EBITDA.
