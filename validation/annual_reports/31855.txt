Highlights of our year Products
We	manufacture	our	own	products	in	our	specialist	facilities	
worldwide,	as	well	as	sourcing	from	over	400	partners.	This	way	
we 	 are 	 able 	 to 	 offer 	 scientists 	 the 	 newest 	 and 	 best 	 research 	 tools	
available globally regardless of source.
Customers
Our 	 customers 	 are 	 research 	 scientists 	 who 	 need 	 high 	 performance	
products 	 with 	 detailed 	 technical 	 specifications. 	 Our 	 information-rich	
products, 	 together 	 with 	 expert 	 customer 	 support 	 and 	 fast 	 delivery,	
make us the researcher’s choice.
People
Our team is our biggest asset. We have over 1,000 employees 
and	we	are	proud	to	have	over	140	in-house	PhDs.	Nurturing	
employee	excellence	is	key	to	our	success	and	we	continue	
to invest in the learning and development of our staff. 
Our main product types
Antibodies
The	human	body	makes	proteins	known	as	antibodies	when	it	
becomes infected by a foreign body, like bacteria. Each antibody 
binds to a very specific part of the surface of the foreign body that 
we 	 call 	 the 	 antigen 	 – 	 different 	 antibodies 	 bind 	 to 	 different 	 antigens.	
We can artificially generate antibodies to target antigens on 
molecules	we	are	interested	in	studying	to	understand	where	
they	are	located	within	a	cell	or	tissue	sample.
Research-grade antibodies
Our main focus is providing antibodies intended for basic research 
–	that	is,	those	typically	used	in	academic	pharma	and	biotech	
laboratories to investigate fundamental scientific questions.
In vitro diagnostic (IVD) antibodies
IVDs are tools typically used in a clinical setting, such as a hospital 
or medical institute lab, to help diagnose a particular disease or 
condition. These antibody-based tools are used on patient samples 
(such as blood, urine, or tissue) and help clinicians to diagnose or 
assess the progression of a disease. IVDs can also provide information 
on the type of treatment to use and on disease prognosis.
Kits
Kits contain everything a researcher needs to run an experiment: 
the reagents and protocol are provided and the contents have 
been optimised for maximum performance. A researcher provides 
the sample of interest and the kit delivers everything else.
These tools enable life scientists to analyse components of living cells at the molecular level 
which	is	essential	in	a	wide	range	of	fields	including	drug	discovery,	diagnostics,	and	basic	
research.	We	are	headquartered	in	Cambridge,	UK	with	eleven	additional	locations	across	
Asia, the UK, and the US.
Abcam is a producer and marketer  
of high quality protein research tools.
Leadership
Good corporate governance is fundamental to the success 
of our business. The Board and its Committees have a key role in 
our 	 governance 	 framework 	 by 	 providing 	 external 	 and 	 independent	
support	and	challenge,	understanding	the	views	of	shareholders	
and stakeholders, and ensuring that a culture of good governance 
is promoted across the business.

Strategic report I am pleased to report that Abcam has made good 
progress, both financially and strategically, over the course 
of 	 the 	 past 	 twelve 	 months. 	 We 	 have 	 continued 	 to 	 successfully	
implement	our	growth	strategy	and	once	again	delivered	
double-digit 	 catalogue 	 revenue 	 growth, 	 performing 	 at 	 levels	
well 	 above 	 market 	 growth 	 rates. 	 At 	 the 	 same 	 time 	 we 	 have

of our products, including knockout validation. We are 
excited	about	the	successes	we	have	made	and	the	
further	opportunities	we	see	in	custom	products	and	
licensing. 	 As 	 a 	 result 	 we 	 are 	 putting 	 increasing 	 resources	
behind this part of our business.
I am grateful for the 
hard work, enthusiasm  
and dedication of all our 
employees. My thanks 
to them and to our 
shareholders for their

Chairman’s introduction Strengthened the foundations for growth
We 	 are 	 confident 	 that 	 the 	 investments 	 we 	 are 	 making 	 in 	 our	
systems 	 and 	 processes, 	 our 	 facilities 	 and 	 our 	 teams 	 will 	 enable	
us	to	continue	to	deliver	solid	growth	over	the	long-term.
Our	new	enterprise	resource	planning	(ERP)	system	is	a	
significant	investment	and	is	providing	a	new	platform	for	
the	way	in	which	we	do	business.	We	have	gone	live	with	
a number of modules over the course of the year and are 
making	progress	towards	its	full	implementation	in	FY	2018.
Another 	 goal 	 for 	 us 	 this 	 year 	 was 	 to 	 progress 	 the 	 development	
of our global facilities. Investments have been made to initiate 
and complete manufacturing and distribution improvement 
related	projects	in	China,	the	US	and	the	UK.
We have completed the hiring of our Executive Leadership 
Team and have re-organised the business to create separate 
Research & Development and Global Manufacturing & 
Supply Chain teams.
Our	dual	growth	strategy	combines	organic	in-house	
development 	 with 	 a 	 track 	 record 	 of 	 successfully 	 completing	
partnerships and acquisitions. We remain committed to this 
strategy and continue to proactively evaluate the landscape 
for	opportunities	which	align	with	our	business	objectives	
and	that	will	provide	increased	scale.
Our team
I	am	grateful	for	the	hard	work,	enthusiasm	and	dedication	
of all our employees. My thanks to them and to our shareholders 
for their ongoing support.
I 	 would 	 also 	 like 	 to 	 thank 	 my 	 current 	 and 	 previous 	 Board	
colleagues	for	their	hard	work,	guidance	and	oversight	
of	the	business	through	a	successful	period	of	growth	and	
change. 	 Gavin 	 Wood 	 joined 	 the 	 Company 	 as 	 CFO-elect 	 in	
July 2016, replacing Jeff Iliffe as CFO and Executive Director 
on	12	September	2016.	Additionally,	Jim	Warwick	retired	
from	Abcam	and	stepped	down	from	the	Board	on	
31 December 2016, and Anthony Martin and Michael Ross 
did not seek re-election as Non-Executive Directors at the AGM 
in November 2016, leaving the Board on 31 October 2016. 
I 	 am 	 pleased 	 to 	 say 	 that 	 over 	 the 	 year 	 we 	 have 	 completed	
the	hiring	of	our	Executive	Leadership	Team	and,	as	well	as	
appointing	Gavin	as	our	new	CFO,	we	have	also	added	a	
Senior Vice President of Technology and a Senior Vice President 
of Global Manufacturing & Supply Chain.
Governance
We are committed to high standards of governance 
and	continue	to	comply	in	all	material	respects	with	the	
UK Corporate Governance Code, despite it not being a 
requirement	for	an	AIM-listed	company.	In	addition,	we	
operate	a	robust	framework	of	systems	and	controls	to	
maintain high standards throughout the Company.
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 7.355 pence per 
share (FY 2016: 6.556 pence per share). Added to the 2017 
interim dividend of 2.825 pence per share, this brings the 
total dividend for the financial year ended 30 June 2017 
to 10.18 pence per share (FY 2016: 8.91 pence per share), 
representing an increase of 14.3% over the previous year.
Outlook
We	believe	we	are	well	placed	to	continue	to	gain	
market share from our leadership position in research 
antibodies and to continue to make progress in related 
markets.	We	remain	confident	that	we	have	the	right	
strategy and the right people to achieve our long-term 
goals and build significant value for all our stakeholders.

Our business model
6 Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 A year of progress
We	have	led	Abcam	further	toward	achieving	our	goal	
of becoming the most influential life sciences company for 
researchers 	 worldwide. 	 We 	 remain 	 the 	 market 	 leader 	 in 	 the	
primary 	 antibody 	 market 	 and 	 have 	 grown 	 above 	 market 	 in	
all our product categories and territories, despite a highly 
competitive landscape. This outcome reflects our clear 
growth 	 strategy, 	 strong 	 product 	 line 	 and 	 dedication 	 from	
our team.
Our strategy leads to long-term 
sustainable growth
FY	2017	was	another	year	of	good	progress	as	we	continue	
to 	 build 	 on 	 the 	 growth 	 strategy 	 that 	 we 	 announced 	 in 	 2014.	
Our	customer	feedback	has	never	been	stronger	and	we	
continue 	 to 	 make 	 market 	 share 	 gains 	 worldwide. 	 To 	 prepare	
for	further	growth,	we	have	made	substantial	investments	
in our systems and processes, our facilities and our people, 
and	we	continue	to	work	hard	to	ensure	these	investments	
support	our	long-term	growth	aspirations.	Underpinning	our	
transformation	is	the	solid	financial	foundation	we	have	
established. 	 Overall, 	 we 	 believe 	 the 	 changes 	 we 	 are 	 creating	
will	enable	us	to	double	the	scale	of	Abcam	from	2016	to	
2023 in terms of the life science research influence and 
commercial scale of the Group.
It has been a year of  
progress for Abcam 
as we have once again 
delivered on our financial 
goals. We have delivered  
10% constant currency 
revenue growth, meeting  
our full year guidance,  
while continuing to invest  
in the long-term future of  
the Company.

Strategic report
Chief Executive Officer’s review Our strategy leads to long-term 
sustainable growth continued
We 	 have 	 delivered 	 strong 	 revenue 	 growth, 	 with 	 all 	 geographic	
areas and main product categories performing at levels 
above 	 underlying 	 market 	 growth 	 rates. 	 In 	 a 	 year 	 with 	 political	
uncertainty in large markets such as the US and Europe, our 
business	has	remained	focused	on	serving	customers	well.	
Our history and strengths in digital marketing continue to 
support	our	business	well	and	we	are	making	increasing	
use	of	data	to	enhance	our	product	selection,	website	
and	marketing	in	order	to	attract	new	customers	and	
satisfy more needs of our existing customers.
Our research use-only product catalogue revenues 
at	reported	values	grew	to	£202.5m	(FY	2016:	£159.0m),	
a 27.4% increase over the previous year. By product type, 
we 	 continue 	 to 	 grow 	 primary 	 antibody 	 revenue 	 ahead 	 of 	 the	
global 	 market 	 growth 	 rate. 	 Our 	 market 	 leading 	 recombinant	
antibodies, including RabMAb
®
 rabbit monoclonal antibodies, 
are	major	contributors	to	that	success.	Constant	currency	
revenues from RabMAb
®
	 products 	 are 	 in 	 line 	 with 	 our 	 full 	 year	
expectations,	growing	by	over	25%,	and	now	represent	
£41.5m of our total £159.8m primary research antibody 
revenue. With over 11,000 RabMAb
®
 primary antibodies 
in	our	catalogue,	10,000	of	which	are	recombinant,	these	
and other recombinant antibodies are expected to continue 
to	play	an	important	part	in	our	future	growth.
Product quality is a priority for our customers and, therefore, 
a 	 major 	 focus 	 of 	 our 	 work 	 and 	 investment 	 at 	 Abcam. 	 We 	 are	
investing to increase the standards and breadth of product
validation, 	 including 	 over 	 900 	 products 	 that 	 now 	 benefit 	 from	
market leading knockout validation. Our investments in the 
latest antibody production technology mean that our 10,000 
recombinant antibodies ensure the highest standard of 
repeatability for researchers and drug development teams. 
We	continue	to	work	closely	with	our	suppliers	to	ensure	
that they meet our high standards.
Non-primary antibody revenues on a constant currency basis 
grew	16%,	aggregated	across	several	product	categories.	
Kits	and	assays	are	the	largest	sub-category	within	this	part	
of our product portfolio, representing approximately 60% of 
the	revenue.	Following	the	mid-year	revision	to	lower	growth	
targets	for	this	portfolio,	the	products	performed	within	our	
expectations	and	all	product	categories	within	this	group	
grew	at	double-digit	levels	versus	the	prior	year.
Kits	and	assays	remain	a	very	important	growth	opportunity	
for Abcam. These products contain all the reagents researchers 
need to run an experiment and save researchers considerable 
time. For example, our SimpleStep ELISA
®
 kit reduces the time 
it takes to run the simple ELISA experiment from approximately 
four 	 hours 	 to 	 just 	 ninety 	 minutes, 	 with 	 the 	 added 	 benefit 	 that 	
the	kit	minimises	potential	variability	between	experiments.	
We are investing and innovating to move our market leading 
antibodies into these products as rapidly as possible. In the 
last 	 year, 	 we 	 have 	 created 	 new 	 assay 	 products 	 from 	 integrating 
antibody and assay technologies from our recently acquired 
companies. These combinations resulted in the introduction 
of	approximately	500	new	products	including	matched	
antibody pairs, singleplex immunoassays, and multiplex 
immunoassays using the FirePlex
®
 particle platform.

Beyond	the	research	use	product	market	that	we	serve	
through 	 our 	 catalogue, 	 we 	 are 	 working 	 to 	 grow 	 our 	 custom 	
products	and	services	by	working	with	leading	diagnostic	
and 	 pharmaceutical 	 companies 	 worldwide. 	 Forecasts 	 estimate	
that the end market value of antibody and immunoassay use 
in 	 diagnostics 	 and 	 therapeutics 	 is 	 expected 	 to 	 grow 	 to 	 circa	
$80bn by 2022. We believe Abcam can address up to $5bn 
of that total through in vitro diagnostic (IVD) products, other 
antibodies and immunoassays and biological therapeutics. 
We have an emerging reputation for successfully partnering 
with 	 pharmaceutical, 	 diagnostic 	 and 	 instrument 	 companies.	
These 	 businesses 	 work 	 with 	 Abcam 	 to 	 develop 	 antibodies 	 and	
immunoassays that they then take to market. Abcam benefits 
from the relationships through opportunities to license, and 
from 	 downstream 	 milestones 	 and 	 potential 	 royalties, 	 as 	 well	
as from the opportunity to sell the research-grade version of 
the antibody or immunoassay into our core research markets 
via	our	website.	This	is	a	model	we	are	replicating	across	
many 	 commercial 	 agreements 	 around 	 the 	 world 	 to 	 establish	
future	growth	for	our	business.

Chief Executive Officer’s review continued Underlying markets growing
We	observed	single-digit	underlying	market	growth	for	our	
products	in	all	regions	and	customer	segments	with	one	
exception 	 – 	 China. 	 China 	 continues 	 to 	 invest 	 public 	 funds 	 to	
support 	 a 	 life 	 science 	 strategy 	 such 	 that 	 we 	 are 	 seeing 	 12–15%	
annual	revenue	growth	for	the	markets	our	products	serve.	
In our largest market, the US, it has been a year of uncertainty 
around	the	funding	environment	following	the	presidential	
election. This resulted in an eventual increase in National 
Institute	of	Health	(NIH)	funding	for	2017,	coupled	with	a	
buoyant biopharma cycle. In Europe, there has been increased 
funding but Brexit has caused some disruption to the UK 
market as researchers move to replace EU research funding 
with	domestic	sources.	Elsewhere	in	the	world,	the	markets	
continued	to	grow	but	growth	remained	relatively	low	
compared 	 to 	 the 	 major 	 three 	 of 	 the 	 US, 	 China 	 and 	 Europe.
Our five strategic priorities
• Grow	our	core	reagents	business	faster	than	the	market.
• Establish	new	growth	platforms.
• Scale organisation capabilities.
• Sustain attractive economics.
• Selectively pursue partnerships and acquisitions.

Business systems
Abcam 	 is 	 a 	 rapidly 	 growing 	 organisation 	 and 	 it 	 is 	 important 	 that	
we	have	the	IT	systems	infrastructure	and	business	processes	
to 	 support 	 this 	 growth. 	 We 	 are 	 investing 	 in 	 building 	 enhanced	
capabilities, processes and systems centred around the 
Oracle Cloud ERP system. 
We are putting significant emphasis on organisational 
preparation, training and transformation to support the 
improvements 	 that 	 the 	 ERP 	 system 	 will 	 make 	 in 	 the 	 way 	 we	
do	business	and	support	the	growth	that	we	are	working	to	
deliver. We are resolutely focused on delivering a high quality 
solution	that	is	scalable	and	will	deliver	future	efficiency	
improvements. 	 During 	 the 	 year, 	 we 	 have 	 chosen 	 to 	 adopt 	
additional functionality, including a Warehouse Management 
System, 	 and 	 we 	 have 	 successfully 	 implemented 	 the 	 HR 	 and	
certain customer service modules and are making good 
progress	towards	full	implementation	in	FY	2018.
UK facilities
We currently operate from three separate sites in Cambridge, 
which	are	not	only	at	the	end	of	their	leases,	but	also	at	the	
end of their operational lives. We have started construction 
of 	 our 	 new 	 HQ 	 facility 	 and 	 we 	 are 	 looking 	 forward 	 to 	 relocating	
to 	 the 	 Cambridge 	 Biomedical 	 Campus 	 in 	 early 	 2019, 	 following	
completion of the build and fit-out.
Leadership Team
Over 	 the 	 year 	 we 	 have 	 completed 	 the 	 hiring 	 of 	 our 	 Executive	
Leadership	Team	and	are	confident	that	we	have	the	right	
team and expertise in place to lead Abcam in our next stage 
of development.
Outlook
There	is	significant	momentum	across	the	business	as	we	
continue 	 to 	 grow 	 our 	 revenues 	 ahead 	 of 	 the 	 market 	 in 	 every	
region 	 we 	 serve. 	 The 	 investments 	 we 	 are 	 making 	 are 	 enabling	
Abcam 	 to 	 grow 	 and 	 achieve 	 the 	 stretching 	 targets 	 we 	 have	
set	for	ourselves	and	we	believe	the	Company	is	in	a	strong	
position for a successful future. Based on our clearly defined 
strategy,	together	with	our	history	of	results,	we	expect	our	
total	revenue	growth	for	FY	2018	to	be	similar	to	FY	2017’s	
total	growth	rate.

Strategic report The global life science research tools 
market is estimated to be $2.7bn, of which 
the primary antibody research sector is 
estimated at $906m. 
Academic funding is variable across countries, but good 
increases 	 have 	 been 	 seen 	 this 	 year 	 in 	 many 	 regions, 	 with 	 EU	
and	US	funding	increasing	by	6%	compared	with	2016.	The	
pharma and biotechnology industries continue to be steady 
end 	 market, 	 supported 	 by 	 continuing 	 R&D 	 investments 	 in 	 new	
medicines and in vitro diagnostics (IVDs). In particular, IVD 
market	forecasts	estimate	the	market	to	grow	to	$80bn	by	
2022	and	we	are	looking	to	further	develop	our	custom	
and licensing capabilities to address this market.
Key markets and trends:
Key growth drivers
• Increased funding for life science research, particularly 
to drive healthcare research into chronic diseases 
associated 	 with 	 an 	 ageing 	 population 	 and 	 the 	 ongoing	
threat from communicable diseases.
• Improved economic activity in certain regions, 
particularly in the Middle East and Asia.
• Technological and scientific advances such as 
development of advanced antibody manufacturing 
technologies and the emergence of revolutionary 
genome editing technologies such as CRISPR that 
allow	us	to	speed	up	antibody	production	and	
improve validation.
• Demand for more accurate and reliable 
antibodies and research tools by the research 
community to address the reproducibility crisis 
facing scientific research.
• Substantial	funding	for	collaborations	between	
private	and	public	organisations	which	improves	
funding in certain research areas, e.g. NIH’s BRAIN 
Initiative, Cancer Moonshot and the Precision 
Medicine Initiatives in the US and China.
The Americas
US academic funding has seen a $2bn increase in NIH 
funding	this	year,	with	the	21st	Century	Cures	Act	providing	
additional funding on top of the NIH budget. Cancer and 
Alzheimer’s disease are receiving the biggest increases in 
funding,	with	a	cancer-focused	precision	medicine	initiative	
being launched this year that may translate to increased 
opportunities in the IVD space. 
There is uncertainty regarding the science budget beyond 
September	with	the	threat	that	the	Trump	administration	will	
try	to	cut	budgets	by	20%;	however,	Abcam’s	business	model	
means	that	it	is	well	placed	to	mitigate	any	budget	cuts.	
Historically, NIH funding changes have had limited impact 
on	Abcam’s	growth	rate.

Our markets Government investment into research remains flat for the fiscal 
year starting April 2017. Japan’s declining population, meaning 
fewer 	 researchers, 	 alongside 	 the 	 lack 	 of 	 increased 	 budget 	 for 	
science and technology has meant that Japan’s global share 
of 	 scientific 	 publications 	 is 	 decreasing. 	 However, 	 research 	 grants	
are	increasing	at	the	top	academic	institutions,	with	the	top	
five national universities receiving almost half of the JPY100bn 
–	approximately	$900m	–	funding.
Japan
Academic	research	in	China	continues	to	be	well	funded,	
and a substantial precision medicine initiative is beginning 
in 	 China 	 that 	 it 	 is 	 estimated 	 will 	 provide 	 $9.2bn 	 primarily 	 for	
cancer research, potentially presenting opportunities in the 
IVD 	 space. 	 China’s 	 pharmaceutical 	 industry 	 is 	 also 	 growing	
strongly, having increased 10.4% from 2015 to 2016. 
China
The	Asia	Pacific	region	has	seen	strong	economic	growth	
overall, and many countries in the region have increased 
investment in scientific funding. In South Korea, scientific 
research	funding	remains	very	high	and	we	are	benefiting	
from strong investment by conglomerates, private institutes 
and academia. Singapore has increased spending in R&D 
in recent years to advance academic research into a 
commercial 	 setting, 	 and 	 we 	 are 	 growing 	 well 	 in 	 this 	 country	
as a result of our customer acquisition strategy.
Asia Pacific
EU academic research funding increased strongly this year. 
The total European Research Council (ERC) budget increased 
to 	 €1.8bn, 	 an 	 8% 	 increase 	 from 	 2016, 	 with 	 approximately 	 €600m	
available 	 for 	 new 	 life 	 science 	 projects 	 in 	 2017. 	 Currently 	 Germany,	
UK 	 and 	 France 	 receive 	 the 	 most 	 EU 	 funding, 	 winning 	 17%, 	 16%	
and 13% of EU life science grants, respectively. With the 
continuation of the Horizon 2020 programme, funding in 
the	European	Union	is	set	to	continue	to	grow	until	2020.	
The impending exit of the UK from the EU has created 
uncertainty	around	science	funding	in	the	UK,	which	has	 
the 	 potential 	 to 	 slow 	 demand. 	 However, 	 the 	 UK 	 government	
has guaranteed to replace funding for existing EU research 
projects, 	 and 	 we 	 do 	 not 	 currently 	 believe 	 that 	 Brexit 	 will 	 lead	
to a material adverse impact on results.

14 Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report
Our KPIs Abcam’s risk management strategy is to identify, 
assess and effectively mitigate any existing or 
emerging significant risks that it faces in accordance 
with the Group’s risk appetite. It is recognised, 
however, that no risk management strategy 
can provide absolute assurance against loss.
Risk management framework
Our	risk	management	framework	provides	the	structure	
within	which	principal	risks	affecting	our	business	are	managed,	
and sets tone, culture and appetite for risk.
The Board is accountable for carrying out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group, including those threatening 
its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity. 
The	Board,	in	conjunction	with	the	Audit	and	Risk	Committee,	
performed	the	latest	full	assessment	in	June	2017,	reviewing	the	
progress of agreed risk mitigation strategies and any changes to 
the materiality of key risks, to ensure that the overall risk profile 
of the Group is appropriate to its strategy and risk appetite. 
The principal risks form the backbone of the risk register that is 
maintained by the Group Executive Leadership Team. The Audit 
and	Risk	Committee	reviews	and	approves	the	adequacy	and	
effectiveness of risk management and internal controls, including 
the	risk	register,	and	reviews	changes	in	risks	and	mitigations	
regularly	with	formal	review	by	the	full	Board	twice	a	year.
Management is responsible for the initial identification and 
evaluation of risks and the implementation of policies and 
procedures intended to reduce risk. It implements mitigating 
actions in relation to significant risks, embeds risk management 
in the internal controls system and cultivates the tone of an open 
and receptive approach to addressing business risk across the 
Group. 	 Risk 	 policies 	 are 	 regularly 	 reviewed 	 with 	 regard 	 to 	 current	
market conditions and the Group’s activities. A number of 
compliance initiatives have been rolled out over the course 
of	the	year,	including	our	new	employee	code	of	conduct	
called	‘How	we	do	things	at	Abcam’.
Subsidiary companies and Group functions, supported by the 
internal audit function, are responsible for identifying, assessing 
and	managing	risks	within	their	office	or	function.	The	Group	
financial management team has added responsibilities to 
challenge	and	review	the	risks	identified,	review	changes	in	the	
business	that	may	give	rise	to	new	risks	or	risk	areas,	and	to	ensure	
that significant risks are escalated to the risk register.
As a result of the above, the Board believes it has taken all 
reasonable steps to satisfy itself that the risk management 
process is effective and fit for purpose.
Risk appetite
Risk appetite describes the types and amount of risk that the 
Board	is	willing	to	take	or	accept	to	achieve	our	strategic	and	
operational 	 objectives, 	 and 	 serves 	 as 	 a 	 boundary 	 to 	 our 	 strategy.	
Our culture is based on the entrepreneurial and collaborative 
spirit 	 that 	 has 	 supported 	 the 	 rapid 	 growth 	 of 	 the 	 business 	 to 	 date.	
The Board aims to enable the scalability of the business by 
reinforcing	appropriate	controls	without	hindering	its	ability	
to	continue	to	grow	and	take	advantage	of	opportunities.	
In doing so, it is committed to maintaining high ethical standards 
and 	 complying 	 with 	 the 	 applicable 	 laws 	 and 	 regulations 	 of 	 the	
countries	in	which	it	operates.	Furthermore,	the	Group	has	no	
appetite for significant reputational risk or for not providing 
appropriate facilities and tools for our staff to operate effectively.
During 	 the 	 year, 	 the 	 Board 	 has 	 reviewed 	 and 	 approved 	 risk 	 appetite	
both 	 overall 	 and 	 in 	 relation 	 to 	 each 	 principal 	 risk 	 together 	 with 	 the	
mitigating actions. The updated risk appetite statements have 
been embedded in the risk register and the risk policy.
Principal risks
A summary of the principal risks, their linkage to our strategy 
and	an	explanation	of	how	the	Group	mitigates	each	risk	is	set	
out in the table on pages 16 to 19. Whilst the Group is exposed to 
some 	 risks 	 wider 	 than 	 those 	 listed, 	 the 	 Board 	 determined 	 that 	 the	
risks	previously	reported	in	the	2016	Annual	Report	were	still	the	
most material for the Group. In reaching this conclusion the Board 
discussed the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 (Code) 
requirements to give due regard to risks to the Group’s strategy. 
Although Brexit and the result of the last American presidential 
election have introduced more uncertainty into these business 
environments,	the	macroeconomic	risks	were	considered	to	be	
covered	within	the	breadth	of	the	existing	principal	risks.	At	this	
point, apart from the effect of the devaluation of Sterling, there 
are no immediate, material effects of Brexit on Abcam’s risk profile.
There	may	be	other	risks	and	uncertainties	which	are	unknown	to	
the 	 Group 	 or 	 which 	 could 	 become 	 material 	 in 	 the 	 future. 	 These 	 risks	
may cause the Group’s results to vary materially from historical 
and expected results.
Further additional information on the Group’s financial 
risk management strategy can be found in note 24 to the 
financial statements.

Longer-term viability statement 
The Code requires the Board to assess the future prospects of 
the 	 Group 	 over 	 a 	 period 	 longer 	 than 	 the 	 twelve 	 months 	 required	
by going concern provisions and to issue a ‘viability statement’. 
Last year the Board selected a five-year assessment period for the 
viability	statement	as	this	aligns	with	our	innovation	pipeline	and	
strategic 	 planning 	 window, 	 and 	 more 	 than 	 covers 	 the 	 period 	 with	
large 	 cash 	 outflows 	 on 	 live 	 major 	 capital 	 projects. 	 On 	 review, 	 the	
Board determined that this is still the most appropriate time period 
given our business model and strategy.
The	process	adopted	to	assess	viability	this	year	followed	that	
undertaken in 2016 and involved collaborative input from a range 
of business functions to model a series of theoretical ‘stress test’ 
scenarios linked to the Group’s principal risks. These scenarios included 
both significant adverse financial outcomes and operational failures. 
Consideration	was	given	to	the	impact	of	mitigations	as	well	as	
their interdependencies.
The	Audit	and	Risk	Committee	reviewed	the	process	before	
the	viability	evaluation	was	provided	to	the	Board	to	assist	
in its assessment.
The Directors have assessed the Group’s prospects and resilience 
with	reference	to	its	current	financial	position	and	prospects,	
its recent and historical financial performance and forecasts, 
the Board’s risk appetite, and the principal risks and mitigating 
factors. The Group is operationally and financially strong and has 
a track record of consistently generating profits and cash, and 
this is expected to continue. 
Based on this assessment, the Directors confirm that they have 
a	reasonable	expectation	that	the	Company	will	be	able	to	
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the next five years.

Abcam fails to acquire 
businesses	which	could	bring	
added value to Abcam
Abcam attempts to acquire

distraction of management 
from more valuable initiatives
Abcam does not identify risks in 
the 	 acquired 	 business 	 that 	 would	
have prevented acquisition
The valuation of the acquired 
business	is	not	justified	through	
failure to hit technical targets,

Strategic report Our communities
Abcam 	 has 	 a 	 proud 	 history 	 of 	 involvement 	 with 	 local 	 communities	
by	supporting	and	partnering	with	organisations	that	align	with	
our goal of helping advance life science research. We aim to help 
communities through programmes that inspire the next generation 
of scientists, and by supporting life science research through 
corporate giving and fundraising activities.
Partnering with In2Science to encourage 
the next generation of scientists
In2Science is a charitable organisation that encourages students 
from	low	socio-economic	and	under-represented	backgrounds	
to	pursue	scientific	careers.	The	two-week	programme	provides	
placements 	 at 	 leading 	 research 	 organisations 	 for 	 students 	 to 	 work	
on cutting-edge scientific research: 78% of students that go through 
the programme progress onto science degrees and STEM careers. 
Abcam	is	proud	to	be	partnering	with	In2Science	and	this	
year launched an image competition for the students during 
their	research	placements.	The	entries	were	outstanding	and	
demonstrated 	 high 	 engagement 	 of 	 the 	 students 	 with 	 their 	 projects.
In	2017,	In2Science	will	be	expanding	from	London	to	include	
programmes	in	Harlow	and	Cambridge,	and	Abcam	will	be	
working	closely	with	the	charity	to	launch	a	new	bespoke	
mentoring programme.
Charitable donations
This 	 year 	 we 	 have 	 made 	 charitable 	 donations 	 exceeding 	 £70,000,	
including donations to local charities including Jimmy’s Night Shelter, 
In2Science,	and	Breast	Cancer	Now.
We have also supported charities through fundraising activities 
and volunteering. In the UK a team of employees ran the Cambridge 
half	marathon	in	aid	of	Breast	Cancer	Now,	raising	over	£8,000	
and our US offices are actively involved in volunteering, and this 
year	have	volunteered	with	Habitat	for	Humanity	to	help	build	a	
home for families in South Boston and organised a holiday toy 
drive to provide gifts for families in need.
Our people
Attracting and retaining the best talent is crucial to the success of 
our 	 business. 	 During 	 the 	 year, 	 we 	 invested 	 in 	 a 	 new 	 global 	 careers	
website 	 which 	 won 	 the 	 best 	 website 	 at 	 the 	 In-house 	 Recruitment	
Awards	in	November	2016.	We	have	started	to	roll	out	a	new	
global	on-boarding	process	where	senior	leaders	welcome	all	
new	employees	and	spend	time	explaining	our	unique	culture	
and 	 what 	 we 	 expect 	 of 	 people. 	 To 	 improve 	 how 	 we 	 communicate	
we	launched	a	new	intranet	where	we	regularly	share	stories	
and updates on business performance, employee events and 
achievements. We have started to publish detailed infographics 
celebrating key achievements and results over the course of the 
year.	Every	quarter	we	hold	our	Global	Conversation	–	a	meeting	
where	we	present	business	updates	and	recognise	employee	
and team achievements. These are broadcast live and employees 
both	present	at	the	meeting	and	watching	in	other	global	
locations can ask questions. Employees across the globe can 
watch	live,	plus	they	are	recorded	and	posted	on	our	intranet	
for	anyone	not	able	to	join	live.	They	are	also	translated	for	
employees	where	English	is	not	their	first	language.
We	provide	employees	with	an	anonymous	question	service	
“Ask	Alan”	–	allowing	anyone	to	send	a	question	on	any	topic	
to the CEO. With the launch of our code of conduct this year 
we 	 introduced 	 a 	 global 	 hotline 	 for 	 raising 	 concerns 	 and 	 questions.	
We have continued to listen to our people through our annual 
all-employee 	 survey 	 which 	 this 	 year 	 had 	 a 	 response 	 rate 	 of 	 nearly	
90%	and	saw	a	rise	on	employee	Net	Promoter	Score	of	over	
20 	 points. 	 We 	 have 	 expanded 	 our 	 staff 	 forums 	 – 	 adding 	 permanent	
ones	in	the	US	as	well	as	the	UK.	These	give	us	additional	
opportunities to listen to our people.
Underpinning our ambition to become the most influential 
life science company for researchers worldwide is Abcam’s 
reputation for ethical business practices, and behaving 
in a socially and environmentally responsible way.
Our sustainability activities are around three key areas: 
our communities our people
health, safety and 
the environment

Sustainability Meet our first Trailblazers
This	year	saw	the	launch	of	Trailblazers	–	our	new	apprenticeship	
scheme that gives people the opportunity to become qualified 
within 	 a 	 working 	 environment, 	 while 	 helping 	 us 	 to 	 grow 	 talent 	 within	
the 	 business. 	 We 	 will 	 be 	 hosting 	 apprentices 	 in 	 Finance, 	 HR, 	 customer	
experience, the lab and logistics.
We	have	already	welcomed	our	first	two	apprentices,	based	in	
the lab.
Enabling our employees to serve customers faster
We	have	been	reviewing	and	improving	our	global	systems	and	
processes 	 to 	 ensure 	 they 	 fit 	 our 	 future 	 needs 	 as 	 we 	 continue 	 to 	 grow	
at	pace.	By	implementing	a	new	ERP	system,	we	hope	to	build	
the foundations of a smarter, faster and more scalable organisation.
This	long-term	project	is	in	its	implementation	phase:	this	year	
we 	 have 	 released 	 the 	 HR 	 modules 	 that 	 are 	 focused 	 on 	 self-service	
to 	 allow 	 employees 	 and 	 leaders 	 access 	 to 	 people 	 information	
quickly 	 and 	 has 	 allowed 	 us 	 to 	 restructure 	 the 	 HR 	 function 	 to 	 support	
the global business more effectively. We have also released modules 
that	integrate	our	sales,	service	and	marketing	functions,	allowing	
us to understand and meet customer needs better and streamlining 
our processes globally. 
Health, safety and the environment
We 	 provide 	 a 	 fair 	 and 	 safe 	 work 	 environment 	 for 	 employees 	 and 	
ensure	we	follow	legal	requirements	and	best	practice	standards.	
Following	sustainable	practices	is	important	to	Abcam’s	success	
and	we	continue	to	look	for	ways	to	improve	our	environmental	
impact and operational efficiency.
Gold award for sustainable travel 
We 	 are 	 constantly 	 working 	 to 	 improve 	 and 	 encourage 	 sustainable	
travel,	and	this	year	we	were	rewarded	with	a	gold	sustainable	
travel	initiative	award	at	the	Travel	Plan	Award	ceremony	in	
Cambridge,	UK.	This	award	reflects	initiatives	introduced	in	the	
past	year	such	as	branded	cycle	wear,	a	new	Lifeshare	website	
and 	 cycle 	 to 	 work 	 schemes, 	 and 	 also 	 how 	 engaged 	 and 	 committed	
our employees are to sustainable travel.
Investing in our locations
We 	 strive 	 to 	 house 	 our 	 rapidly 	 growing 	 workforce 	 in 	 facilities 	 that	
are	pleasant	and	safe.	We	have	made	good	progress	with	our	
global	offices	this	year.	Construction	of	our	new	Cambridge	HQ	
has 	 begun. 	 The 	 new 	 HQ 	 will 	 bring 	 our 	 Cambridge-based 	 operations	
and	employees	under	one	roof	in	a	new	state-of-the-art	facility.	
The 	 new 	 HQ 	 has 	 been 	 designed 	 with 	 a 	 strong 	 vision 	 for 	 the 	 future,	
and	will	improve	efficiency	across	all	business	functions.
We have also refurbished or expanded many of our existing 
facilities:	we	have	completed	refurbishment	of	the	AxioMx	site	
in Branford and the Boston office, and expanded our Shanghai 
and Eugene offices.
We	provide	employees	with	a	positive	and	healthy	work	
environment,	where	they	are	listened	to	and	recognised	for	
their contributions. In the UK, all permanent employees have the 
opportunity	to	share	in	the	success	of	Abcam	via	the	award	of	
free shares and can participate in our Share Incentive Plan (SIP). 
As 	 of 	 June 	 2017, 	 38% 	 of 	 UK 	 employees 	 were 	 enrolled 	 in 	 our 	 Share	
Incentive Plan.
How we do things at Abcam
Trust	is	a	fundamental	element	of	our	business.	We	want	to	
be	valued	for	the	high	quality	research	tools	we	provide	and	
trusted 	 for 	 the 	 way 	 in 	 which 	 we 	 work. 	 Underpinning 	 our 	 ambition	
is Abcam’s reputation for ethical business practices and high 
standards of integrity.
We 	 have 	 launched 	 our 	 code 	 of 	 conduct, 	 called 	 “How 	 we 	 do	
things 	 at 	 Abcam”. 	 This 	 defines 	 who 	 we 	 are 	 as 	 a 	 company, 	 how	
we	make	decisions,	what	standards	we	expect	and	how	we	
behave	amongst	ourselves	and	with	others.	All	of	our	people	
have been trained on this. We have also launched codes of 
conduct	for	our	suppliers	and	distributors,	which	clearly	state	
our expectation that our suppliers and distributors demonstrate 
a	culture	that	reinforces	ethical	and	lawful	behaviours.
I have always been passionate  
and enthusiastic about science  
and cannot wait to develop my 
understanding and knowledge.  
I look forward to contributing 
to Abcam and am very grateful  
to be given this amazing opportunity.

Strategic report
Gross margins
Reported	gross	margin	was	in	line	with	the	prior	year	at	70.1%	
(FY	2016:	70.2%).	However,	this	reported	number	was	after	the	
reclassification of goods-in processing costs from administration 
and management expenses in the year. Restating FY 2016 gross 
margin on a like for like basis results in a gross margin of 69.2% 
for the prior year, an expansion of 90 basis points in FY 2017. 
The expansion in gross margin comes from both product mix 
and productivity improvements across our manufacturing sites.
Administration and management expenses
We have continued to invest in Abcam’s capabilities, 
people, processes and systems to support and drive our medium 
and	long-term	growth	and	this	has	increased	our	cost	base.	
Administration 	 and 	 management 	 expenses 	 were 	 also 	 impacted	
by 	 the 	 effect 	 of 	 our 	 forward 	 currency 	 contracts, 	 because 	 hedging	
the positive effect of currency rates on revenue results in an 
offsetting charge to administrative costs. Administration and 
management expenses increased by £17.0m (28%) to £78.4m. 
Included in the increase are:
• £11.4m	owing	to	the	relative	weakness	of	Sterling	consisting	
of £3.5m in relation to costs denominated in the currency 
of 	 the 	 Group’s 	 overseas 	 entities 	 (which, 	 when 	 translated 	 into 	 a	
weaker 	 Sterling 	 results 	 in 	 higher 	 charges 	 to 	 expenses), 	 and 	 £7.9m	
of	net	currency	losses	from	forward	selling	currency	contracts	
together	with	transaction	and	translational	currency	impacts;
• £3.0m additional performance-related remuneration charges 
driven	by	the	strong	Group	results	in	the	year;
• £1.4m spend to further strengthen commercial and support 
teams	as	part	of	building	business	scalability,	with	key	people	
being recruited for IVD, an area of future strategic importance, 
and marketing teams supporting the RabMAb
®
 and core 
primaries	product	categories;	and
• £2.0m cost increase in global operations and logistics, related 
to the increase in revenue volumes and organisation structure 
improvements, including securing key senior roles to build in-house 
expertise in global operational processes and increased premises 
space to accommodate expansion of operations, and the costs 
associated 	 with 	 closing 	 a 	 small 	 reagent 	 manufacturing 	 facility 	 in	
Bristol 	 following 	 a 	 review 	 of 	 the 	 Group’s 	 manufacturing 	 footprint.
We	have	realised	one-off	benefits	within	administrative	and	
management expenses during the year comprising of a release 
of 	 bad 	 debt 	 provision 	 of 	 £0.7m 	 following 	 an 	 update 	 to 	 the 	 Group’s	
historical	write-off	experience,	£2.2m	reclassification	of	goods-in	
processing costs to cost of sales and £0.9m re-assessment of 
contingent 	 consideration 	 and 	 fees 	 in 	 line 	 with 	 the 	 final 	 settlement	
of our contingent consideration liabilities relating to the acquisition 
of AxioMx in November 2015.
Research and development expenditure
Research and development (R&D) expenditure relates to the 
development 	 of 	 new 	 products, 	 as 	 well 	 as 	 costs 	 incurred 	 in 	 identifying	
and implementing production process improvements. These costs 
do not meet the requirements to be capitalised as an intangible 
asset and are therefore expensed through the income statement.
Whilst total R&D expenditure increased by £5.8m to £18.6m 
(FY	2016:	£12.8m)	there	were	certain	one-off	costs	within	this	
total. These include the effect of exchange rate movements 
that	contributed	£1.1m	of	the	increase;	the	amortisation	of	
acquisition-related 	 intangible 	 assets 	 which 	 increased 	 by 	 £1.9m	
due to the full year impact of the assets acquired as part of 
the AxioMx Inc acquisition in FY16 and the FirePlex
®
 platform 
(previously held as in progress and therefore not amortised), 
and a one-off £1.3m prior year R&D tax credit in FY 2016. 
Following 	 these 	 adjustments 	 the 	 underlying 	 increase 	 in 	 R&D	
costs	was	£1.5m,	predominantly	from	the	full	year	impact	
of 	 AxioMx 	 costs 	 (compared 	 with 	 only 	 eight 	 months 	 in 	 FY 	 2016),	
including increased resource and materials to support the 
pipeline of future product development and increased 
depreciation charges from capitalised development costs.
The Group remains focused on improving the quality of 
its product catalogue and invested £0.9m during the year, 
sustaining a similar level of investment as in the prior year.
Investing in infrastructure, systems and processes
We are investing in our IT systems infrastructure, capabilities 
and business processes and have selected Oracle Cloud as our 
core ERP system. We had targeted a full implementation of the 
ERP	system	in	late	2017.	We	now	expect	the	remaining	modules	
to be implemented in FY 2018. As a result of the incremental 
functionality 	 and 	 the 	 extended 	 project 	 timelines 	 we 	 have 	 chosen	
to	invest	in,	we	expect	the	total	cost	of	the	project	to	be	in	the	
region	of	£44m	to	£46m,	split	between	capital	expenditure	
of £29m to £31m and operating expenses of £15m.
In 	 FY 	 2017 	 with 	 the 	 ramp-up 	 of 	 work 	 performed 	 on 	 the 	 Oracle	
Cloud 	 ERP 	 project, 	 we 	 incurred 	 capital 	 expenditure 	 of 	 £10.6m	
(FY 2016: £5.5m) and incremental operating costs of £4.4m 
(FY	2016:	£4.0m),	as	well	as	depreciation	of	£0.6m	on	the	
modules fully implemented and deployed in the year. 
We are planning to relocate from our current premises in Cambridge 
to 	 a 	 new, 	 purpose-built 	 HQ 	 on 	 the 	 Cambridge 	 Biomedical 	 Campus	
in early 2019. We entered into an agreement for a 20-year lease in 
FY 2017 for the building. As previously announced, the total build 
cost	will	be	in	the	region	of	£46.3m	with	Abcam	contributing	
approximately £16m. Additionally, professional fees, laboratory 
and 	 office 	 design 	 costs, 	 and 	 office 	 fit-out 	 costs 	 will 	 be 	 in 	 the 	 region	
of	£8m.	During	the	year	we	have	spent	approximately	£1.1m	of	
capital	expenditure	on	our	new	global	HQ	and	also	transferred	
£6.1m	to	an	escrow	account	to	partly	fund	our	element	of	the	
build costs.
We have also expanded our Branford, Connecticut, site during 
the year to enhance the manufacturing capacity of our AxioMx 
business	and,	as	noted	above,	we	have	made	significant	
investment in the headcount of our support, operational 
and commercial functions.
Earnings and tax
Reported	profit	before	tax	for	the	year	was	£51.9m	
(FY	2016:	£45.4m).	This	was	after	finance	costs	of	£3.4m	
(FY	2016:	£1.1m)	in	relation	to	the	unwind	of	the	discount	
on	contingent	consideration	and	fees	associated	with	the	
early settlement during the year of the remaining contingent 
consideration liability from the AxioMx acquisition.
After taking into account the acquisition-related income and 
costs,	incremental	costs	associated	with	the	ERP	improvements,	
and the tax losses relating to the Epitomics acquisition claimed 
in	the	year,	the	reported	effective	tax	rate	would	be	18.3%	
(FY 2016: 17.6%).
Adjusted 	 profit 	 before 	 tax 	 for 	 the 	 year 	 was 	 £64.6m, 	 on 	 which	
the	effective	tax	rate	was	19.5%,	which	includes	a	one-off	1.9%	
rate reduction from £1.3m of prior year and one off tax charge 
adjustments	(FY	2016:	£53.8m	and	16.0%	respectively,	which	
included a one-off 5.2% rate reduction from £2.8m of prior year 
tax 	 charge 	 adjustments). 	 Group 	 profits 	 arise 	 in 	 the 	 UK, 	 the 	 US 	 and	
other overseas territories and as a consequence the effective tax 
rate	is	a	blend	of	the	varying	tax	rates	in	different	jurisdictions. 24 Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Our financials continued
Earnings and tax continued
Basic	earnings	per	share	(EPS)	were	20.90	pence	(FY	2016:	
18.61 pence) on a profit after tax of £42.4m (FY 2016: £37.4m), 
with	adjusted	EPS	of	25.66	pence	(FY	2016:	22.45	pence)	on	an	
adjusted 	 profit 	 after 	 tax 	 of 	 £52.0m 	 (FY 	 2016: 	 £45.2m). 	 The 	 adjusting	
items are disclosed in the Alternative Performance Measures section.
Balance sheet
Goodwill and other intangibles
Goodwill	at	30	June	2017	was	£115.5m	(FY	2016:	£112.5m).	
The increase of £3.0m is related to exchange rate movements 
due to the location of businesses acquired being predominantly 
based in the United States. The Directors have performed the 
required	impairment	test	and	no	impairment	was	necessary.	
For more details, please see note 12.
Other	intangible	assets	at	30	June	2017	were	£73.6m	
(FY 2016: £70.2m). The increase primarily reflects capitalisation 
of 	 software 	 costs 	 as 	 part 	 of 	 the 	 Group’s 	 global 	 ERP 	 improvement	
project	and	exchange	rate	movements	arising	on	assets	where	
the	functional	currency	of	the	entity	to	which	the	asset	belongs	
is not Sterling.
The amortisation charge on acquisition-related intangible assets 
was 	 £5.9m 	 (FY 	 2016: 	 £3.7m). 	 £1.5m 	 of 	 the 	 increase 	 was 	 due 	 to 	 starting	
amortisation of FirePlex
®
 technology at the beginning of the year 
with	the	remaining	increase	mainly	coming	from	exchange	rate	
movements as the functional currency of these assets is US Dollars. 
The 	 amortisation 	 charge 	 on 	 the 	 other 	 intangible 	 assets 	 was 	 £3.8m 	
(FY 2016: £3.8m) including £0.6m of accelerated amortisation of 
existing 	 software 	 which 	 was 	 replaced 	 by 	 the 	 ERP 	 implementation	
(FY	2016:	£1.3m)	which	is	included	within	the	incremental	costs	
of the ERP improvements.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment additions of £10.2m (FY 2016: £8.0m) 
have been made in the year. This reflects continued investment in 
support 	 of 	 our 	 growth 	 strategy, 	 with 	 £3.6m 	 spent 	 on 	 improvements 	 to	
research and manufacturing sites including an investment of £2.4m 
in significant expansion of our Branford, Connecticut, site and £3.6m 
on continued development of the Group’s product catalogue.
The capital expenditure figure above includes a £1.1m contribution 
to 	 the 	 initial 	 ground 	 preparation 	 and 	 fit-out 	 work 	 for 	 our 	 HQ 	 building	
(FY 2016: £0.6m).
Non-current liabilities
Consideration payable on the acquisition of AxioMx included an 
element	of	performance-based	payments;	a	contingent	liability	
of	£10.9m	reflecting	the	expected	future	payment	was	included	
in non-current liabilities at 30 June 2016. During the year an early 
settlement 	 of 	 certain 	 milestones 	 was 	 negotiated 	 and 	 performance	
against	the	other	outstanding	milestones	was	met.	Consequently	
there 	 is 	 no 	 further 	 liability 	 associated 	 with 	 this 	 acquisition. 	 See 	 note 	 24	
on page 91 for further details.
Cash flow
Strong cash generation from the business continued in the year 
resulting 	 in 	 cash 	 inflow 	 from 	 operations 	 of 	 £66.4m 	 (FY 	 2016: 	 £47.3m)	
and 	 free 	 cash 	 flow 	 of 	 £41.1m 	 (FY 	 2016: 	 £31.7m), 	 including 	 favourable	
working 	 capital 	 movements 	 of 	 £4.7m. 	 A 	 reconciliation 	 of 	 the 	 adjusted	
measure is included in the Alternative Performance Measures section.
Cash 	 outflow 	 on 	 investment 	 activities 	 of 	 £33.0m 	 (FY 	 2016: 	 £21.5m)	
includes £9.8m in relation to the settlement of the remaining 
contingent consideration and fees from the AxioMx acquisition 
(FY 	 2016: 	 outflow 	 of 	 £6.3m 	 for 	 the 	 initial 	 acquisition 	 consideration),	
and	additional	spend	compared	with	FY	2016	of	£5.7m	for	the	
step-up in capital activity for the ERP improvements and on the 
new	HQ	building.
In 	 relation 	 to 	 the 	 new 	 HQ 	 building, 	 £6.1m 	 has 	 been 	 paid 	 into 	 an	
escrow	account	in	accordance	with	the	agreement	for	lease	
terms.	This	is	excluded	from	cash	and	is	disclosed	within	other	
receivables on the balance sheet.
The 	 cash 	 and 	 cash 	 equivalents 	 position 	 was 	 £84.8m 	 (FY 	 2016: 	 £70.7m	
including term deposits), giving a net increase of £14.1m. The term 
deposits	have	matured	during	the	year	and	there	was	no	bank	
debt at 30 June 2017.
Looking forward
The 	 revenue 	 growth 	 this 	 year 	 and 	 in 	 previous 	 years 	 is 	 a 	 measure 	
of the continued success of our strategy and provides a solid 
foundation	as	we	continue	to	invest	in	the	capabilities,	systems	
and people at Abcam. These investments and our financial strength 
will	enable	us	to	continue	to	deliver	against	our	commitments	to	
grow 	 revenue 	 sustainably 	 and 	 continue 	 to 	 fulfil 	 our 	 mission 	 to 	 help	
life science researchers discover more.

Alternative performance measures
The	Group’s	performance	is	assessed	using	a	number	of	financial	measures	which	are	not	defined	under	IFRS	(the	financial	reporting	
framework	applied	by	the	Group).	These	measures	are	therefore	considered	alternative	performance	measures	(APMs).
Management 	 uses 	 the 	 adjusted 	 or 	 alternative 	 measures 	 as 	 a 	 part 	 of 	 their 	 internal 	 financial 	 performance 	 monitoring 	 and 	 when 	 assessing	
the future impact of operating decisions.
The	measures	allow	more	effective	year-on-year	comparison	and	identification	of	core	business	trends	by	removing	the	impact	of	
items occurring either outside the normal course of operations or as a result of intermittent activities such as a corporate acquisition. 
The	principles	to	identify	adjusting	items	have	been	applied	on	a	basis	consistent	with	previous	years.
The	measures	used	in	the	financial	review	are	defined	in	the	table	below	and	reconciliations	to	the	nearest	related	IFRS	measure	are

55 Directors’ report I am pleased to present the Corporate Governance Report 
for the year ended 30 June 2017.
Good corporate governance is fundamental to the success 
of our business. The Board and its Committees have a key role in 
our governance framework by providing external and independent 
support and challenge, understanding the views of shareholders 
and stakeholders, and ensuring that a culture of good governance 
is promoted across the business. Our continuing aim is to promote 
and maintain an environment of openness, transparency, 
accountability and responsibility.
This section of the Annual Report describes our corporate 
governance structures and processes and how they have 
been applied throughout the year ended 30 June 2017.
The UK Corporate Governance Code (Code)
Although as an AIM-listed company we are not required to 
comply with the Code, which sets out the principles of good 
practice in relation to corporate governance to be followed by 
Main Market-listed companies, the Board continues to believe 
that it is appropriate for Abcam to comply with the Code insofar 
as is practicable given the Company’s size and the nature of its 
operations. I am happy to report that we have complied with 
the principles and provisions of the 2016 edition of the Code in 
all material respects during the 2016/17 financial year.
My role as Chairman
My role is to ensure that the Board of Abcam operates effectively 
in delivering the long-term success of the Company. In fulfilling 
this role I seek to ensure that Board proceedings are conducted 
in such a way as to allow all Directors to have the opportunity to 
express their views openly and that, in particular, the Non-Executive 
Directors are able to provide constructive support and challenge 
to the Executive Leadership Team.
Culture and business ethics
Underpinning Abcam’s ambition to be valued for the high quality 
research tools we provide, and to be trusted for the way in which 
we work, is our reputation for ethical business practices and high 
standards of integrity. This has been a particular area of focus for 
Abcam this year. The Board has reviewed and approved a new 
code of conduct for staff, ‘How we do things at Abcam’, which has 
been produced in four languages and distributed to all employees 
across the business. We have launched compulsory online anti-bribery 
training for all employees in three languages, updated our gifts and 
hospitality policy, and enhanced our whistleblowing arrangements. 
We have also launched codes of conduct for our suppliers and 
distributors which clearly state our expectation that our suppliers 
and distributors demonstrate a culture that reinforces ethical 
and lawful behaviours.
Capital investment projects
The Board and the Audit and Risk Committee have received 
regular progress updates on the implementation of our new 
enterprise resource planning (ERP) system during the year, with 
a particular focus on risks related to the quality, cost and timing 
of delivery of the project. We are very pleased with the manner 
in which the project has been managed, and the operational 
and strategic benefits that the system will deliver as it is embedded 
throughout the business over the coming months.
The Board has also considered and discussed the project to design 
and build our new headquarters in Cambridge, again with a 
particular focus on the identification and mitigation of risks 
associated with the investment.
Succession planning and Board changes
The composition of the Board changed significantly during the 
year, as described in last year’s Nomination Committee Report. 
We appointed Gavin Wood to the Board to replace Jeff Iliffe as 
CFO, and three other Directors (Jim Warwick, Michael Ross and 
Anthony Martin) stepped down. The Nomination Committee has 
kept the composition of the Board and the Committees under 
review, and it is our intention to appoint an additional Non-Executive 
Director during 2018. However, we are satisfied that the current 
composition of the Board reflects an appropriate balance of skills, 
experience, knowledge and diversity, and remain confident that 
the Board and its Committees have operated effectively during 
the year. 
Succession planning and talent management have also remained 
firmly on the agenda of the Board and the Nomination Committee 
over the last year, and are detailed in the Nomination Committee

We regard regular Board and Committee evaluation as a 
valuable tool in maintaining and improving Board effectiveness. 
Following last year’s performance evaluation, it was decided to 
reduce the number of Board and Committee meetings in order 
to improve efficiency. This has proved to be a successful decision, 
allowing more focused and constructive debate at Board and 
Committee meetings.
This year I again conducted a thorough evaluation process, which 
was discussed in detail by the Board. Overall, we are satisfied that 
the Board is both efficient and effective with a good mix of skills 
and experience. There is always room for improvement and we 
have identified some areas around Board process to develop in 
the coming year. More detail about the Board evaluation and 
on some of the major matters considered by the Board and its 
Committees during the year can be found on pages 34 to 54.
The year ahead
Over the coming year, and in addition to our normal duties, the 
Board will focus on the continued implementation of the ERP system 
and progress on the development of our new headquarters in 
Cambridge. We will also monitor with interest the ongoing corporate 
governance debate in the UK and in particular any changes that 
may be recommended by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) 
to the Code. We believe that our governance framework is robust 
and effective, but recognise that we will need to consider any 
changes that it may be appropriate for us to address following any 
revisions to the Code. Moreover, we will continue to monitor, assess, 
and seek ways to underpin and improve our governance further.

Corporate governance
Corporate governance report continued Board meetings
The Board meets on six occasions in person during the year on a 
bi-monthly basis with two further scheduled telephone conferences. 
In addition, ad hoc meetings may be called to discuss urgent 
matters arising during the course of the year, or to approve the 
annual and interim accounts and dividends. A separate one-day 
strategy session is also held once a year to discuss the longer-term 
aspirations and objectives of the Company.
The culture of our Board meetings is to encourage rigorous debate. 
The NEDs constructively challenge the performance of management 
in meeting agreed goals and objectives and help develop proposals 
on strategy, priorities and, indeed, on occasion, tactics. More 
informal and extended discussions on strategy routinely take 
place before, after and in between bi-monthly Board meetings. 
The Chairman also holds meetings with the Non-Executive Directors 
without the Executive Directors present, and the Non-Executive 
Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, meet without 
the Chairman present at least annually to appraise the 
Chairman’s performance.
The Directors have access to the advice of the Company Secretary, 
who is a qualified solicitor and acts as secretary to the Board and 
its Committees.
Effectiveness
Information and support
The Chairman, the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary 
are responsible for making sure the Board members are updated 
with information concerning the state of the business and its 
performance, and information necessary for them to effectively 
discharge their duties and responsibilities, in a timely manner. The 
agenda for the following Board meeting is discussed at the end 
of each Board meeting so that Non-Executive Directors have the 
opportunity to influence agendas for Board discussions, ensuring 
the amount of time spent reviewing strategic and operational 
issues as well as governance is appropriately balanced.
In the event that Directors are unable to attend a meeting or a 
conference call, they are encouraged to relay their comments 
and, if necessary, to follow up with the Chairman or the CEO 
after the meeting.
Board development
Regular training is provided to the Board and, in particular, 
focus is given to explaining the complex and evolving science 
behind Abcam’s business, together with updates on corporate 
governance, including training on the Market Abuse Regulation, 
the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and anti-corruption legislation. 
On appointment to the Board, new Directors receive a 
comprehensive and tailored induction programme, the aim of 
which is to introduce them to key management and personnel 
across the business and to enhance their knowledge and 
understanding of the Company’s business, strategy and governance 
structure, as well as their own duties and responsibilities. This includes 
time with each of the Executive Directors and the Company 
Secretary, and with a wide range of senior management from 
across the business.
Director independence
The Board considers all Non-Executive Directors to be 
independent within the meaning of the Code, with the exception 
of Jonathan Milner who is a founder of Abcam and was an 
Executive Director of the Company until September 2014. 
In accordance with an established procedure, all Directors are 
required to notify the Board of any conflicts of interest, and a 
register of such interests is maintained by the Company Secretary 
and formally reviewed at Board meetings. Any planned changes 
to their interests, including directorships outside the Group, are 
notified to the Board. There were no relationships declared in the 
year which were considered to conflict with Abcam’s business 
and therefore there was nothing that was deemed to impact on 
the independence of the Directors. While the obligation to notify 
the Company is immediate, the Conflicts of Interest Register is 
maintained by the Company Secretary and is formally reviewed 
at each Board meeting.
In determining the independence of the Non-Executive Directors, 
the Board also considers the beneficial interests of such Directors 
in the share capital of the Company. Those interests are set out 
on page 49 and do not (other than in respect of Jonathan Milner, 
who is not considered independent), in the opinion of the Board, 
detract from their independent status.
Board evaluation
The Board undertakes a regular evaluation of its own performance 
which is led by the Chairman. One of the key findings of the 2016 
evaluation was that the number of Board and Committee meetings 
should be reduced to improve efficiency and the calendar 
of meetings was therefore amended to address this concern, 
principally reducing the number of formal Board meetings 
per year from eleven to six. 
The 2017 Board evaluation was again conducted by the 
Chairman by way of questionnaires and face to face meetings 
with each Director. The outcome of the evaluation process 
was presented to the Board in June. As well as confirming the 
improved efficiency of the Board and Committees as a result 
of the reduction in meeting frequency, the key findings of the 
evaluation process were:
• the composition of the Board is strong with a good mix of skills 
and experience, but the Board agrees it is right to appoint a 
further Non-Executive Director;
• Board dynamics are good, with all Directors able to share their 
views and challenge; and
• the balance of discussion between strategic, operational 
and governance matters is appropriate.
In addition, some areas of focus/improvement were identified 
for the 2017/18 financial year including enhancing some of the 
non-financial reporting to the Board and developing the process 
by which the impact of key decisions are reviewed.
35 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Abcam plc
Corporate governance Accountability
Risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group 
maintains a sound system of risk management and internal control 
in accordance with the Code. The system of risk management 
and internal control is kept under review by the Audit and Risk 
Committee, which reports to the Board on its findings. The Board 
considers and determines the principal risks faced by the Company, 
which are set out on pages 16 to 19, and also conducts an 
annual review of the effectiveness of the risk management 
and internal control systems.
Financial reporting
The Board is responsible for reviewing and approving the 
Annual Report and Accounts and the interim financial information, 
and for ensuring that these reports present a balanced assessment 
of the Group’s position. Drafts of these reports are provided to the 
Board in a timely manner and Directors’ feedback is discussed 
and incorporated where appropriate, prior to publication.
In addition, the Board ensures that controls over the financial 
reporting process and preparation of the consolidated accounts 
include extensive reviews by qualified and experienced individuals 
to ensure that all elements of the financial statements and 
appropriate disclosures are considered and accurately stated.
Whistleblowing procedures
The Group operates a whistleblowing policy which allows all 
employees to raise concerns to senior management in strict 
confidence about any unethical business practices, fraud, 
misconduct or wrongdoing. During the year, the Company has 
also implemented a new online whistleblowing portal and hotline, 
Speak Up, through which employees are encouraged to raise 
questions and concerns, anonymously if preferred. Speak Up is 
managed by a third party and not staffed by Abcam employees. 
Any concerns raised in accordance with the whistleblowing 
policy are reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee.
Disclosure Committee
The Disclosure Committee was established by the Board in July 2016 
to assist the Company in complying with its obligations relating to 
the disclosure and control of inside information under the Market 
Abuse Regulation and the AIM Rules. Its responsibilities include 
identifying inside information, ensuring the appropriate disclosure 
of inside information and maintenance of insider lists, and that 
effective internal controls are in place to keep any inside information 
confidential. The Disclosure Committee meets as and when is 
necessary in order to discharge its obligations.
Relations with shareholders
The Board is committed to maintaining an open and constructive 
dialogue with shareholders to ensure there is a common 
understanding of the strategic objectives, governance 
and performance of the Company.
The main points of contact for major shareholders are the 
CEO, the CFO, the SID, the Chairman and the Head of Investor 
Relations. Following the announcement of the interim results 
there was an extensive roadshow over three weeks with most 
of the top shareholders of the Company, with the CEO and 
the CFO present. Any feedback gained from the roadshow is 
reported back to the Board to enable the Board to understand 
the views of major shareholders.
Where appropriate, the Company consults with shareholders on 
significant issues. During 2017 the major shareholders were offered 
the opportunity to meet the Chairman and/or the SID to discuss 
Abcam’s strategy and governance arrangements.
In addition, our financial public relations advisors and corporate 
brokers gather investor and analyst feedback following meetings 
and roadshows, which is relayed to and reviewed by the Board. 
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The Chairman actively encourages the participation of all 
Directors at the AGM, which is the principal forum for dialogue 
with shareholders. A presentation is also given at the AGM 
outlining recent developments in the business, and a question

Committee members
• Sue Harris (Chairman)
• Louise Patten
As Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee, I am pleased to 
present the Committee’s report for the year ended 30 June 2017. 
This report details the work of the Committee over the past year, 
fulfilling our responsibilities to provide effective governance over 
the Group’s financial affairs to ensure that shareholders’ interests 
are properly protected in relation to internal controls and 
financial reporting. In meeting these responsibilities, we continue 
to consider the provisions of the Code and the FRC Guidance 
on Audit Committees.
Effective Committee governance
Louise Patten and I are both independent Non-Executive Directors 
with a combination of accounting, financial, risk, commercial 
and strategic experience in listed companies and with Abcam 
since 2014. The Committee acts independently of management 
to ensure that the interests of shareholders are appropriately 
protected in relation to financial reporting, internal control 
and risk management.
The Board has determined that I meet the Code requirements for the 
Committee to have one member with recent and relevant financial 
experience as I am a qualified accountant with over 30 years’ 
financial, risk and commercial experience in listed companies.
Shortly prior to the 2016 Annual General Meeting, Anthony Martin 
stepped down from the Board and ceased to be a member of the 
Committee. Murray Hennessy was appointed as an additional 
member of the Committee and attended the November meeting, 
such appointment being permitted under the Code. Subsequently, as 
part of a general review of Board Committees as the size of the main 
Board was reduced, it was decided that the Committee should 
be reduced to two members. Murray Hennessy therefore stepped 
down from the Committee following the November 2016 meeting.
Committee meetings are also attended, by invitation, by the 
Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Legal Officer and Company 
Secretary (acting as secretary to the Committee) and, where 
appropriate, other members of management, internal audit and 
the Board. Representatives of the Group’s external auditor also 
attend by invitation and meet with the Committee at least twice 
a year without Executive Directors or Company management 
being present.
Key responsibilities of the Committee
The Committee’s principal duties are to:
• monitor the integrity of the Group’s financial reporting, including 
the review of significant financial reporting judgements, and 
advise the Board on whether, taken as a whole, the Annual Report 
and Accounts is fair, balanced and understandable;
• advise the Board on principal risks, their mitigation and risk 
appetite and review the robustness of our risk management 
system and internal controls;
• oversee assurance work including the work of the Group’s 
internal auditor;
• oversee the Group’s external audit process, monitor the 
auditor’s independence, objectivity, effectiveness and 
performance, and approve any engagement of the 
external auditor outside of the Group’s audit; and
• review and monitor the whistleblowing policy and activity.
Committee activities
The key areas of Committee activity during the year included:
Financial reporting
• considering and deciding if the accounting policies 
are appropriate and reviewing the key judgements and 
estimates that underpin financial reporting as set out in note 4 
to the financial statements on pages 76 and 77. Other matters 
considered included reviewing the Group’s accounting for the 
completion of milestones and settlement of the contingent 
consideration related to the acquisition of AxioMx, the provision 
for bad and doubtful debts, the presentation of goods-in 
processing costs, taxation (tax losses, transfer pricing primarily 
related to China, and R&D claims) and the tax provision, and 
the impairment review of goodwill and intangibles;
• reviewing the Annual Report and Accounts, interim 
management statements, associated analyst presentations 
and press releases and challenging where appropriate to 
ensure clarity and completeness of disclosures including 
considering alternative performance measures to inform 
shareholders and other stakeholders, and advising the 
Board that taken as a whole the Annual Report and 
Accounts is fair, balanced and understandable;
• reviewing the basis for the going concern statement in light of 
financial plans and reasonably likely scenarios and recommending 
to the Board that the Company is a going concern; and
• reviewing the longer-term viability statement (LTVS), considering 
the appropriateness of the five-year time period on which the 
LTVS is based, linkage to strategy, principal risks, the assumptions, 
underlying stress-testing and the scenario analysis.
Risk management and internal control
• reviewing principal risks and risk appetite to ensure effective 
and continual improvement in risk management including 
reviewing and challenging the assessment of business-wide 
risks and actions to mitigate;
37 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Abcam plc
Corporate governance
Audit and Risk Committee Committee activities continued
Risk management and internal control continued
• reviewing the effectiveness and integrity of the internal financial 
controls framework that underpins financial reporting. The 
Committee has considered reports on internal control reviews 
in the period. These reviews did not highlight any significant 
control failings, though they did identify some areas where 
existing controls could be strengthened;
• monitoring progress on the implementation and project 
governance of the new ERP system including receiving 
the internal auditor’s report on programme assurance;
• reviewing Group insurance cover;
• reviewing hedging strategy and policy application in light 
of changing global market conditions; and
• monitoring and reviewing internal audit, approving the 
appointment of KPMG LLP (KPMG) as internal auditor, 
reviewing and approving the internal audit plan for 2016/17 
ensuring alignment with key risks, and challenging key audit 
outcomes and recommendations.
Tax
• overseeing the Group’s tax affairs and reviewing Group tax 
strategy for recommendation to the Board; and
• reviewing the preparation for compliance with Senior Accounting 
Officer (SAO) legislation. The parent company has implemented 
enhancements to the internal control framework in anticipation 
of the requirement to comply with SAO legislation that is expected 
to apply from the financial year 2018/19.
External audit
• approving the annual audit plan and risk identification and 
approving the level of fees paid to the auditor for audit services;
• reviewing the findings of the auditor and management’s 
response ensuring robust challenge;
• reviewing the independence, objectivity, performance and 
effectiveness of the auditor; and
• reviewing and updating the policy on the use of the auditor 
for non-audit work and approving any such work undertaken.
Compliance
• reviewing and considering the operation of the Group’s 
compliance initiatives, including the launch of the employee 
code of conduct called ‘How we do things at Abcam’, a 
global whistleblowing hotline and portal and compulsory 
online training in anti-bribery. 
External audit
Effectiveness
The Committee undertakes an annual assessment of the 
effectiveness of the external auditor, incorporating the views 
of both financial and commercial management in addition 
to the Non-Executive Directors to facilitate continued 
improvement in the external audit process.
The assessment, which is informed by the FRC’s Audit Quality 
Practice Aid for Audit Committees, considers:
• delivery of a thorough, robust and efficient global audit 
in compliance with the agreed plan and timescales;
• provision of accurate, robust and perceptive advice on 
key accounting and audit judgements, technical issues 
and best practice;
• a high level of professionalism and technical expertise consistently 
demonstrated by all audit staff and maintenance of continuity 
within the core audit team; and
• strict adherence to independence policies and other 
regulatory requirements.
The Committee concluded that the above factors had been 
met, and that it continued to be satisfied with PwC’s performance 
and effectiveness. 
Independence and objectivity of external auditor
Both the Board and the external auditor have safeguards in place 
to protect the independence and objectivity of the external auditor, 
which were reviewed by the Committee during the year and 
remain satisfactory. 
During the year, the Committee reviewed and revised the policy 
for the use of the external auditor for non-audit work to ensure 
that objectivity and independence are not compromised and 
that it is in line with the new EU audit regime introduced in 2016. 
Under the revised policy, all non-audit services to be contracted 
with the auditor require approval by the Committee. The external 
auditor will not be engaged to provide non-audit services that 
would be prohibited taking account of recent EU legislation 
applicable to Main Market companies.
Details of fees paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) during 
the year are outlined in note 7 on page 79 of the financial statements. 
Non-audit fees were paid to PwC during the year, mainly in respect 
of its review of the Company’s interim results. As it is usual practice 
for these non-audit services to be provided by the auditor, the 
Committee does not consider that auditor independence has 
been impacted. The ratio of non-audit fees to audit fees is 13:87.
Appointment and tendering
PwC has served as Abcam’s external auditor since September 2013, 
when a full tender process was carried out. The current audit partner, 
Simon Ormiston, has served since the firm’s appointment and is 
due for rotation after completion of the audit for the year ending 
30 June 2018. Following the review of PwC’s continued objectivity, 
independence and performance in respect of the 2016/17 financial 
year, and with PwC having confirmed its willingness to continue in 
office as external auditor, the Committee recommended to the 
Board that PwC be re-appointed as external auditor for the 2017/18 
financial year, subject to approval at the AGM. There were no 
contractual obligations that inhibited or influenced the 
Committee’s recommendation.
Internal audit
As reported last year, following a tender process KPMG 
was appointed to provide internal audit services to the Group. 
KPMG presented its internal audit plan for 2016/17 to the 
Committee in November, and its work during the year has 
focused on:
• project assurance for the implementation 
of the new ERP system;
• cyber security;
• a business health check in China; and
• US and UK payroll.
KPMG has provided updates on progress against the internal audit 
plan at each of the subsequent Committee meetings, including 
reports on each completed audit. The Committee will monitor the 
effectiveness of the internal audit function, including management’s 
response to internal audit findings, and is pleased that the new 
internal audit programme has been well received across the Group.

Corporate governance
Audit and Risk Committee continued Review of financial statements and audit findings
The Committee considered the following significant financial issues in relation to the Company’s financial statements and disclosures, 
with input from management and the external auditor:
Issue Committee’s review and conclusions
Longer-term 
viability statement
The Committee reviewed the assessment of the viability of the Group. This assessment was 
based upon the Group’s medium-term financial and operating plans and risk assessment, 
and included appropriate scenario analysis. The Committee continued to be satisfied 
that a period of five years was suitable and that the viability statement be provided. 
Strategic IT investment The strategic ERP investment project is a complex, global implementation with multiple 
phases, and implementation will extend into the next financial year. The Committee has 
maintained its review of programme progress with particular consideration of financial 
accounting and controls processes. In line with last year the Committee has provided 
oversight of the accounting for both capital and revenue expenditure. There has been 
additional oversight of this important programme at Board level with a focus on its 
broader reach across the Group.
Inventory and property, plant 
and equipment valuation for 
in-house manufactured items
Inventory manufactured in house, and capitalisation within property, plant and equipment 
of the costs of new hybridoma and assay development include an element of overhead 
allocation. The Committee discussed the calculation methodologies with management 
and also reviewed the report from the auditor on the results of its testing.
Inventory provisioning The calculation of the inventory provision includes a degree of judgement of the likelihood 
that individual products will be sold at some point in the future, at a value equivalent to 
or greater than cost. During the year the Company amended the estimated product 
sales life for all product categories (except biochemicals) and reviewed the growth rates 
of product sales taking account of all the historical data available to the Company. 
The impact on the provision was not significant. The Committee’s review included an 
assessment of the reasonableness of future sales forecasts (which are based on actual 
sales patterns in previous years) and the shelf life of those products.
The Committee has had a busy and productive year as newer control processes such as internal audit have bedded in and finance 
capability further develops to meet the needs of the Group as it continues to grow. I look forward to another successful year in 2017/18.

Key responsibilities of the Committee
The Committee is responsible for reviewing Board composition 
and balance, considering the skills and capabilities required for 
each new Board appointment, leading the process for Board 
appointments, making recommendations to the Board in relation 
to new appointments, and reviewing succession planning.
Board diversity and appointments procedure
Abcam recognises and embraces the benefits of having a diverse 
Board, and sees diversity at Board level as an essential element 
in maintaining a competitive advantage. Board composition is 
central to the effective leadership of the Group and, therefore, 
prior to commencing any search for prospective Board members, 
the Committee draws up a specification, reflecting on the Board’s 
current balance of skills and experiences and those that would be 
conducive to the delivery of the Company’s strategy. Selection for 
Board appointments is made on merit against this specification.
Board changes in the year
The size of the Board has reduced during the year as a result 
of the retirement of Jim Warwick as COO, and Michael Ross and 
Anthony Martin stepping down from the Board at our 2016 AGM. 
The Committee keeps the composition of the Board under review 
and, while it is satisfied that the balance of skills, experience and 
knowledge on the Board is appropriate, the Committee has 
recommended that an additional independent Non-Executive 
Director be appointed in 2018.
Gender diversity
Following the Board changes during the year, female 
representation on the Board now stands at 43%, up from 30% 
at the end of the previous financial year. This puts Abcam ahead 
of recommended targets for FTSE 350 companies in terms of 
female Board representation. The Company continues to see 
the development of female executive talent as an important 
area. More details on gender diversity in the Company are set 
out on page 34.
Activity in the year
A key focus for the Committee during the year has been on 
the successful integration of new additions to the ELT. This has 
included a newly introduced mentoring programme whereby 
each ELT member has been assigned a Non-Executive Director 
mentor. They meet on a regular basis and the ELT member can 
use the time with the Non-Executive Director to support their career 
development journey, learning from their experience. The Committee 
has also supported the introduction of a coaching scheme to further 
the development of the leadership skills of the ELT.
Succession planning has been an important area of focus, with 
the Committee regularly discussing succession and receiving 
and discussing a detailed paper on succession planning across 
the business. A number of key priority areas have been identified, 
in particular the development of a robust pipeline of potential 
ELT successors and the deliberate effort to ensure that the 
development needs of potential successors are met.
Priorities for 2017/18
The Committee will continue to focus on succession planning, 
particularly for ELT positions, as well as monitoring the success of 
the mentoring and coaching schemes. The Committee will also 
focus on developing its plans for the orderly and progressive 
refreshing of the Board over time.

(appointed 8 December 2016)
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present you with the 
Committee’s report for the year ended 30 June 2017.
This year Abcam has continued its trend of significant 
growth with an increase in total revenue of 26.5% to £217.1m 
(FY 2016: £171.7m) and a 13.2% increase in reported profit whilst 
making substantial investment in the business, including a global 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system as a platform to 
support continued growth demands. 
Over the last three financial years, we have seen the successful 
execution of our strategy which has created significant value for 
shareholders. Abcam’s total shareholder return has been 169.9% 
over this period, with a compound annual growth rate of 39.1%, 
and an increase in Abcam’s market capitalisation from around 
£800m to over £2bn. Abcam has significantly outperformed the 
FTSE 250 index which had compound annual growth of 9.8% over 
the same period.
Although Abcam is not required by the AIM Rules to provide 
all the information detailed in this report, the Committee have 
chosen to do so to provide greater transparency to shareholders 
in accordance with best practice.
Within this context, I would like to provide you with an overview 
of the Committee’s major decisions during 2016/17.
Remuneration Policy
The Committee undertook a strategic review of the approach 
to remuneration in 2015, and the resulting Remuneration Policy 
was put to an advisory vote at the 2015 AGM and approved 
by 91.5% of shareholders. We are not proposing to make any 
changes to our Remuneration Policy this year.
We engaged with shareholders prior to the publication of this 
Remuneration report. Over the coming year, we will seek their 
feedback as we carry out a review of our Remuneration Policy, 
which will be put to them for an advisory vote at the 2018 AGM.
Executive Director changes
As detailed in last year’s Annual Report, 2016/17 saw changes 
to the Executive Directors following the departure of the CFO, 
Jeff Iliffe, on 12 September 2016, the appointment of Gavin Wood 
as CFO-elect on 18 July 2016, and his subsequent appointment as 
an Executive Director on 12 September 2016. The COO, Jim Warwick, 
retired on 31 December 2016. Details of the departure arrangements 
for Jeff Iliffe and Jim Warwick can be found on page 47.
Base salary for Executive Directors and 
the Company Chairman’s remuneration
The Remuneration Committee’s policy is to offer remuneration which 
is competitive with comparable publicly listed companies and to 
provide incentives which fairly and responsibly reward individuals 
for their contribution to the long-term success of the Group.
• Both Alan Hirzel and Gavin Wood received increases to their 
base salaries of 2.5% effective 1 July 2017 in line with the average 
increase awarded to Abcam’s UK employees.
• No increase will be made to the Chairman’s remuneration 
in 2017/18.
2016/17 remuneration out-turns for Executive Directors
• Annual Bonus Plan (ABP) – the annual bonus out-turns in 2016/17 
were 100% and 59.1% of the maximum award for financial and 
strategic measures respectively, reflecting a strong performance 
against stretching targets during the year. In combination with 
a good performance against personal objectives for both our 
Executive Directors (as detailed on page 44), this means our 
Annual Bonus Plan will pay 78% of the maximum for both the 
CEO and CFO of which 30% is deferred into shares, in line with 
our policy. Further details regarding achievement against 
each performance target are set out on page 44.

Remuneration report
Part 1 – Remuneration Committee Chairman’s statement 2016/17 remuneration out-turns for Executive 
Directors continued
• Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) – awards granted 
on 4 November 2014 (at a maximum of 50% of salary), 
had an Earnings Per Share (EPS) performance condition 
measured over the three financial years ended 30 June 2017. 
Over the performance period, Abcam’s rapid growth has 
placed demands on our existing systems and processes and 
the Board formally approved a significant investment in our 
ERP platform in February 2016. As the scale and complexity 
of this transformational programme had not been established 
when the LTIP target was set, the Committee has determined, 
as permitted under the Remuneration Policy, that it should be 
excluded from the calculation of EPS growth for the purposes 
of the LTIP awards. This resulted in an adjusted annualised 
compound EPS growth over the three-year performance 
period ended 30 June 2017 of 9.7% against a minimum target 
of 8% and a maximum target of 12%. Awards will therefore vest 
at 71.6% of the maximum award. Further detail regarding the 
EPS calculation and achievement against the performance 
target is set out on page 45.
Overview of out-turns and performance
These results reflect the successful execution of our strategy. 
Abcam has achieved strong financial growth, while also investing 
significantly in the people, systems and infrastructure required to 
support our continued expansion. The Committee has continued 
to place emphasis on ensuring that the remuneration outcomes 
are aligned with our long-term strategy and performance.

Compound annual EPS growth 8% 12% 9.7% 71.6%
1 For the purpose of calculating EPS growth, the Committee excluded the exceptional investment costs in relation to the implementation of the ERP system.
Pension-related and other benefits
The Company operates a flexible benefits scheme under which the Executive Directors are entitled to contributions made by the Company 
on their behalf equivalent to 12% of base salary. Each Executive Director can choose how to spend this contribution from the specific 
benefits available and has the option to sacrifice an element of base pay to make additional pension contributions into the Company’s 
defined contribution pension plan or to purchase other benefits.
Where Executive Directors have elected to preserve their current lifetime or annual allowance for pension contributions, they are entitled 
to draw a cash supplement or other benefits equivalent to the cost to the Company of their pension entitlement, adjusted for employer’s 
National Insurance (NI) contributions, such that the Company is in a neutral position. These amounts have been included within the 
pension-related benefits disclosed in the total remuneration table on page 43.
b) 2016/17 single figure for total remuneration for the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors (NEDs)
The Company has a philosophy of share ownership which was extended to the Chairman and NEDs in the 2015/16 financial year by 
delivering one-third of their fees as Abcam shares.
Each NED has committed not to transfer or sell these shares during the term of their non-executive directorship.

1 The shares will be awarded at the beginning of the first open period following the announcement of the annual results in September 2017.
2  The number of shares delivered was calculated by converting one third of the NEDs’ 2015/16 fees into a fixed number of notional shares at £5.95 per share 
(being the average share price for the ten dealing days following the announcement of the Company’s annual results for the 2014/15 financial year).
  The notional shares were valued at the end of the 2015/16 financial year (at the closing price of the day of announcement of the Company’s financial results, 
being £7.91); normal PAYE and NI deducted and the net amount used to purchase the actual shares delivered to each NED.
3  Michael Ross and Anthony Martin stepped down from their roles as NEDs on 31 October 2016. The 2016/17 ‘Delivered as cash’ figures in the table above represent 
the pro-rated cash element of their fees to their departure date and the cash equivalent of their share entitlement pro-rated to this date converted at the closing 
share price on 31 October 2016, being £8.71.

1  The share price used to calculate the face value of the LTIP awards was the closing mid-market price on the day prior to the award date, being 851 pence for the 
4 November 2016 awards.
2 The share price used to calculate the face value of the free shares was the closing share price of the date of award, being 841 pence.
3 The share price of the matching shares acquired on 7 December 2016 was 792.25 pence.
4  The share price used to calculate the face value of the deferred share awards was the ten-dealing day average beginning on the day on which the Company 
announced its financial results, being 816.60 pence.
5  Awards made under the LTIP to Alan Hirzel are in the form of conditional shares and will be subject to an additional retention period following vesting as set out in the 
table above.
6  As disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report, the Remuneration Committee awarded Gavin Wood a one-off LTIP new joiner award equal to 100% of base salary on his 
appointment. The Committee believed the award was necessary to secure his appointment from a small pool of talent with the international experience and calibre 
required for the role and to immediately align his interests with those of our shareholders. Of the award, 75% is subject to the same performance conditions as the 
2016/17 LTIP award; the remaining 25% will be released subject to his continued employment on the third anniversary of the date of grant of the award. The share 
price used to calculate the value of the award was the average share price of the ten dealing days immediately preceding his start date, which was 753.90 pence.
7  Free shares are awarded to all UK employees employed by the Company on the date of award, even if under notice of retirement. Jim Warwick therefore received 
his full entitlement before his retirement on 31 December 2016.
8  Jim Warwick was awarded 25% of the deferred share award he would have been granted in respect of the 2015/16 plan year to reflect his retirement.
The performance conditions for the 2016 LTIP awards are based 70% on target annualised compound EPS growth and 30% on strategic KPIs 
over the three-year period ending on 30 June 2019. In relation to EPS growth, there will be 25% vesting at 8% compound growth and 100% 
vesting at 12% compound growth, with proportionate straight-line vesting between these two figures. The remaining performance measures 
are the Group’s four KPIs: RabMAb® primaries revenue growth, non-primaries revenue growth, NPS and market position.
All ABP and LTIP targets will be fully disclosed after vesting, unless full disclosure would expose the business to a clear competitive risk.

d) Executive Director departure arrangements
Chief Financial Officer (Jeff Iliffe)
Jeff Iliffe served notice of his intention to step down from the position of Chief Financial Officer on 14 September 2015. The Committee 
considered the overall circumstances of his departure as an Executive Director, as well as performance, contractual obligations and 
scheme plan rules. The Committee’s determinations, as previously disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report, and consistent with the Committee’s 
termination policy, are set out below:
Remuneration element Description
Payment in lieu of notice Jeff Iliffe worked and was paid for his full notice period, which expired on 13 September 2016. He 
stepped down from the Board on 12 September 2016. No payment was made in respect of salary or 
benefits (or compensation in lieu) in respect of any period after his departure date of 13 September 2016 
or compensation for loss of office. 
Base salary No increase to base pay was awarded from 1 July 2015. 
Retirement and other benefits The benefits package was maintained until his date of departure and not beyond.
ABP Jeff Iliffe received the cash element of his 2015/16 bonus, whilst the deferred share element relating to 
2015/16 was not granted. In respect of his 2014/15 bonus, only 50% of the deferred share award was made, 
which was a pro-rated amount to reflect his announced departure. Deferred share awards already 
accrued from previous years will vest at the normal time on the second anniversary of the date of grant.
For 2016/17, it was agreed by the Remuneration Committee that he would receive the cash element 
of bonus only, at target, and pro-rated to his date of departure. No deferred share award will be paid 
in respect of the 2016/17 plan year.
LTIP Unexercised but vested LTIP awards are capable of exercise within twelve months from the departure 
date. Unvested LTIP awards are subject to meeting the performance requirements and will be pro-rated 
for time and will be capable of being exercised within twelve months from their normal release dates.
No LTIP award was made following his resignation on 14 September 2015.
Chief Operating Officer (Jim Warwick)
Jim Warwick retired from the position of Chief Operating Officer on 31 December 2016. The Committee considered the overall 
circumstances of his departure as an Executive Director, as well as performance, contractual obligations and scheme plan rules. 
The Committee’s determinations, as previously disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report, and consistent with the Committee’s termination 
policy, are set out below:
Remuneration element Description
Payment in lieu of notice No payment has been made in respect of salary or benefits (or compensation in lieu) in respect of any 
period after his departure date of 31 December 2016.
Base salary No increase to base pay was awarded from 1 July 2015. 
Retirement and other benefits The benefits package was maintained until his date of departure and not beyond.
ABP Jim Warwick received the cash element of his 2015/16 bonus in the normal way and 25% of the 
deferred share award he would have been granted but for his retirement.
For 2016/17, he received a cash bonus of 35% of base salary in recognition of his satisfactory 
performance in his leadership of the implementation of the ERP system. No deferred share award will 
be granted in respect of the 2016/17 plan year.
LTIP Unexercised but vested LTIP awards are capable of exercise within twelve months from the date of 
leaving. Unvested LTIP awards are subject to meeting the performance requirements and will be 
pro-rated for time and will be capable of being exercised within twelve months from their normal 
release dates. 
No LTIP award was made in the financial year of his retirement.
e) Payments to past Directors
There have been no payments to the former CFO and former COO during the year other than the departure arrangements 
described above.
f) Directors’ shareholdings and share interests
The Committee introduced a shareholding guideline of two times salary for all Executive Directors from the date of the 2015 AGM. 
This level is to be built up over a period ending on the later of the fifth anniversary of appointment or the fifth anniversary of introduction 
of the policy, and ceases to apply after they cease to be an Executive Director of Abcam. Until the shareholding guideline is achieved, 
an Executive Director is prohibited from selling any shares they have acquired through a Company scheme. They can, however, sell 
sufficient shares to satisfy any tax liability that may arise on the release or exercise of an award.

for Jim Warwick and Jeff Iliffe, being the share price at their termination date and their salaries at their termination date.
3  Outstanding scheme interests under the LTIP, the SIP and the ABP (deferred share awards) take the form of rights to receive shares (nil-cost share options or conditional 
share awards). Outstanding Company Share Options Plan (CSOP) and unapproved options take the form of rights to receive shares on payment of the relevant 
exercise price.
4 Details of each scheme interest held by each Executive Director are set out on the following pages.
5 Outstanding scheme interests under the LTIP for which the performance conditions were not met have been excluded.
6  Part ‘A’ awards under the LTIP refer to the first £30,000 of LTIP value awarded at the date of grant. A corresponding CSOP option was also granted, with an exercise 
price equal to the share price at the date of grant, and subject to the same performance conditions. In respect of the LTIP part ‘A’ award, subject to achievement 
of the relevant performance conditions, the participant will receive the lower of the number of shares with an aggregate value of £30,000 at the date of release and 
the number of shares originally subject to the award. Thus, £30,000 of gain will be subject to income tax/NI and any increase in value between the date of grant 
of the award and the date at which the shares are sold is delivered through the CSOP option and is subject to capital gains tax.

Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
Abcam operates an HMRC-approved SIP for all UK employees. Under the SIP, awards are made as follows:
Free share awards
Annual awards are made to UK-based staff, with a market value up to the HMRC limit, which in 2016/17 was £3,600 each (2015/16: £3,600). 
Awards take the form of a conditional entitlement to shares and will vest after three years of continuous employment with the Company 
following the date of award.
Partnership and matching share awards
All UK-based employees are given the opportunity to invest up to the HMRC limit, which in 2016/17 was £1,800 per annum (2015/16: £1,800), 
to acquire new ‘partnership’ shares in the Company at market value. If these shares are held for three years and the employee remains 
employed by the Company during that time, then they will also receive an additional ‘matching’ share for each share acquired.
Dividend shares
Shares conditionally and beneficially held in the SIP are entitled to earn dividends in the form of shares. These shares are immediately 
owned outright and can be removed from the SIP by the participant with no penalty.
The following table sets out the shares purchased and awarded under the SIP in respect of each of the Executive Directors during the year.

UNAUDITED INFORMATION
The Company’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) over the previous eight years compared to a broad equity market is shown in the graph 
below. The FTSE 250 index has been chosen as the comparator because Abcam would sit within this if it were listed on the Main Market 
of the London Stock Exchange. The Committee considers the relatively complex international nature of this index to be comparable to 
the Company’s business operations where a large proportion of revenues are generated outside the UK.

Abcam for more than three years, and therefore no long-term incentives had vested.

h) Percentage change in CEO remuneration
Abcam has an international workforce of around 1,000 employees in eight countries. Due to the differing local pay levels across each of 
our overseas offices, the Committee considers the most meaningful comparator group to be the average remuneration of UK employees.
The following table shows the percentage change in remuneration between the years ended 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2017 for the 
CEO and this comparator group.

j) Implementation of Directors’ Remuneration Policy in 2017/18
The following sections outline how the Remuneration Policy will be implemented in 2017/18.
Executive Directors’ base salaries
The base salaries of the CEO and CFO were increased to £492,000 and £307,500 respectively with effect from 1 July 2017.

Salary as at
1 July 2017

Alan Hirzel CEO 480 2.5% 492
Gavin Wood CFO 300 2.5% 308
Annual incentive, deferred bonus and LTIP awards
The overall performance framework for 2017/18 for Executive Directors remains unchanged and is as follows:
Maximum % of salary 2017/18 measures Weighting
Annual Bonus Plan 150%, of which 30% of any bonus 
is deferred into shares
Profit growth 50%
Strategic targets 33%
Personal objectives 17%
Long Term Incentive Plan 125% for CEO
100% for the CFO
Three-year EPS growth 70%
Three-year strategic targets 30%
The strategic targets for the ABP and LTIP awards are measurable, quantifiable and aligned with the Group’s KPIs as set out on page 14.
The EPS growth targets for the forthcoming LTIP award will be 8% growth per annum for threshold vesting and 12% growth per annum for 
maximum vesting. Following the review of strategic priorities as set out on pages 12 and 13, we have aligned our strategic targets with 
them. These targets are considered to be appropriately stretching and incentivising in the context of our business strategy.

Part 3 – Annual Report on Remuneration continued UNAUDITED INFORMATION continued
j) Implementation of Directors’ Remuneration Policy in 2017/18 continued
Annual incentive, deferred bonus and LTIP awards continued
The strategic targets for the forthcoming LTIP award will be based on:
• recombinant antibody revenue growth;
• immunoassay revenue; and
• customer engagement: NPS.
The ABP targets and the strategic targets for the LTIP will not be disclosed in advance as they are deemed by the Committee to 
be commercially sensitive. Appropriate retrospective disclosure of targets will be provided when these are no longer considered 
commercially sensitive.
Annual incentive, deferred bonus and LTIP awards
The Committee introduced a performance cross-underpin to the ABP in 2015. At the Committee’s discretion, vesting may be restricted 
if any of the three performance elements (financial, strategic or personal) shows serious underperformance, or if the Committee determines 
that there has been underperformance on the part of an Executive Director in their role.
Pension
The Company retains its policy of contributing 12% of base salary (prior to any voluntary waivers) into each Executive Director’s pension 
scheme. For further details, please refer to the pension-related and other benefits section on page 45.
Non-Executive Directors
During 2015/16 the Company put in place fee arrangements for all NEDs where a portion of their fees would be delivered as a fixed 
number of fully paid ordinary shares. Louise Patten, Mara Aspinall and Sue Harris will receive an increase in fees to £70,000 per annum 
(2016/17: £50,000) with effect from 1 July 2017. There will be no increase in fees paid to Murray Hennessy and Jonathan Milner. 
k) Remuneration Committee
The Committee advises the Board on overall Remuneration Policy on behalf of the Board, and with the benefit of advice from external 
consultants and the SVP, Human Resources, it also determines the remuneration of the Executive Directors and proposes a fee for the 
Chairman of the Board of Directors (with the Chairman not being present for any discussions on his fee). The remuneration of the NEDs 
is determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors.
The Committee formulates and applies the policy with consideration to the prevailing economic climate in the major economies in 
which the Group operates. It also observes the spirit of the Group’s core values, including responsible leadership in the external and 
internal social environment. Consequently, the Committee closely considers the Company’s performance in building both long-term 
shareholder value and a secure future for all stakeholders.
The Committee currently comprises four NEDs, each of whom the Company deems to be independent: Louise Patten (Chairman), 
Murray Hennessy, Sue Harris and Mara Aspinall. Murray Hennessy is considered by the Company to be independent as he was 
independent on his appointment as Chairman.
The Company Secretary and the SVP, Human Resources, attend the Committee meetings by invitation and assist the Committee in the 
execution of its objectives, except when issues relating to their own compensation are discussed.
No Director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.
While it is the Committee’s responsibility to exercise independent judgement, the Committee does request advice from management 
and professional advisors, so as to be informed given the internal and external environment.
No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest, other than as a shareholder, in the matters to be decided 
by the Committee. The four independent members of the Committee have no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships. 
Members of the Committee have no day-to-day involvement in the running of the Company. The Committee met six times during 
the year. Details of attendance can be found in the Corporate Governance Report (see page 33).

External advisors to the Committee
The following table sets out the details of external advisors who provided material assistance to the Committee during the year in its 
consideration of matters related to Directors’ remuneration:
Advisors Appointment and selection Other services provided to the Company Fees for Committee assistance
Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) Appointed to provide ongoing 
advice to the Committee on 
various matters including Directors’ 
remuneration reporting regulations, 
shareholder communication and 
other governance matters.
Advice on risk management. £21,330
Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the Code of Conduct in relation 
to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The Committee is satisfied that advice received from Deloitte during the year was 
objective and independent.
Statement of voting at general meeting
The table below shows the advisory vote on the 2015/16 Remuneration Report at the 2016 AGM and the advisory vote on the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy at the 2015 AGM. The shareholder support we received for last year’s Annual Remuneration Report was lower than 
we have seen in previous years. The main concern for shareholders was the salary increase we made for the CEO. The Remuneration 
Committee unanimously agreed that it was in the best interests of the Company to make a one-off ‘step-change’ adjustment to bring 
his salary in line with the market, reflecting the value of his role.

Dividends
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 7.355 pence (2015/ 
16: 6.556 pence) per ordinary share to be paid on 8 December 2017 
to shareholders on the register on 17 November 2017. The associated 
ex-dividend date will be 16 November 2017. Together with the 
interim dividend of 2.825 pence per share paid on 13 April 2017, this 
brings the total dividend for the financial year ended 30 June 2017 
to 10.18 pence per share (2015/16: 8.91 pence), representing an 
increase of 14.3% over the previous year.
Disabled employees
Abcam is an equal opportunities employer and ensures that 
applications for employment from people with disabilities and 
other under-represented groups are given full and fair consideration. 
Such individuals are given the same training, development and 
job opportunities as other employees. Every effort is also made 
to retain and support employees who have a disability during 
their employment, including flexible working to assist their re-entry 
into the workplace and making alternative suitable provisions.
Control and share structure
Details of the authorised and issued share capital, together with 
details of the movements in the Company’s issued share capital 
during the year, are shown in note 22 to the financial statements. 
The Company has one class of ordinary share which carries no 
right to fixed income. Each share carries the right to one vote 
at general meetings of the Company.
Other than specific lock-ins and orderly marketing provisions 
negotiated with vendors in connection with acquisitions made 
by the Company, there are no specific restrictions on the size of 
a holding nor on the transfer of shares, which are both governed 
by the general provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing 
legislation. The Directors are not aware of any agreements between 
the holders of the Company’s shares that may result in a restriction 
on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. No person has any 
special rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all 
issued shares are fully paid.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 25 to the 
financial statements. Shares held by the Abcam Employee Share 
Benefit Trust abstain from voting.
Agreements affected by change of control
The Company is not party to any significant agreements that take 
effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company 
following a takeover.
There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors 
providing for compensation for loss of office or employment 
(whether through resignation, redundancy or otherwise) that 
occurs because of a takeover bid. However, members of the 
Executive Leadership Team, excluding the Executive Directors, 
are entitled to an agreed sum equal to six months’ basic salary 
in the event of a dismissal for any reason other than misconduct 
(including constructive dismissal by reason of a fundamental 
breach of contract by Abcam or a successor employer) within 
twelve months following a change of control, provided that the 
individual enters into a settlement agreement and agrees to 
certain obligations regarding confidentiality, intellectual property 
and restrictive covenants. The agreed sum is payable in addition 
to any pay in lieu of notice, but includes any entitlement to 
statutory redundancy pay.
Major interest in shares
Details of the interests in voting rights in the Company’s shares notified to the Company in accordance with Chapter 5 of the FCA’s

Directors’ report Purchase of own shares
At the end of the year, the Directors had authority, under a 
resolution passed at the Company’s AGM on 2 November 2016, 
to purchase through the market 20,280,000 of the Company’s 
ordinary shares, subject to the conditions set out in that resolution. 
No shares were purchased under this authority during the year 
under review.
Directors
Brief biographical descriptions of the current Directors of the 
Company, all of whom were in office during the year and up 
to the date of signing the financial statements, are set out on 
pages 30 and 31. The beneficial and non-beneficial interests 
of the Directors in the Company’s ordinary shares of 0.2 pence 
are disclosed in the Remuneration Report. The names of previous 
Directors of the Company who resigned from the Board during 
the year are set out in the Board and Committee meeting 
attendance table on page 33.
The powers of the Directors are determined by UK legislation and 
the Company’s Articles of Association, together with any specific 
authorities that may be given to the Directors by shareholders 
from time to time (for example the authority to allot or purchase 
shares in the Company).
Re-election of Directors
Following performance evaluation, the Chairman has determined 
that each individual continues to demonstrate commitment to his 
or her role and to display effective performance; he is therefore 
recommending the re-election of all Directors seeking to remain on 
the Board. Abcam has elected to comply with Code Provision B.7.1 
and therefore all Directors shall retire and stand for re-election at 
the AGM to be held on 14 November 2017.
Articles of Association
The rules governing the appointment and replacement of 
Directors are contained in the Company’s Articles of Association. 
The Articles of Association may be amended only by special 
resolution at a general meeting of shareholders.
Qualifying third party indemnity provisions
The Company has made qualifying third party indemnity 
provisions for the benefit of its Directors during the reporting 
period and these remain in force at the date of this report.
Directors’ and officers’ insurance
The Company has purchased and maintained throughout the 
financial year directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in respect 
of itself and for its Directors and Officers; this gives appropriate 
cover for legal action brought against its Directors.
Going concern
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the financial 
statements, the Directors have considered the business activities 
and reviewed the Group forecasts and budgets as well as the 
Group’s principal risks and uncertainties as set out above.
The Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue to operate for the next twelve months. For this reason, 
the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
its financial statements.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM will be held at 330 Cambridge Science Park, 
Milton Road, Cambridge CB4 0FL, UK on 14 November 2017 
at 2.00pm. A presentation will be made at this meeting outlining 
the recent developments in the business. All voting at the meeting 
will be conducted by show of hands where every shareholder 
present in person or by proxy will have one vote, unless a poll is 
requested by a shareholder for which each shareholder present 
or by proxy will have one vote for each share of which they are 
the owner.
The Group will publish the results of the votes on its website after the 
AGM. Shareholders are invited to submit written questions in advance 
of the meeting. Questions should be sent to the Company Secretary, 
Abcam plc, 330 Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge 
CB4 0FL, UK.
A resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as 
independent auditor to the Group will be proposed at the AGM. 
Details of the other resolutions to be proposed at the meeting 
are set out in the Circular and Notice of AGM 2017, which will be 
made available to all shareholders together with a proxy card.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union and Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising 
FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law). 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group and Company for that period. In preparing 
the financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
have been followed for the Group financial statements and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101, 
have been followed for the Company financial statements, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s

dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group 
and the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in 
the biographies on pages 30 and 31, confirm that, to the best 
of their knowledge:
• the Company financial statements, which have been 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, 
and applicable law), give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company;
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Group; and
• the Directors’ Report on pages 55 to 57, together with 
the Our Financials and Our Risks sections on pages 22 to 27 
and pages 15 to 19 respectively of the Strategic Report, 
include a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Group, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
Auditor
Each Director in office at the date the Directors’ Report is approved 
confirms that:
(a)   so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Group and the Company’s auditor 
is unaware; and
(b)   he/she has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have 
taken as Director in order to make himself/herself aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group 
and the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has expressed its willingness to 
continue in office as auditor.

Opinion
In our opinion:
• Abcam plc’s Group financial statements and Company 
financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true 
and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s 
affairs as at 30 June 2017 and of the Group’s profit and cash 
flows for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the Company financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and 
applicable law); and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 (the “Annual Report”), which 
comprise: the consolidated and Company balance sheets as at 
30 June 2017, the consolidated income statement and the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year 
then ended, the consolidated cash flow statement for the year 
then ended, and the consolidated and Company statements of 
changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the 
financial statements, which include a description of the significant 
accounting policies.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the 
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard as 
applicable to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality 
and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made 
subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and 
considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all 
of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override 
of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was 
evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk 
of material misstatement due to fraud.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional 
judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest 
effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in 
the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. 
These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our 
procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
• £2,594,000 (2016: £2,270,000) – Group financial statements.
• Based on 5% of profit before tax.
• £2,377,000 (2016: £2,103,000) – Company financial statements.
• Based on 5% of profit before tax.
• We conducted audits of the complete financial information of Abcam plc, Abcam Inc 
and Abcam Trading (Shanghai) Co., Limited.
• We performed specified procedures over certain account balances and transaction 
classes at other Group companies, including another Chinese operation.
• With the exception of the audit of Abcam Trading (Shanghai) Co., Limited and certain 
specified procedures performed over another Chinese operation, which were performed by 
the component auditor, the Group engagement team performed all of the audit procedures.
• Taken together, the Group companies over which we performed our audit procedures 
accounted for 86% of the absolute profit before tax (i.e. the sum of the numerical values 
without regard to whether they were profits or losses for the relevant reporting units) 
and 85% of revenue.
• Inventory provisioning (Group and Company).
• Costing of inventory manufactured in house and hybridomas included within property, 
plant and equipment (Group and Company).
• Classification of costs associated with systems and process improvements 
(Group and Company).

at 30 June 2017. Inventory principally comprises 
antibodies and reagents that bear a natural risk 
of obsolescence. Furthermore, owing to the low 
incremental cost of in-house production of 
antibodies, the Group and the Company often 
produce surplus inventories that are at risk of expiring 
before a sale can be achieved (see note 4 and 
page 39 of the Audit and Risk Committee Report).
For new products, the Directors apply a fixed 
percentage provision against the inventory levels 
held at the year end, unless they believe that there 
are specific reasons that no provision is required.
For all other products, the Directors calculate a 
specific provision for obsolescence by comparing 
inventories on hand at year end with forecast sales 
volumes on a product-by-product basis, providing 
fully against inventories regarded as surplus.
There is therefore judgement in the valuation of 
inventories, owing to the estimation uncertainty 
that exists around future sales forecasts.
We understood and assessed the methodology utilised to estimate the 
Group’s and the Company’s inventory provisions and checked that the 
calculation of the provision was mathematically accurate.
We found no material exceptions in our testing.
For new products against which the Directors had not recorded a provision, 
we assessed the Directors’ rationale as to why no provision was required. 
We found no material exceptions in our testing.
For the other products, we assessed the reasonableness of the Directors’ 
future sales forecasts by considering whether projected levels of sales 
growth were supported by historical trends or specific factors relevant 
to the product in question.
We considered both the risk of under and overstatement of the inventory 
provisions by:
• performing sensitivity analysis on the forecast future sales; and
• ascertaining the change that would be required to materially affect 
the determined provision. We assessed that the likelihood of such a 
change was low.
Costing of inventory manufactured in 
house and hybridomas included within 
property, plant and equipment – Group 
and Company
The Group and the Company capitalise within 
property, plant and equipment (PPE) costs arising from 
the production of hybridoma cells, which are used to 
generate antibodies that the Group sells. During the 
year, £3,595,000 was capitalised by the Group and 
£3,785,000 was capitalised by the Company as part 
of the total additions to hybridomas and assays and 
hybridomas under construction (see note 4 and 
page 39 of the Audit and Risk Committee Report).
The costs incurred both in producing the hybridomas 
(held in PPE) and in harvesting the antibodies 
(held in inventory) include a labour and overhead 
allocation. This allocation is capitalised into PPE and 
inventory on the basis of the proportion of batches 
that pass internal quality tests. No allocation is 
capitalised for the batches that do not pass the 
tests, and the labour and overhead element is 
instead written off in the income statement.
The nature of the manufacturing process is such 
that there are fluctuations in the proportion of 
batches of hybridomas and antibodies that pass 
quality tests, meaning that the total labour and 
overhead absorbed into PPE and inventory varies.
The relevant calculations are also performed 
manually, necessitating a substantive approach 
to testing that appropriate amounts of labour 
and overhead cost have been capitalised.
We evaluated whether appropriate costs had been capitalised as inventory 
and property, plant and equipment, including checking, on a sample basis, 
the labour costs capitalised.
For labour costs, we agreed, on a sample basis, the timesheet records used 
to allocate labour costs to the underlying records. We found no material 
exceptions in our testing.
For inventory manufactured in house and hybridomas, we agreed, on a 
sample basis, the quality test results to underlying records. We found no 
material exceptions in our testing.
We also checked the mathematical accuracy of the calculations 
(taking into account the proportion of batches passing quality tests) 
and that only reasonable categories of overheads were absorbed into 
inventory and capitalised as property, plant and equipment. We found 
no material exceptions in our testing.

Classification of costs associated with 
systems and process improvements – Group 
and Company
During the year the Group and the Company 
capitalised costs of £11,202,000 and £11,131,000 
respectively in relation to the systems and process 
improvements project. Further amounts in relation 
to systems and process improvements have been 
expensed to the consolidated income statement 
and, to the extent this is incremental, included in 
the reconciliation of the adjusted income measures 
within the “Our financials” section (see note 4 and 
page 39 of the Audit and Risk Committee Report). 
The Directors have assessed whether the 
costs incurred in relation to the implementation 
of the Group’s and the Company’s systems 
and improvements project meet the criteria for 
capitalisation and, if not, whether the costs were 
incremental to the ongoing costs of the Group.
The adjusted consolidated profit before tax, which 
is considered by management to be a key metric 
and is discussed in the “Our financials” section, is directly 
impacted by the amount of costs capitalised and 
the amounts included in the reconciliation of the 
adjusted income measures. We focused on whether 
the costs capitalised met the criteria for capitalisation 
and whether, for those costs classified as systems 
and process improvements costs on the face of 
the consolidated income statement, they were 
indeed incremental.
We vouched a sample of the costs capitalised in relation to the system 
and improvements project to invoices from suppliers.
We agreed a sample of the internal staff costs capitalised to supporting 
calculations and time records.
In both cases, we considered whether the nature of the costs met the 
criteria for the costs to be capitalised.
For costs expensed to the consolidated income statement and included 
within the reconciliation of adjusted income measures we considered 
whether the Directors’ policy for the treatment of such costs was reasonable 
and, on a sample basis, assessed whether the costs included in the 
reconciliation were in line with the Directors’ policy.
We found no material exceptions in our testing.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the 
Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry 
in which they operate.
The Group financial statements are a consolidation of 17 
reporting units, comprising the Group’s operating businesses 
and holding companies. 
We performed audits of the complete financial information of 
Abcam plc, Abcam Inc, and Abcam Trading (Shanghai) Co., Limited 
reporting units, which were individually financially significant and 
accounted for 83% of the Group’s revenue and 80% of the 
Group’s absolute profit before tax (i.e. the sum of the numerical 
values without regard to whether they were profits or losses for 
the relevant reporting units). We also performed specified audit 
procedures over goodwill and other intangible assets, as well 
as certain account balances and transaction classes that we 
regarded as material to the Group at four further reporting 
units, one based in China, one in the UK, one in Japan and 
another in the US. 
The Group engagement team performed all audit procedures, with 
the exception of the audit of Abcam Trading (Shanghai) Co., Limited 
and certain specified procedures performed over another Chinese 
operation which were performed by a component auditor in China.
Our involvement in the work of the component auditor in China 
included regular communication with a formal meeting arranged 
following the performance of the procedures. In addition, a member 
of the Group engagement team met with the component auditor 
in China and conducted a review of the working papers.
Taken together the Group companies over which we performed 
our audit procedures accounted for 86% of the absolute profit 
before tax and 85% of revenue.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of 
materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to 
determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and 
extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial 
statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect 
of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the 
financial statements as a whole. 
61 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Abcam plc
Financial statements Report on the audit of the financial statements continued
Our audit approach continued
Materiality continued
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Company financial statements
Overall Group materiality £2,594,000 (2016: £2,270,000). £2,377,000 (2016: £2,103,000).
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax. 5% of profit before tax.
Rationale for 
benchmark applied
We believe that profit before tax is the 
primary measure used by the shareholders 
in assessing the performance of the 
Group, and is a generally accepted 
auditing benchmark. 
We believe that profit before tax is the 
primary measure used by the shareholders 
in assessing the performance of the 
Company, and is a generally accepted 
auditing benchmark.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range 
of materiality allocated across components was between £965,000 and £2,464,000. Certain components were audited to a local 
statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £130,000 
(Group audit) (2016: £114,000) and £119,000 (Company audit) (2016: £105,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our 
view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in respect of the directors’ statement in the financial statements 
about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements and the 
directors’ identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least 
twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw 
attention to. However, because not all future 
events or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
and Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
Reporting on other information
The other information comprises all of the information in the 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 other than the financial 
statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are 
responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial 
statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, 
we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify 
an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement,
we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there 
is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have 
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have 
nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, 
we also considered whether the disclosures required by the 
UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work 
undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, 
(CA06) and ISAs (UK) require us also to report certain opinions 
and matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless 
otherwise stated).

Reporting on other information continued
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report for the year ended 30 June 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared 
in accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency 
or liquidity of the Group
As a result of the directors’ voluntary reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”), 
we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or draw attention to regarding: 
• The directors’ confirmation on page 15 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The directors’ explanation on page 16 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report in respect of this responsibility.
Other Code Provisions
As a result of the directors’ voluntary reporting on how they have applied the Code, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• The statement given by the directors, on page 57, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced 
and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and Company’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and Company 
obtained in the course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on pages 37 to 39 describing the work of the Audit and Risk Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit and Risk Committee.
We have nothing to report in respect of this responsibility.
Responsibilities for the financial statements 
and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the 
financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
set out on pages 56 and 57, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the 
applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal 
control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible 
for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company 
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis 
of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website 
at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description 
forms part of our auditors’ report.

and the audit continued
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
• the Company financial statements are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Other voluntary reporting
Going concern
The directors have requested that we review the statement on 
page 56 in relation to going concern as if the Company were 
a premium listed Company. We have nothing to report having 
performed our review.
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the 
Group and of the principal risks that would threaten 
the solvency or liquidity of the Group
The directors have requested that we perform a review of the 
directors’ statements on pages 15 and 16 that they have carried 
out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group 
and in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group, as if the 
Company were a premium listed Company. Our review was 
substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of 
making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting 
their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment 
with the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether 
the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding 
of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the 
course of the audit. We have nothing to report having performed 
this review.
Other Code provisions
The directors have prepared a corporate governance statement 
and requested that we review it as though the Company were a 
premium listed Company. We have nothing to report in respect 
of the requirement for the auditors of premium listed companies 
to report when the directors’ statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure 
from a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing 
Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ remuneration
The Company voluntarily prepares a Directors’ Remuneration Report 
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
The directors requested that we audit the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report specified by the Companies Act 2006 to 
be audited as if the Company were a quoted Company.
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the CA06.

Financial statements
Consolidated cash flow statement
For the year ended 30 June 2017 1. Presentation of the financial statements
a. General information
Abcam plc (the Company) is incorporated and domiciled in the UK and registered in England under the Companies Act 2006. The address 
of the registered office is 330 Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge CB4 0FL, UK. The Company is a public limited company 
whose shares are listed on AIM of the London Stock Exchange.
The Company and its subsidiaries (together the Group) produce and distribute high quality research-grade antibodies and associated 
protein research tools. The Group operates through its ultimate parent company Abcam plc and through a channel of wholly owned 
manufacturing and distribution subsidiaries mainly based in the US and Asia Pacific, which allows it to serve a global customer base of 
over 100 countries. A list of all subsidiaries is contained in note 7 of the Company financial statements.
b. Basis of preparation
The annual financial statements of Abcam plc are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and 
IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations as adopted by the European Union and the Companies Act 2006 as applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS, and comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments. 
The Group financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (£000) except 
when otherwise indicated.
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation 
of the statements for the year ended 30 June 2016 except where disclosed otherwise in this note.
c. Provision for bad or doubtful debts
A review of historical debtor defaults undertaken during the year showed a low trend of actual write-offs, thereby resulting in a revision 
of the expected collectability of the Group’s debtor portfolio. Consequently, £693,000 of the provision has been released to the 
income statement in the year.
d. Presentation of goods-in processing costs
Goods-in processing costs relate to costs incurred in receiving, resizing, and storing brought-in product. These costs have previously 
been shown as operating expenses but, as the costs are only incurred in relation to selling product, management has concluded that 
it more appropriate to include the costs in gross margin as a cost of sales to give a more accurate representation of the true cost of 
product sales. This has led to £2,210,000 being reclassified from operating expenses to cost of sales, a reduction in gross margin of 1.0%. 
The comparative costs for the year to 30 June 2016 were £1,794,000 representing a gross margin reduction of 1.0%. The prior year 
income statement has not been restated on the grounds of immateriality.
e. Going concern
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements from the cash surpluses generated as a result of normal trading. The Group’s 
forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able 
to operate within the limits of its available resources.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for at least one year from the date of approval of the financial statements. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements.
2. Changes in accounting policies and disclosures

Impact on future periods of the adoption of new standards and interpretations
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was issued in July 2014 and replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. 
It is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group will apply the standard retrospectively for the first 
time in the half year report ending 31 December 2018 and the annual report ending 30 June 2019.
IFRS 9 is applicable to financial assets and financial liabilities, and covers classification, measurement and derecognition.
On adoption of IFRS 9, the main areas of change that are relevant for the Group are:
• requirement to use an expected credit loss method for impairment calculation; and
• broadening of hedge accounting application with more focus on risk management alignment.
These areas are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s net results or net assets.
An initial review of expected impairment losses on the current receivable ledger under the new methodology indicates an increase 
in the provision of less than £0.2m due to the Group’s customer profile. The full impact will be subject to further assessment and is 
dependent on the receivables open at the transition date. 
The standard was endorsed by the EU on 22 November 2016.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers was issued in May 2014.
It is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group will apply the standard for the first time in the half 
year report ending 31 December 2018 and the annual report ending 30 June 2019.
The new standard will replace existing accounting standards used to determine the measurement and timing of revenue recognition, 
and requires an entity to align the recognition of revenue to the transfer of goods or services at an amount that the entity expects to 
be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The standard also requires enhanced revenue disclosure.
The adoption of IFRS 15 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s recognition of its catalogue product revenue 
which contributes approximately 93% of the Group’s revenue. 
For the Group’s other revenue streams, an initial review has been performed on a sample of custom service, licence and royalty agreements 
and no significant change to the timing of revenue recognition has been identified. However, given the customised nature of these types 
of agreement, and that the portfolio of open contracts will continue to change up to the transition date, the final impact assessment 
may not reflect the current view of the likely impact based on the sample. The Group is continuing to assess the full impact on these 
areas of revenue.
The standard was endorsed by the EU on 22 September 2016.

For the year ended 30 June 2017 2. Changes in accounting policy and disclosures continued
Impact on future periods of the adoption of new standards and interpretations continued
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 Leases was issued in January 2016 and will replace IAS 17 Leases. 
It is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, with the Group’s initial date of application being 1 July 2019. 
The Group will apply the standard for the first time in the half year report ending 31 December 2019 and the annual report ending 
30 June 2020.
The new standard will introduce a single lessee accounting model, eliminating the previous classification of leases as either operating 
or finance. All leases will require recognition of an asset and a related liability unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying 
asset value is low.
The Group has conducted an initial review of its lease contracts and based on the operating leases in place at 30 June 2017, including 
judgements over expected extension options and lease terms for the new Group HQ property, expects a decrease in net assets on 
transition to the new standard of less than £5m as at the date of transition, 30 June 2019. In the years after transition, there would also 
be an impact on the Group’s income statement when the fixed rental expense is replaced by a depreciation charge and an interest 
expense. This will lead to an increase in operating profit as a result of removing the operating lease expense net of the new leased 
asset depreciation charge. The overall impact to the Group’s reported profit after tax is expected to be immaterial with a small net 
decrease in the initial years after transition which will reverse in later years as the leases in existence at transition come closer to ending.
The final transition impact assessment is still in progress and will be dependent on the transition method selected by the Group and 
the leases in existence at the transition date. Consequently, the actual transition impact may differ from the above impact guidance 
depending on business decisions made during the period to July 2019.
The standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
3. Significant accounting policies
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
made up to 30 June each year. Control is achieved when the Company has power over the entity and the ability to use its power to 
affect the returns it receives from its involvement with the entity.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of 
the subsidiary. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies in 
line with those used by the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, equity, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to 
the identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities unless the fair value cannot be reliably measured in which case the value 
is subsumed into goodwill. The consideration transferred for the acquisition includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a 
contingent consideration arrangement. Contingent consideration may include specific research and development or other operational 
milestones and/or financial targets. Each element is fair valued at the date of acquisition using actual and projected data and statistical 
techniques. Key inputs include probability of success and consideration of expected timing. Future internal forecasts may also be used 
to help determine any financial targets.
Changes in the fair value of any contingent consideration from additional information obtained during the measurement period (up to 
a year from date of acquisition) about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date are adjusted retrospectively against 
goodwill. Changes in the fair value that do not qualify as measurement-period adjustments are not recognised until settlement if the 
contingent consideration was classified as equity at acquisition or are recognised immediately in profit if it was classified as an asset or 
liability on the balance sheet. Unsettled amounts of consideration are held at fair value within the relevant category of the balance sheet.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed to the income statement in the period they are incurred.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination that meet the recognition 
criteria under IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2008) are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition, except that:
• deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured 
in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;
• liabilities or equity instruments relating to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payment awards are measured 
in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment; and
• assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale are measured in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale 
and Discontinued Operations.
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment. Where applicable, cost is adjusted to reflect changes in consideration 
arising from contingent consideration amendments.

Financial statements Financial statements 3. Significant accounting policies continued
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Where the fair value 
of the consideration is less than the fair value of the acquired net assets, the deficit is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain 
purchase. Goodwill is capitalised and subject to an impairment review at least annually and is carried at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed in subsequent periods.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from 
the synergies of the combination. The CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently 
when there is an indication that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the 
carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit 
and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
In accordance with IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation 
and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition of that foreign operation are 
treated as assets and liabilities of that foreign operation and as such are translated at the relevant foreign exchange rate at the 
balance sheet date. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Revenue and income recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods 
and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when title and risk have passed to the customer.
Custom service revenue is recognised proportionately when the outcome of each discrete stage of the contract can be estimated reliably 
and is based on the stage of completion of the contract activity per agreed milestones set out in the contract. Where the outcome cannot 
be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised to the extent of costs incurred where it is probable these will be recovered. In instances 
where it is probable that the costs will be in excess of the contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Licence fee income is recognised on delivery of the licensed technology where the Group’s continued performance or future research 
and development services are not required. Payments received prior to this are recorded as deferred income.
Royalty revenue is recognised on an accruals basis based on the contractual terms and the substance of the agreements with the 
counterparty, provided that the amount can be reliably measured and it is probable that the economic benefit will flow to the Group.
Grant income is recognised in the same period as the related R&D expenses are incurred and is recorded through the corresponding 
expense line of the income statement.
Revenue derived from the Company’s conferences is recognised when the conference is held; however, it is not material.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, 
which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s 
net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant 
lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term.
Foreign currencies
For the purposes of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed 
in Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the reporting currency for the consolidated financial statements.
Foreign currency transactions in the individual companies are booked in the functional currency of that entity at the exchange rate 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are retranslated into their functional currency at 
the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences are included in the income statement.
On consolidation, the results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries are translated into Sterling using the average exchange rates during 
the period, and the balance sheets translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on this translation 
are classified as equity and recognised in the translation reserve.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when 
the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for:
• differences arising on transactions entered into to hedge certain foreign currency risks (see below under financial instruments/
hedge accounting) which are recognised through other comprehensive income; and
• differences arising on foreign currency assets or liabilities designated as a net investment hedge of the Group’s overseas operations 
which are recognised in the translation reserve.

For the year ended 30 June 2017 3. Significant accounting policies continued
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to 
state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the nature of the 
Group’s obligations under the schemes is equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme. The Group 
has no further obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes some items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that 
are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
The benefit of UK research and development is recognised under the UK’s Research and Development Expenditure Credit (RDEC) 
scheme. The benefit is recorded as income included in profit before tax, netted against research and development expenses, as the 
RDEC is of the nature of a government grant.
Where the current tax deduction in respect of share option exercises exceeds the share option accounting charge for the period, 
the excess is recorded in the reserves rather than the income statement.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences 
can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or 
from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the 
Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised for deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
The Group’s liability for deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited 
in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income or equity, in which 
case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or equity respectively.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes 
the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the 
following bases:
Office equipment, fixtures and fittings 2 to 5 years
Laboratory equipment 1 to 5 years
Computer equipment 3 years
Hybridomas and assays 3 to 8 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement. Residual values of assets and their useful lives are reviewed, 
and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. Assets under the course of construction are not depreciated.
73 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Abcam plc
Financial statements Financial statements 3. Significant accounting policies continued
Intangible assets
Payments made to acquire software, distribution rights, capitalised development work and contract-based intangibles from third 
parties are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The principal expected useful 
lives used for this purpose are as follows:
Upfront licence fees 3 years
Distribution rights 1 to 10 years
Software 1 to 5 years
Contract based Term of contract
Customer relationships 7 to 10 years
Patents, technology and know-how 5 to 15 years
Trade names 8 years
Patents, technology and know-how assets are only amortised once the development is complete and being utilised for its intended 
purpose; until this point the asset is deemed to be in progress. Other assets under the course of construction are not amortised.
Expenditure on development activities including internally generated intangible assets is recognised as an asset if and only if it meets 
the recognition criteria set out in IAS 38 Intangible Assets. Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period 
in which it is incurred. Intangible assets under construction are not amortised.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, a review of the carrying amounts of the Group’s and the Company’s tangible and intangible assets 
is performed to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
The recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced 
to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct 
labour costs and an attributable portion of production overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present 
location and condition. Cost is calculated using the standard cost method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price 
less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made for obsolete, 
slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s and the Company’s balance sheets when the Group or the 
Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Where the Group holds an investment in shares which is classified as an available-for-sale financial asset it is stated at cost less any 
provision for impairment and estimated costs associated with the sale, unless the investment is in relation to shares traded on an active 
market where a fair valuation for all the shares can be obtained. Such investments are held at fair value, taken as the closing market 
value of the shares. Any revaluation gain or loss is recorded through other comprehensive income.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost, less provision for impairment. 
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement when there is objective 
evidence that the asset is impaired. When a trade receivable is considered uncollectable, it is written off. Subsequent recoveries 
of amounts previously written off are credited to the income statement. Changes in the carrying amount of receivables are 
recognised in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Term deposits
Term deposits represent bank deposits and a charitable bond all with an original maturity of over three months.

For the year ended 30 June 2017 3. Significant accounting policies continued
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group or the Company after deducting 
all of its liabilities. The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at amortised cost.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments
Forward contracts are used by the Group and the Company to manage the exposure to foreign exchange rate risk associated with 
the variability in foreign currency rates and values in relation to both recognised assets or liabilities and forecast future transactions.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to 
their fair value at each balance sheet date. A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative 
with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately 
unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the income 
statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than twelve 
months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within twelve months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or 
current liabilities.
Hedge accounting
The Group and the Company designate certain derivatives as cash flow hedges of highly probable forecast foreign currency 
transactions. The Group and the Company have also designated contingent consideration payable as a hedge of their net 
investment in foreign operations.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, 
along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception 
of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship 
is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or net investment of the hedged item.
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is deferred in other 
comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is included in 
the ‘administration and management expenses’ line of the income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, 
in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated 
or exercised, or it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in other comprehensive income at that 
time remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. 
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in other comprehensive 
income is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
Hedges of net investment in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the 
translation reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, and is included in 
the ‘administration and management expenses’ line of the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in the translation reserve are reclassified to profit or loss in the same way as exchange differences relating 
to the foreign operation.
Share-based payments
Incentives in the form of shares are provided to employees under share option, Share Incentive Plan (SIP), Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
and Deferred Share Award schemes. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of 
non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled 
share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the number 
of shares that will eventually vest.
The grant date fair value of options issued under the Group’s share option schemes is measured by the use of the Monte Carlo simulation.

Financial statements Financial statements 3. Significant accounting policies continued
Share-based payments continued
The grant date fair value of the awards under the Group’s LTIP is measured by the use of the Monte Carlo simulation for any market 
related performance conditions and the Black Scholes model for EPS and strategic performance conditions.
The grant date fair value of an equity-settled payment under the SIP is measured as the face value of the award on the date of grant.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. Charges made to the income statement in respect of share-based payments are 
credited to the reserves.
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the 
non-market based vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with 
a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The Group operates a scheme whereby the Non-Executive Directors of the Group are issued with options, the fair value of which is 
issued measured by the use of the Black Scholes model.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as 
a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised 
over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity in the parent entity 
financial statements.
When the options are exercised, the Company issues new shares. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction 
costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.
The Group operates an employee share benefit trust as part of its incentive plans for UK-based employees. All assets and liabilities of 
the trust are recorded in the balance sheet as assets and liabilities of the Company until such time as the assets are awarded to the 
beneficiaries. All income and expenditure of the trust is similarly brought into the results of the Company.
Own shares
Own equity instruments which are acquired are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the 
income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. Any difference between the 
carrying amount and the consideration is recognised in reserves.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders or, in the case of interim dividends, when paid.
4. Risks and uncertainties
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the Directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in the financial statements. Actual amounts 
and results may differ from those estimates.
The Directors regularly evaluate the estimates and judgements. Any revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or prior periods, or in the period of the revision and future periods 
if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The key accounting judgements and estimates included in the Group’s financial statements are discussed below.
a. Critical accounting judgements
Capitalisation of intangible assets
The Group capitalises internal software development costs relating to the enhancement of the Group’s core IT systems architecture 
and developments, where the costs meet the recognition criteria of IAS 38. Judgement is required in applying the capitalisation criteria 
of IAS 38, differentiating between enhancements and maintenance, and in assessing an expected useful life of the resulting enhancement 
or development.
During the year £11.2m was capitalised, £8.7m within assets under construction and £2.5m within software assets, in relation to the 
Group’s systems and process improvement project. The costs include external consultant costs and incremental staffing costs. In establishing 
the principles on which the costs are capitalised, the Directors have reviewed the nature of work being performed under the different 
phases of the project and the nature of the associated deliverables against the capitalisation criteria of IAS 38 and have identified the 
activities through the life of the project where the related costs should be expensed through the income statement.
Valuation of own manufactured inventory
The costs absorbed into the value of own manufactured inventory require a number of assumptions concerning the allocation of materials, 
labour and overheads. The assumptions have been made with reference to the requirements of IAS 2 Inventories. Judgement is used 
mainly in the application of materials to products produced and in selecting the types of overhead and company personnel that are 
appropriate to be included in the valuation.

Notes to the financial statements continued
For the year ended 30 June 2017 4. Risks and uncertainties continued
b. Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment
Goodwill is deemed to have indefinite life and so is not amortised. The Group tests whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual 
basis or more frequently when there are indications of possible impairment. The impairment review requires estimating the value-in-use 
of the Group’s CGU, this estimation uses a number of input assumptions where management must apply judgement including:
• the estimation of forecast future cash flows, risk adjusted where relevant;
• the selection of an appropriate discount rate in order to calculate present value; and
• the selection of an appropriate terminal growth rate.
The assumptions used in the impairment test are set out in note 12. The valuations indicate that the Group has sufficient headroom 
and that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill.
Other intangible assets are amortised. The Group reviews their carrying amount at each balance sheet date or if events occur which 
call into question the carrying values of the assets.
With the live release of certain initial modules of the Group’s new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system during the year, a further 
review of the carrying value of existing software assets was conducted to identify any instances where the current development work 
will replace the predecessor development. A number of assets were identified and their remaining useful life shortened based on the 
expected replacement date. Consequently additional amortisation of £0.3m has been recognised in the current year (2016: £1.3m) 
to accelerate the amortisation.
The assumptions relating to future cash flows, estimated useful lives and discount rates are based on business forecasts and therefore 
inherently include an element of management judgement. Future events could cause the assumptions used in these impairment tests 
to change which may in turn mean future impairment charges to be recognised.
Provision for slow-moving or defective inventory
The provision for slow-moving inventory is based on management’s estimation of the future sales of each of the Group’s products over 
the period from the balance sheet date to the expiry date of the product, (the next eight years where evidence of normal product life 
cycle is shorter). Estimated future sales are based on historical actual sales and a growth rate assumption which is derived from the average 
annual growth over the product life to date.
If actual unit sales growth rates differ from those estimated by management, both the level of provision against existing inventory and 
the rates of provision applied to inventory in future periods would need to be revised.
Provision for bad or doubtful debts
The Group has a significant trade receivable balance from a large number of customers at any given point in time. Consequently estimating 
the required provision for such a debtor book requires a regular review to identify those customers where events (either historical or current) 
give management an indication that future collectability may be uncertain.
During the year a review of the historical default rate was undertaken to update the provision input assumption. The recent historical 
trend showed a very low level of actual write-offs, thereby resulting in a revision of the expected collectability of the Group’s debtor 
portfolio. Consequently £0.7m of the provision has been released to the income statement.
Taxation
The Group is subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. Significant judgement is employed to determine the income tax provision 
on a global basis. There are numerous transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the 
ordinary course of business. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional 
taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters differs from amounts initially recorded, such differences will impact the 
income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
The Group holds significant deferred tax assets on the balance sheet in relation to acquired tax losses. Assessments were performed 
by third party experts to verify the availability of these acquired tax losses and, as such, partly utilise them within both the tax returns 
submitted for the year ended 30 June 2016 and against the provision at 30 June 2017.
The carrying value of the deferred tax asset is based on expected levels of future taxable profit in the relevant jurisdictions which are 
estimated from management forecasts. If actual profitability differs significantly by jurisdiction in the future, this could impact the level 
of losses that it is possible to utilise and therefore would require an impairment of the tax asset value.

Financial statements Financial statements 5. Operating segments
Products and services from which reportable segments derive their revenues
The Directors consider that there are no identifiable business segments that are engaged in providing individual products or services or 
a group of related products and services that are subject to risks and returns that are different to the core business. The information reported 
to the Group’s Chief Executive Officer, who is considered the chief operating decision maker, for the purposes of resource allocation 
and assessment of performance is based wholly on the overall activities of the Group. The Group has therefore determined that it has 
only one reportable segment under IFRS 8 Operating Segments, which is ‘sales of antibodies and related products’. The Group’s revenue 
and assets for this one reportable segment can be determined by reference to the Group’s income statement and balance sheet.
The Group has no individual product or customer which contributes more than 10% of its revenues.

financial instruments) by geographical location is detailed below:

UK corporation tax is calculated at 19.75% (2016: 20%) of the estimated assessable profit for the year. Taxation for other jurisdictions is 
calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions. The standard rate of UK corporation tax reduced from 20% to 19% on 
1 April 2017.
In the budget of 16 March 2016, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the Corporation Tax main rate will be reduced 
by an additional 1% for the Financial Year beginning 1 April 2020. The legislation in Finance Act 2016 set the rate at 17%, replacing the 
rate set for Financial Year 2020 in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2015. This will have an effect on the Group’s future tax position. The standard 
rate of UK corporation tax will now reduce to 17% from 1 April 2020. These proposed changes were substantively enacted when the 
Finance Bill 2016 received Royal Assent on 15 September 2016.
The above changes to the rate of corporation tax will impact the amount of future cash tax payments to be made by the Group 
and also the future valuation of any deferred tax liabilities or assets.

2  The recognition of deferred tax not previously recognised relates to the tax attributes acquired from Epitomics Inc. During the year ended 30 June 2017 
a third party report to determine the availability of these attributes was analysed and implemented by management. It was concluded that these attributes 
were available for utilisation and would be utilised within the required time limits. Therefore a one-off adjustment was made to recognise these attributes, 
some of which has already unwound.

For the year ended 30 June 2017 11. Earnings per share continued
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to the owners of the parent by the weighted average number of shares 
outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is calculated on the same basis as basic EPS but with a further adjustment for the weighted 
average shares in issue to reflect the effect of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The number of dilutive potential ordinary shares is 
derived from the number of share-based options and awards granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average 
market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year and where it is considered performance conditions will be met.
Adjusted earnings per share

Goodwill is converted at the exchange rate on the date of acquisition and retranslated at the balance sheet date.
Group goodwill acquired in the year ended 30 June 2016 relates to the acquisition of AxioMx Inc (AxioMx) on 11 November 2015. 
Note 27 contains further details of the transaction and resulting financial impact on the Group.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business 
combination. The Directors consider there to be one CGU as acquisitions are integrated into the Group’s operations and product 
portfolio; see note 5. Any discrete financial information which is available for an individual entity does not reflect the true substance 
of the performance of that entity or its value in use within the Group. There have been no changes to the Group organisation during 
the period which would require a reallocation of the goodwill balance.
The Abcam Group CGU is tested for impairment on a Group-wide basis using the future forecast cash flows arising from the Abcam 
business as a whole.
The Group performs an annual test for goodwill impairment or more frequently if there are any indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions considered most sensitive 
for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and growth rates after five years.
Management has projected cash flows based on financial forecasts over a period of five years. A growth rate of 2.3% has been used 
in the extrapolation of cash flows beyond the five years based on expected inflationary increases of the economies in which the Group 
predominantly trades. A pre-tax discount rate of 9.4% has been estimated using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU.
Management has performed a sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions mentioned above. Based on the results of this analysis, 
management is satisfied that the recoverable amount of goodwill exceeds its carrying amount. As such, no impairment of goodwill 
has been recognised at the balance sheet date.
Due to the headroom which exists between the recoverable amount and the carrying value there is currently no reasonable possible 
change in any of these key assumptions which would cause the CGU’s carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.

The amortisation period for the upfront licence fees, software and distribution rights is referred to in note 3.
Material intangible assets
Software intangible assets relate to software licences, as well as the core IT systems, inclusive of the new ERP system.
Contract-based intangibles relates to:
• an agreement with the University of Oregon, under which the university supplies monoclonal antibodies to MitoSciences Inc, which 
has full rights and entitlement to commercially exploit these materials in exchange for an ongoing fee. The remaining amortisation 
period is seven years, being the remaining term of the agreement; and
• a support agreement with a third party acquired during the year ended 30 June 2016 as part of the AxioMx acquisition that had 
a remaining term of three years at acquisition which has been adopted as the asset’s useful life. The remaining amortisation period 
is four months.
Assets under construction are software related. The costs capitalised relate to the development of the core IT systems architecture, 
including the build of the new ERP system. These are not amortised until available for use in the business.
Customer relationships mainly relates to access to new customers as part of the Epitomics acquisition, namely in the reagents 
and services business. The remaining amortisation period is five years in line with the history of the business. 
Patents, technology and know-how relates to acquired technology as part of the Group’s acquisitions:
• RabMAb
®
 technology as part of the Epitomics business with a remaining amortisation period of ten years, being the remaining term 
of the primary patent;
• multiplex and complex assay technology acquired as part of the Firefly BioWorks business. The amortisation period will be the remaining 
term on the primary patent, which is twelve years; and
• in vitro monoclonal antibody production technology was acquired during the year ended 30 June 2016 with the acquisition 
of AxioMx. The useful life was set in line with the remaining life on the patents existing at acquisition. The remaining amortisation 
period is sixteen years.
Trade names relate to RabMAb
®
 and Epitomics. The remaining amortisation period is three years.

Notes to the financial statements continued
For the year ended 30 June 2017 17. Financial assets continued
Trade receivables continued
Movement in the allowance for doubtful debts continued
The average credit period taken for sales is 31.8 days (2016: 36.5 days). No interest has been charged on the receivables. Trade receivables 
are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to past default experience. A detailed review 
of historical debtor default was undertaken during the year, which demonstrated a low trend of actual write offs and thereby resulted 
in a revision of the expected collectability of the Group’s trade receivable portfolio. Consequently, £693,000 of the provision has been 
released to the income statement in the period.
Credit limits for each customer are reviewed on a monthly basis. No customer represents more than 5% of the total balance 
of trade receivables.
The Group does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements over its trade receivables, nor do they have a legal right to 
offset against any amounts owed to the counterparty.
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the receivable from 
the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being 
large and unrelated. Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for 
doubtful debts.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

The Group holds a 3.92% interest in PlexBio Co. Limited (PlexBio), a biotechnology company headquartered in Taiwan which was listed 
on the Taiwan Emerging Stock Board in the year ended 30 June 2016. PlexBio was established to research, develop and manufacture 
IVD kits. 
For the year ended 30 June 2016, the Directors did not believe that the conditions for an active market had been met and determined 
the fair value to be in line with the original cost. A further twelve months of trading has allowed trading prices to stabilise from initial listing 
and are therefore a more reliable indication of the investment fair value. Consequently the fair value at 30 June 2017 is based on the 
year-end quoted market price. See note 24 for further details.

Group had an average of 29.3 days of purchases (2016: 22.8 days) outstanding in trade payables (excluding accruals and deferred 
income). Most suppliers do not charge interest for the first 60 days of the invoice. The Group has financial risk management policies in 
place to ensure that all payables are paid within the credit timetable. The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and 
other payables approximates to their fair value.

24. Financial instruments
Capital risk management
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents and total equity attributable to the owners of the parent. 
The Group maintains a capital structure with the following objectives:
• to protect the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern and maintain sufficient available resources as protection 
for unforeseen events;
• to provide flexibility of resource for strategic growth and investment where opportunities arise; and
• to provide reasonable returns to shareholders whilst maintaining a limited level of risk.
As part of achieving these objectives the Group identifies the principal financial risk exposures that are created by the Group’s financial 
instruments and monitors them on a regular basis. These are considered to be foreign currency risk (a component of market risk), credit 
risk and liquidity risk.
Where appropriate, the Group uses financial derivatives to help mitigate the key risks. The use of financial derivatives is governed by 
the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative 
financial instruments, for speculative purposes.

Foreign currency risk
Currency risk is the risk that a change in currency rates causes an adverse impact on the Group’s performance or financial position.
The Group has transactions denominated in various currencies other than the Group’s presentational currency, GBP. The Group’s principal 
currency exposure is to fluctuations in USD, Euro, Chinese Renminbi and Yen. Collectively these currencies make up approximately 89% of 
the Group’s revenue. Whilst a large portion of the manufacturing and research and development costs are USD and RMB giving a natural 
offset against the currency inflows, the majority of administration costs remain as GBP leaving an overall net currency inflow in the 
Group’s operating profit and cash flows.
This remaining currency exposure is centrally managed with the objective being to secure a level of certainty of GBP value for up to 90% 
of the future net exposure based on forecast cash flows expected to occur up to 18 months ahead. The Group uses forward currency 
contracts to achieve this objective and applies hedge accounting where applicable.
Foreign currency forward contracts are valued using quoted forward exchange rates and the yield curves derived from quoted interest 
rates matching maturities of the contracts.
The Group’s open forward currency contracts and their maturity profile as at the year-end is as follows:

At 30 June 2017, the fair value of contracts held as cash flow hedges is a liability of £0.1m (2016: liability of £8.6m). The remaining 
contracts are not held as cash flow hedges. The gain on the financial assets at fair value through the profit and loss account was 
£1.2m (2016: loss of £2.4m). The gain of £8.6m (2016: £10.8m loss) recognised through comprehensive income is the combination of 
fair value gains in the year of £1.2m (2016: £8.6m losses) and transfers to the income statement of £7.4m (2016: £2.2m loss) included 
within administration and management expenses.
The Group may also use other currency-denominated financial instruments, such as contingent consideration, as net investment 
hedges against the currency translation of overseas subsidiaries results. During the year the USD contingent consideration which 
was designated as a hedging instrument against the net investment of the US subsidiaries was settled.
Currency risk sensitivity analysis
The following table shows the sensitivity of the Group’s financial instruments to changes in exchange rates by detailing the impact 
on profit and other comprehensive income of a 10% change in the sterling exchange rate against the relevant foreign currencies.
10% represents management’s assessment of the reasonable possible change in foreign exchange rates over a 12-month period. This is 
a lower assessment than in the prior year as a reflection of the less volatile currency environment experienced through the last 12 months 
since Brexit.
The sensitivity analysis only includes financial instruments denominated in non-functional currency and forward currency contracts 
outstanding at the reporting date. It represents the impact of an immediate 10% change in currency rates on that position. +10% is 
a strengthening in sterling against the other currencies, -10% is a weakening of sterling against the other currencies.

In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk since it is limited to the year 
end exposure and does not reflect the exposure during the year.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will have insufficient funds available in the right currency to settle its obligations as they fall due.
The Group generates funds from operational activities in excess of its operational requirements and has substantial cash balances 
available for its current investment activities.
The Board reviews the funding requirement of the Group as part of the budgeting and long term planning processes and considers as 
necessary alternative possible sources of funding where the requirement is not satisfied by the Group’s forecast operational cash generation.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining an adequate level of easily accessible cash reserves, in a currency profile representative 
of the Group’s cost base and matching customer and supplier terms where possible. The Group also has access to daily currency trading 
facilities which provides the ability to convert currency within the agreed settlement limits as required.
The maturity profile of financial liabilities shown below represents the Group’s gross expected contractual cash flows.

The Group holds sufficient funds to meet these commitments as they fall due.
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on its financial assets which consist of cash, derivative instruments, and trade and other receivables 
to the extent that settlement is cash-related. The Group does not have a significant exposure to this type of financial risk due to the 
nature of its customer base and the types of transaction that are undertaken.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread globally with the majority being in economically strong geographies. 
The Group has a high volume of transactions spread across its customer base and therefore does not have a significant exposure to 
the credit worthiness of any single counterparty.
The Group’s customer base is predominantly representatives from government-funded institutions, pharmaceutical companies 
conducting research, and local distributors. Whilst there is some exposure for future sales linked with the local economies, a significant 
portion of the existing Group receivables are funded in advance of purchase due to the nature of the counterparty thereby giving a 
lower likelihood of default.
Trade receivables are managed and monitored locally which includes deciding whether to allow credit, setting an appropriate credit limit, 
and subsequent on-going monitoring of receivable aging along with other indicators where credit risk on a given customer or group of 
customers may have changed, such as an observable change in local economic conditions. The standard payment terms for receivables 
is 30 days.
Any receivable where collectability is considered doubtful based on past experience or due to a trigger event occurring specific to 
that customer, is provided in full. At the point when it is certain that a receivable will not be settled, the carrying value is written off, and 
the related provision released against the expense. Further information on the Group’s trade receivable aging and impairment can be 
found in note 17.

Financial statements Financial statements 24. Financial instruments continued
Credit risk continued
The Group generates significant levels of operational cash. Where these are not yet required for business opportunities, the excess cash 
is remitted and managed centrally. The maximum exposure to counterparty default is the carrying amount of cash and open currency 
contracts held at any given time. This exposure is managed by limiting the concentration of funds and contracts held with any individual 
financial institution. Funds are only placed with institutions or in products rated BBB- or above by Standard & Poor’s. The Group monitors 
the credit rating of the major institutions along with any increasing cash concentration on a quarterly basis to identify any change in 
credit risk exposure.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that a change in interest rates adversely effects the Group or Company’s performance or ability to settle 
financial obligations.
As the Group does not hold any external debt and is not dependent on income from investment returns to settle operational obligations, 
exposure to interest rate risk is considered minimal and consequently no sensitivity analysis is presented.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments principally consist of those arising directly from the operations of the Group, such as cash, trade and other receivables, 
and trade and other payables, and non-operational instruments such as forward currency contracts and equity investments.
Significant accounting policies
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement 
and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity 
instrument are disclosed in note 3. Foreign exchange contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and the yield 
curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of these contracts.

1 Financial instruments within trade and other payables consist of trade payables, certain accruals and other payables.
The Directors consider there to be no material difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the financial instruments 
classified as held at amortised cost due to the short maturity of these items. For the items classified as held at fair value, the fair value 
is recognised on the balance sheet as the carrying amount as required by IAS 39.
Financial instruments held at fair value
Financial instruments that are measured at fair value are classified using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the source of inputs used in 
deriving the fair value. The three classification levels are:
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable 
for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable market inputs).
The following table presents the Group’s assets and liabilities carried at fair value by valuation method.

Level 2 derivative financial instruments comprise forward foreign exchange contracts. The fair value is remeasured on a monthly basis 
with reference to available forward market rates and comparative instrument pricing.
The Level 3 contingent consideration and fees payable was recognised as part of the AxioMx Inc acquisition in November 2015. During the 
year a negotiation for settlement of certain milestones early for commercial purposes was concluded in November 2016 at £2.4m less 
than the original liability estimate. Management also re-assessed the probability of the other milestones being achieved, increasing the 
fair value of the related liability by £1.5m with a net credit to the income statement of £0.9m. The remaining milestones were achieved 
in August 2016 and April 2017. As a result, no liability remains at the balance sheet date, the Group has satisfied all obligations under this 
arrangement. The movement in the liability during the year is detailed below:

Changes between classifications
During the year the available-for-sale asset, which consists of an equity investment listed on the Taiwan Emerging Stock Board, has 
been transferred from Level 3 classification to Level 1 following a further year of inclusion on the market. The Directors believe that the 
additional 12 months of trading has allowed trading prices to stabilise from initial listing and are therefore a more reliable indication 
of the investment fair value. Consequently the fair value is based on the year end quoted market price.
25. Share-based payments
Equity-settled share option scheme
The Company operates a number of share option schemes for certain employees of the Group. The share-based payments charge relates 
to option awards from the Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) scheme, the Unapproved Share Option Plan, the Abcam Inc share 
scheme, the Abcam 2005 Share Option Scheme, the Abcam Company Share Option Plan (CSOP), the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), 
the deferred share award, the Share Incentive Plan (SIP) and the NED share award. Option or conditional share grants under each scheme 
have been aggregated.
The vesting period ranges from one to four years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant the 
options expire. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
The Group recorded a total equity-settled share-based payments expense of £3,496,000 in the year (2016: £1,962,000), of which 
£3,075,000 (2016: £1,627,000) was included within administration and management expenses and £421,000 (2016: £301,000) was 
included within R&D expenses.

The risk-free rate is the yield on UK government gilts at each date of grant. The employee exercise multiple is based on published statistics 
for a portfolio of companies. The employee exit rate is based on management’s expectations at the valuation date.
Share Incentive Plan
All UK-based employees are eligible to participate in the SIP whereby employees buy shares in the Company. These shares are called 
Partnership Shares and are held in trust on behalf of the employee. For every Partnership Share bought by the employee up to a limit of 
£1,800 per tax year the Company will give the employee one share free of charge (Matching Shares), provided the employee remains 
employed by the Company for a period of at least three years. The employees must take their shares out of the plan on leaving the 
Company and will not be entitled to the Matching Shares if they leave within three years of buying the Partnership Shares. In addition, 
the Company can also award employees up to a maximum of the HMRC approval limit, which during the year was £3,600 of shares 
(Free Shares) per tax year. There are no vesting conditions attached to the Free Shares, other than being continuously employed by 
the Company for three years from the date of grant.

For the purposes of IFRS 2 the fair value of these Matching Shares and Free Shares is determined as the market value of the shares at 
the date of grant. No valuation model is required to calculate the fair value of awards under the SIP. The fair value of an equity-based 
payment under the SIP is the face value of the award on the date of grant because the participants are entitled to receive the full value 
of the shares and there are no market-based performance conditions attached to the awards.
The Group recognised a total expense of £765,000 (2016: £642,000) in the year relating to Matching and Free Share awards.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The Company approved a new LTIP in 2008. Full details of the performance conditions are outlined in the Remuneration Report. 
All awards are nil-cost options or conditional shares which vest, subject to achievement of the relevant performance conditions, 
after three years and can be exercised over the following seven years. Save as permitted in the LTIP rules, awards lapse on an 
employee leaving the Company.
Details of performance share awards outstanding during the year are as follows:

were exercised in exchange for cash (2016: 5,008).
The aggregates of the fair values of the awards made in the year were £2,201,000 and £149,000, granted on 4 November 2016,

Annual Bonus Plan – deferred share award
The Company approved a new component to the Annual Bonus Plan in 2013 whereby a portion of the annual amount awarded to 
certain senior management would be deferred in shares. The number of deferred shares granted is dependent on certain performance 
criteria, consisting of a one-year profit target, and achievement of strategic and personal objectives. There is a further two-year 
compulsory deferral period, at the end of which the deferred share awards will become exercisable subject to continued employment. 
All awards are nil-cost options or conditional shares.

Non-Executive Directors – share award
During the year ended 30 June 2016, the Company approved a new component to the Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration, whereby 
a portion of the annual fees agreed would be deferred in shares. The number of deferred shares granted will be settled in the open 
period following the completion of the one year vesting period. The Group recognised an expense of £183,000 (2016: £135,000) in the 
year related to these share awards under the Non-Executive Directors’ share plan.
Further details are included in the Remuneration Report on page 45.
Cash-settled share option scheme
In addition to the equity-settled schemes the Group operates a cash-settled scheme for certain overseas employees. The total charge 
for the year was £377,000 (2016: £281,000) and the liability was £534,000 (2016: £195,000), of which £25,000 (2016: £54,000) relates to options 
that have vested.

For the year ended 30 June 2017 26. Retirement benefit schemes
Defined contribution schemes
The UK-based employees of the Group have the option to be members of a defined contribution pension scheme managed by a third 
party pension provider. For each employee who is a member of the scheme the Company will contribute a fixed percentage of each 
employee’s salary to the scheme. The only obligation of the Group with respect to this scheme is to make the specified contributions.
Employees of the Group’s subsidiaries in the US, Japan, China and Hong Kong are members of state-managed retirement benefit schemes 
operated by the governments of the US, Japan, China and Hong Kong respectively. Depending on location, the subsidiaries are required 
to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit schemes to fund the benefits. The only obligation of the 
Group with respect to the retirement benefit schemes is to make the specified contributions as required by law.
The total cost charged to the income statement in respect of these schemes during the year ended 30 June 2017 was £2,759,000 
(2016: £2,235,000). As at 30 June 2017 contributions of £227,000 (2016: £181,000) due in respect of the current reporting period had 
not been paid over to the schemes.
27. Business combinations
During the year ended 30 June 2017 a negotiation for early settlement of certain milestones for commercial purposes was concluded 
in November 2016 at £2.4m less than the original liability estimate. Management also re-assessed the probability of the other milestones 
being achieved, increasing the fair value of the related liability by £1.5m with a net credit to the income statement of £0.9m. The remaining 
milestones were achieved in August 2016 and April 2017 and the consideration for these settled during the year. The Group has satisfied 
all obligations under this arrangement (refer to note 24 for a reconciliation of contingent consideration).
Details of acquisition in the year ended 30 June 2016
On 11 November 2015 the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued share capital of a private Delaware corporation, 
AxioMx Inc (AxioMx). Upfront consideration, including payments for working capital, of $19.3m was exchanged on the acquisition date 
with a payment of $2.4m made after the acquisition to settle pre-existing liabilities to largely offset the $2.0m cash and cash equivalents 
acquired. Further consideration payments of up to $23.5 million were payable on successful completion of future development and 
technology milestones. As a result of the acquisition, Abcam now has access to AxioMx’s technology, which potentially provides scalable 
capabilities to produce highly validated recombinant monoclonal antibodies within weeks (significantly faster than in vivo methods).
The goodwill of $18.2m (£11.8m) arising from the acquisition consists largely of the production opportunities derived from the acquired 
technology and the value of the highly knowledgeable and skilled workforce. The tax benefit recognised within goodwill in relation to 
the acquired AxioMx losses has been concluded by a section 382 loss analysis.
The following table summarises the consideration transferred and the fair value of the assets and liabilities recognised at the date 
of acquisition.

Financial statements Financial statements 27. Business combinations continued
Details of acquisition in the year ended 30 June 2016 continued
The fair value of the acquired identifiable intangible assets consists of £15.9m attributable to technology and £0.5m attributable to license 
support agreements. The values have been assessed by an independent third party valuation company. A related deferred tax liability 
of £6.3m has also been recognised.
The fair value of the equity consideration was determined using the mid-market close price on the date of the acquisition.
The Group recognised a contingent consideration liability of £9.6m in relation to the acquisition, which represents the total calculated 
present value of expected payments due upon achievement of predetermined development milestones. This value was also assessed 
as part of the independent third party valuation. The total contingent consideration and fees recognised by the Group at acquisition 
was £10.2m.
During the period from the date of acquisition to 30 June 2016, AxioMx contributed £0.4m to the Group’s revenue from sales to third 
parties and a loss before tax of £1.7m over the same period.
Had AxioMx been consolidated from 1 July 2015, the consolidated income statement for the year ended 30 June 2016 would show 
a Group pro-forma revenue of £172.0m and profit before tax of £44.4m.
28. Related party transactions
Remuneration of key management personnel
The remuneration of the key management personnel of the Group is set out below in aggregate for each of the categories in 
IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures.
The key management team for the prior year comprised the Non-Executive Directors, the Executive Directors and the Senior 
Leadership Team. In April 2016 the key management team was restructured and the Senior Leadership Team replaced by the 
Executive Leadership Team. The prior year figures therefore represent pro-rated amounts for the change in structure.
The Non-Executive Directors’ fees for the year ended 30 June 2017 represent amounts received in cash and an element receivable 
in shares. Further information about the remuneration of individual Directors is provided in the audited section of the Remuneration 
Report on pages 41 to 54.

additional product-related fees of £41,595 (2016: £4,700). The balance outstanding at 30 June 2017 was £6,000 (30 June 2016: £3,000).

Financial statements
Company statement of changes in equity
For the year ended 30 June 2017 1. Significant accounting policies
The separate financial statements of the Company, which are prepared on the historical cost convention (as modified to include revaluation 
of certain financial instruments) and on the going concern basis, are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The Company 
meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). Accordingly in the year ended 30 June 2017, the Company has decided to adopt FRS 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework and has undergone transition from reporting under IFRSs adopted by the European Union to FRS 101 as 
issued by the FRC. Accordingly, the financial statements have therefore been prepared in accordance with FRS 101, incorporating the 
amendments to FRS 101 issued by the FRC in July 2015 and July 2016. This transition is not considered to have had a material effect on 
the financial statements.
The Company is included in the Group financial statements of Abcam plc, presented on pages 65 to 96.
The following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements, 
in accordance with FRS 101:
• Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
• IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
• Paragraphs 91–99 of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. 
• Paragraph 38 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and comparative information requirements in respect of paragraph 
79(a) (iv) of IAS 1.
• Paragraph 73(e) of IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and 118(e) of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
• Paragraphs 10(d), 10(f), 16, 38(a), 38(b to d), 40(a to d), 111, and 134 to 136 of IAS 1.
• IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows.
• Paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.
• Paragraph 17 of IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures and the further requirement in IAS 24 to disclose related party transactions entered 
into between two or more members of a group.
The basis for all of the above exemptions is because equivalent disclosures are included in the Group financial statements in which the 
entity is consolidated.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101, ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ 
(FRS 101) and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 except for the departure from the Companies Act explained in note 4.
The financial information has been prepared on the going concern and historical cost basis. The principal accounting policies adopted 
are the same as those set out in note 4 (paragraph a) of the Group financial statements, except in respect of investments in subsidiaries, 
which are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment. All accounting policies have been applied consistently. 
Critical accounting judgements 
The preparation of Company financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Company 
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from 
those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future 
periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The critical accounting judgements have been set out in note 4 of the 
Group financial statements. These judgements have been applied consistently within the Company financial statements.
2. Profit for the year
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account or 
statement of comprehensive income for the year. The profit attributable to the Company amounted to £39,508,000 (2016: £45,901,000). 
The auditor’s remuneration is disclosed in note 7 of the Group financial statements.

The Company does not amortise goodwill in accordance with the requirements of IFRS as applied under FRS 101. Instead an annual 
impairment test is performed and any impairment that is identified is recognised in the income statement. The non-amortisation of 
goodwill conflicts with paragraph 22 of Schedule 1 to ‘The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/410), which requires acquired goodwill to be written off over its useful economic life. As such, the non-amortisation 
of goodwill is a departure from the Companies Act 2006, for the overriding purpose of giving a true and fair view, from the requirement 
of paragraph 22 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations.
It is not possible to quantify the effect of the departure from the Companies Act 2006, because a finite life for the goodwill has not 
been identified. However, the effect of amortising over a useful life of 20 years would be a charge of £0.4 million (2016: £0.4 million) 
against operating profit, and a reduction of £0.8 million (2016: £0.4 million) in the carrying value of goodwill in the balance sheet.
Goodwill impairment review
The Company goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are any indications that the goodwill 
might be impaired. The forecast cash flows arising in the Company have been projected using the same key assumptions as used 
for the Group testing.
Management has performed a sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions and, based on the results of this analysis, management 
is satisfied that the recoverable amount of goodwill exceeds its carrying amount. As such, no impairment of goodwill has been 
recognised at the balance sheet date.

The amortisation period for the upfront licence fees, software and distribution rights is referred to in note 3 of the Group financial statements.
Assets under construction are software related. The costs capitalised relate to the development of the core IT systems architecture, including 
the build of the new ERP system. These are not amortised until available for use in the business.
Customer relationships in the Company balance sheet have been acquired as part of the trade transfer of Ascent Scientific Ltd (Ascent) 
and represent access to new customers in the biochemical industry. The remaining amortisation period is two months.
Patents, technology and know-how relates to acquired technology as part of the Company’s acquisitions. These are included in note 13 
of the Group financial statements. The technology asset in the Company balance sheet was acquired as part of the trade transfer of 
Ascent and represents the cost to recreate unique production processes that were assessed during the original acquisition of Ascent 
by the Group. This has been fully amortised in the year.

reporting year.

Credit/(charge) to income 260 (231) — 119 (137) 11
Credit to equity — (1,546) (937) — — (2,483)
At 30 June 2017 (204) 113 1,664 — 28 1,601
The Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the 
liability is settled or the asset realised based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. 
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the asset can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so. The following is the analysis of the 
deferred tax balances (after offset) for financial reporting purposes:
 
30 June 2017
£000
30 June 2016
£000
Deferred tax assets
 Deferred tax assets to be recovered after more than 12 months 1,651 2,524
 Deferred tax assets to be recovered within 12 months 154 1,668

Deferred tax liabilities
 Deferred tax liabilities to be recovered after more than 12 months — —
 Deferred tax liabilities to be recovered within 12 months (204) (119)
(204) (119)
Deferred tax assets (net) 1,601 4,073
No deferred tax asset or liability is recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where the 
Company is able to control the timing of reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future. The Directors believe that all dividends to be paid by the Company’s subsidiaries will meet the UK tax 
legislation amendment largely exempting dividends from the UK if received on or after 1 July 2009.

Financial statements
Notes to the Company financial statements continued
For the year ended 30 June 2017 Antibody A protein made by the immune system that binds specifically to an antigen. When an antibody detects 
this antigen in the body, it will contribute to an immune response to rid the body of the antigen.
Amino acids The basic building blocks of proteins and peptides.
Antigen A molecule that is recognised by the immune system and which can be specifically bound by an antibody.
Assay A laboratory test for assessing the presence, amount or functional activity of a chemical or biological molecule.
Biological pathway A series of molecular interactions that leads to a change in a cell in response to a stimulus. For example, 
biological pathways can trigger the assembly of new molecules, turn genes on and off, or spur a cell to move.
Biomarker A measurable indicator of a biological state or condition. For example, increased amounts of a particular 
protein in a blood sample may indicate the presence of a particular disease.
Conjugated antibody Antibodies that are chemically bound to molecules that enable detection of the antibody. For example, 
an antibody might be bound to a fluorescent dye.
DNA Deoxyribonucleic Acid – a polymeric molecule that comprises both the coding and non-coding elements 
of the genome of an organism. Coding elements are transcribed into RNA, while non-coding elements 
exert cellular control functions.
ELISA Assay that uses antibodies to detect and quantify proteins and peptides in a biological sample. Acronym for 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
ERP Acronym for enterprise resource planning. It refers to business process management software that allows 
an organisation to use a system of integrated applications to manage the business and automate many 
back office functions related to technology, services and human resources.
Gene A section of DNA that acts as the blueprint for making a particular protein. Every human being (except 
identical twins) has a unique set of genes, half of which came from their mother and the other half from 
their father.
Immunoassay A test that uses the binding of antibodies to antigens to detect and quantify a biological molecule in a sample.
In vitro Describes studies that are performed with microorganisms, cells or biological molecules outside their 
normal biological context. For example, an in vitro experiment might involve extracting a blood sample 
from a patient, and performing an assay on that sample in a test tube.
In vivo Describes a biological process that takes place in a living cell or organism, including animals and plants.
Kits and assays Multi-component products comprising antibodies and other reagents that can be used to detect a wide 
range of biological molecules.
Knockout cell lines A cell line that has had a particular gene removed (or ‘knocked out’). The protein that the knocked-out 
gene encodes for is therefore not produced.
Lysate The fluid produced by lysis of cells and tissues. Lysates are used as controls in biological experiments 
to confirm the absence or presence of proteins of interest.
Lysis The disruption of cells by mechanical, chemical or enzymatic means.
Matched antibody pairs A pair of antibodies that binds to an individual protein at different sites, meaning that both antibodies of 
the pair can bind the protein at the same time. Matched antibody pairs are used in assays such as ELISA.
microRNA or miRNA Small RNAs that are involved in regulating gene expression.
Monoclonal antibodies Identical antibodies derived from a group of identical cloned cells. Monoclonal antibodies recognise only 
one kind of antigen, i.e. they bind to the same site on a protein.
Multiplex immunoassays Immunoassays that can detect multiple proteins at once within a single sample. They allow scientists to increase 
the efficiency and scope of their experiments.
Net Promoter Score or NPS A management tool that can be used to gauge the loyalty of a company’s customer relationships. It serves 
as an alternative to traditional customer satisfaction research and can be correlated with revenue growth.
Peptides Short chains of amino acids.
PD-L1 Acronym for programmed death-ligand 1. It is a protein that plays a major role in suppressing the immune 
system and is an important target in difficult to treat cancers.
Polyclonal antibodies Antibodies that target the same antigen, but are derived from different cell lineages. Polyclonal antibodies 
bind to different sites on the antigen.
Proteins Large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. Proteins are required for the structure, function and 
regulation of the body’s tissues and organs.
RabMAb
®
Abcam’s patented technology for the generation of high quality rabbit monoclonal antibodies.
Rabbit/recombinant 
monoclonal antibodies
Antibodies made by cloning DNA sequences from cell lines that produce rabbit monoclonal antibodies. 
Cloned recombinant antibodies are identical, and are therefore not susceptible to lot-to-lot variation.
Reagent A product used in an experiment to detect or measure biological processes.
Recombinant An antibody or protein that is synthesised from modified DNA in an artificial system that permits rapid 
production of large quantities of the protein.
RNA Ribonucleic Acid – a polymeric molecule that is transcribed from DNA. Various forms of RNA are involved 
in protein synthesis.
Specificity This refers to the ability of an antibody to bind only the desired antigen.
SimpleStep ELISA
®
 kits Kits that deliver fast results in just 90 minutes by reducing antibody and sample additions to a single step.
