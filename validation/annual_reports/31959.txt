BOWLEVEN AT A GLANCE
An Africa-Focused  
Oil and Gas Company
Bowleven plc has strategic interests in key hydrocarbon licences in Cameroon. 
It currently has a 25% interest in an offshore, shallow water permit in Etinde 
and a 100% interest in Bomono, an onshore permit. Our vision is to deliver 
transformational shareholder value through monetisation of our discovered 
hydrocarbons. Creating value from these assets and managing risk are core 
deliverables to our shareholders.
Where We Operate
The West African state of Cameroon has an established hydrocarbon industry with a history  
of oil production from the Rio del Rey Basin.
The Group has strategic equity interests in two permits in Cameroon, the offshore shallow water 
Etinde Permit (non-operated) and the Onshore Bomono Permit (operated).

Our Portfolio
Etinde
The Etinde Permit (formerly MLHP-7 block) was awarded an 
Exploitation Authorisation in July 2014. The production sharing 
contract based Permit has a term of 20 years with an option to extend 
for a further ten years. The licence sits in the prolific Rio del Rey Basin. 
The IM-5 well drilled in 2013, encountered liquids-rich hydrocarbons 
at sufficient volumes to underpin a development scheme within the 
EA framework.
Bowleven has an 25% interest currently. SNH has a right to back-in 
the PSC, which would have the impact of reducing Bowleven’s interest 
to 20%.
Bomono
The Bomono Permit is located in an onshore extension of the Douala 
Basin. The acreage is characterised by numerous surface oil seeps, 
but is under-explored using modern exploration methods. We have 
identified multiple Tertiary and Cretaceous age prospects and leads, 
as well as the hydrocarbons identified in the Moambe and Zingara 
exploration wells drilled in 2015.

CEO STATEMENT
A Strong Platform for Growth 
Following Transformational Change
2017 was a year of significant change for Bowleven. Having substantially 
reduced the operating costs and maintained a strong balance sheet, 
the Company is well positioned to develop its assets. 
whilst continuing to scrutinise work programme costs 
and exercise capital discipline wherever possible.
Our capital discipline is underpinned by a strong 
financial position, which will remain a recurring 
theme into next year. With a strong cash 
balance and a deferred consideration structure 
in place post completion of the Etinde farm-
out transaction, no debt or outstanding work 
programme commitments, the Group is well placed 
financially to progress its existing asset base.
The prolonged downturn in the industry is creating 
opportunities for Bowleven by providing the ability 
to access lower development costs for its assets 
and to continue to challenge cost efficiency in the 
investment cycle. With its robust financial position, 
Bowleven is in an ideal position to capitalise on 
these opportunities as they arise. We remain 
determined and committed to challenging costs and 
proper capital allocation in operational delivery.
The farm-in agreement with VOG in respect of the 
Bomono licence area, has de-risked our funding 
obligations whilst retaining some long-term ability to 
extract some shareholder value, notwithstanding the 
reduction in the Group’s share of the asset. However, 
contractual terms of the farm-in as agreed by the 
previous Board provide limited financial value for the 
80% of the asset transferred to VOG, and efforts 
continue to mitigate the associated contingent liabilities. 
Our discussions with VOG to date have suggested 
that there are limited prospects of negotiating 
more favourable commercial terms. Should the 
farm-in arrangement with VOG not complete, 
the Group will not be in a position to present the 
Government with an alternative development plan 
for the licence area in the remaining time before the 
existing agreement terminates in December 2018.
Furthermore, there is a risk that the Government will 
not approve a further extension to the Exploration 
Authorisation. In which case, any Provisional 
Exploitation Authorisation (PEA) would cease 
to be valid. Therefore, when considering these 
risks as a whole, the Board deems it unlikely that 
the Government will seek to extend the existing 
licence any further at the current time without 
attaching additional work commitments.
As an incoming CEO, considerable effort was spent 
in engaging stakeholders to ensure the disruptive 
start to 2017 would result in a positive transformative 
change. Whilst the work is ongoing, Bowleven now 
has in place a fit-for-purpose organisation and 
business model that has the potential to deliver 
shareholder value into 2018 and beyond. 
The Board has strongly supported the turnaround 
agenda, and within a short period, the Company 
right-sized its cost base, initiated a more 
disciplined approach towards capital allocation 
and retained the capacity to deliver meaningful 
progress in its Etinde and Bomono assets. 
With a small central team we have been able to 
leverage our stakeholder relationships to navigate 
the complexity of these acreage developments 
with a view to delivering value from our assets. 
This focus has delivered the positive progress made 
with Société Nationale des Hydrocarbures (SNH) in 
Etinde, which has indicated support for the appraisal 
drilling programme that supports an economically 
viable Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) scheme. 
In Bomono, we have maintained the farm-in option 
with Victoria Oil & Gas Plc (VOG), which allows 
us to leverage their infrastructure, but as a non-
operator. Key to our business model is partnering,  Bowleven plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 05
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements
Given the ongoing negotiations and fundamental 
uncertainties, the recoverable amount of the 
Bomono asset has been determined to be zero at 
the current time, resulting in an impairment charge 
of $45.6m (2016: $61.0m) in the income statement 
as detailed in note 9 of the financial statements.
The focus on reducing G&A costs through 
organisational and work process efficiencies was 
taken to a new level towards the end of the financial 
year. The ongoing costs savings will significantly 
reduce the Group’s Corporate G&A footprint in 
both the UK and Cameroon. The Board is now 
focused on agreeing similar G&A efficiencies with 
the Operator of the Etinde asset. The outlook 
for Etinde is encouraging, and as the proposed 
appraisal well drilling programme materialises, this 
has important implications for the Company.
Outlook
Much progress has been made and the benefits 
of the relentless effort will be clearer into 2018. 
The task in hand is clear. We are determined 
to protect cash, maintain capital discipline and 
optimise the value and return from our assets. 
We will continue to focus on a strategy that preserves 
our financial robustness within the context of 
developing our assets in a manner that manages 
the risks and creates value over the longer term. 
The potentially transformational Etinde appraisal 
drilling campaign during 2018 will enable us to 
further define the asset monetisation route for this 
potentially world-class asset. The operating model 
is fit-for-purpose and I look forward to FY2018 
and beyond as we grow shareholder value.

STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK
Creating Shareholder Value
To deliver value to the shareholders by developing and growing 
the resources base from our Cameroon assets whilst maintaining 
rigorous attention to costs and value.
Our Strategic Re-Focus 
Positioning for Future Growth
Consistent with the Board transformation in March 2017, our plan is 
to create long-term shareholder value with these strategic pillars
1

5
Since April 2017 we have focused on adapting the organisational 
structure such that it allows for proper portfolio coverage and a 
cost base commensurate with the needs of the business.
In the near term we are not deploying capital for exploring for new 
oil and gas deposits. Given the current commodity cycle, along with 
the technical and funding requirements for developing resources, 
the Board has decided to focus on monetising the existing project 
pipeline.
Assuming agreeable terms can be negotiated, continue to develop the 
farm-out opportunity to establish a sustainable, low development 
cost, domestic gas revenue stream with potential growth 
opportunities in local energy demand.
We have a potentially world-class asset in Etinde where resources 
discovered to date will already support commercial development but 
which has the potential following appraisal drilling success to deliver 
even greater commercial opportunities. The impact for the business 
could be transformational and value accretive.
We have an unleveraged balance sheet, strong cash position and 
are carried for two appraisal drills. We should have sufficient financial 
flexibility to realise the benefits of the Etinde appraisal well discoveries.

OPERATING REVIEW
Progressing our  
Assets in Cameroon
A significant milestone will be the 
commencement of appraisal drilling in 2018, 
key to ensuring that Etinde’s full potential will 
be maximised.
The strategic review undertaken in March 2017 led the 
Board to decide that, unless there were compelling 
business reasons to the contrary, exploration and 
merger-acquisition activities would be suspended. The 
strategic review has led to a restructuring of Bowleven 
as a company and organisation, with major staff 
reductions in the UK head office and in our EurOil 
offices in Cameroon.
This effort has highlighted the task of creating value 
from the Etinde and Bomono assets and that this value 
should be underpinned by realistic, competitive 
development costs.
A key strategic tenet of Bowleven is to ensure that at all 
times the business complies with the Company’s Health, 
Security, Safety and Environmental (HSSE) Policy across 
its offices and sites. This extends to our contractors and 
to anyone visiting the offices or sites. Bowleven also 
seeks to influence its business partners and contractors 
in striving to achieve top-tier performance in delivering a 
safe, secure and compliant operation.
Group HSSE performance for the period ending August 
2017 has achieved the performance requirements set 
by the Board. There have been 750 lost time incident 
(LTI)-free days accrued in Cameroon since a low 
severity LTI was recorded in 2015. There has been no 
loss of containment or oil spills in excess of one barrel 
in the same period.
The Company is also focused on building capability and 
skills in the local community through the provision of 
employment. There have been no employee disputes, 
strikes, local community actions or unauthorised access 
which interrupted activities in Cameroon in the period 
of this review.
An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment has 
been independently conducted for the Bomono 
development and this involved stakeholder engagement 
and consultations. CAMEROON

Etinde JV (NewAge 37.5%; LUKOIL 37.5%;  
Bowleven 25%)
Within the Etinde JV, there has been significant 
behind-the-scenes activity and the JV Operator has 
managed to bring clarity to the development plans for 
the Etinde resources. The Cameroon authorities have 
agreed that the appraisal drilling programme for two 
wells is to proceed and that, provided 500 bcf of 
resource is set aside for future domestic gas 
opportunities, a commercially viable Floating LNG 
project will be supported if reserves are sufficient.
The 500 bcf resource would be utilised for domestic 
projects such as fertiliser and gas-to-power schemes. 
The fertiliser project remains the reference case for 
Bowleven’s Etinde valuation.
The Etinde JV is proceeding with plans to undertake the 
appraisal drilling in 2018 and seeking to prove up an 
additional 2.0 tcf of resource.
The appraisal drilling will be a significant step in the 
development of Etinde and a significant milestone for 
the JV and Cameroon. The outcome of the appraisal 
wells will be assessed to define the most cost-effective 
development plan and if successful, there will be 
sufficient Etinde resource to support Cameroon’s 
ambitions for their domestic market and also to support 
LNG exports.
This represents a positive move, considering that plans 
have been impacted by the low-price, low-investment 
environment in the industry which has, in turn, 
adversely impacted investment in Cameroon oil, gas 
and energy projects.
With agreement from 
the Cameroonian 
authorities that the 
appraisal drilling 
programme is to 
proceed, the Etinde 
JV plans to 
undertake the drilling 
in 2018 will ensure 
that Etinde’s potential 
can be determined.
The plan to commence appraisal drilling in 2018 
will ensure that Etinde’s potential can be determined 
and a full-cycle project valuation presented to the 
shareholders and the investment community.
The Board is assured that this project is supported 
by the Cameroon authorities and that any other 
opportunities which may arise to develop Etinde will be 
fully evaluated to enable the project to be chosen which 
would deliver the best value for all stakeholders.
Bomono Permit (Bowleven Group 100% and Operator)
Following extended well testing which was completed in 
2016, the Zingana and Moambe wells were suspended. 
Efforts have continued through the year to find 
an offtake solution. The Bomono Exploration 
Licence, which was extended to the end of 2015 
to allow the wells to be drilled and tested, was 
further extended by the Cameroon authorities 
until the end of 2016 and then by a further 
two-year period to 12 December 2018.
The Cameroon authorities have indicated that a PEA 
could be awarded within the governing framework 
of the Exploration Licence for a period of two years, 
in order to prove an initial commercial development 
phase. Once granted, the Provisional Exploitation 
Licence will allow Bomono gas to be sold to the 
domestic markets in Cameroon once wellstream gas 
processing facilities are installed and commissioned.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 09
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements
Further analysis of the data from the exploration wells has 
allowed the Bomono Prospect inventory exercise to 
progress. This exercise shows that there is 146 bcf of 
un-risked gas initially in place (GIIP) in the Bomono permit 
area. As of the end of October 2017, other than routine 
checks on the integrity of the wellheads, all activities in 
Bomono have ceased and the leased accommodation 
blocks used for drilling and operations workers have been 
returned to the lessor.
The Bomono block presents an opportunity for a 
sustainable supply of onshore gas to Cameroon’s 
domestic market and is consistent with Cameroon’s 
stated gas strategy. Our Bomono development plan 
is to produce hydrocarbons from the shallow Tertiary 
formation to existing gas pipeline infrastructure 
which directly accesses industrial users in the 
Douala area in conjunction with VOG, who would 
become licence Operator and main shareholder 
on completion of the farm-in arrangement.
Discussions are in progress to secure approval for a farm-
in arrangement which requires government Exploitation 
Authorisation approval and their support for the farm-in. 
Contingent Resources
Resource and Volume Estimates (2015)
No changes have been made to the contingent resource 
estimates since the Interim Results announcement in 
March 2015. That announcement removed the 
discovered resource estimates for Etinde blocks 
MLHP-5 and MLHP-6 following the licence expiry in 
December 2014, and adjusted the equity share of 
resources within the Etinde Permit to account for the 
farm-out to NewAge and LUKOIL. 
Notes: 
• For all block MLHP-7 discoveries, except the IM field, wet gas 
contingent resources are estimated based on a consideration of 
the range of recovery factors that may be typically anticipated 
from a gas field, for a range of development scenarios and 
resulting outcomes, ranging from reservoir depletion to gas 
recycling. Gas recovery factor ranges of 50–80% of GIIP can be 
considered typical for a gas field. Tabulated gas resource figures 
are based on an appropriate range of recovery factor estimates 
for the range of current conceptual development cases, allowing 
for gas shrinkage due to liquids drop-out.
• For the IM field, the range of contingent resources are reported 
based on a production model of the ‘Phase 1’ development as 
described in the Etinde Exploitation Authorisation Application. 
For the IM field, the contingent resources estimates are now 
reported as sales gas, primary and secondary condensate 
recovery and LPG recovery resources respectively. 
• For the purpose of calculating barrels of oil equivalent, 1 boe = 
6,000 scf gas.
• The contingent resource for Etinde will be updated following the 
appraisal drilling and subsequent development studies. 
• Other than as stated in these notes, this statement of the 
Group’s resources has been prepared using the classification 
system set out in the 2007 Petroleum Resources Management 
System published jointly by the Society of Petroleum Engineers 
(SPE), the World Petroleum Council (WPC), the American 
Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) and the Society of 
Petroleum Evaluation Engineers (SPEE). 
• In this report, and in previous reports post the farm-in 
agreement, Bowleven’s resource and volume reporting is based 
on a 20% equity interest in Etinde. This is because, under the 
Exploitation Authorisation, SNH were able to take up a 20% 
equity participating interest as a JV partner. In this case, 
Bowleven’s equity would be reduced from 25% to 20%.
• To date SNH have not signed the Participation Agreement to take 
up their 20% interest. Therefore, the Etinde JV is proceeding on 
the basis that the Etinde equity split is NewAge 37.5%; LUKOIL 
37.5%; and Bowleven 25%.
• No resources have been included for Bomono in this tabulation.
The net resource figures are summarised in the table below:

CEO FINANCIAL REVIEW
Financial Review
With the substantial ‘one-off’ costs now behind us, 
Bowleven can expect the ongoing cost to reduce significantly.
Results
The Group reported a loss of $53.7m 
(2016: a loss of $129.3m) for the 12 months 
ended 30 June 2017, with an impairment 
charge of $45.6m (2016: $122.3m) and 
no unsuccessful exploration costs (2016: 
$11.8m) arising from the review of the 
Group’s intangible exploration assets.
The upstream oil and gas sector continues to 
operate in a challenging macro environment of 
prolonged lower global oil prices. Whilst prices 
have recovered slightly during FY2016/17, 
they have remained low by recent standards. 
The Group’s assessment of key commodity 
price and planning assumptions, used in 
assessing and calculating any impairment 
charge on intangible exploration assets, 
performed in FY2015/16 has been validated 
during the current financial year. As set out in 
the CEO statement, on page 4 and 5, the 
carrying value of the Bomono intangible 
exploration asset has been impaired during the 
year by $45.6m (2016: $61.0m) following the 
agreed, but not yet completed sale to VOG.
The loss for the year includes administrative 
expenses for the Group of $11.7m (2016: 
$9.1m), which included one-off reorganisation 
and restructuring costs of $2.0m, of which 
$1.7m was Director and staff redundancy 
related. Going forward, we expect the ongoing 
cost to reduce significantly. 
Finance income includes $2.9m in foreign 
exchange gains arising primarily from the 
recognition of foreign exchange differences 
under International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) on US Dollar cash balances 
held (2016: exchange gain of $13.5m). 
Loss per share (basic and diluted) was $0.17 
(2016: loss per share $0.39).
Cash Flow
Group cash outflow from operating activities 
(cash operating loss, adjusted for non-cash 
charges and movements in current assets and 
liabilities) of $8.0m for the year against a 
cash outflow of $6.9m for the previous year. 
The 2017 cost includes the exceptional 
administration costs of $2.0m. 
Capital expenditure cash flows during the 
period were $6.0m (2016: $48.2m) and 
relate primarily to follow-up activities related 
to the FY2015/16 drilling and testing 
activities on the Bomono Permit.
Balance Sheet
The carrying value of oil and gas assets 
at 30 June 2017 was $172.7m (2016: 
$213.7m). There was an impairment 
charge of $45.6m relating to the Bomono 
intangible exploration (2016: $121.6m 
relating to Bomono and Etinde). There was 
no unsuccessful drilling activities in the 
current financial year. The year-on-year 
movement reflects capital expenditure on 
the Bomono, and to a small extent, Etinde 
licences, as well as the impairment charge.
As at 30 June 2017, Bowleven had cash and 
deposit balances of $85.8m (2016: $88.5m) 
and no debt. Under the terms of the Etinde 
farm-out transaction that completed in March 
2015, Bowleven received a further $15m in 
cash on 30 September 2016. 
The Group also has access to a $39.7m (net) 
drilling and testing carry which is expected to 
cover its share of two appraisal wells on 
Etinde. This deferred consideration (2016: 
$54.7m) is recognised as a current asset on 
the Group Balance Sheet at 30 June 2017. 
In addition, a further receivable of $25m is 
disclosed as a contingent asset and will be 
credited to intangible exploration assets once 
further clarity around Etinde project sanction/
FID is obtained.
The Group has no remaining work 
programme obligations, following completion 
of the two well exploration commitments on 
Bomono in September 2015.
The Group’s business is conducted 
primarily in US Dollars, with the majority 
of the Group’s cash held in that currency. 
Consequently, in practical terms the Group’s 
operations continue to be insulated from 
UK currency volatility in recent months. 
However, the functional currency of the 
UK Holding Company is GBP, which results 
in an annual currency revaluation of the 
Holding Company’s balance sheet into 
USD and a foreign exchange revaluation 
on translation of USD cash and bank 
deposits into GBP functional currency.
Shareholders’ funds are $301.4m as at 
30 June 2017 (2016: $362m). The year-
on-year reduction of $60.5m is primarily 
due to the impairment of the Bomono 
exploration asset ($45.6m), GBP to USD 
retranslation of the balance sheet ($3.2m), 
the retained loss for the year excluding 
impairment charge ($8.1m) and share based 
payments, associated with the operation of 
the Group’s employee share option, Director 
and executive management orientated 
long-term incentive plan (LTIP) and the 
purchase of treasury shares ($3.6m).

RISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
Risks and Internal Controls
Immediate identification, evaluation and mitigation of risks is 
crucial to keeping the level of risk associated to activities within 
the Bowleven Group to a minimum.
Risks
Bowleven’s business, financial standing and reputation 
may be impacted by various risks, not all of which are 
within its control. The Group identifies and regularly 
monitors the key risks and uncertainties considered to 
affect the Group and its operations, and runs its 
business in a way that, wherever possible, minimises the 
impact of such risks.
Of course, one major risk that is often overlooked is 
misalignment between the aims and ambitions of the 
Group’s management and those of its shareholders, 
which may result in a lack of support for the way in 
which the business is being developed. This situation 
occurred during early 2017 following a period of high 
expenditure and lacklustre performance and ultimately 
led to major changes at Board level, restructuring of the 
Company and adoption of a new strategy to create 
shareholder value. In the future, this risk will be 
mitigated by better communication with shareholders 
and developing closer relationships. 
Bowleven’s Board is responsible for regularly reviewing 
and updating the Group risk register and matrix and 
considering the key risks facing the business. The 
Group risk register and matrix are also regularly 
reviewed by the Board.
The risk management framework and processes 
adopted by the Board involve the identification, 
assessment, mitigation, monitoring and reporting of all 
key Group risks on a regular basis.
An element of risk is inherent to the activities of oil and gas 
exploration and development. It is the Board’s objective to 
be aware of these risks and evaluate and mitigate them 
wherever possible. The Board believes that the principal 
risk categories for the business are: corporate/strategic; 
JV misalignment; operational (exploration, development 
and operating); financial; political/regulatory; HSSE and 
management/organisational. These risks are common and 
must be managed whether an asset is operated or 
non-operated.
The principal risk areas for the business and the respective mitigating actions are listed below:
Risk Mitigation
Misalignment of objectives and strategy 
between management and 
shareholders.
Communicate more effectively with shareholders and establish closer relationships to ensure 
shareholder support for the way in which the business is being developed.
Misalignment between JV partners 
who may have different priorities and 
objectives.
The Group is actively engaged with its JV partners in building and maintaining effective 
and transparent working relationships as a means of understanding their positions and influencing 
decision-making for the benefit of the JV as a whole.
Exploration and appraisal activities are 
inherently uncertain in their cost and 
outcome.
The Group has completed a major restructuring of the business and has changed strategy to de-
emphasise exploration in the short term. Appraisal drilling at Etinde will be funded by JV partners. 
The Group has retained access to technical support through ad hoc contracts with previous 
employees. 
Additionally, the Group has access to specialists who have gained knowledge and experience in the 
Company’s technical challenges.
Additionally, the JV partners in Etinde work closely to ensure that technical and operational risks are 
identified in sub-surface and facilities engineering and this provides a means by which exploration, 
appraisal and project execution risks may be mitigated.
Reliance on JV Operator for asset 
performance.
The Group also continues to actively participate in technical workshops and meetings to challenge, 
apply influence and/or support partners to develop sound concepts and successful work programmes. Bowleven plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 13
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements
Risk Mitigation
The Group’s JV partners may fail to 
fund their share of joint operations.
Risk of default is mitigated by provisions in the Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) model used in the 
business. The JOA allows the non-defaulting JV partners to acquire the defaulting partner’s equity 
share in the asset concerned.
The Group’s ability to access capital to 
meet its commitments and implement 
its development plans.
The Group has no debt and no outstanding work commitments and is sufficiently funded to support its 
interests in Etinde and Bomono for the foreseeable future. The two well Etinde appraisal drilling programme 
is funded through a carry of up to $40m as agreed with the JV partners in the Etinde farm-in transaction. 
If the appraisal wells are not drilled by the end of 2020, the $40m is to be paid in cash.
The Group will receive an additional $25m cash when the FID is made for Etinde. 
Depending on the choice of development scheme, the Group may have to raise additional finance at some 
point in the future. Contacts with banks, existing shareholders and potential investors are being maintained 
to facilitate this should it prove necessary. 
Capital discipline is rigorously deployed to maximise value and reviewed at every Board meeting.
The existence of a market for gas in 
Cameroon is key to the successful 
commercial development of the Etinde 
and Bomono Permits.
Société Nationale des Hydrocarbures (SNH) have indicated that they will support the Etinde appraisal 
drilling programme and an economically viable FLNG project provided that the JV assigns 500 bcf of 
resource to Cameroon domestic offtakes. 
SNH remain interested in developing a proposed fertiliser plant and gas to power schemes.
The Group continues to discuss access to the industrial gas customer base and pipeline infrastructure 
of Gaz Du Cameroun S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of VOG. This would enable the development of 
the resource in Bomono.
Regulatory uncertainty and delays or 
refusal in granting approvals may 
severely inhibit project development 
in the Group’s operated and non-
operated assets and in a worst case 
scenario, lead to the loss of title assets. 
The Group uses its influence in the JV Management Committee(s) to support the JV Operator in 
ensuring that there are open communication channels with Cameroon Government agencies. Also, 
the Group ensures that it is represented at the in-country meetings to discuss JV business with SNH 
and Government officials.
The areas in which the Group operates 
are perceived to have serious bribery 
and corruption problems and issues.
The Group has a zero tolerance attitude towards bribery and corruption.
The Group has an Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy, consistent with the Group’s obligations arising 
under the UK Bribery Act 2010, and has established procedures for monitoring compliance, including 
regular training for all Group staff. The Group includes anti-bribery and corruption compliance 
provisions in all contracts entered into with third parties.
As part of the regular training, staff are also reminded of the Group’s Whistleblowing Policy and 
encouraged to confidentially raise any concerns that they may have about dangerous, illegal activity 
or any wrongdoing within the organisation.
The nature of the Group’s operations 
exposes it to a wide range of HSSE 
risks, including cybercrime risk.
The Group regularly reviews its HSSE policies and procedures within the context of its operational 
profile to ensure that effective HSSE effective measures are in place to ensure compliance with the 
Company HSSE Policy and industry standards. Currently, the Group does not undertake oilfield 
operations and, therefore, has a low staffing level. The Company is aware of EU and UK legislation 
with regard to the growing threat from cybercrime. Having completed a major restructuring, the 
Company is establishing new IT systems and implementing measures to ensure that the Group systems 
are secure and able to adequately protect its intellectual property.
The Group operates in challenging 
market conditions with lower 
commodity prices than previously 
experienced that could adversely affect 
the carrying value of assets. There 
remains uncertainty on how long these 
market conditions will continue and, of 
course, this will impact on investment 
decisions we will make for Etinde.
The Group monitors its macro-economic environment, maintains a disciplined approach to capital 
allocation and costs, and evaluates its business strategies appropriately.
The Group works closely with its JV partners and maintains awareness of industry trends and costs to 
understand how the Group’s assets might be valued. Bowleven plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 14
RISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROLS continued
Risk Mitigation
The assumptions used to estimate 
hydrocarbon resources may prove 
incorrect and this may lead to 
sub-optimum development options 
being made.
The Group utilises its experience and that of the JV partners to determine and correlate the resource 
and development assumptions to ensure that its management and Board maintain a realistic view of 
resources. The Etinde JV will require an independent consultant’s report to verify the results of the 
appraisal drilling and before a FID is made.
Implementation of Company 
restructuring plans.
The potential for losing staff and 
management presents major risk which 
would mean that the Company is 
unable to function properly and meet 
its management and reporting 
obligations to shareholders and as a 
listed Company.
The Group has retained some key technical expertise on ad hoc contracts to be called upon to deliver 
specialist support at JV meetings.
The Group has access to a number of consultants, audit and legal firms who have knowledge of the 
business and also support the formal reporting protocol. Additionally, the Group has retained 
technical expertise in geology, sub-surface engineering and analysis and facilities engineering.
The above risks are considered by the Directors 
to be typical for an oil and gas group of 
Bowleven’s size and stage of development.
Internal Controls
The Board acknowledges that it is responsible 
for establishing and maintaining the Group’s 
system of internal controls and reviewing its 
effectiveness. Group procedures are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. The internal control system 
can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has considered the need for a dedicated 
internal audit function but does not consider it 
necessary at the current time. The Board does, 
however, approve an internal audit programme 
annually under which various specific reviews of 
business activities are carried out. Responsibilities 
for organising these reviews, including utilising 
external consultants as appropriate and reporting 
back, are assigned within the organisation.
Approval of Strategic Report

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Delivering Value for 
All Shareholders
2017 has been a transformative year for Bowleven,  
both in terms of its Board and its operating model.
Responding to Shareholders
Crown Ocean Capital P1 Limited (‘Crown Ocean’), 
then and now a major shareholder of the Company, 
approached Eli Chahin and myself around the turn of 
the year. They shared their analysis of the Group’s 
historic strategy, which had pursued expensive and 
unsuccessful exploration activities that resulted in 
significant value destruction to shareholders. They 
asked us if we would be prepared to be nominated as 
directors of Bowleven and we each agreed to stand for 
election as independent Directors.
Board Changes
A General Meeting was requisitioned and, as 
shareholders now know, on 14 March 2017, Eli Chahin 
and I were elected Directors and the then Chief 
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and three of 
the Non-Executive Directors were removed from office. 
David Clarkson, the Chief Operating Officer, was not 
the subject of a requisition to remove him and remained 
in post as COO.
On 31 March, it was announced that Billy Allan had 
resigned from the Board and Eli Chahin was appointed 
as Chief Executive Officer. Joe Darby joined the 
Board, as Non-Executive Director, bringing extensive 
oil and gas experience, and I became Chairman. 
With David Clarkson, we were a newly constituted 
Board, determined to refocus the Company’s 
strategy on maximising value from our existing 
Bowleven is now 
better aligned to 
delivering long-term 
value for all 
shareholders and the 
operating model and 
balance sheet 
strength will ensure 
that can happen.
assets and reducing corporate expenses. Subsequent 
discussions which we conducted with our institutional 
shareholders, confirmed that this strategy enjoys 
strong support throughout our shareholder base.
New Leadership
Six months have passed in which we have swiftly put 
this strategy into action. I would like to pay tribute to 
Eli Chahin for his bold and efficient leadership and to 
David Clarkson for his tireless efforts in support, which 
have allowed the Bowleven Group to achieve such a 
material transformation in such a short period of time.
The Company’s overhead base has been substantially 
reduced with new exploration activity costs virtually 
eliminated. We have relocated our head office from a 
large prestigious Edinburgh building to a small 
operation near London Bridge. This has resulted in a 
reduction in full time employees from 40 to fewer than 
ten, a workforce which has proven to be sufficient and 
effective for the Company’s activities. These were 
challenging steps for the individuals affected, and the 
Board would like to thank both current and former 
employees for their co-operation and patience during a 
difficult period. The Board is now able to look forward 
to executing its strategy from a sustainable footing. That 
is to maximise the value of both our 25% Etinde 
offshore interest and our interest in Bomono, utilising 
the prospective arrangement with VOG, and dealing 
with any future demands for funding of these 
investments through careful deployment of the 
Company’s $86m cash balance.
Delivering Value
With Crown Ocean’s representative, Matt McDonald, 
having recently joined the Board, we are completely 
aligned on our ambition to deliver value for all 
shareholders. We are looking forward to the new 
operating model for the Group and the value of 
our Etinde and Bomono assets being recognised 
in the Bowleven share price, as progress towards 
monetisation of these fields materialises during 2018.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Corporate Governance
Bowleven’s Directors are committed to meeting high standards 
of corporate governance. 
The Directors are committed to meeting high standards of corporate 
governance. As an AIM listed company, Bowleven is not required to 
comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code). However, 
the Directors are aware of the main principles of the Code and seek to 
comply with the principles as far as practicable, having regard to the 
size and resources of the Company.
Board Structure
The Board currently comprises two Executive Directors and three 
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman. At the General 
Meeting held on 14 March 2017, shareholders voted for the removal 
of Kevin Hart, Kerry Crawford, Philip Tracy, Tim Sullivan and John 
Martin as Directors with immediate effect. In addition, shareholders 
voted in favour of the appointment of Chris Ashworth and Eli Chahin 
as Directors with immediate effect. On 30 March 2017, Billy Allan 
resigned from the Board, having served as Non-Executive Chairman 
since 16 December 2015 and as a Non-Executive Director since 
7 October 2015. Chris Ashworth succeeded Billy Allan to the role 
of Non-Executive Chairman on 30 March 2017. Joe Darby and Matt 
McDonald were appointed to the Board as Non-Executive Directors 
on 3 April 2017 and 17 August 2017 respectively. Ed Willett resigned 
from the Board in December 2016.
Biographies of the current Directors are set out on pages 16 and 17. 
These demonstrate a wide range of experience and high calibre 
considered sufficient to bring independent judgement on the issues 
considered by the Board.
Matters Reserved for the Board
The Board has a schedule of matters reserved for its decisions. In 
addition to those matters required by the Companies Act 2006, the 
Board also considers business strategy and policy, approval of major 
capital investment plans, risk management policy, significant financing 
matters, senior personnel appointments and statutory shareholder 
reporting. 
Board Meetings
The Chairman conducts Board and shareholder meetings and ensures 
that all Directors are properly briefed. The Board intends to meet at 
least five times each year.
Company Secretary
All Directors have access to the Company Secretary for advice and 
services. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary 
is a decision for the Board as a whole. Directors also have access to 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense and receive 
appropriate training where necessary.
Burness Paull LLP was appointed Company Secretary to the Board on 
19 July 2017.
Re-election of Directors
There are transparent procedures in place for the appointment of new 
Directors to the Board. In accordance with the Company’s Articles of 
Association, all Directors are required to retire by rotation every three 
years, when they can offer themselves for re-election, if eligible. There 
are no Directors to whom this is applicable in 2017. In addition, the 
Company’s Articles of Association provide that any Director appointed 
by the Directors shall retire at the AGM of the Company immediately 
following their appointment and be eligible for re-election. Joe Darby 
and Matt McDonald, appointed on 3 April 2017 and 17 August 2017 
respectively, will therefore retire and offer themselves for re-election 
by shareholders at the AGM on 13 December 2017. 
Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees
Prior to the General Meeting held on 14 March 2017, the Company 
had established Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees, 
each having formal Terms of Reference in place and comprised as set 
out below. Bowleven plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 19
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprised John Martin (Chairman), Billy Allan, 
Tim Sullivan and Philip Tracy. The auditor was invited to attend part of 
the Audit Committee meetings and, if required, at the request of the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee, Executive Directors and senior 
members of management attended meetings by invitation. 
The Committee met at least twice a year and was responsible for 
ensuring that the financial performance of the Group was properly 
reported on and monitored. This included the monitoring of the 
integrity of financial statements and the Company’s internal financial 
controls and risk management systems. The Committee liaised with 
the auditor and reviewed the reports from the auditor relating to the 
accounts and control processes. 
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprised Billy Allan (Chairman), 
John Martin, Tim Sullivan and Philip Tracy. The Committee reviewed 
and recommended the appointment of new Directors to the Board. 
If required, at the request of the Chairman of the Nomination 
Committee, the Chief Executive attended meetings by invitation. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprised Tim Sullivan (Chairman), 
Billy Allan, John Martin and Philip Tracy. The Committee was 
responsible for developing policy on remuneration for the Executive 
Directors and senior management, reviewing their performance and 
setting the scale and structure of their remuneration on the basis 
of their service agreements, with due regard to the interests of 
shareholders and the performance of the Group. If required, at 
the request of the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, the 
Chief Executive attended meetings by invitation. 
Upholding Governance Through the T ransformation Process
The Board recognises the need for good corporate governance and is therefore committed to maintaining the roles of each of the 
Committees. Without compromising the importance of compliance and commitment to high standards of corporate governance, the 
Board has taken on the responsibilities of each of the previous Committees. 
The role of the Audit Committee has been returned to the entire Board to ensure the overseeing of the presentation of the results in the 
financial statements; external audit; internal audit and other areas as set out in the Code.
 
The role of the Nomination Committee has also been returned to the entire Board and the members of the Board have taken on the 
responsibilities accordingly. 
Changes have also been made to the Remuneration Committee. In April 2017, a Remuneration Committee was reconstituted with formal 
Terms of Reference which are available from the Company on request. The Remuneration Committee is currently comprised 
of Chris Ashworth (Chair), Joe Darby and Matt McDonald. 
Further consideration will be given by the Board to the requirement for an Audit Committee and a Nomination Committee. The 
Remuneration Committee is discussed further in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 23 to 27.  Bowleven plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 20
The Directors of Bowleven plc (a company incorporated in Scotland with registered number SC225242) submit the Annual Report and Accounts

the Strategic Review, describe the activities of the Group during the financial year and its future developments.
The Group operates through overseas branches and subsidiary undertakings as appropriate to the fiscal environment.
Results and Dividends
The trading results for the year, and the Group’s financial position at the end of the year, are shown in the attached financial statements.

Relations with Shareholders
Communications with shareholders are given high priority by the management. The Company communicates with shareholders and potential 
investors through a variety of channels. The Annual Report and the Interim Report provide a comprehensive update of the Group’s activities and 
are made available to all shareholders. In addition, market announcements, including Group operational updates, are also released, as and when 
appropriate, to update shareholders on activities. The Company’s website is also used to enable access to a variety of information on the 
Company (www.bowleven.com). The Chief Executive maintains regular dialogue with shareholders and potential shareholders by way of formal 
roadshows and presentations, and analyst meetings. An analyst update and investor roadshow are often held after the Group’s announcement of 
year end results and interim results. In addition to these investor roadshows, the Company also attends various conferences and investor events. 
These tend to comprise a mix of presentations and one-to-one or group meetings which are held at various times during the year. As well as 
meetings with investors in the UK, the Company’s investor relations programme includes conferences and investor meetings overseas, extending 
to Africa, North America and Europe and other regions as appropriate. Presentations prepared for investor meetings and conferences are made 
available on the Company’s website. At the AGM a business presentation is normally provided for the benefit of shareholders. The AGM also 
provides an opportunity for private shareholders and institutional investors to meet and to speak to members of the Board.
An investor plan is prepared and presented to the Board annually and is reviewed on an ongoing basis. The Board receives regular investor 
relations reports covering key investor meetings and activities as well as analyst, shareholder and investor feedback and market updates. 
The Company maintains a database of all meetings held by the Directors with shareholders and analysts. All analysts’ reports received on the 
Company are reviewed and monitored and copies are distributed to Directors. Support is provided, where appropriate, to analysts covering and 
initiating coverage on the Company. The Company consults with its corporate brokers and NOMAD on investor/market matters and also utilises 
Brunswick LLP for ongoing public relations support.
The Group continually seeks to develop and improve its investor relations activities. Enquiries from all shareholders are welcomed by the 
Company. Shareholders and other interested parties can also register on the Group’s website to receive news updates by email.

Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies
The financial risk management objectives and policies of the Company are detailed in note 22 to the financial statements on pages 62-65.
Employee Involvement
Using regular briefing procedures and meetings, the Board keeps employees at all levels informed about matters affecting the policy, progress 
and people in the business in which they work.
Disabled Employees
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered bearing in mind the respective qualifications and abilities of the 
applicants concerned. In the event of employees becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure their employment continues. The training, 
career development and promotion of a person with a disability is, as far as possible, identical to that of a person without a disability. Bowleven plc

Acquisition of Own Shares
The Company initiated a share buyback programme on 19 August 2016 for a maximum consideration of up to $10m, the purpose being to reduce 
the outstanding issued share capital of the Company. The Board, as constituted at that time, considered that the share buyback programme 
would be in the shareholders’ interests, being accretive to net asset value per share whilst retaining sufficient financial flexibility to evaluate growth 
options. The Company entered into an agreement with its broker at the time, Macquarie Capital (Europe) Limited to repurchase shares on its 
behalf, such shares being held by the Company in treasury. The share buyback programme was executed in accordance with the general 
authority held by the Company at that time to make market purchases which had been approved by shareholders at the AGM on 16 December 
2015 and the Company retained discretion in respect of the volume, timing and price of shares to be repurchased. The resolution sought at the 
AGM on 14 December 2016 to authorise the Company to make market purchases of its own shares was not passed and, consequently, the share 
buyback programme ceased. Under the programme, the Company repurchased 7,807,281 shares into treasury, having a nominal value of 
£780,728. The aggregate amount of consideration paid by the Company for those shares was £2.7m.
Auditor and Disclosure of Information to the Auditor
So far as each person who was a Director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information (being information 
needed by the auditor in connection with preparing its report) of which the auditor is unaware. Each Director has taken all the steps that they 
ought to have taken as a Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor is aware 
of that information.
Ernst & Young LLP has indicated its willingness to continue in office. Resolutions proposing its reappointment and authorising the Directors to fix 
its remuneration will be submitted at the AGM on 13 December 2017.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 23
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements
The Group is not required to disclose all of the following information but has chosen to do so in the interests of greater transparency for the 
benefit of shareholders.
Remuneration Committee
Prior to the General Meeting held on 14 March 2017, the Company’s Remuneration Committee comprised of Tim Sullivan (Chairman), Billy 
Allan, John Martin and Philip Tracy. Following the General Meeting, in April 2017, the Remuneration Committee was reconstituted and now 
comprises Chris Ashworth (Chairman), Joe Darby and Matt McDonald.
The Committee meets at least four times a year (more often if required) to consider, amongst other things, progress made against the corporate 
key performance indicators which were set by the Board on an annual basis.
The Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for the Executive Directors and senior management, reviewing their 
performance and setting the scale and structure of their remuneration on the basis of their service agreements, with due regard to the interests 
of shareholders and the performance of the Group. The Remuneration Committee also makes recommendations to the Board concerning 
employee incentives, including the allocation of awards under the Bowleven LTIP and the Bowleven transformation incentive plan (BTIP) to 
Executive Directors and senior management and the grant of share options to employees. Independent advisers are engaged to advise the 
Committee as required.
The Chief Executive Officer may attend meetings of the Committee at the invitation of the Chairman. Neither the CEO nor any of the other 
Directors participate in discussions or decisions of the Committee concerning their own remuneration.
Remuneration Policy
The Remuneration Committee aimed to provide overall packages of terms and conditions that were competitive in the market to attract, retain 
and motivate high quality individuals capable of achieving the Group’s objectives. The Committee believes that such packages should contain 
significant performance-related elements and that these elements should be designed to align the interests of the Executive Directors with 
shareholders.
The main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors and senior management are:
 — basic salary;
 — benefits in kind;
 — performance-related bonus; and
 — BTIP, LTIP and Share Option awards.
The overall package is generally weighted more towards variable pay, with a suitable weighting towards long-term performance through the award 
of long-term incentives.
The Remuneration Committee applied its Remuneration Policy during the year having regard to the following factors:
 — The competitive recruitment market in the oil and gas sector;
 — A desire to closely align executive remuneration with shareholders’ interests; and
 — Economic conditions affecting the Group and its proposed operations.
Components of Executive Directors’ Remuneration
Basic Salary and Benefits
The Remuneration Committee reviewed annually the existing remuneration of the Executive Directors, making comparisons with peer companies 
of a similar size and complexity in the independent oil and gas exploration and production industry in the UK and overseas.
Performance Bonus Scheme
The Company operated a discretionary performance-related bonus scheme for all staff, including the Executive Directors and senior 
management.
The performance-related bonus is capped at a maximum percentage of annual salary applicable to each employee. In the case of the Chief 
Executive, this is a maximum of 100% of annual salary and in the case of all of the other Executive Directors, a maximum of 75%. Subject to the 
overriding discretion of the Remuneration Committee, 20% of each Executive Director’s bonus opportunity is based on achievement of personal 
objectives set by the Chief Executive or, in the case of the Chief Executive, by the Chairman, with the remaining 80% being calculated with 
reference to the Group’s performance against the corporate key performance indicators for that year that are set by the Board on the 
recommendation of the Remuneration Committee. No bonus is payable in any year unless the weighted performance against the annual 
corporate key performance indicators exceeds 50%.
Performance against the corporate key performance indicators and the determination of the consequential level of performance-related bonus 
payable, if any, is calculated on a calendar year basis by the Remuneration Committee. Any bonus arising is usually paid in January of the 
following year. Whether any bonus is payable and the level of it, remains subject to the overriding discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Although a number of key objectives were met during the calendar year ending 31 December 2016, the Remuneration Committee, with the 
support of the Executive Directors, exercised its discretion and resolved that no bonus be paid to staff, including the Executive Directors and 
senior management in respect of that calendar year.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT Bowleven plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 24
Long Term Incentive Plans
The LTIPs (the 2006 LTIP and the 2015 LTIP) are designed to reward the Executive Directors and senior Managers in line with the future 
performance of the Company. Benefits will only be delivered if performance conditions are met.
The LTIPs entitle the holder to receive a specific number of shares in the Company for no consideration, with the release of those shares being 
dependent upon the achievement of certain performance conditions that are set by the Remuneration Committee at grant and then measured 
over a three-year period. The performance criteria are discussed in detail later in this report, but relate to the Company’s total shareholder 
return (TSR) performance against a group of comparable companies.
In addition, prior to any award vesting under either LTIP, the Remuneration Committee is required to be satisfied that, amongst other things, 
there has been an overall satisfactory and sustained improvement in the performance of the Company over the performance period.
Awards made under the LTIPs may not exceed 200% of base salary in any year, or 400% of base salary in any consecutive three-year period. 
The Remuneration Committee recommends the level of award to the Board. Individual awards in any particular year are influenced by, inter alia, 
individual performance against personal objectives, Group performance relative to the corporate key performance indicators and the wider 
market environment. The Remuneration Committee retains an element of discretion in relation to the level of awards granted.
Bowleven Transformation Incentive Plan
The BTIP was adopted by the Board of the Company on 9 May 2017. The purpose of the BTIP is to align employees with the Company’s 
long-term goals and performance through the potential for share ownership. Awards under the BTIP are granted at the sole discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee.
As announced on 12 May 2017, Eli Chahin, the Chief Executive Officer, was granted a right to acquire up to 10,000,000 ordinary shares in 
the Company at a nil cost under the BTIP. The Option shall be exercisable subject to and in accordance with the rules of the BTIP, including 
the extent to which certain performance conditions are satisfied over the performance period commencing on the date of grant and ending on 
31 March 2022. The Option’s performance conditions relate to the attainment of certain share price points between £0.45 and £0.80 per share 
for a continuous period of at least three months and meeting the annual cost underpin criteria, whereby the annual cash costs incurred must be 
below the amount set out in the cash expenses target set by the Board. Malus and clawback provisions apply. Options under the BTIP which vest 
may be exercised within ten years from the date of grant.
Directors’ Contracts
It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors should have service contracts with a notice period of 12 months. Details of notice periods for 
the Executive and Non-Executive Directors who were in office as at 30 June 2017 and subsequently appointed are summarised below:

Executive Directors are required to obtain consent from the Chairman prior to accepting any non-executive positions.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors have written terms of engagement setting out their roles and responsibilities. Fees for the Non-Executive Directors 
are determined by the Board. The annual fee for Billy Allan as Chairman was $102,000 (£80,000), reduced by agreement to $91,400 (£72,000) 
with effect from 1 January 2017. The annual fee for the Chairman has been reduced further in respect of Chris Ashworth to $88,900 (£70,000). 
The Non-Executive Directors prior to the General Meeting on 14 March 2017 had an annual fee of $50,800 (£40,000), with John Martin 
receiving an additional fee of $6,350 (£5,000) per annum as Chairman of the Audit Committee. Joe Darby and Matt McDonald receive an 
annual fee of $76,000 (£60,000) and $57,150 (£45,000) respectively. It is also possible for the Non-Executive Directors to earn fees through 
consultancy work as part of their usual professional activities or in respect of additional work provided above their agreed time commitment. 
Directors’ remuneration is paid in GB Pounds and converted at $1.27/£1.00 (2016: $1.49/£1.00).
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in the share option scheme, the LTIPs or BTIP and are not entitled to a cash bonus or pension 
contributions.

Further Notes to Directors’ Remuneration Table
Benefits in kind principally comprised of medical and travel insurance. The Company operates a non-contributory defined contribution 
personal pension scheme in the UK, open to both Executive Directors and permanent employees. The Company contributes 10% of basic salary 
of Executive Directors into the scheme or an individual personal pension plan. If statutory limits are applicable, an equivalent salary alternative 
is provided.
Payments Made to Executive Directors in Connection with Loss of Office During the Year
During the year, a number of Executive Directors left the Company. In particular:
 — Ed Willett ceased employment on 31 December 2016; and
 — following the results of the 14 March 2017 General Meeting, the employment of Kevin Hart and Kerry Crawford came to an end on 
31 March 2017.
In each of the above cases, a payment was made to the individual in lieu of sums due in respect of their contractual notice period of one year. 
These amounts are included in the ‘Compensation for loss of office’ column of the above table.
In regards to the participation of these individuals in the LTIPs, it was agreed that:
 — Ed Willett’s outstanding awards would continue to subsist and would vest in accordance with their terms (which included performance 
condition satisfaction); and
 — each of the awards held by Kevin Hart and Kerry Crawford would lapse immediately in full on cessation of their employment, with the 
exception of the awards under the December 2013 LTIP.
The December 2013 LTIP awards, vesting following the full satisfaction of the applicable performance conditions over the original three-year 
measurement period to 4 December 2016. The Remuneration Committee and the Directors agreed that vesting should be made subject to a 
further condition. The new condition stated that the Remuneration Committee would need to be satisfied that an overall ‘satisfactory and 
sustained improvement’ in the share performance of the Company would need to be achieved, over an additional period, which would ordinarily 
end on 4 June 2017. For Kevin Hart and Kerry Crawford, this additional six-month period was cut short on 14 March 2017 following their 
removal from the Board. The December 2013 LTIPs awards were subsequently awarded to both Directors as part of their employee severance 
arrangements, in accordance with the original vesting criteria from the December 2016 Remuneration Committee meeting decision.
Details of the above vestings and lapses are included in the remaining sections of this Report. Bowleven plc

Eland Oil & Gas PLC Rockhopper Exploration plc Wentworth Resources Limited
Gulfsands Petroleum Plc Savannah Petroleum PLC Xcite Energy Limited
Ithaca Energy Inc. Sterling Energy Plc
The Company’s closing share price on 30 June 2017 was 25.5 pence (2016: 21.25 pence) and the highest and lowest prices during the year were 
36.5 pence and 20.87 pence respectively.
Vesting of Awards
The vesting of an award granted under the LTIPs is dependent upon the achievement of performance conditions determined by the Remuneration 
Committee at the relevant grant date. The three-year performance period commences on the date of grant of an award and ends on the third 
anniversary of the date of grant (save where it expires earlier in accordance with the rules of the applicable plan).
The performance conditions which are applicable to awards under the LTIPs are as follows:
 — Awards will vest if the Company’s TSR ranks median or above when compared with the TSR of a pre-defined comparator group over the 
relevant three-year performance period.
 — The percentage of allocated shares that are transferred to a participant is determined by Bowleven’s position in the TSR ranking list as set out 
below:
TSR ranking of Bowleven compared with comparator group % shares transferred
Upper quartile and above 100
Between median and upper quartile Pro-rata on a straight line basis
Median 20
Below median nil
The rules of the LTIPs also contain the proviso that no award will vest unless the Remuneration Committee, in its absolute discretion, is satisfied 
that there has been an overall satisfactory and sustained improvement in the performance of the Company during the performance period.
Vesting of Awards on Loss of Office
E Willet resigned as a Director on 31 December 2016. On 6 March 2017, the Remuneration Committee concluded that the relevant TSR 
performance criteria in respect of the 2014 and 2016 LTIP awards up to the date of resignation when the share price was 33.5 pence had been 
satisfied in full, but the awards were time prorated. Accordingly, part of the 2014 and 2016 awards lapsed. In respect of the 2013 award, the 
additional six-month period referred to above was curtailed and as part of the Settlement Agreement with Mr Willet, the 2013 award was granted 
in full.

Vesting of June 2013 and December 2013 LTIP Awards
As announced on 21 December 2016, following the expiry of the three-year performance period applicable to the 2013 grant of awards under 
Bowleven’s 2006 LTIP (the 2013 LTIP Awards) on 4 December 2016, Bowleven’s TSR was ranked in the upper quartile when compared with the 
TSR achieved over such performance period by a comparator group of companies.
In light of this situation, 100% of the 2013 LTIP Awards would ordinarily have vested. However, the participants and the Remuneration 
Committee agreed that vesting should be deferred in accordance with the 2006 LTIP scheme rules and that it was appropriate for vesting to be 
made subject to a further condition. The new condition stated that the Remuneration Committee would need to be satisfied that an overall 
‘satisfactory and sustained improvement’ in the share price performance of the Company would need to be achieved, over an additional period, 
which would ordinarily end on 4 June 2017.
Vesting of 2013 award held by D Clarkson
Mr D Clarkson was a Director of the company when the six-month additional time period for the 2013 award expired on 4 June 2017. 
The Remuneration Committee decided on the 19 June that the 2013 award should be granted in full. 
Details of the December 2013 LTIP award that vested on 19 June 2017 when the closing share price was 28.5 pence is given in the table below:

of 50 pence per share (which was higher than required (37.50 pence per share) under the terms of the 2006 LTIP).
Dilution – Compliance with Investment Association Principles of Remuneration
The Company complies with the dilution guidelines issued by the Investment Association (published July 2016). The number of ordinary shares 
which may be issued in respect of all of the Company’s employee share schemes (whether discretionary or otherwise) may not exceed 10% of the 
issued ordinary share capital (adjusted for share issuance and cancellation) in any rolling ten-year period. In addition, commitments to issue new 
shares under the Company’s LTIPs may not exceed 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company (adjusted for share issuance and 
cancellation) in any rolling ten-year period.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 28
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with applicable 
UK law and regulations.
UK company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The AIM Rules require the Directors to prepare 
the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU. The Directors have 
prepared the Group and the Company financial statements on the same basis.
UK company law provides that the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these Group and 
Company financial statements the Directors are required to:
 — select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’ and then apply 
them consistently;
 — present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that is relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable;
 — provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact 
of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s and the Company’s financial position and financial performance of the 
Group and of the Company;
 — state that the Group and the Company have complied with IFRS, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements;
 — make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
 — prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and of the Company and enable them to 
ensure that the Group’s and the Company’s financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.

Opinion
In our opinion:
 — Bowleven plc’s Group financial statements and Parent Company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’) give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 30 June 2017 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
 — the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union; 
 — the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act; and
 — the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
We have audited the financial statements of Bowleven plc which comprise:

Related notes 1 to 24 to the financial statements, including a summary 
of significant accounting policies
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRS as adopted by the European Union and, 
as regards to the Parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
Basis for Opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report below. We 
are independent of the Group and Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions Relating to Going Concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
 — the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
 — the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the 
group’s or the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least 12 months from the 
date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Overview of our Audit Approach
Key audit matters — Impairment of the carrying value of intangible assets
 — Impairment of the carrying value of investments
Audit scope — We performed an audit of the complete financial information of two components and audit procedures on 
a review scope basis for three components

Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the 
current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These 
matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the 
efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated  
to the Audit Committee 
Impairment of the carrying 
value of intangible assets (2017: 
$173m, 2016: $214m)
Refer to Accounting Policies (page 41); 
and note 9 of the consolidated 
financial statements (page 50)
The risk relates to the assessment of the 
carrying value of exploration assets not being 
performed appropriately, including write-
offs not booked, assets not transferred to 
development, and/or receipt of exploitation 
authorisation or exploration licence 
extensions not occurring in a timely manner.
Exploration and evaluation assets shall be 
assessed for impairment when facts and 
circumstances suggest that the carrying 
amount of an exploration and evaluation asset 
may exceed its recoverable amount. The 
facts and circumstances to be considered in 
this assessment include, but are not limited 
to, the potential for licences to expire or 
not be renewed in the near future, further 
exploration and evaluation activity not 
being planned or budgeted or the value 
not likely to be recovered by a sale.
The continued low oil price environment, 
together with ongoing licence and 
development plans for both assets 
(Bomono and Etinde), means that 
this risk, as in prior years, continues 
to be a main focus of the audit.
Following an impairment charge taken on 
both assets in prior year, consideration 
of indicators for the current year was 
undertaken with indicators of impairment 
identified on the Bomono asset. There 
were no indicators of impairment or 
impairment reversals on the Etinde asset.
In assessing the appropriateness of 
management’s oil price assumptions, we 
have compared their price assumptions 
with the latest market evidence available, 
including forward curves, brokers’ estimates 
and other long-term price forecasts.
We carried out procedures to understand 
and walk through Bowleven plc’s 
process for identifying impairment 
triggers, reversal triggers and considered 
management’s assessment of indicators. 
We audited management’s assessment of 
impairment indicators and whether or not 
a formal impairment test was required.
Where a formal impairment test was 
necessary, we audited management’s 
assumptions and sensitivities. This included 
specifically determination of the facts 
and circumstances, understanding of the 
commercial terms of the proposed Bomono 
farm-out transaction (including cash flows, 
gas prices, production profiles, capital and 
operating expenditure and discount rates) and 
evaluating alternative development options.
We concur with management that impairment 
indicators were identified on the Bomono 
assets leading to a full impairment test.
We concur with management that no 
indicators of impairment or impairment 
reversals have been identified on the Etinde 
asset, and therefore no formal impairment 
test was carried out on this asset.
In our view the assumptions used by 
management in relation to the commercial 
terms of the proposed Bomono farm-
out and lack of appropriate alternative 
development options are appropriate. 
Consequently we believe that the impairment 
charge taken on the Bomono asset has been 
treated appropriately, and we concur that 
no impairment charge or reversal is required 
on the Etinde asset in the current year.
Impairment of the carrying value of 
investments – Parent Company only 
(2017: $217m, 2016: $275m)
Refer to Accounting Policies (page 41); 
and note 11 of the consolidated 
financial statements (page 54)
As a result of any impairment of the 
carrying value of exploration assets during 
the year, Bowleven plc Parent Company’s 
investments in subsidiaries may be impaired 
as a result of a reduction in net assets.
The underlying assets of the principal 
subsidiary are made up of the intangible 
exploration assets of Etinde and Bomono, 
along with related working capital balances, 
and management have calculated the 
recoverable amount of the principal 
subsidiary by looking at the individual 
underlying net assets which reflect the 
nature of activities in the investment.
Given there has been a change in the 
assessment of the recoverable amount 
of the underlying assets during the 
year predominantly due to impairment 
of the Bomono asset, we have 
audited management’s assumptions 
and impairment assessment. 
We concur with management assessment 
that, due to no decline in underlying asset 
valuations during the year, no indicators 
of impairment of investment balances 
have been identified, and consequently 
no impairment charges or reversals 
are required in the current year. Bowleven plc

Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements
An Overview of the Scope of our Audit
Tailoring the Scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each 
entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, 
risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other factors when 
assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of 
significant accounts in the financial statements, of the five reporting components of the Group, we selected five components covering entities 
within Africa and the UK, which represent the principal business units within the Group.
Of the five components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of two components (‘full scope components’) 
which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. 
The reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 100% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s loss before tax, 100% 
(2016: 100%) of the Group’s revenue and 100% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s total assets. For the current year, the full scope components 
contributed 100% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s loss before tax, 100% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s revenue and 100% (2016: 100%) of the 
Group’s total assets.
Of the remaining three components that together represent 0% of the Group’s net assets, none are individually greater than 1.5% of the Group’s 
net assets. For these components, we performed other procedures, including analytical review on ‘review scope’ components, testing of 
consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations and foreign currency translation recalculations to respond to any potential risks of material 
misstatement to the Group financial statements.
Involvement with Component Teams 
All audit work performed for the purposes of the audit was undertaken by the Group audit team.
Our Application of Materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in 
forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be $5.2m (2016: $5.5m), which is 1.5% (2016: 1.5%) of net assets. We believe that net assets 
provides us with the most appropriate basis to use, due to there being no revenue generated in the business with all assets being in development 
stage, removing the consideration of an activity-based measure. The users of the business are therefore focused on the capital position of the 
Company which is largely reflective of the assets held.
Performance Materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the 
probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that 
performance materiality was 75% (2016: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely $3.9m (2016: $4.1m). We have set performance materiality at 
this percentage due to our expectation of misstatements based on low level of audit misstatements in the prior year, and our assessment of the 
control environment.
Reporting Threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of $0.3m (2016: $0.3m), which is 
set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant 
qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Other Information 
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report set out on pages 1 to 28, other than the financial statements and 
our auditor’s report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, 
we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.  Bowleven plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 32
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there 
is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have 
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on Other Matters Prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 — the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements; and 
 — the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on Which We Are Required to Report by Exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or Directors’ Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 — adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
 — the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 — certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 — we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 28, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2017
1 Accounting Policies
Bowleven plc (‘the Company’) is a public limited company limited by shares, domiciled in the UK, registered in Scotland (company number 
SC: 225242). The registered office address is 50 Lothian Road, Festival Square, Edinburgh EH3 9WJ Scotland.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
Basis of Preparation
The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union (EU). The Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. 
The financial statements comply with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The Company operates using a functional currency of GB Pounds. These financial statements are presented in US Dollars, the Group’s 
presentation currency, rounded to the nearest $’000. 
Going Concern
After making enquiries, the Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors are of the opinion that the Group has 
sufficient funds to meet ongoing working capital and committed capital expenditure requirements. In making this assessment, the Directors 
considered the Group budgets, the cash flow forecasts and associated risks. 
Accounting Standards
During the year ending 30 June 2017, the following amendments/improvements endorsed by the EU became effective, which have had no 
significant impact on the Group:
IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’
The change to this standard requires that a joint operator accounting for an acquisition of an interest in a joint operation, in which the activity of 
the joint operation constitutes a business, must apply the relevant IFRS 3 principles for business combination accounting. Furthermore, entities 
are required to disclose the information required in those IFRS in relation to business combinations.
Whilst this amendment has had no direct impact on the current or previous financial year, it may well do so in the future.
Standards and Interpretations Issued But Not Yet Effective
At the date that the financial statements were authorised for issue, the standards, interpretations and amendments that were in issue but not yet 
effective are set out in the table below. The Group are in the process of assessing the potential for each of these standards, interpretations and 
amendments having a significant impact on the Group’s existing accounting policies and procedures or how the Group’s results, cash flows and 
financial position are determined and reported. The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards will have a material impact 
on the Group’s financial statements in the period of initial application. There is no intention to adopt any of these standards early.
Standard Effective date
IAS 7 disclosure initiative – amendments to IAS 7 1 January 2017
Requires additional disclosure to enable users to evaluate any changes in liabilities arising from financing activities 
(both cash and non-cash changes).
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ 1 January 2018
Under IFRS 15 revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be 
entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The principles in IFRS 15 provide a more 
structured approach to measuring and recognising revenue. The Group does not have revenue-generating activities, 
so until these commence there is no impact on the Group of the implementation of IFRS 15 and the Directors will 
continue to assess the application.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ 1 January 2019
The revised standard requires lessees to account for all leases under a single balance sheet model recognising both 
the rights to the asset and the liability arising under the lease. The Directors have considered the impact of application 
of the new standard on the Group’s lease commitments and given the limited number of leases (see note 21) do not 
consider that implementation will have a significant impact.
IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ amendment – recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses 1 January 2017

1 Accounting Policies continued
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at 
the date of the financial statements and the reporting amount of income and expenses during the year. Although these estimates are based on 
management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. Accounting estimates 
used by the Group are discussed in more detail in the following accounting policies: 
 — Oil and Gas: intangible exploration assets – carrying value and impairment
 – Note 9 sets out the key estimates and judgements relating to the assessment of the carrying value of intangible exploration assets including 
impairment considerations in the current and prior years.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated accounts include the results of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings at the balance sheet date. 
Joint Arrangements
Bowleven participates in joint arrangements which involve the joint control of assets used in the Group’s oil and gas exploration and appraisal 
activities. All of the Group’s current interests in these arrangements are determined to be joint operations. The Group accounts for its share of 
assets, liabilities, income and expenditure of the joint operation, classified in the appropriate balance sheet and income statement headings. 
Bowleven’s interests in unincorporated joint arrangements are detailed in note 9. 
Oil and Gas: Intangible Exploration Assets
The Group applies a successful efforts based method of accounting for exploration and appraisal costs and applies the requirements of IFRS 6 
‘Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’. 
Costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal right to explore an area are expensed directly to the income statement as they are incurred. 
All licence acquisition, exploration and appraisal costs and directly attributable administration costs are capitalised initially as intangible assets by 
well, field or exploration area as appropriate.
In a situation where the Group benefits from a carry from a joint arrangement partner, no costs are recognised in intangible assets for the period 
of the carry. In a situation where the Group contributes through a carry to a joint arrangement partner, full costs are recognised in intangible 
assets for the period of the carry.
Once commercial reserves are established and technical feasibility for extraction determined, then the carrying cost, after adjusting for any 
impairment that may be required, of the relevant exploration and appraisal asset are then reclassified as a single field cost centre and transferred 
into development and producing assets. In the event that no commercial reserves have been found, the results of the exploration activity no 
longer contribute to ongoing exploration work, or, if the Group decides not to continue exploration and appraisal activity in the area, then the 
costs of such unsuccessful exploration and appraisal are written off to the income statement in the period in which the determination is made.
The carrying value of the Group’s intangible exploration assets are set out in note 9.
Disposals
Net proceeds, including directly attributable costs of the transaction, from any disposal of an exploration/appraisal asset are credited initially 
against previously capitalised costs. Any surplus or shortfall in proceeds is taken to the income statement. Where the transaction reflects 
consideration in the form of a carry (or cash alternative on non-utilisation of carry) a financial asset is recognised. As and when the carry is 
utilised, those costs attributable to Bowleven are paid by the farminees and the costs recognised in Group intangible exploration assets, with a 
corresponding reduction to the financial asset.
Impairment
In accordance with IFRS 6, exploration and appraisal assets are reviewed whenever there is an indicator of impairment and costs written off 
where circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the recoverable amount (being the higher of value in use and fair value 
less costs to sell).
The recoverable amount of an asset is calculated using a discounted cash flow model. The estimated future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The 
estimates and assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model are subject to risk and uncertainty. Therefore, there is a possibility 
that a change in circumstances will impact these projections, which may impact the recoverable amount of the assets. Bowleven plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 43
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements
The following are considered possible indicators of impairment:
 — The period for which the entity has the right to explore in the specific area has expired during the period or will expire in the near future, and 
is not expected to be renewed;
 — Expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area is not planned;
 — Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area have not led to the discovery of commercially viable quantities of 
mineral resources and the entity has decided to discontinue such activities in the specific area; and
 — Sufficient data exists to indicate that, although a development in the specific area is likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the exploration 
and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale.
Where there has been a charge for impairment in an earlier period, that charge will be reversed when there has been a change in circumstances 
to the extent that the discounted future net cash flows are higher than the net book value at the time.
In reversing impairment losses, the carrying amount of the asset will be increased to the carrying value that would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognised in prior periods.
Oil and Gas: Evaluated Oil and Gas Properties (Development/Producing Assets)
There were no development and producing assets during the reported periods. 
The significant components of the development and production assets are the fields. The fields are aggregated to represent the cost of developing 
the commercial reserves discovered, together with the exploration and appraisal costs transferred from intangible exploration and appraisal 
assets and the costs of bringing them into production. 
The development and production costs also include:
 — costs of assets acquired/purchased;
 — directly attributable overheads;
 — finance costs; and
 — decommissioning and restoration.
Depletion 
The Group will deplete expenditure on development and production assets using the unit of production method, based on proved and probable 
reserves on a field-by-field basis. The depletion calculation takes account of the estimated future costs of the development of recognised proved 
and probable reserves. 
Impairment
Impairment reviews on development and production assets will be carried out on each cash-generating unit in accordance with IAS 36 
‘Impairment of Assets’. 
Property, Plant and Equipment: Owned Assets
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less anticipated disposal proceeds, on a 
straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
Leasehold improvements over the life of the lease
Plant and machinery over four years
Computer equipment over three years
Motor vehicles  over four years
Impairment
Impairment reviews on property, plant and equipment will be carried out in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. 
Operating Lease Agreements
An operating lease is recognised where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor and the lease payments 
under an operating lease agreement are charged against profits on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement over the period of the lease as an integral part of the total lease expense. Bowleven plc

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2017 continued
1 Accounting Policies continued
Investments in Subsidiaries
Investments held as non-current assets are stated at cost less impairment. The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. If the recoverable amount of the 
underlying assets within the investment is less than the value of the investment, the investment is considered to be impaired and is written down 
to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Inventory
Inventories comprise equipment and materials purchased for various drilling programmes and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value.
Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument. 
Financial assets are categorised as held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets, fair value through profit and loss or loans and 
receivables. All of the Group’s financial assets are loans and receivables, with the exception of derivative financial instruments which are held at 
fair value through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities generally substantiate claims for repayment in cash or another financial asset. Financial liabilities are categorised as either fair 
value through profit or loss or held at amortised cost. 
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Group’s activities expose the entity to foreign currency rate risk. The Group can use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the 
exposure. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies, approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles over the 
use of financial derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value and are remeasured each period and, where measurement differences occur, the gain or 
loss arising from the remeasurement in fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement. The Group did not use financial derivatives 
in the current or prior year. 
Trade and Other Receivables 
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the original invoice amount less any provision for impairment. Other receivables are recognised 
and measured at nominal value less any provision for impairment. 
A provision for impairment of trade and other receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect 
all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the estimated cash flows. The carrying amount of the asset would be reduced through the use of a bad debt provision account and 
the amount of the loss would be recognised in the Income Statement within administrative expenses. Where a trade receivable is uncollectible, it 
would be written off against the bad debt provision account. No fair value calculations are made as the difference between the asset’s net present 
value and carrying amount is not material. 
Bank Deposits
Bank deposits with an original maturity of over three months are held as a separate category of current asset and presented on the face of the 
Balance Sheet.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Trade Payables and Other Creditors
Trade payables and other creditors are non-interest bearing and are measured at cost. Cost is taken to be fair value on initial recognition.
Equity Instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Bowleven plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 45
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements
Share Based Transactions: Employee Benefits
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange 
for the grant of the options/LTIPs is recognised as an expense over the vesting period. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period  
is determined by reference to the fair value of the options/LTIPs granted. Fair value is determined by a third party using an appropriate suite of 
models, taking all market performance conditions and non-vesting conditions into account. Market performance conditions are linked to the 
growth of the Company’s share price against movements in comparator group indices. Further information on performance conditions is 
provided in note 19. Non-market performance vesting and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options/LTIPs  
that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options/LTIPs that are expected to vest. 
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to the share based 
payment reserve. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest except for equity-settled transactions for which vesting is 
conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition. These are treated as vesting irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition  
is met providing that all other performance/service conditions are met. 
Where an employee that the Company designates as a ‘good leaver’ retains share options/LTIPs on leaving, under an award dated pre 1 July 
2014, this is accounted for as a cancellation of the existing award and a replacement award (treated as a modification) as applied under the 
existing policy. Where the award is dated on or after 1 July 2014, this will be accounted for as a forfeiture, together with a new grant for any 
replacement award. 
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the 
options are exercised/LTIPs vest and new shares are issued. 
Shares acquired to meet awards under these share based compensation plans are held by the EBT. The accounts of the EBT are consolidated in 
the Group financial statements.
Share Based Transactions: Warrants
The Group has issued warrants in connection with a number of transactions with third parties. The fair value of warrants issued is determined in 
accordance with IFRS 2 based upon a valuation model. The proceeds received on exercise of warrants, net of any directly attributable transaction 
costs, will be credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when share warrants are converted into ordinary shares.
Current and Deferred Tax
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax expense and deferred tax expense.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable 
or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated by using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised where a taxable temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or where 
temporary differences arise from the initial recognition (other than in business combinations) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which 
at the time of the transaction affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint 
arrangements, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based upon 
tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Current and deferred tax is charged or credited in the 
income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged against other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the related 
tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or equity respectively.
Foreign Currencies
Transactions entered into in a currency other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates 
prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group’s entities that are not in the functional currency of that entity are 
translated into the functional currency at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange differences are recognised 
in the income statement. Bowleven plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 46
NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2017 continued
1 Accounting Policies continued
At each balance sheet date, for presentation purposes, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s entities that do not use US Dollars as their 
functional currency are translated into US Dollars at exchange rates presiding at the balance sheet date, with gains or losses on retranslation 
being recognised through the foreign exchange reserve. Income and expense transactions are translated at the average exchange rates for the 
period, where average rates are a reasonable approximation of actual rates.
The entire Group, with the exception of the Parent Company, are US Dollar functional. For consistency, the Group presents its financial 
statements in US Dollars and it is industry practice to present in US Dollars. The exchange rate used for the retranslation of the closing balance 
sheet at 30 June 2017 is $1.2978/£1 (2016: $1.3433/£1).
2 Segmental Information
For financial reporting purposes, the Groups assets are aggregated into a single reporting segment as follows:
‘Africa’ operations focus on exploration and appraisal activities in Cameroon (2016: Cameroon and Kenya). All assets that are aggregated in this 
segment are in the exploration phase and operate under a similar regulatory environment. At the end of 2017, there are no remaining assets 
relating to Kenya.
‘Other’ includes amounts of a corporate nature which are not specifically attributable to the Africa segment, such as head office costs, property, 
plant and equipment and cash balances. These amounts are net of intercompany transactions.

Since 1 October 2015, the Company has operated a non-contributory defined contribution personal pension scheme in the UK. All permanent 
employees of the Company are eligible to participate. The Company contributes a specified percentage of basic annual salary for permanent 
employees (into either the Company pension scheme or an individual personal pension plan) or, where statutory limits are applicable, pays them 
an equivalent salary alternative. Prior to 1 October 2015, the Company made a contribution of a specified percentage of basic salary to all 
permanent employees which they were required to pay into a personal pension plan.

Ocean Capital P1 Limited (‘Crown’). Crown suggested that the Group’s operations had been subject to poor management decision making and 
insufficient attention to investors’ interests. The Board determined to undertake a strategic review of the Group’s operations and report back to 
shareholders at a subsequent general meeting. During the strategic review and associated rebuttal of Crown’s claims, the Group incurred legal 
and professional costs of circa $530,000.
At the general meeting on 14 March 2017, shareholders voted to remove all but one of the pre-existing Board members from office and appointed 
two new Directors. As a result of this decision, the Group made termination of employment payments to Executive Directors of $743,000. 
Subsequent to this meeting, the new Board implemented a series of actions to reduce the operating cost of the Group’s head office function, as 
well as relocating the head office from Edinburgh to London. Head office redundancy costs of $742,000 were incurred as a result.
These costs were settled in cash and form part of the Group’s cash flows from operating activities. We expect the costs to be fully deductible at 
the standard rate of UK Corporation tax.

(c) Deferred Tax
At 30 June 2017, tax losses were $73.8m (2016: $67.1m). Tax losses will be carried forward and are potentially available for utilisation against 
taxable profits in future years. The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of these tax losses and temporary differences as it 
does not currently meet the recognition criteria of IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’. The asset will be recognised in future periods when its recovery 
(against appropriate taxable profits) is considered probable. Bowleven plc

Impairment Considerations 
The Group undertook a full impairment review of its exploration assets in December 2015 and the review was undertaken with consideration of 
the macro economic environment and prevailing market conditions in the oil and gas industry which has resulted in a prolonged period of lower 
global oil prices. During the current financial year, the inputs and assumptions which underlie the impairment review of the carrying value of 
intangible exploration assets undertaken as at 31 December 2015 have been reviewed and deemed appropriate by the Directors, and the Group 
considers that there have been no additional or material changes to the indicators of impairment identified at that date for the current year. 
In addition to the underlying inputs and assumptions considered above, additional indicators of impairment have arisen in the current year 
specifically relating to the Bomono asset (as described in more detail below).
In carrying out the impairment assessment of each asset, the recoverable amount of the asset (fair value less costs of disposal using level 3 inputs 
based on IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy) was determined using a discounted cash flow model and is compared to the net book value of the 
intangible exploration asset in the financial statements. The discount rate has been calculated based on the post tax rate of 10% (unchanged from 
prior reporting period). The carrying value as at 30 June 2017 includes additions incurred since 31 December 2015 (the initial impairment date). 
The application of this impairment basis to each of the Group’s assets is set out below.
Etinde
Given the market downturn, the Group’s long-term oil price assumption has been retained at $65 per bbl (2016: $65 per bbl). The Etinde asset is 
considered to be a single cash-generating unit and includes historic exploration costs incurred on the Etinde Permit in line with the treatment of 
those costs for cost recovery purposes. 
The discounted cash flow model used to assess the Etinde recoverable amount represents a conservative case, and only considers an initial 
development supplying gas to the planned fertiliser plant excluding any potential additional resources and offtake solutions that may result from 
planned appraisal drilling, in particular that of the Intra Isongo formation which will be targeted by two planned appraisal wells. Bowleven’s 
estimated share of the drilling and testing of these wells is covered by a $40m net carry provided under the Etinde farm-out transaction that 
completed in March 2015. 
As a result of this impairment review, no additional impairment charge is considered necessary, nor any impairment reversal and no additional 
amount has been recognised in the income statement (2016: $60.7m). The carrying value as at 30 June 2017 includes additions incurred since 
December 2015. The recoverable amount of the Etinde cash-generating unit calculated on the above basis remains $168.4m (2016: $168.4m). 
Bomono
The Bomono asset is considered to be a single cash-generating unit. In the prior year, the Bomono asset was written down by a $61.0m 
impairment charge to its recoverable amount following an impairment review as at December 2015. The key valuation assumption used to assess 
the value of the Bomono licence for impairment purposes, was a gas price of $7/mmscf, which reflected the market downturn and was gauged 
against local market pricing in the absence of a gas sales agreement for the asset at that juncture.
This gas pricing assumption was applied to the discounted cash flow model which is based on the EA submission and assumes a small initial 
in-situ gas-to-power development. The recoverable amount of the Bomono asset calculated on the basis detailed above in 2016 was $36.6m 
(2015 $97.6m). The carrying amount of the Bomono asset at June 2016 reflected subsequent additions since December 2015. 
 
In January 2017, the Group received an extension to the Bomono Exploration Authorisation of a further two years, extending the period to 
12 December 2018. The Group continues to be actively engaged with the Cameroon authorities regarding the award of a PEA under the extended 
Exploration Authorisation. Pending the award of the PEA, to enable development and gas sales discussion progression, the team has completed its 
evaluation of the potential of both the shallower and deeper reservoirs encountered following the completion of drilling and testing activities in 
January 2016. A full inventory of existing contingent and prospective resources has been compiled.
In March 2017, the Board concluded initial discussions with VOG, an AIM listed oil and gas utility business with operations in Cameroon, to sell 
80% of its investment in the Bomono PSC, subject to the finalisation of a number of conditions precedent. The most significant of which related 
to the receipt of Governmental approval, further extension of the licence term and the award of a PEA. These contractual arrangements had a 
‘longstop’ date of 30 June 2017, which VOG has extended with our agreement to 31 December 2017. The conditions precedent have yet to be 
achieved and discussions continue with VOG and SNH. 
The Directors consider the farm-out arrangement with VOG to be an ideal partnership for both parties to enable the successful development of 
the Bomono asset. VOG has a well established infrastructure and commercially orientated customer base around Douala in close proximity to the 
Moambe discovery in the Bomono licence area. There are currently few other potential development partners in Cameroon for an asset of this 
size and nature.
The Group have used this contractual arrangement as providing a reasonably definitive third party valuation point for the Bomono exploration 
asset at 30 June 2017. The principal consideration for the asset transfer is a royalty against future gas sales from the Moambe well, along with 
a small amount of VOG shares and a carry of up to $3m in value, against an estimate of $6m capital cost to bring the existing gas to market. 
The carry is subject to a clawback arrangement under which Bowleven might repay up to $2m.  Bowleven plc

NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2017 continued
9 Intangible Exploration Assets continued
In respect of the royalty agreement, there is some uncertainty regarding both the gas selling price, where there is a range of possible selling 
prices based on the agreement with VOG, upon which the royalty would be calculated, and the amount of gas that would be produced from the 
Moambe well. As a result, we are not able to determine the net present value of the royalty at the current time with sufficient reliability nor to 
estimate the net present value of Bowleven’s continuing 20% share of the Bomono licence under the commercial terms agreed with VOG. 
Should the farm-in arrangement with VOG not complete, then the Directors consider it unlikely that the Group will be able to present the 
Government with an alternative development plan for the licence area in the remaining time before the existing agreement terminates in 
December 2018. Furthermore, there is a risk that the Government will not approve a further extension to the Exploration Authorisation. 
In which case, any PEA would cease to be valid. Therefore, when considering these risks as a whole, the Directors’ consider it unlikely that the 
Government will seek to extend the existing licence any further at the current time without attaching additional work commitments.
Given the ongoing negotiations and fundamental uncertainties, the recoverable amount of the Bomono asset has been determined to be zero, 
resulting in an impairment charge of $45.6m (2016: $61.0m) in the income statement.
Our discussions with VOG to date have suggested that there is little or no prospect of improving on the above commercial terms. Whilst we have 
also flagged other possible Bomono divestment scenarios, the likelihood is that any NPV improvement on the farm-in terms, if any, is likely to be 
marginal. To the extent any contractual arrangement is agreed and a possible valuation determination is possible on any royalty structure, or 
indeed Bowleven’s 20% equity in the Bomono PSC, then an impairment reversal may be merited at that time.
Unsuccessful Exploration Costs
The licence interest in Kenya block 11B, the sole asset held in Bowleven Kenya (owned by Bowleven 70% and First Oil 30%), expired on 26 May 2016, 
the end of the initial phase of the exploration licence. Bowleven has not sought to extend the licence and has exited the development. Exploration 
costs of $11.8m had been incurred on the licence ($8.8m of which was funded by First Oil) and were fully impaired in 2016. 
Etinde Farm-Out 
On 16 March 2015, the Group completed a farm-out of part of its interest in the Etinde asset to LUKOIL Overseas West Project Ltd (‘LUKOIL’) 
and NewAge (African Global Energy) Ltd (‘NewAge’). The operatorship of Etinde transferred to NewAge on that date with Bowleven retaining a 
25% non-operated interest. $165m initial cash proceeds were received on 16 March 2015 along with a further $15m on 30 September 2016 on 
completion of appraisal drilling. In accordance with the Company’s policy under IFRS 6 ‘Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Assets’ the 
Group deducted the net proceeds received from the carrying value of intangible exploration assets in the prior years. 
In addition to these cash payments, there is further deferred consideration: 
 — Up to $40m (net) carry for two Etinde appraisal wells, including testing (or cash alternative in 2020); and
 — $25m cash contingent upon and to be received at Etinde development project FID. 
A financial asset of $55m (note 14) was recognised for the deferred considerations relating to the two well future Etinde appraisal drilling carry 
(or cash alternative on non-utilisation of carry) of $40m and $15m relating to the completion of ongoing appraisal drilling noted above. The 
appraisal drilling carry is an element of the total transaction consideration so has been credited to intangible exploration assets along with the 
other elements of consideration. This credit to intangibles will be unwound as those appraisal drilling costs attributable to Bowleven are paid by 
the farminees and the costs recognised in Group intangible exploration assets.
The remaining $25m is currently disclosed as a contingent asset (note 20) and will be credited to intangible exploration assets once sufficient 
certainty on FID project sanction is achieved. This is likely to occur post appraisal drilling as key milestones are reached on the path to FID.

Ongoing funding advanced from the Company to its subsidiaries is capitalised on a regular basis. During the year $4.6m (2016: $47.7m) has been 
capitalised. During the year $49,000 (2016: $94,000) was recognised as additions relating to Bowleven Resources Limited for the award of share 
options in the Company to the employees of EurOil Limited (Cameroon subsidiary of Bowleven Resources Limited).
A full impairment review of the carrying value of Investments in subsidiary undertakings was performed in 2017, giving rise to an impairment 
provision of $58.1m (2016: $64.1m).
The recoverable amount of the investments are determined using discounted future cash flows, on a basis consistent with that already disclosed 
in note 9 ‘Intangible Exploration Assets’, and compared to the net book values of the investments in Bowleven Resources Limited and Bowleven 
New Ventures Limited in the financial statements. As a result of the current year update following the impairment provision of the Bomono 
intangible asset (note 9) and the dividend of $15m of Etinde deferred consideration distributed to the Company, a further impairment provision of 
$58.1m has been required in relation to the investment in Bowleven Resources Limited (2016: $60.5m). No impairment reversals or further 
provisions have been made against the carrying value of Bowleven New Ventures Limited (2016: $3.6m) in respect of the year to 30 June 2017. 
The recoverable amount of the investment in Bowleven Resources Limited was $215.4m (2016: $273.5m) as at 30 June 2017. The investment in 
Bowleven New Ventures Limited was assessed to have a recoverable amount of zero as at 30 June 2017 and 2016.

As at 30 June 2017 there is a financial asset of $39.7m (2016: $54.7m) arising from the Etinde farm-out (see note 9 for further detail). $15m 
deferred cash consideration was received on 30 September 2016 in respect of ongoing appraisal drilling. The initial, outstanding amount was 
$40m (net) relating to two appraisal wells carry on the Etinde asset (or cash alternative if not completed by 2020). The financial asset will unwind 
as the carry is utilised through appraisal drilling and/or when the deferred cash is received respectively. The Etinde field operator has cash called 
a small amount of the sum outstanding in the year. Any discounting applied for this period would be immaterial so no adjustment has been made.  Bowleven plc

Group income statement. The transfer between reserves relates to LTIPs and share options exercised or lapsed in the period and represent the 
amount previously expensed through the Group income statement.
Shares Held in Trust
The balance in the shares held in trust reserve 4,639,563 shares (2016: 302,895 shares) relates to Bowleven plc shares held by the EBT for the 
settlement of share based payment obligations. During the year, the EBT purchased 9,201,577 shares (2016: 3,544,633 shares) and issued 
4,864,909 shares (2016: 3,378,515).
Merger Reserve
The balance held in the merger reserve is the result of a Group reconstruction in 2002.
Treasury Shares
The Company initiated a share buyback programme on 19 August 2016 for a maximum aggregate consideration of up to $10m, the purpose 
being to reduce the outstanding issued share capital of the Company. The Board considered that the share buyback programme would be in the 
shareholders’ interests, being accretive to net asset value per share whilst retaining sufficient financial flexibility to evaluate growth options. The 
Company entered into an agreement with its then broker, Macquarie Capital (Europe) Limited to repurchase shares on its behalf, such shares 
being held by the Company in treasury. The share buyback programme was executed in accordance with the Company’s general authority to 
make market purchases which was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 16 December 2015 and the Company retained discretion in respect 
of the volume, timing and price of shares to be repurchased. The share buyback arrangements were terminated at the AGM on 14 December 
2016. The Company repurchased 7,807,281 shares into treasury, having a nominal value of £780,728. The aggregate amount of consideration 
paid by the Company for those shares was £2,566,000.
Non-Controlling Interest
Bowleven Kenya is included in the Group accounts as a subsidiary with the 30% First Oil shareholding recognised as a non-controlling interest 
(note 11). In the year to 30 June 2015 funding from the non-controlling interest was received. This relates to interest free funding to Bowleven 
Kenya from First Oil, repayable at such time as the Board of Bowleven Kenya resolve Bowleven Kenya has proceeds available to make a 
repayment. Given the expiry of the block 11B licence in Kenya on 26 May 2016, no repayment will be made in respect of funding received from 
First Oil and accordingly, no liability is recorded. Bowleven plc

19 Share Based Payments 
The Group operates share based payment schemes for the benefit of its employees. The Group has also issued share based payments in 
connection with third party transactions.
Approved and Unapproved Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) Scheme
Options granted under the approved CSOP are exercisable three to ten years following the date of grant. Options granted under the unapproved 
CSOP Scheme are exercisable two to ten years following the date of grant or three to ten years following the date of grant depending on the grant 
date. The options issued prior to 31 December 2007 are not subject to performance conditions on exercise. Options issued after 31 December 
2007 are subject to the following performance conditions attached to their exercise: 
 — an increase in Bowleven plc’s share price of at least 5% per annum on a compound basis over the period from the date of grant of the options 
up to the date they are exercised; and
 — the percentage increase in Bowleven plc’s share price over the same period being at least equal to or greater than the percentage movement in 
the FTSE AIM Oil & Gas Index. 
The options granted under the unapproved CSOP Scheme on 11 December 2008 have special performance conditions attached to their exercise 
as follows in that they are conditional upon the Company’s performance over the period of two years from the date of grant being the median 
position or above, relative to other oil and gas companies in its comparator group. 
Both schemes were adopted by the Directors on 10 December 2004 and the approved scheme was approved by the Inland Revenue with effect 
from 15 December 2004. Under the approved scheme, certain employees were granted options which are exercisable between 2008 and 2026 
at prices between £0.20 and £3.80.
Under the unapproved scheme, certain employees were granted options which are exercisable between 2007 and 2026 at prices between £0.20 
and £3.80. 
During 2017, a number of employees were made redundant. The Remuneration Committee determined that each leaver was to be treated as 
a ‘good leaver’ under the scheme rules and permitted each employee to exercise their full option rights in the 12-month period following 
their redundancy. Bowleven plc

During the current financial year, the Remuneration Committee and the Board changed the terms of the share options already in issue, following 
two rounds of redundancies. As a result of these changes, the fair value of certain options changed, resulting in the requirement to update the 
valuation model. The valuation assumptions used in respect of both the revaluation and the awards during the year were calculated using a Monte 
Carlo model at the date of grant or change in scheme rules, utilising the following inputs:
May 2017 
Revaluation
December 2016 
Revaluations
New options 
issued 2016/17 2015 and 2016
Risk-free rate 0.07% 0.02% 0.29% 0.49%-0.92%

Vesting period 1 year 1 year 2–3 years 2-3 years
Expected life 1 year 1 year 7 years 7 years
Expected departures during vesting period 0% 0% 5% 5.0%
Prior to 1 July 2012 awards were valued using a binomial model.
The weighted average fair value of approved options granted during the year was £0.06 (2016: £0.06). The weighted average fair value of 
unapproved options granted during the year was £0.06 (2016: £0.06). Settlement is in shares and the exercise price is the share price at date of 
grant. Expected volatility has been set as an estimate of the rate which the Company share price is expected to fluctuate during the life of the 
option. Estimation included consideration of movements in the historic volatility of the Company share price. The expected life used in the model 
has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural 
considerations. The weighted average share price during the year was £0.23 (2016: £0.23).
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The fair value of the LTIP scheme awards has been calculated using an appropriate suite of models. The main inputs to the model are as per the 
share option schemes above. In addition, the following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of LTIP awards:
2017 2016
Risk-free rate 0.29% 0.76%
Expected volatility 45.4% 49.4%
Dividend yield 0% 0%
Expected life 3 years 3 years
The vesting date is three years from the date the LTIP was awarded. Bowleven plc

Performance Conditions
A proportion of the LTIP awards will vest if the total shareholder return in the Company ranks median or above when compared with the total 
shareholder return of a pre-defined list of its 14 (2016: 14) main competitors (‘the comparators’) over the vesting period.
The awards under the existing LTIP are shown below:

Outstanding at 30 June 2017 4,364,694
As at 30 June 2017, there were 4,364,694 awards (2016: 16,536,275) outstanding with a weighted average grant price of £0.23 (2016: £0.26) 
and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.2 years (2016: 1.76 years).
The weighted average fair value of LTIP awards granted during the year was £0.06 (2016: £0.06) and the weighted average share price at the 
date of grant of LTIP awards granted during the year was £0.22 (2016: £0.20). 
During the year, a number of Directors and senior managers left employment with the Group. For each individual, the Remuneration Committee 
determined which LTIP awards had met or partially met the appropriate performance criteria. On this basis a number of awards were considered 
to have vested. Other LTIP awards were considered to have lapsed. 
Bowleven Transformation Incentive Plan
The Plan was adopted by the Board of the Company on 9 May 2017. The purpose of the Plan is to motivate employees of the Company in 
alignment with the Company’s long-term goals and performance. Options are issued at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Options granted under the Plan cover a performance period running between the date of grant and 31 March 2022. The options vest from the 
release date, determined by the Board based on the attainment of certain performance criteria. The options may be exercised in the subsequent 
period up to a maximum of ten years from the grant date. The performance conditions relate to the attainment of certain share prices points 
between £0.45 and £0.80 pence per share for a continuous period of at least three months and meeting the annual cost underpin criteria, 
whereby the annual cash costs incurred must be below the amount set out in cash expenses target set by the Board. The options have a nil 
exercise price.
The awards under the Plan during the year are as follows:
Number
Outstanding at 1 July 2016 –
Granted during the year 10,000,000
Expired during the year –
Vested during the year –
Outstanding at 30 June 2017 10,000,000
The fair value of the BTIP scheme awards has been calculated using an appropriate suite of models. The main inputs to the model are as per the 
share option schemes below using a trinomial pricing model applying a Monte Carlo simulation. In addition, the following assumptions were used 
in calculating the fair value of LTIP awards:

Warrants
During 2015, 6,875,000 warrants were issued to Macquarie under the terms of a now-expired bridge facility at an exercise price of 50 pence,

As at 30 June 2017 the Group has a contingent asset of $25m (2016: $25m) arising from the Etinde farm-out (see note 9 for further detail). 
The amount is contingent on a FID being reached on the development of the Etinde field by all parties. A financial asset will be recognised in the 
balance sheet and this final consideration for the Etinde farm-out transaction credited to intangible exploration assets once sufficient certainty on 
FID project sanction is achieved. This is likely to occur post appraisal drilling as key milestones are reached on the path to FID. 
21 Commitments Under Operating Leases

average term of approximately two years. All leases have been entered into on conventional commercial terms. Certain contracts include renewal 
options. Subsequent to the end of the financial year, the leases on the existing office space ended and new office leases have been signed in the 
UK and Cameroon. The total commitment under these agreements is $40,000 per annum in respect of a two-year lease.
22 Financial Instruments
The Group’s and Company’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents and deferred consideration. The main purpose 
of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s and Company’s operations. The Group and Company have other financial instruments, 
which mainly comprise trade receivables and trade payables arising directly from its operations.
Financial Risk Factors
The Group’s and Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s and 
Company’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse 
effects on the Group’s and Company’s financial performance.
The Group and Company finance department identifies, evaluates and manages financial risks under policies approved by the Board of Directors. 
The Board provides guidance on overall risk management including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and investment of excess 
liquidity. The principal aim of the Risk Management Policy is to minimise financial risks and ensure adequate cash is available to the Group and 
Company. Bowleven plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 63
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements
(a) Market Risk
Foreign Exchange Risk
The Group and Company operate internationally and are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily 
with respect to the GB Pound and the US Dollar. 
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the 
functional currency of a Group company. The Group and Company manage exposures that arise from receipt of monies in a non-functional 
currency by matching receipts and payments in the same currency. 
The Group reports in US Dollars which, with the majority of assets US Dollar denominated, minimises the impact of foreign exchange movements 
on the Group’s balance sheet.

Surplus funds are placed on short-term deposits and money market funds at floating rates. 
The Group and Company are exposed to foreign exchange risk relating to translation of foreign currency balances under IFRS, mainly between 
US Dollar and GB Pound. The table below shows the impact that a change in the US Dollar to GB Pound rate would have had on (loss)/profit 
before tax and equity, all other variables being held constant.

(b) Credit Risk
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. 
The Group invests primarily in funds with institutions holding a Moody’s long-term deposit rating of A2 or above, or with AAA-rated money 
market funds. The Board may from time to time approve the use of banks rated P2 or above, with investment assessed on a case by case basis 
(limited to $3m per bank). The Directors believe their choice of bank reduces the credit risk exposure of the Group.
Counterparty risk is monitored on a regular basis and the Group and Company aim to minimise its exposure by investing funds with a number of 
counterparties at any one time, with a maximum of $25m (or 25% if total cash balance greater than $100m) held with any one bank. As at 
30 June 2017, the largest balance held with one institution was $25m (2016: $19.7m).
The Group and Company adopt a prudent approach to cash management to maximise safety, liquidity and yield. Developments in the market are 
closely monitored and if increasing counterparty risk is identified, funds are fully redeemed and invested with alternative institutions. Neither the 
Group or Company have any offset arrangements. 
As the Group and Company are not yet trading, they are not yet exposed to the credit risks associated with trade receivables. The Group has 
JV receivables balances and deferred consideration receivable relating to the Etinde farm-out, both of which are monitored on an ongoing basis 
with appropriate follow-up action taken if necessary.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the balance sheet date. Bowleven plc

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2017 continued
22 Financial instruments continued
(c) Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group or Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group and Company 
prepare cash flow information on a regular basis, which is reviewed by Directors and senior management. 
Management’s objectives are to retain sufficient liquid funds to enable them to meet their day-to-day obligations as they fall due whilst maximising 
returns on surplus funds.
The Group and Company currently finance their operations from existing cash reserves which, in the past, have been funded from share issues. 
During 2015, the Group completed the Etinde farm-out and received cash proceeds of $165m on completion with a further $15m received on 
30 September 2016. There is further deferred consideration relating to the Etinde farm-out totalling $64.7m receivable as a combination of cash 
and carry for appraisal drilling activity (refer to note 9). As the Group moves towards development, alternative sources of funding are likely to 
be used.
The Group and Company currently have surplus cash, which is placed predominantly in short-term variable-rate deposit accounts or invested in 
money market funds. The Directors believe this gives them the flexibility to release cash resources at short notice and also allows them to take 
advantage of changing conditions in the finance markets as they arise.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s and Company’s cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows. In addition, 
the Group’s and Company’s Liquidity Management Policy involves projecting cash flows for capital expenditure and considering the level of liquid 
assets necessary to meet these.
Cash and cash equivalents include restricted cash of $0.5m (2016: $0.5m) as detailed in note 15. 
The Group and Company have no borrowing facilities (with the exception of the interest free funding from First Oil) that require repayment and 
therefore have no interest rate risk exposure. The maturity profile of the Company’s liabilities is shown in note 16.
Capital Risk Management
The Group’s and Company’s objectives when managing capital, maintained on an ongoing basis, are to maintain a strong capital base so as to 
preserve investor, creditor and market confidence, sustain the future development of the business and achieve an optimal capital structure to 
reduce the cost of capital to the Group and Company. The Group currently considers equity to be the principal capital source of the Group 
alongside farm-out opportunities. As the Group moves towards development, alternative sources of funding are likely to be used.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group and Company may issue fresh equity, return capital to shareholders (cancellation 
of share premium account completed in prior year, refer to note 18), farm-out part of its assets or source debt funding.
Other funding sources include funding from the non-controlling interest. This relates to interest free funding to Bowleven Kenya from First Oil. 
Given the expiry of the block 11B licence in Kenya on 26 May 2016, no repayment will be made in respect of funding received from First Oil and 
accordingly, no liability is recorded.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 30 June 2017.

EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
General
The notes on the following pages give an explanation of the proposed resolutions. Resolutions 1 to 6 are proposed as ordinary resolutions. 
This means that for each of those resolutions to be passed, more than half of the votes cast must be in favour of the resolution. Resolution 7 
is proposed as a special resolution. This means that for this resolution to be passed, at least three-quarters of the votes cast must be in favour 
of the resolution.
Resolution 1 – Annual Report and Accounts
The Directors must lay the Company’s accounts, the Directors’ Report and the auditor’s report before the shareholders in a general meeting. 
A copy of those accounts and reports are available on the Company’s website at www.bowleven.com.
Resolutions 2 and 3 – Re-Election of Directors
The Company’s Articles of Association require that any Director appointed by the Directors shall retire at the next AGM following their respective 
appointments and be eligible for re-election. Joe Darby (appointed to the Board on 3 April 2017) and Matthew McDonald (appointed to the 
Board on 17 August 2017) will accordingly retire and offer themselves for election by the shareholders for the first time. 
A biography in respect of each Director is included on pages 16 and 17 of the Annual Report and Accounts. 
Resolutions 4 and 5 – Reappointment and Remuneration of the Auditor
The Company is required to appoint an auditor at each general meeting at which accounts are laid before the shareholders, to hold office until the 
end of the next such meeting. Resolution 4 proposes the reappointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s auditor and Resolution 5 seeks 
authority for the Directors to determine the auditor’s remuneration.
Resolution 6 – Renewal of Authority to Allot Shares 
The purpose of this resolution is to renew the Directors’ power to allot shares. Section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that the 
Directors may not allot new shares (other than pursuant to employee share schemes) without shareholder approval.
This resolution proposes that authority be granted in substitution for the existing authority to allot securities up to a maximum amount 
of £10,852,021, representing approximately one-third of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 
7 November 2017, being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this notice. 
In addition (and as was the case at last year’s AGM), following guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers (ABI) (now known as the 
Investment Association) in December 2008 and updated in November 2009, the Company is seeking additional authority to allot securities in 
connection with a pre-emptive rights issue up to a maximum amount of £10,852,021, representing approximately one-third of the Company’s 
issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 7 November 2017, being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this 
notice. The benefit to the Company of obtaining such authority on an annual basis is that it would allow the Company to implement a rights issue 
of an amount equal to a maximum of approximately two-thirds of the issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) without the need to 
call an additional general meeting. This would shorten the implementation timetable of such a rights issue. 
The Directors have no present intention of exercising the authorities sought pursuant to this resolution but consider them desirable to allow the 
Company to retain flexibility. The authorities will expire on 31 December 2018, or if earlier, at the conclusion of the next AGM to be held in 2018, 
unless previously renewed, revoked or varied by the Company in a general meeting. It is the intention of the Directors to renew these authorities 
annually at each annual general meeting.
As at 7 November 2017, 7,807,281 shares were held by the Company in treasury which represented approximately 2.34% of the issued share 
capital of the Company.
Resolution 7 – Disapplication of Pre-Emption Rights
Section 561(1) of the Companies Act 2006 provides that if the Directors wish to allot any equity securities, or sell any treasury shares (if it holds 
any), for cash, the Company must first offer them to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings. Section 561 does not 
apply in connection with allotments made pursuant to an employee share scheme. 
The purpose of this resolution is to seek power for the Directors to allot equity securities or sell any treasury shares for cash as if section 561(1) 
of the Companies Act 2006 did not apply, in connection with rights issues, open offers and other pre-emptive offers pursuant to the authority 
granted by resolution 6, and otherwise up to a total amount of £3,255,606, representing approximately 10% of the Company’s issued ordinary 
share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 7 November 2017, being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document. The 
power conferred by this resolution will expire at the same time as the authority granted by resolution 6, unless previously renewed, revoked or 
varied by the Company in a general meeting. It is the intention of the Directors to renew this power annually at each AGM. 
Recommendation
The Directors consider that the resolutions to be proposed at the AGM are in the best interests of the Company and shareholders as a whole. 
Accordingly, the Directors unanimously recommend that you vote in favour of the resolutions to be proposed at the AGM, as the Directors intend 
to do in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings, which amount in aggregate to 1,806,274 ordinary shares, being 0.55% of the ordinary 
share capital of the Company in issue at the date of this notice (excluding treasury shares). Bowleven plc
