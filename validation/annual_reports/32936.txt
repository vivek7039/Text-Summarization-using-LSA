Key Events
Total 2017 production of 272,274 oz of gold and gold 
equivalent, above the guidance range for the year of  
255,000 – 265,000 oz. (2016 production: 261,159 oz).
Average realised price of gold equivalents was US$1,162 per oz 
for the year (2016: US$1,136 per oz).
Total Cash Costs increased by 11.7% to US$507 per oz, 
influenced by the stronger rouble, while All-In Sustaining  
Cash Costs inched up by 1.8% to US$664 per oz.
Cash inflow from operating activities decreased by 6.0%  
to US$131.0 million (2016: US$139.3 million)
Net debt to EBITDA ratio slightly increased to 1.28 as  
of 31 December 2017 from 1.26 a year earlier.
Interim dividend of £0.0498 per share paid for H1 2017  
(2016: Interim dividend of £0.05 per share).
Mnogovershinnoye (MNV) – New JORC-compliant reserve 
estimate at MNV doubled ore reserves and supported the 
extension of life-of-mine by four years to at least 2022, with initial 
results from the ongoing near-mine exploration programme 
indicating resources for additional years of operation. New 
exploration licences were received for two areas adjacent to MNV. 
Novoshirokinskoye (Novo) – Updated resource and reserve 
estimates for Novo supported an increase in gold equivalent 
ounces by more than 70%, but at lower grades. The planned 
expansion of ore mining and processing capacity to 1.3 mtpa  
is ongoing and is now expected to achieve its full capacity in  
the year 2020.
Belaya Gora –A pre-feasibility study (PFS) was developed for 
Belaya Gora including plant upgrades and the treatment of ore 
from the nearby Blagodatnoye deposit (finalised and released  
in early 2018). Mining at Belaya Gora continued to focus on 
processing low-grade ore stockpiles pending the completion  
of an ongoing project review.
Kekura – Preparations made for construction and work advanced 
on a Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) and updated JORC-
compliant mineral resource and ore reserve estimates (finalised 
and released in early 2018). 
Baley Hub – De-watering programme continued for existing 
Taseevskoye open-pit with a view to de-risking the project and 
allowing for further reserve confirmation, with attention now 
turned to finding new water disposal solutions. On the ZIF-1  
Tailings licence, the Board approved funding for design work  
on a possible heap leach operation.
Unkurtash – Scoping study completed and released, and 
discussions held with potential partners for joint project 
development.
The Company’s Board of Directors adopted a new dividend policy 
targeting a payout of 20% of net cash flow from operations.
Post Year End Events
Second interim dividend of £0.0542 per share approved by  
the Board of Directors, making a total distribution of £0.104 per 
share for the year to 31 December 2017 (2016: £0.104 per share). STRATEGIC REPORT

Strategic Report 
Chairman’s Statement
Eugene Shvidler
 “Unlocking the Value of a 
World Class Resource Base…”
Dear Shareholder,
It gives me much pleasure to report  
that Highland Gold Mining’s 15th year as  
a public company – Anniversary: 23rd 
May 2017 – marked a period of steady 
progress on all our strategic fronts. 
Before I chronicle such progress, I would 
like to draw your attention to the fact  
that, after 15 years as a publicly quoted 
enterprise, some 63% of your Company’s 
shares are in ‘free float’ and our shareholder 
base includes a wide range of UK, 
European and US institutional investors. 
Our commitment to good corporate 
governance remains strong. Furthermore, 
we continue to enjoy a strong dividend 
record and a conservative debt profile. 
As some of you will be aware, our recent 
presentations to the investment and 
mining communities have focused on 
unlocking the value of our assets. I utilise 
this phrase again because there can be 
few better descriptions of management’s 
primary objective which was furthered, 
throughout the year under review,  
by effective business strategies and 
carefully monitored disciplines.
Unlocking value came of age during 2017 
when the results of extensive exploration 
activity and a series of updated estimates 
from our producing mines, Blagodatnoye, 
and Kekura, our flagship development 
project, culminated in a 56% increase  
in the Company’s proven and probable  
ore reserves from 3.26 Moz of gold and 
gold equivalent to 5.10 Moz on a year-on-
year basis. 
This significant enhancement of our 
reserves, accompanied by a lowering of 
average grade from 8/0 g/t to 3.3 g/t 
reflecting lower cut-off grades and 
increased ore tonnage, underlines the 
strength of our asset base, as does  
a 6.6% increase in our mineral resources 
Steady
progress
(measured, indicated and inferred)  
to 17.2 Moz of gold and gold equivalent 
compared to 16.1 Moz as at 31 December 
2016. Further details regarding the 
extension of our resources and reserves 
are to be found in the Chief Executive’s 
Report and the subsequent Operational 
Review. 
Our business strategy, as outlined in 
recent years, is to balance a steady rate  
of production from our operating mines 
– MNV, Novo and Belaya Gora – with the 
progression of our key development and 
exploration projects, while also reviewing 
opportunities to add new resources or 
production in our regions of presence. 
In keeping with this approach, total 
production registered a 4.3% increase  
to a record 272,274 oz of gold and  
gold equivalent in 2017 compared  
with the previous year’s 261,159 oz.  
This performance exceeded our initial 
255,000 – 265,000 oz guidance range 
and our estimate in respect of 2018 
targets looks for a maintained outcome 
of between 265,000 and 275,000 oz. 
Consistent with our business strategy, 
your Company will continue to maximise 
the upside potential of our operating 
assets, namely: MNV (‘Life-of-mine’ 
extended), Novo (capacity being 
expanded to 1.3 Mtpa) and Belaya  
Gora (processing plant upgrades  
and combination with the  
Blagodatnoye deposit). 
We will also drive the development  
of assets at the Definitive Feasibility  
Study and/or Preliminary Feasibility  
Study stages encompassing Kekura, 
where Government approval has been 
received for the development of a deposit 
of ‘federal significance’ and infrastructure 
construction has commenced, and Klen, 
where we are planning additional 
exploration work. 
I would like to emphasise the importance 
we place on retaining our low cost 
producer credentials and I am pleased to 
report that our current ratios fully support 
our status as one of the most competitive 
gold mining companies in the world. Total 
Cash Costs amounted to US$507 per oz 
in 2017, while our All-In-Sustaining Cash 
Costs totalled US$664 per oz. This 
compares with US$454 per oz and 
US$652 per oz respectively in 2016. 
The average realised price of gold and 
gold equivalent during 2017 amounted 
to US$1,162 per oz compared with 
US$1,136 per oz in 2016 and should  
be seen against our All-In-Sustaining 
Cash Costs measurement. The average 
realised price of gold, in respect of MNV 
and Belaya Gora, was US$1,259 per oz 
during the year. Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

STRATEGIC REPORT
The combination of a stronger Russian 
rouble, and the resulting slightly higher 
dollar production costs, as well as our 
utilisation of low grade ore at Belaya  
Gora was reflected in a 4.4% reduction  
in EBITDA to US$155.3 million in 2017 
compared with US$162.5 million in 2016. 
In line with this, our EBITDA margin 
declined to 49.0% (2016: 53.1%). 
Net debt, as at 31 December 2017, 
amounted to US$198 million versus 
US$205 million as at 31 December 2016. 
Our net debt to EBITDA ratio remains 
stable at 1.28 (2016: 1.26). 
Your Directors recognise the Company’s 
commitment to the return of profits to 
shareholders through dividend payments 
and towards the end of last year we 
decided to clarify such intentions by  
way of adopting a more formalised 
dividend policy. 
The key aspects of the policy are as 
follows: 
• The Company aims to pay a dividend 
that takes into account its cash 
generation, profitability, balance  
sheet strength and capital investment 
requirements;
• The Company anticipates that the total 
dividend distribution for each financial 
year will be 20% of net cash flow from 
operating activities; and
• The Board may recommend the 
distribution of additional cash on the 
balance sheet through increased or 
special dividends should such funds 
not be required for capital expenditure 
or debt repayment. 
In the wake of such considerations,  
the Board is pleased to recommend the 
payment of a second interim dividend of 
£0.0542 per share (2016 final dividend: 
£0.054 per share) which will make a total 
distribution of £0.104 per share (2016: 
£0.104 per share) for the financial year  
to 31 December 2017. 
As evidenced above and in the ensuing 
sections, 2017 has witnessed sound 
progress on numerous fronts. Your Board 
has every confidence that such progress 
will serve to deliver further returns to 
shareholders in the future. 
It is with deep regret that I have to report 
the occurrence of a fatality at our Novo 
underground mine on 13 April 2017, as  
well as a lamentable increase in Lost  
Time Incidents Frequency Rate (LTIFR)  
to 4.88 in 2017 compared to 2.30 in 2016. 
A thorough review of the circumstances 
surrounding the fatality has been carried 
out, as well as a comprehensive review of 
our health and safety system, implemented 
by a new, highly-qualified HSE team. 
Among the results of this effort is a new 
set of cardinal rules of safety behaviour  
at each of our production sites (more 
details on this programme in the 
Operational Review). 
I would now like to take this opportunity, 
on behalf of the Board, to thank all of  
our employees for the hard work and 
commitment that was integral to all  
that has been achieved in our 
Anniversary Year.

Strategic Report 
CEO’s Report
Denis Alexandrov
It is gratifying to report that the 
extensive exploration and development 
activity undertaken by Highland Gold 
during 2016 and 2017 has been rewarded 
with a material 56% increase in your 
Company’s ore reserves (proven and 
probable) to 5.1 Moz of gold and gold 
equivalent as at 31 December 2017 
compared with 3.3 Moz at year-end 2016. 
This JORC-compliant reserve estimation 
as at 31 December 2017 was accompanied 
by notification of a similarly compliant 
6.6% increase in the Company’s mineral 
resources (measured, indicated and 
inferred) from 16.1 Moz of gold and gold 
equivalent to 17.2 Moz on a year-on-year 
basis. At the same time, the average 
grade of ore reserves was lowered from 
8.0 g/t at year-end 2016 to 3.3 g/t at 
year-end 2017 due to lower cut-off grades 
and increased ore tonnage at our Novo 
and Belaya Gora operations, and the 
inclusion of the Blagodatnoye deposit. 
Last year, I emphasised the importance 
we attached to our Khabarovsk, Baikal 
and Chukotka ‘cluster’ initiative in order 
to drive overall development by focusing 
our activities in key geographic regions 
and maximising synergies. 
The potential benefits of this approach 
are well illustrated by recent developments 
at Belaya Gora (Khabarovsk cluster) 
where our Preliminary Feasibility Study 
(PFS) –largely compiled in 2017 and 
published post the financial year-end – 
envisages an integrated Belaya Gora/
Blagodatnoye operation with combined 
gold reserves of 932,000 oz: more than 
triple Belaya Gora’s 291,000 oz recorded 
at the outset of 2017. Grade was reduced 
to 1.44 g/t versus 3.3 g/t for Belaya Gora 
alone. Average annual gold production  
is estimated at 55,000 oz, with the life  
of the combined mine forecast to extend  
Stable 
production
to 2032 and estimated average TCC  
of US$802.
Operations at Belaya Gora, in advance  
of the PFS, focused on the processing 
of low grade stockpiles following a 
regulatory decision to reduce the mine’s 
cut-off grade from 0.7 g/t to 0.3 g/t. 
Overall output recorded a relatively 
modest year-on-year decline from 
45,000 oz to 43,000 oz.
An updated JORC reserve statement in 
respect of MNV, our longstanding mine 
which is also located in the Khabarovsk 
region, was completed and published  
in May 2017. This confirmed a doubling  
of ore reserves to 500,000 oz Au  
(as of 31 December 2016) which,  
in turn, underwrote a life-of-mine 
extension to at least 2022. 
We are intent on extending MNV’s 
productive life beyond this date and, to 
this end, we have budgeted for an annual 
US$3 million – US$5 million exploration 
spend. Near-mine exploration activity is 
ongoing and initial exploratory work has 
commenced in relation to our two new 
greenfield site licences – Zamanchivaya 
(4.2 sq km) and Kulibinskaya (38 sq km) 
– which are directly adjacent to MNV.  
A solid performance from MNV 
throughout 2017 resulted in a 6.6% 
increase in gold and gold equivalent 
production to 102,000 oz.
Novo fully maintained its status as our 
lowest cost, highest margin producer  
by way of a 7.7% increase in the production 
of gold and gold equivalent to 126,000 
oz in 2017 compared with 117,000 oz  
in 2016. 
A JORC reserve audit completed at 
Novo in November 2017 brought a 430% 
increase in ore tonnage. Ore reserves 
rose from the previously estimated 1.1 
Moz of gold equivalent to 1.9 Moz (as of 
31 December 2016) at an average grade 
of 3.3 g/t compared with the previously 
reported 9.8 g/t. 
The planned expansion of Novo’s  
mining and milling capacity to 1.3 Mtpa  
is designed to compensate for the  
lower grades and the first stage of  
the development, involving a series  
of upgrades to the mining system,  
is scheduled for completion by  
year-end 2018.  Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

STRATEGIC REPORT
The second stage, focused on the 
processing plant, is in the design phase. 
We continued to pursue our strategy  
of balancing a stable rate of production 
with the progression of our development 
and exploration projects, with the cash 
flow from the former integral to the 
funding of the latter. Output recorded  
a 4.3% increase to a record 272,274 oz  
of gold and gold equivalent and our 
guideline for the current financial year  
is a comparable outcome of between 
265,000 – 275,000 oz.
Our principal development project is 
Kekura, a world class deposit located  
in the remote Chukotka region in the  
Far East of Russia. Government approval 
for the development of a deposit  
of ‘federal significance’ (a standard 
regulatory requirement for an operation 
of this scale) was duly received in 2017. 
Exploration activity included 11,000 metres 
of reverse circulation drilling and 4,750 
metres of core drilling for the purpose  
of reserve confirmation, while work 
commenced on a state-funded power 
line to connect Kekura to the regional 
electrical grid. 
The Definitive Feasibility Study for 
Kekura was completed in early 2018  
and anticipates: 
• An estimated start date of 2021; 
• Sequential and combined open-pit 
and underground extraction with a 
total mine life of 16 years (twice the 
original expectation);
• Processing plant capacity of 800,000 
tpa with an 85% recovery rate;
• Capex of US$229 million (pre-
commissioning/excluding underground 
operations);
• Average annual gold production of 
172,000 oz for the first eight years  
and 46,000 oz thereafter; and
• Average Total Cash Costs of US$511 
per oz and All-In Sustaining Cash 
Costs of US$541 per oz. 
Kekura’s Au resources (measured, 
indicated and inferred) are currently 
estimated at 2.46 Moz commanding  
an average grade of 8.1 g/t, while Au 
reserves (proven and probable) total 
2.00 Moz with an average grade of 7.0 
g/t. Preliminary construction is underway 
with the bulk of such work scheduled to 
take place in 2019 – 2020. 
Additional R&D studies at Klen, involving 
external consultants, indicated the 
potential for higher than anticipated 
recoveries of more than 90% and lower 
than forecast operating costs. Such 
findings will be incorporated in the 
updated PFS which is expected to be 
completed in the near future. Meanwhile, 
additional exploration is to be undertaken 
in order to delineate any additional 
potential resources. 
In Kyrgyzstan, our fourth region,  
the Scoping Study for Unkurtash, 
published in Q1 2017, envisaged:
• Two open pits and an 18-year LoM;
• Processing plant throughput of 4 
Mtpa with an 80% plus recovery rate;
• Annual production of 133,000 oz of 
gold at an average operating cost  
of US$616 per oz; and 
• A Capex requirement of US$322 
million to commence production. 
Your Board continues to consider 
prospective partnerships to develop the 
Unkurtash resource and preliminary talks 
have been held with certain parties. 
In conclusion, I have every confidence 
that the quality of assets outlined above 
and the strategies that management is 
deploying to capitalise on such assets, 
augur well for the Company’s medium 
term growth prospects. 
You can find more details in the 
Operational Review which includes  
a detailed analysis of 2017’s activities 
including those associated with the 
health and safety of employees and  
the protection of the environment.

STRATEGIC REPORT
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
KHABAROVSK REGION, RUSSIA
Mnogovershinnoye (MNV)
Production of gold and gold equivalent 
at MNV achieved a 6.6% increase from 
96,188 oz to 102,502 oz in 2017, thereby 
accounting for a fully maintained 38% 
share of total production. The average 
grade registered an 8% improvement 
from 2.36 g/t to 2.55 g/t year-on-year 
(reflecting a higher proportion of 
underground ore) while the recovery  
rate was effectively unchanged at  
91.4% (2016: 91.5%).
Completion and publication of an 
updated JORC reserve statement  
in May revealed a doubling of MNV’s  
ore reserves to 500,000 oz Au, a 
development that saw the life-of-mine 
(LoM) extended by four years to at  
least 2022. Management is intent on 
continuing operations beyond this date 
and a near-mine exploration programme 
– actively progressed in 2016 and 2017 
– is ongoing. The Company aims to 
continue budgeting US$3 – 5 million  
per year to support this effort.
May also witnessed the receipt of 
licences in respect of two greenfield sites 
adjacent to MNV, namely Zamanchivaya 
(4.2 sq km located to the north east of 
the mine) and Kulibinskaya (38 sq km 
located to the south west of the mine).
The re-evaluation of MNV’s historic  
waste dumps continued throughout  
2017, an exercise that has added a total 
of 1.07 million tonnes of ore (with grades 
of approximately 1.1 g/t Au) since the 
programme commenced in 2016.
PRODUCTION COSTS
Total cash costs amounted to US$617  
per oz (2016: US$607 per oz) while all-in 
sustaining costs were US$741 per oz 
(2016: US$765 per oz).
CAPITAL COSTS
A total of US$12.8 million was invested  
at MNV in 2017. This included capitalised 
expenditures and construction (US$5.5 
million), purchase of equipment (US$6.6 
million) and exploration (US$0.7 million).
OUTLOOK
The extensive near-mine exploration 
activity seen during 2017 will continue in 
2018 with a view to identifying sufficient 
resources to facilitate a further extension 
of LoM. Such activity will prioritise areas 
in the vicinity of previously mined  
ore bodies including the Intermediate 
and Deep ore bodies and the Burlivy 
zone, while also encompassing the new 
greenfield sites – Zamanchivaya and 
Kulibinskaya – where geochemical 
prospecting work was carried out  
in 2017 in preparation for 2018’s 
exploration programme.
Appraisal of the waste stockpiles – a 
potentially significant source of additional 
resource – will also continue in 2018.
Against this background, an updated 
JORC-compliant reserve estimate is 
scheduled for completion in Q3 2018.
Belaya Gora
Operations at Belaya Gora focused on 
processing low-grade ore stockpiles during 
2017 in advance of the Pre-Feasibility Study 
involving a joint mining schedule with the 
nearby Blagodatnoye deposit.
A lowering of the cut-off grade from 0.7 
g/t to 0.3 g/t was reflected in a year-on-
year reduction in mined ore grade from 
1.23 g/t to 0.77 g/t. The recovery rate 
improved to 72.5% (2016: 71.4%) and 
the decline in overall production was 
limited to 6% at 43,166 oz of gold and 
gold equivalent.
An exploratory drilling programme 
focused on the deep horizons of the 
north-western flank of the Belaya Gora 
licence area was completed in Q4 2017, 
an exercise which saw 111 diamond holes, 
totalling 12,686 metres, drilled over the 
course of the year. In addition, Stage 1 
exploration drilling was completed  
at the Kolchansky area within the 
broader Belaya Gora Flanks licence.  
The drilling programme, as at the 
year-end, encompassed 702 metres over 
14 holes and has continued into 2018.
PRODUCTION COSTS
Total cash costs amounted to US$861 
per oz (2016: US$678 per oz) while all-in 
sustaining costs were US$1,029 per oz 
(2016: US$1,134 per oz).
CAPITAL COSTS
A total of US$3.8 million was invested  
at Belaya Gora in 2017. This included 
capitalised expenditures and construction 
(US$3.4 million) and purchase of 
equipment (US$0.4 million).
OUTLOOK
The pointers to the future lie in the 
Pre-Feasibility Study, announced  
early in 2018. Features include:
• More than tripled gold reserves  
of 932,000 oz (encompassing 
Blagodatnoye and a 60% increase in 
Belaya Gora ore) versus Belaya Gora’s 
previously reported 291,000 oz;
• Upgrades to the processing plant 
(including the addition of a carbon- 
in-pulp (CIP) circuit) designed to 
improve recoveries from 72% to 
86-91% for Belaya Gora ore and  
90% for Blagodatnoye ore;
• New open-pit mining plans  
which envisage the processing of 
Blagodatnoye ore at the Belaya Gora 
mill and a combined LoM extending 
to 2032;
• Capex estimated at US$15 million in 
respect of the plant upgrade and US$21 
million to transfer mining activity from 
Belaya Gora to Blagodatnoye in 2023; 
and
• Estimated annual production of 55,000 
oz Au over LoM at an average Total 
Cash Cost of US$802 per oz and All-In 
Sustaining costs of US$848 per oz.
Blagodatnoye
The year under review witnessed the 
processing of extensive exploration work 
carried out in 2016 and the completion of 
an additional drilling programme totalling 
2,400 metres.
CAPITAL COSTS
A total of US$1.1 million was invested at 
Blagodatnoye in 2017 and represented  
a capitalised exploration and evaluation 
asset. 
1
OUTLOOK
The Blagodatnoye deposit is the subject 
of a prospective amalgamation with 
Belaya Gora’s mining and processing 
operations. The new mining plan was 
outlined in Belaya Gora’s Pre-Feasibility 
Study, announced early in 2018 and 
highlighted above.

ZABAIKALSKY REGION, RUSSIA
Novoshirokinskoye (Novo)
Production of gold and gold equivalent at 
Novo recorded a 7.7% increase from 2016’s 
117,577 oz to 126,606 oz in 2017 representing 
46.5% (2016: 45%) of total output.
Ore mined registered a 12.7% increase to 
858,106 tonnes on a year-on-year basis, 
while ore processed during 2017 advanced 
9% to 825,819 tonnes versus 2016.
Average grade was effectively unchanged 
at 5.61 g/t (2016: 5.62 g/t) as was the 
recovery rate at 85.0% (2016: 85.9%).
Completion of an updated JORC reserve 
audit in November 2017 saw ore reserves 
advance from the previously estimated  
1.1 Moz to 1.9 Moz Au Eq., as of 31 December 
2016, with an average grade of 3.3 g/t 
compared with the previously reported  
9.8 g/t and the aforementioned 5.61 g/t  
in respect of 2017. The lower grade reflects 
a reduction in the cut-off grade and a 
substantial increase in ore volume.
Work continued on the expansion  
of Novo’s ore mining and processing 
capacity from 700,000 tpa to 1.3 mtpa. 
In line with this a comprehensive survey 
of the hoist, headframe, crusher and 
main fan unit buildings was conducted.
PRODUCTION COSTS
Total cash costs amounted to US$291  
per oz (2016: US$254 per oz) while all-in 
sustaining costs were US$342 per oz 
(2016: US$274 per oz). 
1
CAPITAL COSTS
A total of US$13.5 million was invested  
at Novo in 2017. This included capitalised 
expenditures and construction (US$9.7 
million) and purchase of equipment 
(US$3.8 million).
OUTLOOK
The expansion of Novo’s capacity – 
designed to compensate for the expected 
lower ore grades – is scheduled for 
completion in 2020.
Design documentation for the project 
has been split into two stages:
Stage 1, which has already been filed  
with the Russian State Expert Board for 
approval, encompasses construction and 
installation work including the main fan unit 
building, the skip shaft and dosing complex, 
and run-off water treatment facilities.
Stage 2 encompasses facilities in relation 
to the processing plant and the tailings 
dam. The Company is also reviewing the 
potential for the utilisation of dense 
media separation (DMS) or X-ray 
separation to reduce capital costs 
associated with Stage 2 mill expansion.
Baley Ore Cluster (Taseevskoye, Sredny 
Golgotay and ZIF-1)
The primary objective at Taseevskoye, 
the largest of the Baley Hub projects,  
is a ‘de-risking’ of the site (by way of 
pumping water out of the Taseevskoye 
open-pit and monitoring any inflow of 
water from the neighbouring Baley pit) 
in preparation for exploration activity 
designed to verify reserves.
Some 4.3 million cubic metres of water 
were pumped from the Taseevskoye pit 
during H2 2016 and H1 2017, thereby 
resulting in a 10.05 metre decrease in  
the water level. No water inflow was 
observed from the Baley pit.
Pumping is currently on hold, due to the 
fact that the ZIF-2 tailings pond, which 
receives the water, is full.
In November, Giprotsvetmet, the mining 
and metallurgy research and design 
institute (Moscow), issued a trade-off 
study of various options available for 
additional storage and/or treatment  
of water pumped from the pit. Such 
options are currently under consideration. 
Funding was approved, in Q3 2017, for the 
commencement of design work on a heap 
leach operation at the ZIF-1 Tailings licence, 
containing approximately 300,000 oz Au. 
A technological flowsheet, drafted by 
engineering consultants Irgiredmet, 
anticipates annual throughput of up to 
840,000 tonnes of ore. The Company  
has selected Geotechproekt LLC 
(Ekaterinburg) as contractor responsible 
for all design work associated with the 
project. Engineering studies were initiated 
in October and technical solutions are 
under development.
CAPITAL COSTS
A total of US$2.8 million was invested  
at the Baley area licences in 2017.
CHUKOTKA AUTONOMOUS 
DISTRICT, RUSSIA
Kekura
Work on the final sections of the Kekura 
Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS), including 
mine design, technical solutions, a financial 
model and estimates for capital and 
operating expenditures, was concluded 
during Q4 2017 prior to publication in 
early 2018. This, in turn, was accompanied 
by a JORC-compliant resource update 
which included data drawn from the 
2016-17 drilling programme.
Work was also completed on the design 
documentation for Kekura’s fuel storage 
facilities in preparation for construction 
in 2018. In the wake of an in-house review 
an application to the State Expert Board 
for approval is scheduled for submission 
in H1 2018.
The government project for construction 
of the Bilibino-Kekura-Peschanka-
Omsukchan power line, which will bring 
the regional electricity grid to Kekura, 
also made headway during Q4 2017. 
Meanwhile, State Expert Board approval 
was received for the planned 110/6 kV 
Kekura substation, with construction 
permits duly applied for.
Equipment for the substation was 
delivered to the Chukotka port of  
Pevek by Rostek JSC, under a supply 
and installation contract, and will be 
transported to the Kekura site in March 
2018 when weather conditions become 
suitable. Construction work is scheduled 
to begin in May 2018.
Klen
Further R&D studies, designed to 
confirm engineering parameters and 
mitigate project risks for incorporation 
into the PFS currently under development, 
continued to be carried out by consultants 
SGS Vostok during Q4 2017. Such research 
yielded positive results, indicating the 
potential to improve Au recovery to 
90.82% and reduce operating expenses 
and class V hazard for tailings.
A tender was held to select a contractor 
to carry out an additional exploration 
programme at Klen and work began 
in Q1 2018.

KYRGYZSTAN
Unkurtash
A scoping study was completed and 
published in March 2017 which envisages:
• Two open-pits and an 18-year LoM;
• Processing plant utilisation of gravity 
concentration and gravity tailings 
CIL with an annual throughput of 
4 million tonnes and recoveries of 
more than 80%;
• Annual production of 133,000 oz Au 
at an average operating cost of 
US$616 per oz; and
• Total Capex to commence production 
of US$322 million.
Management continues to consider 
partnership opportunities to develop 
this significant resource and preliminary 
discussions have been held with potential 
partners.
HEALTH, SAFETY  
AND ENVIRONMENT
The health and safety of our employees 
is paramount and Highland Gold’s 
endeavours to minimise risk and 
maximise protection are focused on:
• Safe working conditions;
• The management of operational risks;
• Across-the-board training; and
• Constant emphasis on the need for 
employees to develop a sense of 
accountability for their safety and  
the safety of others.
To these ends, senior staff from the 
Company’s Moscow management office 
(42 managers), Novo (212 managers) and 
MNV (394 managers) attended courses 
entitled ‘Conscious Safety Management’ 
during Q4 2017. Employees at Novo (100 
participants) and MNV (254 participants), 
also attended a training course on 
‘Internal Accident Investigation’, and 
eight staff from Moscow participated  
in a ‘Defensive Driving’ course.
In 2017, the Health & Safety team 
developed and introduced several 
updated corporate standards including: 
‘Labour Safety Management System’, 
‘Internal Accidents Investigation’, 
‘Behavioural Safety Audits’, ‘Labour 
Safety Committee’, ‘Cardinal Rules of 
Safe Behaviour’ and ‘Best Practices’. 
Tools compliant with these standards 
were introduced at each of the 
Company’s operating mines.
Audits of occupational safety 
management systems were conducted at 
each operating subsidiary in November 
2017, the results of which will be used as 
benchmarks in 2018.
November also saw the Company 
introduce a new Transportation Safety 
programme and implement transport 
audits to facilitate the drafting of 
improved transportation safety policies.
We are deeply saddened to record  
that, despite our endeavours, a fatality 
occurred at Novo’s underground mine  
on 13 April, 2017, as reported in the 
Company’s Q1 Report on 27 April, 2017.
The Lost Time Incidents Frequency Rate 
(LTIFR) totalled 4.88 in respect of 2017 
compared with 2.30 in 2016. The number 
of incidents across the Group totalled 26 
over the course of the year involving the 
aforementioned fatality and 13 incidents 
at Novo, five such incidents at Belaya 
Gora and seven at MNV. This compares 
with one fatality and 13 incidents in 2016. 
The scale of increase is, in part, due to 
more stringent reporting requirements  
in relation to minor incidents.
During the year a total of 1,582 employees 
attended safety induction and fire & 
electrical safety induction (one-day) 
courses, while 235 managers and 
specialists underwent self-training and 
testing safety courses utilising OlimpOKS 
software and were certified on industrial 
safety (7 – 30 day programmes).
As in the past, auxiliary rescue teams  
at each of the Company’s mines have  
been kept ‘at the ready’ to respond to  
any emergency.
The Company diligently observes 
environmental and regulatory 
requirements and actively seeks to 
identify, analyse and mitigate any risks 
from operations that might impact  
the environment.
Approximately 1,800 employees 
underwent environmental training 
programmes during 2017, while 418 
employees participated in class I-IV 
hazard waste treatment training with 
subsequent testing under the OlimpOKS 
system. A further 75 managers and 
specialists attended a two-day course to 
familiarise themselves with the new ISO 
14001-2015 standard for environmental 
management systems.
An environmental management system 
certification audit at the Moscow  
office and at MNV, carried out by risk 
management specialists DNV, confirmed 
compliance with the requirements of  
the new ISO 14001-2015 standard. The 
absence of any significant discrepancies 
points to the efficacy of the environmental 
management systems in place. Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Strategic Report 
CFO’s Report
Alla Baranovskaya
“ Highland Gold retained its position among the world’s 
lowest-cost gold producers during the year.”
Trading conditions on the global metal 
market during the year to 31 December 
2017 were, for the most part, favourable. 
Despite price fluctuations between 
US$1,146 per oz and US$1,358 per oz 
over the course of the year, the average 
London Bullion Market Association 
(LBMA) gold price was US$1,257,  
an increase of 0.5% versus 2016. The 
prices of lead and zinc traded at their 
highest levels for three years. Meanwhile, 
the strength of the Russian rouble, 
influenced by rising oil prices, impacted 
negatively on financial indicators and 
exerted upward pressure on costs.
In 2017, Highland Gold increased sales 
volume, retained its status as one of  
the world’s lowest-cost gold producers 
and maintained a strong cash position. 
This enabled the Company to deliver  
a competitive dividend distribution for  
the fifth consecutive year.
Total revenue increased by 3.5% to 
US$316.7 million, primarily driven by  
the higher volume of realised gold and 
gold equivalents. Revenues from sales  
of precious metals and concentrates 
totalled US$185.8 million and US$130.5 
million respectively. During the reporting 
period, the Company sold 270,380 oz of 
gold and gold equivalent, representing a 
1.1% volume increase versus 2016. Novo’s 
contribution, accounting for 46.0% of  
the total, was effectively unchanged.  
A modest decrease of 0.4% in Novo  
sales was related to the reserving of a 
consignment of zinc concentrate under  
a new export agreement. MNV increased 
its sales volume by 5.3% to 102,015 oz 
representing a 37.7% share. Belaya  
Gora accounted for a 16.2% share in  
the wake of a 3.4% decline in sales 
volume to 43,885 oz (2016: 45,411 oz) 
due to processing lower grade ore  
from stockpiles.
Low cost, 
high margin
During 2017, the Company continued  
to pursue a ‘no hedge’ policy. The 
Company’s average realised price of gold 
and gold equivalent increased by 2.3% to 
US$1,162 per oz compared with US$1,136 
per oz in 2016. The average realised price 
of gold in respect of MNV and Belaya 
Gora (net of commission) was US$1,259 
per oz, which corresponded with the 
average market price. The higher prices 
for lead and zinc raised the average price 
of gold equivalent realised by Novo to 
US$1,048 
1
 per eq. oz against US$1,008 
per eq. oz in 2016 (+4.0% y-o-y).
The Company’s cost of sales net of 
depreciation increased by 12.8% to 
US$139.6 million (2016: US$123.8 million). 
The negative effect of the strengthening 
Russian rouble was heightened by an 
increase in energy prices (+6% in RUR 
y-o-y) and the impact of overall inflation 
(2.5%). Depreciation amounted to 
US$49.5 million, down 17.8% y-o-y, 
largely reflecting the life-of-mine 
extensions at all operational assets.
Management’s efforts to maximise 
operating efficiencies and reduce costs 
across the board led to a decrease in 
consumption, lower expenses for repairs, 
and reduced maintenance costs for 
infrastructure and sites. This, in turn, 
enabled the Company to offset rising 
rouble-denominated costs and charges 
including labour, energy and taxes. The 
decline in Belaya Gora’s mining activity and 
the lowering of the cut-off grade to 0.3 g/t, 
in line with the authorities’ requirement, 
resulted in a significant reduction in change 
in work in progress. Stripping volume 
started to be classified as poor ore and  
is subject to impairment testing.
Total cash costs 
2
 (TCC) increased by 
11.7% to US$507 per oz, comfortably 
below the industry average. A 
breakdown by operating unit shows  
a 14.8% increase in total cash costs  
at our lowest-cost producer Novo to 
US$291 per eq. oz, reflecting the negative 
currency effect and an increased share 
of mining from lower horizons. MNV,  
our oldest mine, succeeded in holding 
total cash costs at US$617 per oz (2016: 
US$607 per oz), assisted by an increase 
in sales volume. Belaya Gora’s total cash 
costs advanced from US$678 per oz to 
US$861 per oz, a reflection of processing 
lower-grade stockpile ore.
All-in sustaining costs 
3
 (AISC) registered 
only a marginal increase from US$652 
per oz in 2016 to US$664 per oz in 2017. Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

1. Novo’s average price is based on the spot price for metals contained in the concentrates (gold, lead, zinc and silver), net of fixed processing and refining 
costs at third-party plants.
2. Total cash costs include mine site operating costs such as mining, processing, administration, royalties and production taxes but are exclusive of depreciation, 
depletion and amortisation, capital and exploration costs. Total cash costs are then divided by ounces sold to arrive at the total cash costs of sales. This data 
provides additional information and is a non-GAAP measure.
3. In line with guidance issued by the World Gold Council, the formula used to define the all-in sustaining cash costs measurement commences with total 
cash costs per ounce sold and then adds sustaining capital expenditures, corporate general and administrative costs, mine site exploration and evaluation 
costs and environmental rehabilitation costs. This data seeks to represent the total costs of producing gold from current operations and therefore it does 
not include capital expenditures attributable to projects or mine expansions, exploration and evaluation costs attributable to growth projects, income tax 
payments, interest costs or dividend payments.
4. EBITDA margin is defined as EBITDA divided by total revenue.
Higher administrative expenses, 
reflecting the strength of the rouble, 
were compensated by a 20% reduction 
in sustaining CAPEX at BG and MNV 
together with a decrease in BG’s poor 
ore provision.
Higher average realised prices and 
largely maintained AISC delivered  
strong headroom of US$499 per ounce, 
effectively underwriting the Company’s 
development projects and dividend 
distribution.
In 2017, the Company’s EBITDA 
decreased by 4.4% to US$155.3 million 
(2016: US$162.5 million). In line with this, 
the EBITDA margin 
4
 dipped from 53.1% 
to 49.0%: a ratio which underlines 
Highland’s status as one of the world’s 
most efficient gold producers.
The Company’s management analysed 
internal and external indicators of 
impairment as of 31 December 2017.  
No impairment loss was recognised in 
2017. In 2016, the Company recognised 
impairment loss in respect of BG 
amounting to US$22.8 million. Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

In 2017, the Company recognised a net 
finance cost of US$2.5 million compared 
with US$5.0 million in 2016. The principal 
components were the interest expense 
on bank loans in the amount of US$0.8 
million in 2017 (2016: US$2.2 million) and 
accretion expense on site restoration 
provision in the amount of US$1.6 million 
in 2017 (2016: US$1.7 million).
A foreign exchange gain of US$0.7 
million (2016: gain of US$1.9 million) 
resulted from the settlement of  
foreign currency transactions and the 
retranslation of monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in Russian roubles 
into US Dollars.
Income tax charges almost doubled to 
US$34.5 million in 2017 compared with 
US$18.3 million in 2016. The increase 
resulted from a substantial US$14.9 
million reduction in released deferred  
tax, largely as a result of future tax 
revaluation because of the rouble’s 
appreciation at the end of the year.
Current tax expenses totalled US$33.3 
million (Novo: US$19.4 million, MNV: 
US$13.1 million, BG: US$0.4 million  
and RDM: US$0.4 million) while  
dividend withholding tax amounted  
to US$7.7 million.
Net profit, benefiting from the growth  
in revenue, cost controls and zero 
impairment losses, rose 37% from 2016’s 
US$47.9 million to US$65.9 million. 
Consequentially, earnings per share 
advanced from US$0.145 in 2016 to 
US$0.201 for the year to 31 December 2017.
The Company’s cash inflow from 
operating activities registered a 6.0% 
decrease to US$131.0 million reflecting 
higher income taxes (US$2.9 million)  
and lower EBITDA. Capital expenditure 
for the reporting period amounted to 
US$58.3 million versus US$59.3 million in 
respect of 2016. This primarily related to 
near-mine exploration at MNV, designed 
to further extend the LoM, the expansion 
of Novo’s processing capacity and the 
progression of the Kekura project. 
Specific capital expenditures included 
US$12.8 million at MNV, US$13.5 million 
at Novo, US$3.8 million at Belaya Gora, 
US$22.4 million at Kekura and US$5.8 
million in relation to other exploration 
and development projects. Capital 
expenditures were entirely funded  
by operating cash flow.
The Company’s total debt is denominated 
in USD. The debt in relation to facility 
agreements with banks showed a 
decrease of 2.0% to US$207.4 million  
as of 31 December 2017 (2016: US$211.6 
million) accompanied by a 24.3% 
reduction in the effective annual interest 
rate to 3.4% (2016: 4.5%), despite rising 
LIBOR. To mitigate the latter’s negative 
effect on the cost of debt, management 
continued to switch from floating to fixed 
interest rates, thereby increasing the 
overall proportion of fixed-rate liabilities 
to 65% compared with 47% as of end 
December 2016.
At the end of the reporting period,  
cash and cash equivalents amounted to 
US$12.4 million compared with US$8.7 
million as of 31 December 2016. The 
Company’s net debt position, including 
lease liabilities, was US$198.3 million as  
of 31 December 2017, compared with 
US$205.5 million as of 31 December 2016.
The ratio of net debt to EBITDA was 1.28 
as at the end of 2017 which is well within 
the Board of Directors’ debt policy.
Taking into account the growth in 
earnings per share and the strength of 
the balance sheet, the Board is pleased 
to recommend a second interim dividend 
of GBP 0.0542 per share.

PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS
The final dividend for the year ending 
31 December 2016 in the amount of 
US$22.6 million was paid on 12 May 2017. 
The Group paid an interim dividend  
of GBP 0.0498 per share in respect of  
H1 2017 (2016: interim dividend of GBP 
0.050 per share) which resulted in an 
aggregate interim dividend payment of 
US$21.3 million (2016: US$19.8 million). 
The interim dividend was paid on 
3 October 2017. 
The Board has recommended a second 
interim dividend of GBP 0.0542 per 
share which, taking into account the 
interim dividend paid in October 2017, 
gives a total dividend of GBP 0.104 per 
share for the year 2017 (2016: GBP 0.104 
per share). The total payout exceeds  
the minimum amount prescribed in the 
Company’s dividend policy, reflecting  
the availability of additional funds for 
disbursement to shareholders.
The dividend will be paid on 25 May  
2018 to shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 27 April 2018 
(the record date). The ex-dividend date 
will be 26 April 2018.
The Company offers an option for 
shareholders to elect to receive their 
dividends in US dollars. Payments for 
dividends in US dollars will be fixed at  
an exchange rate of 1.4329 GBP/US$,  
or US$0.0777 per share. To receive 
payment in US dollars, shareholders 
should complete and file the Currency 
Election Form no later than the record 
date (Election Deadline), 27 April 2018. 
The form and instructions for filing it are 
available on the Highland Gold website

The Group is exposed to a number of 
risks and uncertainties which, in most 
cases, are relevant to the entire gold 
mining industry. These risks and 
uncertainties could cause actual results 
to differ materially from expected or 
historical results. The main challenge  
is to manage them effectively. The Group 
recognises that dealing with risks is an 
integral part of managing its operations 
and is fundamental to the Group’s 
business success.
The Group’s risk management system  
is designed to provide a consistent  
and clear framework for managing  
and reporting the most significant 
operational risks to the Board of 
Directors. The Board is responsible  
for maintaining the Group’s risk 
management system, defining risk 
appetite, and monitoring the most 
significant risks. 
The Audit Committee supports the 
Board of Directors in monitoring the 
Group’s risk exposures and is responsible 
for reviewing the effectiveness of the  
risk management system. The risk 
register is presented to the Audit 
Committee following periodic updates  
by the executive management. The risk 
register and framework utilises the 
Group’s risk matrix and universal risk 
prioritisation and rating scale, which 
grade and prioritise perceived and 
known risks based on the probability  
of the adverse event occurring and scale 
of consequences from a risk occurrence. 
The risk register defines a responsible 
body or individuals who are charged with 
monitoring, managing and mitigating 
these risks.
Executive management performs  
the risk identification, assessment and 
mitigation throughout various areas  
of the Group’s business, ranging from 
detailed assessment of environmental 
risk at the operational level of each mine, 
to the monitoring of delivery risks with 
respect to each major capital project and 
the assessment and mitigation of risks at 
executive management and Board levels 
through the internal control system  
and specific risk management actions.  
At an operational level, all mines identify, 
prioritise and directly engage stakeholder 
groups that have the potential to affect 
their operational, sustainability or 
financial performance.
The Group’s principal risks are set  
out below and, for the most part, are 
typical of the risks associated with other 
companies in the gold mining industry. 
We consider that, in general, the Group 
was affected by the same risks as in prior 
periods, although the precise implications 
of certain risks may have changed 
together with our remedial actions. 
The Group takes into account known 
risks but there may be additional risks 
unknown to the Group and other risks, 
currently believed to be immaterial, 
which could develop into material risks. 
Therefore, the Group’s risks listed below 
do not represent a complete register  
of the risks and uncertainties. 
Strategic Report 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties 
Risk Risk description Mitigation Movement
MARKET AND FINANCIAL RISKS
COMMODITY  
PRICES
The Group’s product prices are subject to 
international supply and demand and can  
be volatile.
A significant and/or prolonged fall in the 
commodity prices of the metals produced  
by the Group (primarily Au and to a lesser 
extent Pb, Zn and Ag) could have an adverse 
impact on sales and profits. The Group did 
not utilise hedging in 2017 and prior periods 
and price fluctuations had an effect on the 
Group’s profits.
The capability to invest in growth projects  
is limited during periods of low commodity 
prices – which may, in turn, affect future 
performance. Furthermore, the financial 
viability of the Group’s exploration, 
development projects and production 
operations is sensitive to price levels and may 
become questionable in an environment of 
decreasing prices. Management may have to 
reassess the economic model and recognise 
impairment losses.
The Group constantly monitors price trends 
and forecasts, maintains a cost-cutting 
programme, checks the viability of exploration 
and development projects based on the 
current and projected price levels and,  
if necessary, revises specific investment  
plans and schedules.  Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

STRATEGIC REPORT
Risk Risk description Mitigation Movement
FINANCIAL  
RISKS 
Adverse economic conditions or uncertainties that affect global and Russian financial 
markets can give rise to risks which may negatively impact the Group’s operations  
and results.
Please refer to Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details explaining 
the implications and management of financial risks.
CURRENCY  
RISK
Adverse fluctuations in Russian rouble/USD 
and GBP/USD exchange rates. The Group 
collects the majority of revenues in US Dollars 
and also obtains financing in US Dollars.  
The majority of costs are linked to US Dollars 
although a significant proportion is incurred 
in Russian roubles.
The Group uses natural hedging and matches 
revenue and debt denominated in US Dollars, 
and reviews other possible ways to hedge 
exchange rate fluctuations if appropriate.  
The Group did not use currency hedges in 
2017 and 2016 nor in prior periods.
CREDIT RISKS Risk of loss related to a counterparty’s failure 
to perform its contractual obligations or 
transactions in a certain time frame and,  
as a result, certain financial assets (including 
assets with high liquidity) may be impaired.
The Group places cash in reputable and highly 
rated financial institutions and constantly 
monitors the financial/economic situation.
The Group sells commodities to creditworthy 
and reliable customers.
INTEREST  
RATE RISK
Interest rates are affected by geopolitical  
and macroeconomic events. An increase  
in interest rates may adversely affect the 
Group’s financial results and its ability  
to demonstrate the economic viability  
of certain assets.
The majority of the Group’s loans and 
borrowings have fixed rates at the date  
of debt drawdown.
LIQUIDITY  
RISK
Failure to accurately forecast, manage or 
maintain sufficient liquidity and credit could 
impact our ability to operate and result in 
financial loss.
An event such as a significant operational 
incident or geopolitical events may potentially 
increase financing costs and limit access  
to financing that could put pressure on the 
Group’s liquidity.
The Group uses a short-term, medium-term 
cash planning system and long-term cash 
flow forecasts are prepared in line with 
strategic planning.
The Group’s centralised treasury function 
ensures that there is sufficient liquidity  
for day-to-day operations at each location  
and reviews the need to attract additional 
external financing. Opportunities to secure 
loans at appropriate rates are constantly 
monitored by the Group.

OPERATING RISKS
RISKS 
ASSOCIATED 
WITH 
EXPLORATION 
ACTIVITIES 
The Group’s estimates of ore reserves and 
mineral resources are subject to a number  
of assumptions and approximations, 
including geological, metallurgical and 
technical factors, future commodity prices 
and production costs. Fluctuations in any  
of these variables could result in lower  
than expected revenues, higher costs  
and lower operating profits and could  
lead to reductions in estimated reserves  
and resources. 
The Group makes significant investments  
in exploration activities performed at 
greenfield sites to develop the business  
and at brownfield sites to extend the 
life-of-mines.
For various reasons, including geological  
and economic factors, such activities may 
prove unsuccessful and may not result in  
an increase in Group resources. The failure  
to discover new resources could adversely 
affect the Group’s future performance.
The Group conducts detailed exploration and 
assesses results in accordance with widely 
recognised methods of resources/reserves 
evaluation. 
The Group engages internationally 
recognised external consultants to confirm its 
resources and reserves estimates (information 
regarding the Group’s mineral resources and 
reserves, reported in accordance with JORC, 
is presented on pages 76 and 77). 
The Board reviews exploration projects on  
a regular basis and approves all exploration 
activities and costs based on indicative 
economic probabilities.
A review of the Group’s exploration activities 
is presented in the Operations section on 
pages 11 to 13. 
THE GROUP’S 
DEPOSITS ARE 
SUBJECT TO 
EXPLORATION 
AND MINING 
LICENCES 
Group companies must comply with mineral 
exploration and mining licence requirements. 
Non-compliance with licence requirements or 
major licence changes may result in a loss of 
licence and mineral rights or significant costs 
to ensure compliance with new requirements.
Compliance with licence requirements is 
constantly monitored at management level. 
To diminish risks, measures are developed  
to meet or renegotiate the terms and 
conditions of licence agreements. The 
Group’s senior management and the Board 
are regularly informed as to compliance  
with licence agreements. Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

STRATEGIC REPORT
Risk Risk description Mitigation Movement
PRODUCTION  
RISKS AND 
FAILURE TO 
DELIVER 
PRODUCTION 
PLANS
The Group’s mining operations are affected 
by numerous risk factors not wholly within 
the Group’s control, including flooding, pit 
slope and rim slide, unexpected/unusual 
geological variations or technical issues, 
extreme weather conditions and natural 
disasters. Such factors could adversely affect 
production volumes and costs or damage 
electricity supply facilities and/or other 
necessary items of equipment or infrastructure.
Group companies, in both open-pit and 
underground operations, may encounter 
unusual geological formations, including 
overly thin ore bodies, incidental deterioration 
in ore quality (lower grade) and dilution.
Unexpected interruptions in processing and 
technological characteristics of the ore may 
result in lower recovery rates than expected.
As a result of these factors, end-product  
unit costs may turn out to be considerably 
above budget and this might hinder the 
implementation of production plans and 
cause major losses in the form of impairment 
of various assets and goodwill.
The Group employs in-house planning 
experts who specialise in mine engineering 
and design and are responsible for developing 
optimal safe and commercially-viable mine 
plans. In turn, the in-house mine plans are 
reviewed by external consultants and state 
authorities.
The mine plans include consideration of safe 
open-pit and underground mining operations, 
including smoke warning systems, personal 
protection kits (gas masks, self-rescue 
systems, etc.) and mine dewatering 
equipment.
The Group implemented a number of 
processes to ensure that production is 
facilitated by the necessary machinery  
and equipment, and that relevant standby 
equipment is available. Regular maintenance 
is performed by qualified Group employees 
and contractors to ensure reliable machinery 
and equipment operations. Stocks of spare 
parts are maintained for urgent repairs. 
Details of the operational performance of 
each of the Group’s operations are included 
in the Operations section on pages 11 to 13.
NEW 
CONSTRUCTION 
PROJECTS
The Group faces challenges in developing 
major projects, particularly in geographically 
remote locations and in technically 
challenging areas.
Construction projects require significant 
resources and should be executed in 
accordance with planned costs and  
within defined terms. 
Cost overruns and timely execution  
in projects directly impact the capital, 
productivity and commercial performance  
of assets across the Group.
Incorrect capital allocation and poor project 
management may result in a decrease in the 
profitability of a particular project and affect 
the Group’s results.
The Group initiates new projects, mine 
extensions, etc., based on detailed investment 
plans and a review of management resources. 
Major projects are subject to external 
consultants’ reports and JORC evaluation.
Capital expenditure disciplines and controls 
are implemented to deliver on-budget 
performance for construction projects. 
Widely recognised project management 
techniques are employed. The Group applies 
a stage-gate process to ensure the cash 
generation potential of future growth 
projects. Management and the Board closely 
monitor the status of new projects, costs 
incurred and project issues.

SKILLED 
WORKFORCE 
SHORTAGE
The Group experiences intense competition 
with other companies for the retention and 
engagement of mining and production staff, 
including geologists, engineers, production 
process managers and other mining specialists.
The loss of key personnel or a failure  
to attract, retain and motivate qualified 
personnel, could have a materially adverse 
effect on the Group’s business, financial  
position and operational results.
The Group monitors the labour and salary 
markets and develops motivation systems  
to attract qualified personnel and retain  
key employees.
One of the responsibilities of the Group’s 
Remuneration Committee is to consider and 
approve remuneration for senior management.
THE GROUP  
IS SUBJECT  
TO EXTENSIVE 
ENVIRONMENTAL, 
HEALTH  
AND SAFETY 
LAWS AND 
REGULATIONS
Group companies are subject to various 
environmental, health and safety regulations 
stipulated by the relevant regulatory agencies. 
The Group’s operations require various 
licences/permissions with regard to the  
use of industrial explosives, the operation  
of flammable, explosive and chemically 
aggressive production facilities and the  
use of hazardous structures.
Stricter regulations could cause the Group  
to incur additional costs in order to comply 
with the new directives. 
State environmental agencies supervise  
and regulate the Group’s operations in 
accordance with applicable laws and 
regulations regarding the use of such 
contaminants as cyanide-containing 
reagents. The Group monitors compliance 
with environmental requirements and  
incurs costs to achieve compliance but  
if environmental regulations change,  
Group companies may face heavy fines and 
waste removal claims which may become a 
significant burden on the Group and result  
in demands to cease operational activity.  
The absence of a final product would lead  
to a decrease in profitability.
Inability to deliver appropriate levels of safety 
and environmental protection may result in loss 
of life, workplace injuries, pollution and lead to 
a stoppage of operations, significant fines and 
a threat to the Group’s licence to operate.
The Group is focused on health and safety 
issues and environmental protection, both  
of which are prioritised. 
Safety and environmental policies are based 
on the applicable legislation. Changes in 
legislation are monitored.
The Group purchases the necessary 
equipment to prevent fires, flooding, other 
accidents and pollution. The Group organises 
training and assessment programmes for all 
staff and regularly checks their compliance 
with HSE rules and regulations. An external 
provider of rescue services is contracted in 
accordance with legislation.
The Group strives to implement international 
best practices, conducts regular internal  
and external environmental audits, and 
implements remedial actions where required. 
In 2014, it completed the certification of all 
major production sites under ISO 14001:2004, 
and in 2017 and 2016 successfully completed 
ISO 14001 recertification audits. 
At Board level the Group’s HSE Committee

STRATEGIC REPORT
Risk Risk description Mitigation Movement
STRATEGIC RISKS
AN ADEQUATE 
RESOURCE BASE 
NEEDS TO BE 
MAINTAINED  
FOR FUTURE 
OPERATIONS AND 
REPLACEMENT OF 
DEPLETED MINES
Due to the fact that the life of a mine is 
limited, the Group has to strategically seek  
to replenish its resource base through the 
development of organic projects or through 
M&A activity.
Mine development from exploration  
to production is a prolonged process.  
There can be no guarantee that current  
or prospective exploration will lead to 
sustainable production in the future.
The Group undertakes exploration projects 
to sustain and increase the resource base. 
Comprehensive near-mine exploration plans 
are developed for all sites.
The Group is actively looking for 
opportunities around its existing operational 
assets to create competitive advantages 
through synergies within the Group and  
with regard to competitors’ projects.
REGULATORY 
CHANGES AND 
GOVERNMENT 
ACTIONS
Risks related to changes in the political and 
economic situation and legislative regulation 
in the Russian Federation and Kyrgyzstan  
are significant for the Group in that its major 
operations are located in these jurisdictions.
The Group’s operations in these jurisdictions 
are regulated by numerous laws, standards and 
guides. The Group’s approach is to strive to 
comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
There is a risk that government and 
government agencies could perform actions, 
adopt new laws, taxes, regulations, rules,  
or other requirements which could have  
a negative impact on the Group’s business 
and operations.
Senior management monitors political 
developments and new legislation, and 
assesses possible implications for the Group.
In addition, the Group has established lines  
of communication with various governmental 
authorities in order to contribute to the thinking 
of such bodies and, when appropriate, to 
participate in relevant discussions with political 
and regulatory authorities.
The Group is not directly affected by any 
sanctions, although the macroeconomic 
situation in Russia could result in limited 
financing options thereby increasing the  
cost of capital. 
The Group monitors further developments  
on an ongoing basis.

Directors’ Report
The Directors of Highland Gold Mining Limited are pleased to submit their Directors’ Report together with the audited Consolidated 
Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.
Review of Activities
Highland Gold Mining Limited (‘Highland Gold’ or the ‘Company’ or the ‘Group’) was incorporated in Jersey on 23 May 2002  
for the principal purpose, then and now, of establishing a portfolio of gold mining operations within the Russian Federation. The 
Group’s activities, structure and operating companies are described more fully on page 78 of the Report. The Chairman’s Statement 
and the Chief Executive Officer’s Report highlight the Company’s business developments during 2017 and prospective opportunities. 
The Company’s shares are quoted on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange.
Dividend Policy
In December 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted the following Dividend Policy:
• Highland Gold aims to pay a dividend that takes into account the Company’s cash generation, profitability, balance sheet 
strength and capital investment requirements.
• The Company anticipates total dividend payout for each financial year will be 20% of Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities.
• The Board may recommend the distribution of additional cash on the balance sheet through increased or special dividends, 
should those funds not be required for capital expenditure or debt repayment.
In addition, the Board is proposing a Scrip Dividend Scheme and will seek authorisation to implement this proposal for future 
dividends at the upcoming Annual General Meeting (AGM). The terms of the Scheme are circulated with the 2017 Annual Report 
and Notice of the AGM.
Resolutions to approve the dividend policy and a scrip dividend alternative and terms thereof will be proposed at the Annual 
General Meeting.
Results and Dividends
An overview of the Group’s results for the financial year to 31 December 2017 appears in the Chief Financial Officer’s Report  
on page 14 of this Report. The Group achieved a profit for the year of US$65.9 million (2016: profit of US$47.9 million). 
The Directors have approved the payment of a second interim dividend on ordinary shares of GBP 0.0542 per share (2016: GBP 
0.054 per share) payable on 25 May 2018.
Accounting Policies
Highland Gold’s Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union with the US dollar as its reporting currency.
Directors and their Interests
The interests of the Directors in office, and of persons connected with them, in the Company’s £0.001 ordinary shares, not 
previously reported and any subsequent changes up to the date of this report, are shown below:

Primerod International Limited (‘Primerod’) was the holding vehicle through which certain individual persons, managers and 
connected parties of Millhouse LLC, including Valery Oyf, held a combined 32% interest in the Company. In November 2016, 
Primerod reorganised and simplified the shareholding by exchanging its Highland Gold shares for Primerod shares. Among the 
recipients of this reorganisation were Valery Oyf and Executive Chairman Eugene Shvidler. An announcement to this effect was 
made on 8 November 2016.

GOVERNANCE
The Company was subsequently notified on 4 January 2018 that, due to the liquidation of Primerod, which had retained an 8% 
interest in the Company, Primerod’s shareholding was transferred to its sole remaining shareholder, Mr. Roman Abramovich.
No other Directors have an interest in the share capital of the Company.
The Company has adopted a share dealing code for Directors and relevant employees which prescribes a strict permissions 
procedure prior to any trading in the Company’s shares. This was updated in 2016 to incorporate the Market Abuse Regulation 
(MAR), which came into effect in July 2016.
Corporate Governance
The Directors have implemented many of the main principles of good governance under the UK Corporate Governance Code issued 
by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2016, having regard to the size and nature of the Company’s activities. The Board is 
assisted by a number of Committees with delegated authority to review key business risks, in addition to the financial risks applicable 
to the Group in operating its business. The Board has adopted an Anti-Corruption policy and an Internal Code of Business Conduct 
and Ethics, details of which can be found on the website at www.highlandgold.com.
The Board
The Board is currently comprised of seven Directors, five of whom are non-executives. Three non-executive Directors, comprising 
Duncan Baxter, Colin Belshaw and Terry Robinson, bring an element of independence to the Board and provide a balance to those 
Directors who cannot be regarded as independent. The Board considers them to be independent in character and judgement. 
Eugene Shvidler, Valery Oyf and Olga Pokrovskaya are affiliated with Millhouse LLC which, together with persons connected with  
it and close associates, own 37.41% of the issued share capital of the Company, including Eugene Shvidler’s interest of 12.56% and 
Valery Oyf’s interest of 4.46%.
The Board meets on a regular basis to review the business and performance of the Group, to ensure that financing needs are 
appropriate and to consider operational matters, development and acquisition opportunities. A total of six Board and Board 
Committee meetings were held during the year.
Where appropriate, the Directors have full access to the Company Secretary and independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense. The Company has in place appropriate Directors’ and Officers’ Liability insurance.
In the absence of any changes to the Board during the year, the Directors undertook a self-assessment review in early 2017  
from which no material issues arose, having considered the interaction with Committees, Executive Management and Corporate 
Governance matters. The Board will continue to undertake such reviews on a biennial basis provided there are no major changes 
to the Board that would render such a review ineffective. We anticipate the next review will take place during 2019.
Terry Robinson is the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director who is available to meet with major shareholders.
It is a requirement that all Directors retire by rotation at least within every three years and new appointments be confirmed  
at the following Annual General Meeting. Olga Pokrovskaya, Terry Robinson and Colin Belshaw, who retire by rotation, will offer 
themselves for re-election at the AGM to be held on 24 May 2018. The Remuneration and Nomination Committee has agreed  
and recommended these reappointments.

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee in 2017 consisted of two non-executive Directors, Olga Pokrovskaya and Terry Robinson, who chaired  
the Committee. The Audit Committee met three times during 2017 to consider the annual and interim Financial Statements  
and the internal and external audit programme. In April 2018, the Audit Committee considered and reviewed the 2017 Financial 
Statements and the Annual Report sections on the Company’s Principal Risks and Uncertainties, the Directors’ Report and the 
Operational and Financial Review.
Management and external auditors are invited to attend Committee meetings as appropriate. There are defined Terms of 
Reference for the Audit Committee which are reviewed by the Board on an annual basis and are available for inspection at the 
AGM; details can also be found on the Company’s website at www.highlandgold.com. The Committee is responsible for ensuring 
that the appropriate financial reporting procedures are properly maintained and reported upon, reviewing accounting policies, 
meeting the auditors and reviewing their reports relating to the accounts and internal control systems. The Audit Committee also 
considers budgets and has agreed an authorisation and expenditure policy. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring 
key risks and has implemented, through the internal audit department, a process for reporting on and monitoring such risks.
The Audit Committee reviews the annual Internal Audit Plan and Internal Audit recommendations in response to their audit findings 
and, subsequently, Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee on management’s delivery of such audit recommendations. Internal 
Audit also reviews and reports on the measurement and completeness of the Risk Register including details of recommended remedial 
actions on the part of management. Reports on whistleblowing events to the Audit Committee and action in this regard are also within 
the remit of Internal Audit.
With regard to the Financial Statements, the Audit Committee’s key considerations relate in particular to the consistency and 
appropriateness of the inputs for the Impairment review. Such inputs: Life-of-mine, gold price, annual volumes, cash cost of 
production and Capex, together with the proposed discount rate, are the drivers of the separate mine forward financial models 
and calculations of recoverable amount for impairment purposes.
The Audit Committee recommended the Interim Financial Statements and the 2017 full year audited Financial Statements to the 
Board for approval.
Each year, the Audit Committee undertakes a self-assessment of its own performance and that of Internal Audit and an extensive 
assessment of the external auditors which includes input from management’s assessment.
Following consideration of this assessment the Audit Committee recommended to the Board the reappointment of  
Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s auditors.
Remuneration and Nomination Committee
During 2017, the Committee consisted of three non-executive Directors, comprising Duncan Baxter, as Chairman, Valery Oyf and  
Terry Robinson. The Committee is responsible for reviewing the performance of executive management and, where appropriate,  
other senior executives, and for determining their appropriate levels of remuneration. Recommendations are made, as and when 
appropriate, with regard to appointments of Directors, the Chairmanship of Committees, senior management and directors of Group 
subsidiary companies. The composition of the Board is monitored on an ongoing basis. The Committee makes recommendations to 
the Board, within defined terms of reference, which the Board reviews at least annually. The Committee, on the recommendations from 
management, examines fees in relation to non-executive remuneration and committee Chairmen. The Committee held two meetings 
during the year. Details of the Directors’ remuneration are given on page 31. The Committee has considered and recommended to  
the Board the re-election of Olga Pokrovskaya, Terry Robinson and Colin Belshaw respectively as Directors of the Company at the 
forthcoming AGM.
Health, Safety and Environmental Committee
The Health, Safety and Environmental Committee is chaired by Olga Pokrovskaya. The other members of the Committee  
during 2017 were Terry Robinson and Colin Belshaw. The Committee considers, in conjunction with management, development 
and training requirements and regulatory compliance matters related to health, safety and environmental issues. The Committee 
makes recommendations to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, which the Board reviews at least annually. The Committee 
met twice during the year. Details of the progress and performance of the Company in respect of health, safety and the environment 
are given in the Operational Report on page 13.
Other Committees
In addition, the Group management company in Russia, Russdragmet LLC (‘RDM’), has established a risk and control platform 
through regular meetings. The members of the Executive Committee, which meets weekly, include management from RDM’s 
functional departments and the General Directors of the mine sites. The key role of the Committee is to ensure the implementation 
of decisions taken by the Board and committees, to manage the day-to-day operational activities and to make recommendations 
to the Board. The Committee delegates part of its duties to four internal RDM committees: the Risk Committee; the Budget 
Committee; the Production Committee and the Investment Committee.

Internal Controls
The Directors have overall responsibility for the Group’s internal control and effectiveness in safeguarding the assets of the Group. 
Internal controls can provide reasonable, but not absolute assurance against material misstatements or loss. The processes used 
by the Board to review the effectiveness of the internal controls are carried out by the Audit Committee. There is an Internal Audit 
Charter, which can be seen on the website at www.highlandgold.com.
Relations with Shareholders
The Group’s website provides comprehensive information on the Company’s business, results and personnel and is used  
to update shareholders and the market in respect of key developments and announcements (www.highlandgold.com). Shareholders 
are encouraged to use the Annual General Meeting as a forum at which to communicate with Directors. Due notice of the AGM is 
provided to all shareholders. The Company also utilises investor and public relations functions, webinars and road shows through 
brokers and the Nomad.
Shareholders passed a special resolution at the AGM on 17 May 2017 whereby the Directors were authorised to allot and grant 
rights to subscribe for or convert securities into shares in the Company up to a maximum nominal amount equivalent to 33%  
of the nominal amount of the authorised but unissued share capital of the Company, to such persons at such times and on such 
terms as they think proper without first making an offer to each person who holds shares in the Company. Such authority expires 
at the conclusion of the Company’s AGM in 2020.
Going Concern
Having made relevant enquiries and on a thorough overview from the Audit Committee, the Directors believe that it is appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation of the financial statements in view of the fact that the Company and the 
Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future.
Auditors
Ernst & Young LLP have expressed their willingness to 
continue as auditors of the Company and a resolution 
for their reappointment will be proposed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting Notice
The Annual General Meeting will be held  
at 11.00 am on Thursday 24 May 2018 at

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in Relation to the Annual Report and Financial Statements (continued)
Jersey Company law requires directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial period in accordance with any 
generally accepted accounting principles. The Financial Statements of the company are required by law to give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the company at the period end and of the profit or loss of the Company for the period then ended. 
In preparing these financial statements, the directors should:
• select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable;
• specify which generally accepted accounting principles have been adopted in their preparation; and
• prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping accounting records which are sufficient to show and explain its transactions and are 
such as to disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that 
the Financial Statements prepared by the company comply with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and, accordingly, for taking reasonable steps to further the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Report on Remuneration Policy
The overall responsibility for establishing a suitable remuneration policy lies with the Board. The Remuneration and Nomination 
Committee has terms of reference to work within and makes recommendations to the Board designed to provide a framework 
for Executive Director and senior management remuneration.
The Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors, Non-Executive Directors and senior management is based on general principles 
that provide competitive packages designed to attract and retain suitably qualified and talented individuals who can align themselves 
with the overall objectives and corporate culture of the Company.
The remuneration of Executive Directors, other than the Executive Chairman and senior management, currently comprises basic 
salary and discretionary bonus. The executive management and Executive Directors are entitled to certain benefits and are 
eligible to participate in the long-term incentive programme. The Company does not operate a pension scheme for executive 
management or Directors. The Executive Chairman’s fees are set by the Remuneration and Nomination Committee.
Basic salary takes into account the performance of the individual, any changes in responsibility and rates of market remuneration.
Bonuses, currently paid in cash although they could include a share element, are solely dependent on an overall assessment  
of the individual’s performance, with both financial and non-financial key performance indicators being taken into account.
In addition, incentives are available in relation to Executive Directors, senior management and other key personnel under the 
Unapproved Share Option Scheme, managed by the Committee. No such scheme shares are currently granted or vested.
The Committee does not operate a ‘clawback’ facility in respect of Directors’ and senior managers’ remuneration; such 
arrangements being unenforceable under the Russian labour code.
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is considered by the Executive Directors, with input from senior management,  
and takes into account the nature and risk of the business, time commitment, additional responsibilities and competitive fee 
levels. Non-Executive Directors’ fees comprise a base fee and an additional fee for chairmanship of a committee. Other benefits 
are not available to Non-Executive Directors.

annually. The executive Directors, other than the Chairman, are governed by their Russian contracts of employment. During the 
year, the Remuneration and Nomination Committee and the Board agreed not to increase remuneration or pay any ex-gratia

Independent Auditor’s Report  
to the Members of Highland Gold Mining Limited
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Highland Gold Mining Limited for the year ended 31 December 2017 which comprise the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated Statement  
of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and the related notes 1 to 31 to the financial statements, including a 
summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
In our opinion Highland Gold Mining Limited’s financial statements (the “financial statements”):
• Give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of its profit for the year then ended;
• Have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union; and
• Have been properly prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law.  
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report below. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that  
are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, 
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed. 
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to  
you where:
• the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
• the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant 
doubt about the Group’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve 
months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due  
to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation 
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our 
audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated  
to the Audit Committee
Impairment of goodwill and other 
non-current assets
At 31 December 2017 the carrying value  
of PP&E and goodwill was US$347 million  
(2016: US$353 million). The Group 
recognised no impairment loss in respect  
of PP&E and goodwill during the year 
(2016: US$23 million charge). Improved 
market conditions in 2017 resulted in an 
increase in headroom compared to the 
prior year leading us to believe that the 
risk has reduced.
We focused on this area due to the 
significance of the carrying value of the 
assets being assessed, the number and  
size of recent impairments, the current 
economic environment in the Group’s 
operating jurisdictions and because the 
assessment of the recoverable amount  
of the Group’s Cash Generating Units 
(“CGUs”) involves significant judgements 
about the future results of the business 
and the discount rates applied to future 
cash flow forecasts. 
In particular we focused our effort on  
those CGUs with the largest carrying 
values, those for which an impairment  
had been recognised in the prior year  
and those with the lowest headroom.
We have understood management’s 
process for impairment analysis through 
performing walkthroughs.
We evaluated whether potential  
indicators of impairment had been 
assessed by management up to the  
year end date including commodity  
prices, the market capitalisation of the 
Group when compared to its net assets, 
foreign exchange movements, production  
and reserve estimates.
We audited the impairment models 
prepared by management by testing  
the arithmetical accuracy and integrity  
of the impairment models and carrying 
out procedures on the reasonableness  
and consistency of the key assumptions 
including the sensitivity of the model to 
changes in these assumptions.
We assessed the historical accuracy of 
management’s budgets and forecasts,  
and sought appropriate evidence for  
any anticipated improvements in key 
assumptions such as production volumes 
or operating costs. We corroborated 
previous forecasts with actual data.
We engaged EY valuation specialists 
where appropriate to ensure certain 
specific assumptions applied in the 
impairment model are reasonable.
Where the impairment analysis was  
based on estimates of reserves and/or 
resources, we reviewed the basis of 
estimation and assessed the competence 
and independence of any expert engaged  
in performing work on the estimates. 
We tested the appropriateness of the 
related disclosures provided in the 
financial statements. In particular we 
tested the completeness of the disclosures 
regarding those CGUs with material 
goodwill balances and where a reasonably 
possible change in certain variables  
could lead to impairment charges. 
We consider management’s estimates  
to be reasonable for the current year  
with assumptions within an acceptable 
range. 
We concluded that the related 
disclosures provided in the financial 
statements are appropriate. Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated  
to the Audit Committee
Going concern
The Directors of the Group are required  
to make a rigorous assessment of whether 
the Group will remain a going concern  
for a period of at least twelve months 
from the date of approval of the financial 
statements and assess whether there are 
any material uncertainties in relation to 
the going concern basis of preparation.
The Group’s net debt at 31 December 2017 
is US$198 million and at 31 December 2016 
is US$205 million). The Group has regular 
scheduled debt repayments and a number 
of restrictive covenants over a proportion 
of its debt. 
Management and the Board prepare  
a cash flow forecast and undertake 
sensitivity analysis (Base and Sensitised 
cases) of the key assumptions to verify 
that the Group can operate as a going 
concern for at least 12 months from the 
date the financial statements are signed.
In the current year the performance of  
the Group has improved largely as a result 
of more favourable market conditions; 
therefore we consider that the risk  
has reduced.
We have tested the quality of 
management forecasting by comparing 
cash flow forecasts for prior periods to 
actual outcomes.
We tested the detailed cash flow forecasts 
prepared by management, assessed the 
key assumptions used in the model and 
the sources of funding and verified the 
conclusions reached by management. 
We tested the covenant calculations 
through re-performance to ensure that  
the Group has not breached any of its  
key covenants and is not expected to 
breach any in the future.
We agreed the sources of liquidity to 
supporting documents. 
We performed sensitivity analysis on  
the Base and Sensitised cases as part of 
our assessment as to whether the Group 
has sufficient cash reserves to meet its 
forecast expenditures and future debt 
obligations as well as compliance with  
its debt covenants.
Based on the audit procedures performed 
we concur with the conclusion reached  
by management that there is no material 
uncertainty in relation to the going 
concern assumption for the preparation  
of the consolidated financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope 
for each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We 
take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group wide controls, changes in the business 
environment and other factors such as recent Internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative 
coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, we selected 10 components covering Russia, Jersey and Kyrgyzstan, 
which represent the principal business units within the Group.
Of the 10 components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of three components (“full scope 
components”) which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining seven components (“specific 
scope components”), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had  
the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these 
accounts or their risk profile. The extent of our audit work on the specific scope accounts was similar to that for a full scope audit. 
The reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 100% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s EBITDA, 
100% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s Revenue and 95% (2016: 95%) of the Group’s Total assets. For the current year, the full scope 
components contributed 100% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s EBITDA, 100% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s Revenue and 39% (2016: 
40%) of the Group’s Total assets. The specific scope components contributed 56% (2016: 55%) of the Group’s Total assets.  
The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of all significant accounts of the component but will  
have contributed to the coverage of significant tested for the Group. We also instructed three locations to perform specified 
procedures over certain aspects of the financial statements as described in the Risk section above. Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

ACCOUNTS
Changes from the prior year 
Our scope allocation in the current year is consistent with 2016 in terms of coverage of the Group and the number of full and 
specific scope entities.
Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each  
of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms 
operating under our instruction. Audit procedures were performed on the three full scope components by our component teams 
in Russia. For the four specific scope components, where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the 
appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our 
opinion on the Group as a whole.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed to ensure that the each location 
is subject to an appropriate level of senior team member oversight during key activities. The nature and extent of these visits were 
designed relative to the size of the component, and the division of the responsibilities between the Group team on the significant 
risk areas applicable to the component. During the current year’s audit cycle, visits were undertaken by the primary audit team to 
the component teams in three locations in Russia. The primary audit team focused time on the significant risks and judgemental 
areas of the audit, met with local management, attended closing meetings and reviewed key working papers. The primary team 
interacted regularly with the component teams where appropriate during various stages of the audit, reviewed key working papers 
and were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit activities. This, together with the additional procedures performed at 
Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements  
on the audit and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent 
of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be $4.7 million (2016: $3.2 million), which is 3% (2016: 2%) of EBITDA. We believe  
that EBITDA is the most appropriate measure having taken into consideration what we believe to be the perspectives and 
expectations of the users of the financial statements in the context of our understanding of the entity and the environment  
in which it operates. The increase in our materiality is due to improved Group performance and more stable conditions in 
comparison to prior periods.
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low 
level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement 
was that performance materiality was 75% (2016: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely $3.9m (2016: $2.4m). We have set 
performance materiality at this percentage due to our past experience of the audit that indicates a lower risk of misstatements, 
both corrected and uncorrected.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts  
is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is 
based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement  
at that component. In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was $1.6m to $3.2m  
(2016: $1.1m to $2.2m). 
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of $0.2m  
(2016: $0.2m), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light  
of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion. Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Other information 
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated 
in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we 
are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the 
other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other 
information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires us  
to report to you if, in our opinion:
• proper accounting records have not been kept by the company, or proper returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the financial statements are not in agreement with the company’s accounting records and returns; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors 
either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance  
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually  
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these  
financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

The consolidated financial statements of Highland Gold Mining Limited and all its subsidiaries (the Group) have been prepared  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and the Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991.
Going concern
The Directors consider that the Group will continue as a going concern. 
In assessing the going concern status, the Directors have taken account of the Group’s financial position, expected future trading 
performance, its borrowings, available credit facilities and capital expenditure commitments, considerations of the gold price, 
currency exchange rates, and other risks facing the Group. After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors consider that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least the next 12 months from the date of signing these 
consolidated financial statements and that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these consolidated 
financial statements. Having examined all reasonably possible scenarios, the Group also concluded that no covenants are 
breached in such scenarios.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Highland Gold Mining Limited and all its subsidiaries 
as at 31 December each year.
A subsidiary is an entity, including an unincorporated entity such as a partnership, that is controlled by another entity (known as 
the parent). Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, 
and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent 
accounting policies.
All intra-group balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full.
The accounting policies in Note 3 have been applied when preparing the consolidated financial statements.
3. Summary of significant accounting policies
Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate 
of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether it measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair 
value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included 
in administrative expenses.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in 
accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes 
the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent 
changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in accordance 
with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified  
as equity, it will not be remeasured. Subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. In instances where the contingent 
consideration does not fall within the scope of IAS 39, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate IFRS. Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount recognised 
for non-controlling interest and the acquisition date fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the  
net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the 
subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in profit or loss.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. An impairment loss on goodwill cannot 
be reversed under any circumstances. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from 
the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, 
irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill 
associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss 
on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation 
disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Further information is contained in Note 16.
Foreign currency and foreign currency translation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is also the parent company’s functional currency. 
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are 
measured using that functional currency. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange 
ruling at the reporting date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency transactions 
and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities into the functional currency at year-end official exchange rates are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date of 
the initial transaction. Non-monetary items measured at a revalued amount in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
The principal exchange rates against US dollars that were applied are:

Property, plant and equipment
With the exception of those acquired through business combination, on initial acquisition land and buildings, plant and equipment 
are valued at cost, being the purchase price and the directly attributable costs of acquisition or construction required to bring the 
asset to the location and condition necessary for the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
In subsequent periods, buildings, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in 
value, whilst land is stated at cost less any impairment in value and is not depreciated. Property, plant and equipment acquired 
through business combinations are stated at their acquisition date fair values on initial recognition.
The net carrying amounts of land, buildings, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment either individually or at the 
cash-generating unit level when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
To the extent that these values exceed their recoverable amounts, that excess is fully provided against in the financial year in 
which this is determined.

ACCOUNTS
Expenditure on major maintenance or repairs includes the cost of replacement of parts of assets and overhaul costs. Where an 
asset or part of an asset is replaced and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will be available  
to the Group, the expenditure is capitalised and the carrying amount of the item replaced is derecognised. Similarly, overhaul 
costs associated with major maintenance are capitalised and depreciated over their useful lives where it is probable that future 
economic benefits will be available and any remaining carrying amounts of the cost of previous overhauls are derecognised.  
All other costs, including repair and maintenance expenditure, are expensed as incurred.
Where an item of property, plant and equipment is disposed of, it is derecognised and the difference between its carrying value 
and net sales proceeds is disclosed as a profit or loss on disposal in the statement of comprehensive income.
Any items of property, plant or equipment that cease to have future economic benefits expected to arise from their continued 
use or disposal are derecognised with any gain or loss included in the statement of comprehensive income in the financial year  
in which the item is derecognised.
Depreciation and depletion
Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost, less estimated residual values of buildings, plant and equipment (based on 
prices prevailing at the balance date) on the following bases:
• Mineral properties are depreciated using a unit of production method based on the depleted estimated proven and probable 
reserves and a portion of resources expected to be converted into reserves. 
• Buildings, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives.
Where parts of an asset have different useful lives, depreciation is calculated on each separate part. Each item or part’s estimated 
useful life has due regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves 
of the mine property at which the item is located, and to possible future variations in those assessments. Estimates of remaining 
useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually. Changes in estimates which affect unit-of-production calculations are 
accounted for prospectively.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure
Exploration and evaluation expenditure relates to costs incurred on the exploration and evaluation of potential mineral reserves and 
includes costs such as exploratory drilling and sample testing and the costs of pre-feasibility studies. Exploration and evaluation 
expenditure for each area of interest, other than that acquired from the purchase of another mining company, is carried forward  
as an asset provided that one of the following conditions is met:
• such costs are expected to be recouped in full through successful development and exploration of the area of interest  
or alternatively, by its sale; or
• exploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest have not yet reached a stage which permits a reasonable 
assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and active and significant operations  
in relation to the area are continuing, or planned for the future.
Exploration and evaluation assets contain a mixture of tangible (e.g. drill holes) and intangible assets (e.g. capitalised cost of 
evaluation reports, capitalised borrowing costs or capitalised G&A, cost of licence). Purchased exploration and evaluation assets 
are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition or at fair value if purchased as part of a business combination. Exploration 
and evaluation assets are not depreciated. General and administrative and overhead costs directly attributable to the exploration 
and evaluation activities are included in exploration and evaluation assets’ cost. The restoration provision cost does not form part 
of exploration and evaluation assets.
An impairment review is performed, either individually or at the cash-generating unit level, when there are indicators that the 
carrying amount of the assets may exceed their recoverable amounts. To the extent that this occurs, the excess is fully provided 
against, in the financial period in which this is determined. Exploration assets are reassessed on a regular basis and these costs 
are carried forward provided that at least one of the conditions outlined above is met.
Expenditure is transferred to mine properties once the work completed to date supports the future development of the property 
and such development receives appropriate approvals.  Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
Mine development expenditure
Capitalised mine development costs include expenditure incurred to develop new ore bodies, to define future mineralisation in 
existing ore bodies, to expand the capacity of a mine and to maintain production, and also interest and financing costs relating  
to the construction of mineral property. 
The net carrying amounts of mine development costs at each mine property are reviewed for impairment either individually  
or at the cash-generating unit level when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. To the extent that these values exceed their recoverable amounts, that excess is fully provided against the statement 
of comprehensive income in the financial year in which this is determined.
The depreciation on items of properties, plant and equipment used in exploration and development activities is recognised  
as part of the initial cost of the related assets and is treated on a consistent basis with the entity’s other exploration and 
development expenditure. Mine development expenditure is included in mine assets.
Mine properties
Development costs are transferred to the mine properties category when the asset is available for use; this is when commercial 
levels of production are achieved. The restoration provision cost is capitalised within mine assets. Mine properties contain a 
mixture of tangible and intangible assets. The cost of acquiring mine assets after the start of production is capitalised on the 
statement of financial position as incurred and included in the mine properties category. The cost of acquiring rights on mineral 
reserves and mineral resources including directly attributable expenses is capitalised on the statement of financial position as 
incurred and included in the mine properties category. The initial cost of a mine property comprises its construction cost, any 
costs directly attributable to bringing the mining property into operation, the initial estimate of the provision for mine closure 
cost, and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs. 
The net carrying amounts of mine assets and mineral rights are reviewed for impairment either individually or at the cash-
generating unit level when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  
To the extent that these values exceed their recoverable amounts, that excess is fully provided against the statement of 
comprehensive income in the financial year in which this is determined. 
Stripping costs
The Group incurs waste removal costs (stripping costs) during the production phase of surface mining operations. Further details 
are disclosed in Note 4. 
Construction work in progress
Assets in the course of construction are capitalised in the construction work in progress account. On completion, the cost  
of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment.
No depreciation is charged on assets in the construction work in progress account. These assets are depreciated upon their 
transfer to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment.
Incidental and non-incidental income
During the construction of an asset, the Group may earn some income. 
Income and related expenses of incidental operations that are not, in themselves, necessary to bring the asset itself to the location 
and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, are recognised in profit or loss 
and included in their respective classifications of income and expenses. Such incidental income is not offset against the cost of  
the asset. 
Income generated wholly and necessarily as a result of the process of bringing the asset into the location and condition for its 
intended use is credited to the cost of asset.

Fair value measurement
The Group measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair values of financial instruments measured 
at amortised cost are disclosed in Note 29.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction  
to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: 
• in the principal market for the asset or liability, or
• in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the 
asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits 
by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest 
and best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to 
measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair 
value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or 
indirectly observable
Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether 
transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that  
is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, 
characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. Further information  
on fair values is described in Note 29.
Impairment
At each reporting date, management assesses whether there is any indication of impairment within the categories of property, 
plant and equipment (annual impairment test is performed on CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated irrespective of whether 
any indications exist). If any such indication exists, management estimates the recoverable amount, which is determined as the 
higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount 
and an impairment loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
An impairment loss recognised for an asset other than goodwill in prior years is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates 
used to determine the asset’s value-in-use or fair value less costs of disposal and if there is an indication that the impairment loss 
may no longer exist or may have decreased.
Leases
Operating leases 
Where the Group is a lessee in a lease which does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership from the lessor 
to the Group, the total lease payments are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the 
period of the lease.  Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Accounts
3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
Finance lease 
Where the Group is a lessee in a lease which transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group, the  
assets leased are capitalised in property, plant and equipment with a corresponding liability at an amount equal to the lower  
of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments, on commencement of the lease.  
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance 
outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of future finance charges, are stated separately as finance lease liabilities. 
The interest cost is charged to the statement of comprehensive income over the lease period. The assets acquired under finance 
leases are depreciated over the shorter of their useful life and the lease term if the Group is not reasonably certain that it will obtain 
ownership by the end of the lease term.
Financial assets and liabilities
Financial instruments classification and recognition
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contracts that give rise to them. The Group 
determines the classification of its financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition (which, in the case of financial assets existing 
at the transition date, includes designation at that date) and, where allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each 
financial year end. When financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction 
price plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity 
investments or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. Where, as a result of a change in intention or ability, it is no 
longer appropriate to classify an investment as held to maturity, the investment is reclassified into the available-for-sale category. 
Currently, the Group does not have held-to-maturity investments or available-for-sale financial assets.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at initial recognition are designated at fair value through profit and loss. When a group of financial assets  
is managed on the basis of its performance this is evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk 
management strategy.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit or loss or available for sale. 
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
A financial asset is derecognised where:
• the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired;
• the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without 
material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; or
• the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either has transferred substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, or has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset.
Where the Group has transferred its right to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, it continues to recognise the financial asset to the extent 
of its continuing involvement in the asset.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or is cancelled or expires. Gains on 
derecognition are recognised within finance revenue and losses within finance costs. 
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms  
of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss.

Inventories
Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis. The  
cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw material, direct labour, other direct costs and related production 
overheads (based on normal operating capacity) but excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price 
in the ordinary course of business, less the cost of completion and selling expenses. Inventory items that represent significant 
parts of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as non-current assets and are depreciated separately. An existing part 
should be derecognised when it is replaced, with the book value of the replaced part written down through the depreciation charge.
The inventories are segregated by the following:
• gold in process which is valued at the average total production cost at the relevant stage of production;
• gold on hand which is valued on an average total production cost method;
• ore stockpiles which are valued at the average cost of mining and stockpiling the ore;
• raw materials and consumables (including fuel and spare parts): materials, goods or supplies to be either directly or indirectly 
consumed in the production process which are valued at weighted average costs.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. A provision for impairment of 
receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according  
to the original terms of receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the 
present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The amount of the provision is 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments 
with original maturities of three months or less. 
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity  
as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Any excess of the fair value of consideration received over the par value of shares 
issued is taken to the share premium account.
Value added tax 
Gold production and subsequent sales are not subject to output value added tax. Input VAT is recoverable through cash, against 
income tax and other taxes. Where input VAT is not recoverable, the VAT provision is created on the statement of financial position 
corresponding with the statement of comprehensive income in a relevant period.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Subsequently, borrowings are carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an 
asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use (a qualifying asset) are capitalised as part 
of the cost of the respective asset, during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. 
All other borrowing costs are expensed. 
Trade and other payables
Trade payables are accrued when the counterparty has performed its obligations under the contract; they are carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. 
Provisions for liabilities and charges
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate of the amount can 
be made.  Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
Environmental protection, rehabilitation and closure costs
Provision is made for close down, restoration and environmental clean-up costs (including the dismantling and demolition of 
infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas), where there is a legal or constructive obligation to 
do so, in the accounting period in which the environmental disturbance occurs, based on the estimated future costs. Where material, 
the provision is discounted and the unwinding of the discount is shown as a finance cost in the statement of comprehensive income. 
At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset, is capitalised and depreciated on a unit of production basis. Changes 
in the measurement of an existing decommissioning, restoration and similar liability that result from changes in the estimated timing 
or amount of the outflow of resources embodying economic benefits required to settle the obligation, or a change in the discount 
rate, shall be accounted as follow: changes in the liability shall be added to, or deducted from, the cost of the related asset in the 
current period; the amount deducted from the cost of the asset shall not exceed its carrying amount. If a decrease in the liability 
exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the excess shall be recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
The provision is reviewed on a semi-annual basis for changes in cost estimates or lives of operations.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable to the extent that it is probable that the 
economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured and when all significant risks and rewards  
of ownership of the asset sold are transferred to the customer. Gold sales revenue is recognised when the product has been 
dispatched to the purchaser and is no longer under the physical control of the producer. At this point the Group retains neither 
continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the product.
Novo as a concentrate producer and seller has contracts where price risk is retained for a specified period after the sale has 
occurred. The price payable under the concentrate contract is determined by reference to prices quoted in an organized market 
(LME, London Metal Exchange; LBMA, London Bullion Market Association). A portion of the provisional invoice is settled within  
a few days (80%). The remaining amount (20%), plus or minus any adjustment on 100% of the value of the sale for movements in 
price from the price in the provisional invoice and the final price, plus any volume of metals adjustments resulting from the final 
assay is settled in 4 months after the date of the shipment for Kazzinc and is settled in no more than 3 months after the date of 
the delivery for Hyosung. For Kazzinc the title to the commodity passes to the buyer on shipment and for Hyosung the title to  
the commodity passes to the buyer on delivery to boundary railway station – border of the Russian Federation and the People’s 
Republic of China.
Pricing adjustment features that are based on quoted market prices for a date subsequent to the date of shipment or delivery of 
the commodity represent an embedded derivative financial instrument that requires separation at the date the sale is recognised. 
The derivative has a fair value, based on the pricing formula set out in the contract, which is based on quoted market prices. 
Adjustments for prices are calculated using the best estimate. Adjustments for volumes (metal grades in concentrates) are based 
on the available actual test results. No corrections are made in respect of periods where no final test results are available.
Any adjustments to pricing resulting from the embedded derivative as well as volume adjustments are recognised in revenue 
from concentrate sales and accounts receivable.
Employee benefits
Wages, salaries, contributions to the Russian Federation state pension and social insurance funds, paid annual leave and sick 
leave, bonuses, and non-monetary benefits (such as health services) are accrued in the year in which the associated services  
are rendered by the employees of the Group. 
Earnings per share
Earnings per share is determined by dividing the profit or loss attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted 
average number of participating shares outstanding during the reporting year. 
Dividend distribution
Dividends on equity shares are recognised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.

Income taxes
Current tax for each taxable entity in the Group is based on the local taxable income at the local statutory tax rate enacted at the 
reporting date and includes adjustments to tax payable or recoverable in respect of previous periods. The income tax charge/
(credit) comprises current tax and deferred tax and is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, 
except to the extent that it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. 
Deferred income tax is recognised using the statement of financial position liability method in respect of tax losses carried 
forward and temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts for financial 
reporting purposes, except as indicated below.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary difference except:
• where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill, or the initial recognition of an asset or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting 
profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, where 
the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and 
unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised, except:
• where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of  
an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the 
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
• in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, 
deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the 
foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.  
To the extent that an asset not previously recognised fulfils the criteria for recognition, a deferred income tax asset is recorded.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset  
is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
New standards, interpretations and amendments adopted by the Group
In the preparation of consolidated financial statements, the Group followed the same accounting policies and methods of 
computation as compared with those applied in the previous year, except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations 
and revision of the existing standards as of 1 January 2017.
Changes to IFRS:
The following new standards and amendments became effective as of 1 January 2017:
Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows: Disclosure Initiative
The amendments require entities to provide disclosures about changes in their liabilities arising from financing activities, including 
both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes (such as foreign exchange gains or losses). The Group has provided 
the information for both the current and the comparative period in Note 29. Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
New Standards and Interpretations will be adopted in future periods 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. IFRS 9 brings together all three aspects of the accounting for 
financial instruments project: classification and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted. Except for hedge accounting, retrospective 
application is required but providing comparative information is not compulsory.
The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date and will not restate comparative information. During 2017, 
the Group has performed a detailed impact assessment of all three aspects of IFRS 9. This assessment is based on currently available 
information and may be subject to changes arising from further reasonable and supportable information being made available to  
the Group in 2018 when the Group will adopt IFRS 9. Overall, the Group expects no significant impact on its statement of financial 
position and equity from the adoption of IFRS 9. However, there will be some changes to the classification and measurement of trade 
receivables relating to provisionally priced sales. Refer below for further discussion.
a) Classification and measurement
The Group does not expect a significant impact on its statement of financial position and equity on applying the classification and 
measurement requirements of IFRS 9. However, there will be some changes impacting trade receivables relating to provisionally 
priced sales.
As discussed in more detail below within the discussion on the potential impact of IFRS 15, some of the Group’s sales of metal  
in concentrate contain provisional pricing features. Currently, these provisionally priced sales contain an embedded derivative 
that is separated from the host contract, i.e., the concentrate receivable, for accounting purposes under IAS 39. Accordingly,  
the embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is recognised at fair value, with subsequent changes  
in fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income each period until final settlement, and presented as part 
of ‘Revenue’. 
On adoption of IFRS 9, the embedded derivative will no longer be separated from the concentrate receivables as the receivables 
are not expected to give rise to cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and interest. Instead, the receivables will  
be accounted for as one instrument and measured at fair value through profit or loss with subsequent changes in fair value 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income each period until final settlement and presented as part of ‘Revenue’.  
This means that the quantum of the fair value movement will be different because the current approach only calculates fair  
value movement based on changes in the relevant commodity price, whereas under IFRS 9, the fair value of the receivable will  
not only include commodity price changes, but it will also factor in the impact of credit and interest rates. Based on a detailed 
analysis, management has concluded that the impact is immaterial. 
b) Other changes
In addition, IFRS 9 changes accounting for loan modifications which the Group may experience from time to time and this 
requirement will be applied at the time of any future modification. We do not expect any material impact of the adoption  
of this requirement.
c) Impairment
IFRS 9 requires the Group to record expected credit losses on all of its debt securities, loans and trade receivables, either  
on a 12-month or lifetime basis. 
Management has assessed the impact of the new requirements on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.  
Our assessment is focused on the different types of financial assets presented in the financial statements:
• Receivables at Novo (Kazzinc, Hyosung), incl. non-separated embedded derivative, 
• Cash and deposits, and
• Other receivables.
Having analysed the IFRS requirements, contracts terms, the existing accounting treatment, the credit rating position of debtors 
and their history of payments – the new expected credit losses (ECL) impairment requirements will not have a significant impact 
on short-term trade receivables issued by Novo towards customers or cash, deposits and other receivables. The Group has 
neither longer-term receivables, contract assets nor debt securities which can be significantly impacted by ECL requirements.  
No significant impact is expected. 
d) Hedge accounting
The Group utilises a no-hedge policy. Therefore, there will be no impact of new hedge requirements.

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014, and amended in April 2016, and establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from 
contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity 
expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.
The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date using the modified retrospective method. 
During 2016, the Group performed a preliminary assessment of IFRS 15, which was followed by a more detailed analysis in 2017. 
This analysis included identifying the contracts with customers and the performance obligations in the contracts, determining  
the transaction price of variable consideration, analysing the allocation of transaction price to separate performance obligations, 
assessing the impact of shipping terms and considering the new presentation and disclosure requirements. As a result of this 
analysis, the key issues were identified and are set out below. These are based on the Group’s current interpretation of IFRS 15  
and may be subject to change as interpretations evolve further.
Provisionally priced sales
As noted above, some of the Group’s sales of metal in concentrate contain provisional pricing features which are currently considered 
to be embedded derivatives. Under IAS 18, revenue is recognised at the estimated fair value of the total consideration received or 
receivable when the concentrate is delivered. Adjustments for prices are calculated using the best estimate. Adjustments for volumes 
(metal grades in concentrates) are based on the available actual test results. No corrections are made in respect of periods where no 
final test results are available. Any adjustments to pricing resulting from the embedded derivative as well as volume adjustments are 
recognised in revenue from concentrate sales and accounts receivable.
IFRS 15 will not change the assessment of the impact of these provisional pricing features. IFRS 15 states that if a contract  
is partially within the scope of this standard and partially within the scope of another standard, an entity will first apply the 
separation and measurement requirements of the other standard(s). Therefore, to the extent that provisional pricing features  
are considered to be within the scope of another standard, they will be outside the scope of IFRS 15 and entities will be required  
to account for these in accordance with IFRS 9. Any subsequent changes that arise due to differences between initial and final 
assay will still be considered within the scope of IFRS 15 and will be subject to the constraint on estimates of variable consideration.
Revenue in respect of the host contract will be recognised when control passes to the customer and will be measured at the 
amount to which the entity expects to be entitled. When considering the initial assay estimate, the Group has considered the 
requirements of IFRS 15 in relation to the constraint on estimates of variable consideration. It will only include amounts in the 
calculation of revenue where it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur when the uncertainty relating 
to final assay/quality is subsequently resolved, i.e., at the end of the quotation period. As disclosed above, the assay differences 
are not usually material to the Group, hence, no change is expected when compared to the current approach. 
As explained above, in the discussion on the potential impact of IFRS 9, the embedded derivative will no longer be separated 
from the host contract, i.e., the concentrate receivable. This is because the existence of the provisional pricing features will mean 
the concentrate receivable will fail to meet the requirements to be measured at amortised cost. Instead, the entire receivable  
will be measured at fair value, with subsequent movements being recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. The 
requirement to measure the entire receivable at fair value is different from current practice in that the current embedded derivative 
represents changes in the commodity price, whereas the fair value of the receivable will include the impact of changes in the 
commodity price, interest rate risk and credit risk. Given the nature of the Group’s provisionally priced sales, in that they are no 
more than four months long and are with customers who have a strong credit rating, the Group does not expect this change to 
have a material impact.
With respect to the presentation of amounts arising from such provisionally priced contracts, IFRS 15 requires ‘revenue from 
contracts with customers’ to be disclosed separately from other types of revenue. This means that revenue recognised from  
the initial sale must be separately disclosed in the notes to the financial statements from any revenue/income recognised from 
subsequent movements in the fair value of the related concentrate receivable. In 2017, the Group continued testing appropriate 
systems, internal controls, policies and procedures necessary to collect and disclose the required information. Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and it replaces IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, 
SIC-15 Operating Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. IFRS 
16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account 
for all leases under a single on-balance sheet model similar to the accounting for finance leases under IAS 17. The standard includes 
two recognition exemptions for lessees – leases of ’low-value’ assets (e.g., personal computers) and short-term leases (i.e., leases 
with a lease term of 12 months or less). At the commencement date of a lease, a lessee will recognise a liability to make lease 
payments (i.e., the lease liability) and an asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term (i.e., the 
right-of-use asset). Lessees will be required to separately recognise the interest expense on the lease liability and the depreciation 
expense on the right-of-use asset.
Lessees will be also required to remeasure the lease liability upon the occurrence of certain events (e.g., a change in the lease 
term, a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine those payments). The 
lessee will generally recognise the amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset.
IFRS 16 also requires lessees and lessors to make more extensive disclosures than under IAS 17.
IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early application is permitted, but not before an 
entity applies IFRS 15. A lessee can choose to apply the standard using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective 
approach. The standard’s transition provisions permit certain reliefs.
In 2017, the Group assembled a project team to begin the process of assessing the impact of the leases standard. 
In 2018, the Group will continue to assess the potential effect of IFRS 16 on its consolidated financial statements. For details 
relating to lease liabilities, refer to Note 26. 
4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies
The Group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Estimates and judgements 
are continually evaluated and are based on management’s experience and other factors, including expectations of future events 
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management also makes certain judgements, apart from those 
involving estimations, in the process of applying the accounting policies. Judgements that have the most significant effect on the 
amounts recognised in the financial statements and estimates that can cause a significant adjustment to the carrying amount of 
assets and liabilities within the next financial year include: 
Judgements
Deferred stripping costs
The Group accounts for stripping costs incurred during the production stage of its open-pit operations on the basis of the 
relevant production measure calculated for every identified component of every ore body (volume of waste to volume of 
ore extracted). 
Production stripping costs are capitalised as part of a non-current stripping activity asset if: 
• probable future economic benefits associated with the stripping activity will flow to the Group;
• costs can be measured reliably; and
• the Group can identify the component of the ore body for which access has been improved. 
During the production phase, stripping costs (production stripping costs) can be incurred both in relation to the production  
of inventory in that period and the creation of improved access and mining flexibility in relation to ore to be mined in the future. 
The former are included as part of the costs of inventory, while the latter are capitalised as a stripping activity asset, where 
certain criteria are met. 
Significant judgement is required to distinguish between development stripping and production stripping and to distinguish 
between the production stripping that relates to the extraction of inventory and what relates to the creation of a stripping 
activity asset.
Once the Group has identified its production stripping for each surface mining operation, it identifies the separate components 
of the ore bodies for each of its mining operations. An identifiable component is a specific volume of the ore body that is made 
more accessible by the stripping activity. Significant judgement is required to identify and define these components, and also to 
determine the expected volumes of waste to be stripped and ore to be mined in each of these components. These assessments 
are undertaken for each individual mining operation based on the information available in the mine plan. 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017
53
ACCOUNTS
The mine plans and, therefore, the identification of components, will vary between mines for a number of reasons. These include, 
but are not limited to, the type of commodity, the geological characteristics of the ore body, its geographical location and/or 
financial considerations.
Judgement is also required to identify a suitable production measure to be used to allocate production stripping costs between 
inventory and any stripping activity asset(s) for each component. The Group considers that the ratio of the expected volume of 
waste to be stripped for an expected volume of ore to be mined for a specific component of the ore body is the most suitable 
production measure.
Furthermore, judgements and estimates are also used to apply the units-of-production method in determining the depreciable 
lives of the stripping activity asset(s).
Exploration and evaluation expenditure 
The application of the Group’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure requires judgement in determining 
whether it is likely that the asset will bring economic benefits in the future, which may be based on assumptions about future 
events or circumstances. Estimates and assumptions made may change if new information becomes available. If, after expenditure 
is capitalised, information becomes available suggesting that the recovery of expenditure is unlikely, the amount capitalised is 
written off in the statement of comprehensive income in the period when the new information becomes available.
Estimations and assumptions
Impairment of non-current assets 
Non-financial assets (including goodwill)
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset (or CGU) may be impaired. If any 
indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset such as goodwill is required, the Group estimates the asset’s or 
CGU’s recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) 
and its value in use (VIU). Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset/CGU is 
considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Management has assessed its CGUs as being an individual 
mine, which is the lowest level for which cash inflows are largely independent of those of other assets.
In calculating the recoverable amount, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset/CGU. In 
determining the recoverable amount, recent market transactions (where available) are taken into account. If no such transactions 
can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used which reflects management’s judgements relating to the estimates a 
market participant would use to arrive at a FVLCD valuation. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples and 
other available fair value indicators. Further details on how FVLCD is calculated are outlined in Note 17.
The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecasts, which are prepared separately for each of the 
Group’s CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated, based on the life-of-mine plans. The cash flows are based on estimates 
of expected future production, metal selling prices, operating costs, capital expenditure and post-tax discount rates. Future 
changes in these variables may differ from management’s estimates and may materially change the recoverable amounts of 
the CGUs. 
Please refer to Note 17 for further details on the significant judgements and estimations made when preparing impairment tests 
of non-current assets, including post-tax discount rates.
Tax legislation
Russian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations. Please refer to Note 26 for details. The Group 
establishes provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by the tax authorities in the countries 
in which it operates. The amounts of such provisions are based on various factors, such as experience with previous tax audits 
and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible authority.
Site restoration provision
A provision is recognised for expected close down, restoration and environmental clean-up costs based on the estimated  
future costs of such activities. It is expected that most of these costs will be incurred at the end of life of the operating mine. 
Assumptions used to calculate the provision for site restoration were based on the government requirements applicable to  
sites closure, and assumptions regarding the life-of-mine (which is assumed to close in 2023 at MNV, in 2032 for plant and 
infrastructure and in 2024 for open pit at BG, in 2033 at Novo, in 2030 at Klen and in 2036 at Kekura), expected site restoration 
activities (removal of waste, restoration of mine sites), and current prices for similar activities. Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies continued
Inventory obsolescence
The Group’s units perform a detailed analysis of old items of stock and create a specific provision for them once it is determined 
that the recovery of the item’s value unlikely. Then the Group performs a turnover analysis for the remaining items of inventory  
by aging. If the Group identifies impairment indicators, the obsolescence provision is then recognised at the statement of 
financial position. The movement in the obsolescence provision is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Determination of ore reserves and resources
The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources in accordance with the rules and requirements of the Russian State 
Committee for Reserves (GKZ) as well as in accordance with JORC.
Proven and probable reserves and a portion of resources expected to be converted into reserves (as indicated in the detailed 
life-of-mine plans) were used in the units of production calculation for depreciation in 2017, as management believes they 
represent the most accurate approximation of the reserves. 
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves. Assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation  
may change significantly when new information becomes available. Changes in the forecast prices of commodities, exchange 
rates, addition to or reduction of reserves as a result of exploration works, production costs or recovery rates may change the 
economic status of reserves and may ultimately result in the reserves being restated.
Mine development expenditure
Mine development costs are, upon commencement of production, depreciated using a unit of production method based on the 
estimated proven and probable reserves and a portion of resources expected to be converted into reserves to which they relate, 
or are written off if the property is abandoned.
Mine properties
Mine assets and mineral rights are amortised using the units-of-production method based on estimated proven and probable 
reserves and a portion of resources expected to be converted into reserves.
Note 17 contains information on the life-of-mines that is in line with the present assessment of the economically recoverable 
reserves.
Please refer to the Resources and Reserves section for detailed information on mineral resources and reserves.
5. Segment information
For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on the nature of their activities, and has four 
reportable segments as follows:
• Gold production;
• Polymetallic concentrate production;
• Development and exploration; and
• Other.
The gold production reportable segment comprises two operating segments, namely Mnogovershinnoye (MNV) and Belaya  
Gora (BG) at which level management monitors its results for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and 
evaluating the effectiveness of its activity. MNV and BG have been aggregated into one reportable segment as they exhibit 
similar long-term financial performance and have similar economic characteristics: nature of products (gold and silver), nature  
of production processes, type of customer for their products (banks), methods used to distribute their products and the nature 
of the environment (both are located in the Khabarovsk region). 
The polymetallic concentrate production segment, namely Novoshirokinskoye (Novo), is analysed by management separately 
due to the fact that the nature of its activities differs from the gold production process.
The development and exploration segment contains entities which hold licenses in the development and exploration stage: 
Kekura, Klen, Taseevskoye, Unkurtash, Lubov, and related service entities: Zabaykalzolotoproyekt (ZZP) and BSC.
The ‘other’ segment includes head office, management company and other non-operating companies which have been 
aggregated to form the reportable segment.

ACCOUNTS
Segment performance is evaluated based on EBITDA (defined as operating profit/(loss) excluding depreciation and amortisation, 
impairment losses, movement in ore stockpiles obsolescence provision, movement in raw materials and consumables obsolescence 
provision, result of disposal of a non-core entity and gain on settlement of contingent consideration). The development and 
exploration segment is evaluated based on the life-of-mine model in connection with the capital expenditure spent during the 
reporting period.
The following tables present revenue, EBITDA and assets information for the Group’s reportable segments. The segment 
information is reconciled to the Group’s profit/(loss) after tax for the year.
Finance costs, finance income, income taxes and foreign exchange losses are managed on a group basis and are not allocated  
to operating segments.
Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
The accounting policies used by the Group in reporting segments internally are the same as those contained in Note 3 of the 
financial statements.
Revenue from several customers was greater than 10% of total revenues. 
In 2017 the gold and silver revenue reported in the gold production segment was received from sales to Gazprombank (US$185.8 
million) in the territory of the Russian Federation.
In 2016 the gold and silver revenue reported in the gold production segment was received from sales to Gazprombank (US$179.5 
million) in the territory of the Russian Federation.
In 2017 the concentrate revenue reported in the polymetallic concentrate production segment in the amount of US$69.4 million was 
received from sales to Kazzinc (2016: US$97.8 million) in the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan and to Hyosung corporation in 
the territory of the People’s Republic of China in the amount of US$61.1 million (2016: 28.2 million).
Other third-party revenues in both 2017 and 2016 were received in the territory of the Russian Federation.

10.2.2. Individual impairment of property, plant and equipment and mine assets
The recoverable amount of some non-current assets determined as at 31 December 2016 was lower than their carrying amount 
because the Group does not expect to derive future cash flows from the assets. The assets were considered impaired and were 
written down to their recoverable amount. In 2017, the Group recognised a reversal of previously recognised impairment losses.

No deferred tax benefits are recognised in relation to site restoration provisions and obsolescence provisions. Restoration 
expenses are tax deductible when incurred. However, it is not certain that there will be sufficient income towards the end  
of the mine’s life against which the restoration expenditure can be offset and therefore future tax relief has not been assumed. 
The amount of the deductible temporary differences for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the site 
restoration provision at 31 December 2017 is US$18.7 million (31 December 2016: US$17.2 million).
No deferred tax benefit is recognised in relation to the provision for obsolete inventory. These materials are unlikely to be used  
for production purposes in the future and therefore future tax relief is not assumed. The amount of the deductible temporary 
differences for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the obsolescence provision at 31 December 2017  
is US$27.8 million (31 December 2016: US$15.6 million).
The amount of the deductible temporary differences for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the tax 
losses at 31 December 2017 is US$23.3 million (31 December 2016: US$21.7 million). The non-recognition of tax losses is due to 
insufficient expected future income against which these losses could be offset.
Russian tax legislation in respect of treating tax losses was changed in 2016: tax losses generated after 2007 can be utilised with 
no time limit.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, for which deferred tax liability in respect of withholding 
tax on dividends has not been recognised aggregate to US$588.8 million (2016: US$486.9 million). No deferred tax liability has 
been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences and it is not probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
The total deferred tax liabilities arising from these temporary differences should be between US$0 and US$88.3 million  
(2016: US$0 and US$73.0 million), depending on the manner in which the investments are ultimately realised.
Profits arising in the Company for the 2017 and 2016 years of assessment will be subject to Jersey tax at the standard corporate 
income tax rate of 0%.
14. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the 
parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent  
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares that would be issued, for no consideration, on the exercise of share options into ordinary shares. There is no effect of 
dilution in 2017 (2016: none) as the share options expired in 2014.
The following reflects the income and share data used in the basic profit per share computations:

There have been no other transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares between the reporting date and the 
date of completion of these financial statements.
The share capital comprises only one class of ordinary shares, which carry a voting right and the right to a dividend.
There are no restrictions on the distribution of dividends and the repayment of capital. Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

16. Intangible assets
Goodwill arises principally because of the following factors:
• The ability to capture unique synergies that can be realised from managing a portfolio of both acquired and existing mines  
in our regional business units, and
• The requirement to recognise deferred tax assets and liabilities for the difference between the assigned values and the tax 
bases of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at amounts that do not reflect fair value.
At 31 December 2017, intangible assets represented goodwill relating to the group of development and exploration assets 
(US$43.0 million) and to the operating gold mining asset (US$9.7 million), and from the acquisition of Novo (US$5.1 million). 
Goodwill is allocated to a single or group of cash-generating units as appropriate, representing the lowest level at which it is 
monitored for management purposes. Goodwill is allocated to the following groups of cash-generating units:
 
 
2017
US$000

Goodwill allocated to the operating gold mining company (MNV) 9,690 9,690

and Lubov) 42,978 42,978
Balance at 31 December 57,802 57,802
17.  Impairment testing of non-current assets
In accordance with accounting policies and processes, each asset or CGU is evaluated annually at 31 December, to determine 
whether there are any indications of impairment. If any such indications of impairment exist, a formal estimate of the recoverable 
amount is performed.
Management has determined the recoverable amounts in 2017 and 2016 using fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) 
calculations. FVLCD is determined at the cash-generating unit level, in this case being the separate gold production and 
development and exploration assets (Taseevskoye, Unkurtash and Lubov), by discounting the expected cash flows estimated  
by management over the life of the mine:
• MNV* until 2032 (31 December 2016: 2022);
• BG* – 2032 (31 December 2016: 2026);
• Novo – 2033 (31 December 2016: 2029);
• Klen – 2030 (31 December 2016: 2029);
• Kekura – 2036 (31 December 2016: 2030);
• Taseevskoye – 2029 (31 December 2016: 2029);
• Unkurtash – 2037 (31 December 2016: 2037);
• Lubov – 2028 (31 December 2016: 2028).
* Including Blagodatnoe
The calculation of the FVLCD is sensitive to the following assumptions:
• Recoverable reserves and resources;
• Production volumes;
• Real discount rates;
• Metal prices; 
• Capital expenditure; and
• Operating costs.
Recoverable reserves and resources are based on the proven and probable reserves and a portion of resources expected to  
be converted into reserves in existence at the end of the year.
Estimated production volumes are based on detailed life-of-mine plans and take into account development plans for the mines 
approved by management as part of the long-term planning process.
Metal prices are based on management judgement with reference to well-known analysts’ forecasts.
Operating costs are based on management’s best estimate over the life of the mine.
Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each project, taking into consideration the time 
value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets that have not been incorporated in cash flow estimates.

As a result of the recoverable amount analysis performed during the year, no impairment losses were recognised in 2017 (2016: 
impairment losses of US$22.8 million):
 
2016
US$000
Goodwill 12,563
Mine assets 1,478
Stripping activity assets 645
Buildings 4,594
Property, plant and equipment 3,401
Construction in progress 151
Total impairment losses 22,832
An impairment loss was recognised in 2016 in relation to the Belaya Gora project. The triggers for the impairment loss recognition 
were primarily the effect of changes to the mine plan which resulted in lower recovery rate and higher future capital expenditure 
accompanied by higher costs due to a stronger rouble. As part of the Group’s annual impairment assessment, it was determined 
that due to changes in estimates of the mine plan, the carrying amount of goodwill, mine assets, stripping activity assets, buildings, 
property, plant and equipment and construction in progress exceeded their recoverable amounts. The carrying amount of 
goodwill allocated to Belaya Gora has been reduced to nil via the recognition of an impairment loss of US$12.6 million during the 
year ended 31 December 2016. US$10.2 million was recognised as an impairment loss in respect of other non-current assets. 
Any increase in the post-tax discount rate, any decrease in gold prices below US$1,270 per ounce in 2018 or any increase in 
operating or capital costs at Belaya Gora, Klen and Kekura would result in a further impairment of mine properties and property, 
plant and equipment.
For impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, fair value less costs of disposal are determined by 
discounting the post-tax cash flows expected to be generated from future gold production net of selling costs taking into 
account assumptions that market participants would typically use in estimating fair values. These estimates are categorised 
within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Post-tax cash flows are derived from projected production profiles for each asset taking 
into account forward market commodity prices over the relevant period and, where external forward prices are not available,  
the Group’s Board-approved life-of-mine model assumptions are used. As each asset has different reserve and resource 
characteristics and contractual terms, the post-tax cash flows for each asset are calculated using individual economic models 
which include assumptions around the amount of recoverable reserves, production costs, life-of-mine/licence period and the 
selling price of the gold produced.  Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Site restoration provision
In 2017 the Group performed a re-assessment of the site restoration provision at MNV, Novo, BG, Kekura and Klen. The assessments 
were based on government requirements applicable to similar sites that have closed recently, and assumptions regarding the life-of-
mine (which is assumed to close in 2023, 2033, 2032 for plant and infrastructure (2024 for open pit), 2036 and 2030 respectively), 
with site restoration activities expected to be carried out in respective periods (removal of waste, restoration of mine sites).
Current prices for similar activities and a risk-free RUR-denominated government bonds discount rate of 7.1% (2016: 9.3%) has 
been used to calculate the site restoration liability at MNV assuming its closure in 2023.
A risk-free RUR-denominated government bonds discount rate of 7.8% (2016: RUR-denominated government bonds rate  
of 10.1%) has been used to calculate the site restoration liability at Novo assuming its closure in 2033. 
A risk-free RUR-denominated government bonds discount rate for open pit at BG of 7.3% and for plant and infrastructure  
of 8.29% (2016: RUR-denominated government bonds rate of 8.4%) has been used to calculate the site restoration liability  
at BG assuming its closure in 2024 and 2032 accordingly.  Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

25. Provisions continued
A risk-free RUR-denominated government bonds discount rate of 7.8% (2016: RUR-denominated government bonds rate  
of 10.1%) has been used to calculate the site restoration liability at Klen assuming site closure in 2030.
A risk-free RUR-denominated government bonds discount rate of 7.7% (2016: RUR-denominated government bonds rate  
of 10.1%) has been used to calculate the site restoration liability at Kekura assuming site closure in 2036.
The increase in site restoration liability in the amount of US$1.5 million was due to the appreciation of RUR against USD in 2017  
(2016: increase of US$4.6 million).
The total increase in estimation of site restoration liability amounts to US$2.1 million in 2017 (2016: negative US0.5 million).
26. Commitments and contingencies
Operating lease commitments – Group as lessee
The Group has entered into a new commercial lease on its office premises at the end of 2017. This lease has a life of 5 years. 
There are no restrictions placed upon the Group by entering into this lease. The old commercial lease on its office premises 
ended in March 2018. 
The operating lease charge for the year ended 31 December 2017 was US$0.8 million (2016: US$0.9 million).
Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December are as follows:
 
2017 
US$000

assets and US$3.0 million (2016: US$1.0 million) for the acquisition of new machinery.
Finance lease and hire purchase commitments 
The Group has finance lease contracts for various items of plant and equipment at MNV and Novo at interest rates between 4.5% 
and 9.9% for USD lease contracts and 12.8% for RUB lease contracts. Future minimum lease payments under finance leases and

Contingent liabilities
Management has identified possible tax claims within the various jurisdictions in which the Group operates totalling 
US$2.2 million as at 31 December 2017 (at 31 December 2016: US$2.1 million). In management’s view, these possible tax claims  
will likely not result in a future outflow of resources; consequently no provision is required in respect of these matters. 
In addition, because a number of fiscal periods remain open to review by the tax authorities, there is a risk that transactions and 
interpretations that have not been identified by management or challenged in the past may be challenged by the authorities in 
the future, although this risk significantly diminishes with the passage of time. It is not practical to determine the amount of any 
such potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome.
Notwithstanding the above risks, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that 
the Group has complied with all regulations, and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable. Where the risk  
of outflow of resources is probable, the Group has accrued tax liabilities based on management’s best estimate.

28. Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise bank loans and trade payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities  
is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various financial assets such as trade receivables and cash and 
short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
Gold price risk
In 2017 as well as in prior years, the Group is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in prevailing market commodity prices on the  
mix of mineral products it produces. The Group’s policy is to manage these risks through the use of contract-based prices with 
customers. The Group continued its no hedge policy in relation to the gold price.
Embedded derivative 
Novo as a concentrate producer and seller has contracts where price risk is retained for a specified period after the sale has 
occurred. For more information please refer to Note 3 ‘Revenue recognition’. 
Foreign currency risk
Taking into account that gold prices are formed in international markets and denominated in US dollars, the Group seeks to 
mitigate the foreign currency risk by raising its debt facilities and most of its trade liabilities denominated in US dollars. However 
as a result of investing and operating activities in Russia, the Group’s statement of financial position can still be affected by 
movements in the RUR/USD exchange rates. Besides, the Group also has transactional currency exposures connected with 
operations denominated in GBP. 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the EUR, RUR and GBP exchange rates, with 
all other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax (due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets 
and liabilities).

2017 10% 422 5% 30
  -10% (422) -5% (30)
There is no other foreign currency impact on equity.
Credit risk
Maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by carrying amount of financial assets. Credit risk arises from a debtor’s inability 
to make payment of its obligations to the Group as they become due (without taking into account the fair value of any guarantee 
or pledged assets); and by non-compliance by counterparties in transactions in cash, which is limited to balances deposited in 
banks and accounts receivable at the reporting dates. To manage this risk, the Group deposits its surplus funds in highly rated 
financial institutions, establishes conservative credit policies and constantly evaluates the conditions of the market in which it 
conducts its activities. The Group sells the produced gold to recognised, creditworthy banks. The sold gold is being paid for 
immediately after the sale. Therefore, there are no trade receivables associated with the gold trade.

Liquidity risk
The Group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using a recurring liquidity planning tool. This tool considers the maturity  
of both its financial investments and financial assets (e.g. accounts receivable, other financial assets) and projected cash flows 
from operations.
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts, 
bank loans, finance leases and hire purchase contracts. 
Please refer to Note 23 for information on the financial covenants the Group is bound by.

Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to 
provide returns for shareholders (please see the Group’s dividends policy), benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an 
optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. Capital comprises equity and debt financing. For information related  
to equity, refer to consolidated statement of changes in equity. For information on debt financing refer to Note 23. In order to 
ensure an appropriate return for shareholders’ capital invested in the Company, management thoroughly evaluates all material 
projects and potential acquisitions and has them approved by the Board where applicable.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market interest rates. Exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to long-term debt obligations with 
floating interest rates. The Group mitigates this risk through signing financing arrangements mostly at fixed rates. The Group’s 
treasury function performs analysis of current interest rates and in case of changes in market fixed or floating interest rates, 
management may consider the refinancing of a particular debt on more favourable terms. As at 31 December 2017 the Group  
has outstanding bank debt in the amount of US$207.4 million (2016: US$211.6 million).  Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

29. Financial assets and liabilities
The current values of the financial assets and financial liabilities approximate their fair values. The fair value of the financial assets 
and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing 
parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
• The carrying amounts of financial instruments, such as cash and short-term deposits, short-term accounts receivable and 
payable and other current liabilities approximate their fair value.
• Fixed-rate interest-bearing loans and borrowings are evaluated based on current market interest rates.
• The fair value of the embedded derivative is based on quoted market prices.
Coupon bonds
During 2016 all bonds were sold and, as a result of selling, the Group received US$20.1 million and no coupon interest. 
The bonds were treated as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Fair value of those bonds was determined based on 
quoted bid prices (source: Bloomberg). 
The table below sets out the movement in fair value of the bonds.

Fair value hierarchy
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either 
directly or indirectly
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable 
market data.

30. Dividends
The final dividend for the year ending 31 December 2016 in the amount of US$22.6 million was paid on 12 May 2017. 
The Group paid an interim dividend of GBP 0.0498 per share in respect of H1 2017 (2016: interim dividend of GBP 0.050 per 
share) which resulted in an aggregate interim dividend payment of US$21.3 million (2016: US$19.8 million). The interim dividend 
was paid on 3 October 2017. 
The Board has recommended a second interim dividend of GBP 0.0542 per share which, taking into account the interim dividend 
paid in October 2017, gives a total dividend of GBP 0.104 per share for the year 2017 (2016: GBP 0.104 per share). The total payout 
exceeds the minimum amount prescribed in the Company’s dividend policy, reflecting the availability of additional funds for 
disbursement to shareholders.
The dividend will be paid on 25 May 2018 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 27 April 2018 (the record 
date). The ex-dividend date will be 26 April 2018.
The Company offers an option for shareholders to elect to receive their dividends in US dollars. Payments for dividends in  
US dollars will be fixed at an exchange rate of 1.4329 GBP/US$, or US$ 0.0777 per share. To receive payment in US dollars, 
shareholders should complete and file the Currency Election Form no later than the record date (Election Deadline), 27 April 
2018. The form and instructions for filing it are available on the Highland Gold website at address: http://www.highlandgold.com/
