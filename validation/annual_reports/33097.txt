4 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 Q&A
with David Atkins
2014 has been a year of momentum for 
Hammerson. Our retail focus is now fully 
immersed across the business and our  
strategic investment activity has accelerated  
our future growth ambitions. Here, David  
answers some key questions.
Q
What have been the highlights for the 
business in 2014? 
A
The year has been marked by a number of achievements, 
and I believe the strong numbers we have delivered  
reflect the progress we have made across the business.  
Key 2014 highlights include:
• The successful opening of Les Terrasses du Port in 
Marseille which resulted in £107 million profit on  
cost for the business. The 62,800m2 shopping and 
leisure development combines our best design and 
operational expertise and the positive response from 
consumers and retailers has been truly overwhelming, 
with over 8 million visitors to date. 
• Notable progress across our development pipeline 
with planning approval granted at Brent Cross 
Cricklewood, and at our Whitgift JV in Croydon  
and starts on site at both Victoria Gate in Leeds  
and WestQuay Watermark in Southampton.
• Securing robust shareholder support for our  
£399 million share placing. A significant portion  
of the proceeds has been deployed to acquire 
the remaining 40% of Highcross, Leicester from  
our JV partner. 
• Extending our strategic exposure to the European 
outlet sector with a £100 million investment in the 
newly created VIA Outlets venture. The 47% stake  
was financed through the share placing.
Q
How have consumer and occupier markets 
evolved over the past 12 months? 
A
A year ago we saw the first tentative signs of growing 
consumer confidence and increasing retailer demand for 
physical space. I am pleased to report that in the UK we 
have seen significant improvement over the year in retail 
sales growth which was up 2.6% across our centres. This 
momentum in consumer spending is now driving stronger 
demand from retailers for our prime retail space, which is 
starting to reflect positively in rental values. 
Importantly this story of renewed consumer growth  
and occupier demand is not just London centric. We  
have seen strong performance in our centres in major cities 
across the UK. During 2014 we signed 413 leases totalling 
179,000m² of retail space. Like-for-like net rental income for 
the year was 2.1% up on 2013 and occupancy remained 
strong at 97.5%. Despite continuing economic challenges 
in France, the success of Les Terrasses du Port indicates that 
consumer demand remains strong for the right retailing 
propositions. At Le Jeu de Paume in Beauvais we are 
encouraged by the letting progress of the development, 
with 62% already pre-let. The centre will provide 23,800m
2
 
of retailing and leisure facilities and is on track to open  
later this year. 
Q
Will your investment in the luxury and outlet 
markets continue to grow?
A
Global appetite for designer and luxury goods continues, 
with research from our Considered Consumer report 
indicating that one third of shoppers spent more on luxury 
purchases in 2014 compared with the preceding 12 month 
period. We are the only REIT with strategic exposure to  
the sector and we continue to see good growth from  
our investment in Value Retail. 
The newly created VIA Outlets venture with our partners 
Value Retail, APG and Meyer Bergman further increases  
our scale in European outlets. The newly acquired portfolio 
in major European cities has the potential to deliver  
strong returns through the combined expertise of this 
unique partnership. 
There is a clear and growing requirement for premium 
outlet space from retailers and we are enormously  
excited by the new opportunities that this opens up  
for Hammerson.

STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT CONTINUED
Q
Sustainability underpins the focus for the 
business. What have been the standout 
achievements in the past 12 months?
A
We have made significant sustainability progress during 
2014. We achieved BREEAM Excellent at Les Terrasses  
du Port, our first shopping centre development in France.  
In the UK we have been working with retail customers 
delivering much needed apprenticeships at Highcross  
in Leicester. 2014 also saw the launch of the Big Positive 
Weekend, our first national sustainability roadshow, which 
reached nine cities in over nine weekends across the  
UK portfolio. 
Q
How has the team evolved to enable the 
business to deliver strong performance?
A
During 2014 we introduced a number of new initiatives 
and targets to support our objective of promoting diversity 
and inclusion within the business. These targets are 
detailed on page 35 of the Report.
We have welcomed additional talent to the business  
with  a number of new colleagues joining the team from 
non-property backgrounds. While we are still a property 
company the business has been significantly enriched 
through the skills and knowledge of experts from different 
sectors who have bolstered our retail and digital expertise 
and provided a fresh approach. 
At the end of 2014 we opened a new office in Reading, 
which is the operational hub for the UK business. 2015 will 
see us relocate to a new head office in King’s Cross. The 
move signals a continued commitment towards our retail 
focus and, along with enhancing operational efficiency  
and reducing costs, I believe it will foster more creativity 
and collaboration across the teams.
Q
Which qualities differentiate Hammerson’s 
shopping destinations from the competition?
A
We believe the key to winning in retail property is to own 
and manage destinations which excel against each of our 
six unique areas of focus, set out on page 3 of the Report.
By applying a rigorous approach to this Product Framework, 
we ensure that our shopping centres and retail parks bring 
together the best in physical and digital retailing to offer 
consumers the most enjoyable shopping experience. 
Q
What are the business priorities and outlook 
for 2015?
A
Planning for, and the development of, major retail schemes 
in Leeds and London will continue to be a focus for the 
team in 2015. Including Croydon and Brent Cross, these 
projects will deliver over 400,000m
2
 of new retail space  
over the coming years. Our plans to redevelop the  
Whitgift Centre and Centrale in partnership with Westfield 
moved a step closer when the outline application for the 
development was formally consented in February 2014. 
Our strategic focus on the luxury sector will continue in 
2015 as we look to increase our exposure to premium 
outlets alongside our partners in the VIA Outlets venture. 
OUTLOOK 
The recovery in UK consumer sentiment has continued to strengthen 
as economic indicators have improved. With diverse regional exposure 
through our portfolio of prime retailing destinations, I believe that 
Hammerson is well-placed to benefit from this continuing trend.  
In France, the overwhelming success of our new scheme in Marseille, 
together with improving footfall figures, give us confidence that 
consumer demand remains strong for the right retail proposition. 
Despite continuing economic challenges, we expect trading in  
France to remain stable in 2015.
It is anticipated that growing demand from global investors for 
high-quality retail assets will continue in 2015, potentially compressing 
yields and boosting capital values further. Against this backdrop,  
I am confident that Hammerson will continue to deliver strong  
returns for its shareholders.

INTRODUCTION 
2014 was a strong year for the performance of the retail real estate 
market in the UK and Europe.
Retail property offers a number of fundamental attractions versus 
other categories of commercial real estate, including sustainable  
and long-term returns, with lower volatility and a granular and diverse 
tenant mix which mitigates certain risks.
Hammerson’s assets are in the sub sectors of prime shopping centres, 
retail parks and premium outlet villages. We aim to be among the 
market leaders in each of our sub sectors so as to capitalise on the 
favourable market trends identified and exercise scale efficiencies. 
MARKET DESCRIPTION AND POSITION 
Prime Shopping Centres
Prime shopping centres are those that are dominant in their 
catchment, include large anchor stores and flagship units, and  
offer consumers a lifestyle experience alongside their shopping  
visit. The relative attractiveness of prime shopping centres, against 
other secondary centres or high street locations, drives growing 
demand from retail tenants. 
OUR MARKETS
The rents achievable at shopping centres are driven by their  
size, location, demographic catchment and competing centres.  
High tenant demand and low vacancy drives growth in ERV  
(estimated rental value). 
In France, leases are linked to a price inflation index and this is also 
reflected in the rental performance and portfolio value in France.
With ownership stakes in 22 prime shopping centres across the UK  
and France and a total of 1.1 million square metres of retail and leisure 
space, Hammerson is a leading European player. Hammerson is a top  
3 owner of large shopping centres in the UK and France. We have over 
200 different international retail brands in our shopping centres and 
13% of our space is let to catering and leisure.
Retail Parks
Retail parks are predominantly situated in out of town locations which 
are most easily accessible by car. Units are on average larger and rents 
are lower per square metre than in shopping centres. Retailers’ demand 
for efficient space to meet consumers’ growing need for convenient 
and accessible shopping locations drives rental growth in retail parks.
Hammerson is the second largest direct owner of retail parks in the  
UK with 500,000 square metres across 21 assets. The total UK market 
comprises 11 million square metres and is a fragmented market.
Premium Outlets
There are approximately 200 outlet centres across Europe. Ownership is 
fragmented and the largest three operators Value Retail, McArthur Glen 
and Neinver together account for around 25% of the market.
The premium outlets market in Europe comprises outlet centres which 
are of an institutional investment quality, and this market can be broadly 
categorised according to the type of customer it serves. At the high end 
there are outlet centres that attract luxury and fashion consumers; the 
middle segment caters to the mainstream fashion customer; and the 
third segment to the high street customer.
Value Retail, in which Hammerson is a major investor, is positioned at  
the top level, with its unique shopping-tourism Villages serving the 
international luxury and fashion consumer. It has nine Villages serving 
major cities across Europe.
Hammerson is also invested with a 47% stake in VIA Outlets. VIA Outlets 
currently owns six centres which predominantly cater to customers in 
the mainstream fashion segment.
Demand for outlet space is driven by retailers’ desire to sell excess 
inventory while maintaining brand equity. The supply of new outlet 
centres is limited by planning consents and the availability of excess 
inventory to sell.
Outlet centre rents are usually directly linked to tenant sales. Sales  
growth for outlet centres has been 7-9% per annum over the last five 
years (source: Cushman & Wakefield). Investment yields for outlet  
centres are high, around 6-7% across Europe.

STRATEGIC REPORT GROWING DEMAND  
FOR PRIME RETAIL SPACE
In 2014, an improvement in consumer confidence and spending supported demand for space  
in our prime retail locations in the UK, and the French consumer backdrop stabilised. Our tenants’ 
strategies in retail, food & beverage and leisure continue to evolve and we are adapting with  
them to match their needs with the needs of the consumer.
OCCUPIER MARKETS
Consumer trends – The Considered Consumer
Consumers’ habits are evolving. Our research shows they are taking a 
more ‘considered’ approach: browsing; researching; and comparing for 
longer. The internet plays an increasing role for retail transactions and 
as a result when consumers visit shopping centres they expect more 
excitement and entertainment. 
Online orders now account for 11% of retail sales in the UK, up from  
6% in 2009. The role of physical retail space is changing as a result. 
Retailers are rationalising store portfolios requiring fewer, larger, 
better-ranged stores to support their digital platform. 
Fulfillment of online orders is driving strong growth in click & collect.
Retailers recognise that a multi-channel strategy is essential to meet 
customer needs. Physical retail space is critical for brand interaction, 
which is supported by the whole shopping centre experience. 
Retailers such as John Lewis now see more online purchases collected 
in store than delivered to home. The intensity of online promotional 
activity around Black Friday in November served to highlight the 
logistical challenges of servicing growing online demand. Retail parks’ 
traditional strengths of convenience, accessibility, free parking and 
proximity to food stores makes them ideal to support click & collect.
Online sales are growing in France but with less penetration than  
in the UK. The click & collect model is popular in France, however 
shoppers favour a locker model versus collecting in store.

CONSUMER RECOVERY
The recovery in consumer confidence in 2014 was significant in  
the UK and stable in France. The combination of supportive benign 
domestic economic factors in the UK – low interest rates, lower  
energy prices, real wage stabilisation and strong GDP growth –  
is driving consumer confidence.
“ Spending power at record 
highs” – Lloyds Bank 
Spending Power Report
As a result, retail sales volumes grew 3.8% in the UK in 2014, the 
strongest annual growth since 2004 and the market saw the longest 
period of sustained monthly growth since November 2007. Retail  
sales growth was more evenly spread across all regions of the UK.

TENANT DEMAND
Retailers are reporting a confident outlook. A BRC survey in the UK 
revealed 76% of retailers expect sales to improve in 2015 compared  
with last year, while 67% said their investment levels were set to increase. 
Administration levels of UK retailers are running lower than previous 
years limiting the drag which new vacancies have on rents. 
This retailer confidence translated into ERV growth, which in  
2014 turned positive for the first time since the financial crisis, 
according to PMA. 
UK shopping centre ERV growth was 0.7% in 2014. ERV trends also 
reflect changing retailer demand with large prime shopping centres 
outperforming secondary and also smaller prime shopping centres. 
UK retail park ERV growth was 0.1% in 2014. As well as traditional bulky 
goods retailers, fashion and high street brands (eg M&S, Debenhams) 
are taking space in parks, resulting in higher market ERV growth at 
these type of ‘fashion parks’ . 
INVESTMENT MARKET
The persistence of a low interest rate environment is driving record 
investment into direct property: the so-called ‘hunt for yield’ . Forecast 
muted economic growth across Europe and low inflation could  
mean European property continues to look very attractively priced 
through into 2015.
Direct investment in UK shopping centres was at levels not seen  
since 2006. As well as domestic transactions (70%), Asian investors 
accounted for 13% of total volume and North American investors 10%.

Transaction values (LHS, £bn) No. of transactions (RHS)
UK shopping centre investment volumes were at record levels  
as shown in the chart above.
Transaction volumes in retail parks exceeded £2.0bn in 2014 
(2013:£1.5bn) with 43 transactions (2013: 44). 
French retail property markets saw a record level of transactions  
in 2014, up 45% on 2013. This was driven by four major portfolio 
transactions which together represented 51% of the total volume. 
The weight of capital pushed investment yields lower across all  
retail sub-sectors. 
OUTLOOK
With low interest rates, low inflation and lower energy prices expected 
to persist through 2015, consumer spending power in the UK is 
forecast to continue rising, driving further growth in retail sales.  
The economic outlook in France is still not supportive of a definitive  
upturn in consumer confidence.
Driven by the continued growth of online sales and rationalisation  
of retailers’ portfolios, there will be greater polarisation in  
demand for premium UK retail space which favours rents across  
Hammerson’s portfolio. 
Indexation of rents in France was 0.8% in 2014 and will be flat in 2015. 
Yield compression, leading to increased capital values, is expected  
to continue in the UK and France in 2015, although not at the same 
rates as in 2014.

Director, Upstream 
Sustainability Services
Hammerson’s embedded 
approach to sustainability 
drives environmental 
efficiencies in asset 
management and 
development, as well as 
enhanced customer and 
community relationships.  
It is this approach that is  
now unlocking commercial 
opportunities for the  
ultimate benefit of 
Hammerson’s shareholders. 
Charts 7, 8 and 9 show our performance in carbon, water and waste 
management. Further information is available on pages 28-30.
26 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 OUR RESPONSE
Building on these findings we have developed an ambitious set of new sustainability targets  
designed to take the business to a new level in terms of sustainability leadership. The targets are 
arranged under seven key themes drawn from the findings of the materiality study.
Lead & challenge
The transition to a sustainable business 
model requires leaders to challenge 
current practice. We aim to lead the 
way, working with our retailers, 
communities and suppliers to change 
the status quo. Key target areas will be 
whole life costing , the links between 
sustainability, value and risk and 
understanding the carbon footprint  
of our business.
Protect & enhance
We recognise our responsibility to 
protect the environment by minimising 
our resource consumption but also to 
enhance it through restorative projects 
and renewables. Key targets include 
20% reduction in our like-for-like  
CO
2
 emissions by 2020 and installing 
2mWh of renewable capacity across 
the portfolio.
Monitor & evolve
Measurement, monitoring and transparency are key to progress. We will publish annual targets that support our five-year targets  
and continue to report our progress annually. Our internal governance structure will support the evolution of our approach to 
sustainability as our teams learn from each other, our stakeholders and our results.
Our current targets run until the end of the 2015 calendar year. Our new targets will take effect from 1 January 2016.
Innovate & learn
To create the retail destinations of the 
future, we have to invest in trialling 
new approaches. Key targets under this 
theme include establishing a portfolio 
of “Pioneer Places” to showcase and  
test innovative sustainability solutions 
before successes are mainstreamed 
across the portfolios. 
Serve & invest
Our assets deliver important social 
value in our communities, measured in 
jobs, skills , civic pride and investment. 
We have set ambitious new targets  
to understand and maximise these 
place-making impacts as we strive  
to ensure all our assets are truly  
Positive Places.
Partner & collaborate 
Systemic change requires active 
collaboration with like-minded 
partners. Our stakeholder-led approach 
reflects this and key targets have  
been set for each group. These include 
establishing a sustainability learning 
group with our customers, an 
engagement programme for our 
investors and further development  
of our supply chain survey.
Develop & inspire 
We are investing in developing  
the skills of our people, as well as 
recognising and rewarding those 
delivering change. New approaches 
will be supported with role  
specific training and ensuring  
personal objectives are linked  
to sustainability outcomes.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY CONTINUED
CUSTOMERS
SUPPLIERS
One of our biggest sustainability events for 2014 was The Big Positive 
Weekend, our sustainability road show. This was our first consumer 
facing event and the first sustainability road show ever to be taken 
across a whole shopping centre portfolio. 
The event generated over 200,000 positive actions and connected 
with 2.4 million people to raise awareness of their own power to  
make a positive change. Sponsorship from Nationwide, Eon, Renault, 
Sealife Centres and H&M is a clear indication of the appetite amongst 
the consumer facing brands for a platform to communicate their 
sustainability initiatives. 
67% OF PURCHASES DRIVEN  
BY ETHICAL SUPPLY CHAIN*
In 2014, 62 new suppliers completed our sustainable supply chain 
survey, three of them achieving platinum status. Detailed results  
are available in our Annual Supplier Report. 
In 2015 we will update the supply chain survey as part of our ongoing 
monitoring. The increasingly sophisticated approaches to these issues 
adopted by many of our suppliers to these issues makes it important 
to refresh our questions.

INVESTORS
Active engagement with our shareholders during 2014 confirmed 
strong interest in sustainability amongst our major investors and  
an expectation that we will continue to perform as industry leaders  
in this area. 
Working with our Joint Venture partners we have agreed forward 
funding of major investment in LED lighting at Bullring. Once installed 
this will deliver immediate returns in reduced carbon emissions and  
is expected to pay for itself in under five years. During 2015 we will  
be investing in further LED lighting projects across the portfolio.
A new way to communicate with investors
The launch of our Positive Places web pages this year has established  
a more dynamic, engaging way of communicating with our investors. 
Our performance against targets and our Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI) and EPRA compliant reporting remain a key element of our 
communications and are available alongside regularly updated

CONNECTED REPORTING FRAMEWORK
A CONSISTENT REPORTING FRAMEWORK 
Hammerson has reported extensively on its sustainability performance since 2008. For the past six years Hammerson reporting has  
complied with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. In doing so, we aim to provide data and disclosures that facilitate comparison  
with other real estate companies and enable stakeholders to gain an objective view of our approach and performance. All our data are 
available on the Sustainability pages of our website.

Highcross in Leicester is one of five centres across the UK piloting 
the Retail Pathways project led by the BCSC Education Trust. 
Three young people have taken up apprenticeships and will be 
working with six different retailers and the centre management 
team over a 12- month placement. The training they receive 
through this innovative scheme will provide a firm foundation  
for their future careers.
Let’ s Talk Shop
At Brent Cross Shopping Centre the Let’s Talk Shop initiative 
supported by London Borough of Barnet and National Skills 
Academy for Retail has placed 18 people into jobs at the 
Centre. By providing a single point of contact for retailers and 
training support for applicants this initiative has streamlined the 
application process, making it easier for employers to alert 
potential employees to forthcoming roles. 
COMMUNITIES
Our community engagement programme focuses on four key areas: 
• Skills and employment
• Health and wellbeing
• Young people
• Regeneration

or training during its fist year, saving over £150k in public spending. Read more about our 
Lives not knives programme on http://sustainability.hammerson.com
Achieving our ambition of creating Positive Places relies on the skills 
and enthusiasm of our employees. During 2014 we have maintained 
our sustainability training objectives delivering a range of role specific 
training in addition to the basic training provided through corporate 
induction. This includes sustainability away-days, learning lunches  
and breakfast briefings. All new joiners also receive role specific training 
with a member of the sustainability team. Our Centre-based staff 
receive regular, role appropriate training on environmental 
management issues and systems. 
EMPLOYEES
Making sure our staff remain inspired and enthusiastic is supported  
by providing opportunities to tackle something outside the routine, 
especially whilst raising money or contributing practically to a good 
cause. 2014 saw many such events, including our annual Community 
Day, a Paris to Marseille bike ride, and a trip to Haiti to support the Haiti 
Hospital Appeal. More details on this event and on our work with our 
charity partners is available on page 34.

LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT 
CAPABILITY
During 2014 we focused on improving management capability  
within the business. 
For the first time, we developed a clear and concise competence 
model for those who manage teams of people. The Management 
Framework, developed by a representative group of managers  
from across the organisation, was launched in spring 2014.  
The Management Framework clearly defines the capabilities  
and skills we want to see from our management teams.
Furthermore, we redesigned our comprehensive recruitment 
processes to incorporate the new Management Framework and our 
management assessment centres in the UK now include a greater 
focus on management capability than ever before.
The Management Framework also gave us the benchmark against 
which to design a completely new Management Development 
Programme. Aimed at existing and potential managers, the 
Programme was launched to much acclaim in the autumn and will 
form the foundation of our management development. With this  
in mind, a comprehensive schedule has been planned for 2015.
ORGANISATIONAL DESIGN  
AND STRUCTURE
Our commitment to operate the most effective organisational 
structures and to maximise the contribution of our people through 
collaborative working continued throughout 2014.
This was best evidenced by the opening of our new Reading office, 
Aquis House, where our integrated UK Finance team, the recently 
restructured Group IT Infrastructure function, HR administration and  
a number of UK shopping centre support roles are based. As a result  
of this move, 25 employees will be leaving the business in 2015.
Recent changes to our Asset Management, Leasing, Development  
and Property Management functions – designed, in part, to allow for 
greater scalability – enabled us to integrate new employees easily  
into these teams during the course of the year.
Our group-wide Marketing function, restructured in 2013 to improve 
efficiency and better leverage the expertise of our UK and France 
teams, saw significant economies of scale whilst delivering a broad 
range of marketing activity across our portfolio.
TALENT MANAGEMENT AND 
RESOURCING
The Company was successful in retaining and developing talent  
whilst attracting high-calibre individuals to the business in 2014.
Voluntary staff turnover across the UK and France remained low at 
10.3% despite improved labour market conditions.
Our established approach to performance management, including the 
bi-annual assessment of employees’ potential as well as performance, 
contributed towards a high number of promotions during the year;  
13 in the UK and six in France.
Primarily driven by the progression of the Company’s development 
projects and the Reading office move, the need for external 
recruitment was high and 96 new people joined Hammerson during 
the course of the year. A number of restructuring initiatives resulted  
in 14 employees leaving the business during the year.
In order to improve our Company-wide approach to talent 
management and succession planning we objectively evaluated the 
majority of UK and France roles during the course of the year. Using  
the established Hay Group evaluation methodology, we developed 
the Hammerson Career Framework. 
Going forward we will use the Career Framework to help identify 
career paths for high-potential employees and our aspiration is for  
this to support the mobility of our workforce across the UK and  
France. Furthermore, we will use the Career Framework to enhance  
our succession planning practices within the organisation, particularly 
for senior management and business-critical roles.

2014 was a year in which we progressed our people agenda significantly. 
Embedding our values, organisational change and resourcing were key areas of focus. In addition,  
our actions to improve management capability and develop talent will strengthen the business  
in the years ahead. Positive steps were taken to improve collaboration and working practices 
throughout the organisation and our diversity and inclusion agenda was progressed.

APPLICATIONS TO OUR UK GRADUATE PROGRAMME DURING 2014,  
RESULTING IN TWO APPOINTMENTS
I passed my APC (Assessment of Professional Competence)  
in April 2014, having successfully completed five six-monthly 
rotations across key areas of the business as part of the 
graduate development programme. The high quality of 
training and flexibility offered by the programme provided  
me with the confidence and ability to pass my APC and to 
accept an asset management position within the shopping 
centre portfolio. I am enthusiastic about the future success  
of the graduate development programme and excited  
about opportunities for my career with Hammerson. 
THE SURVEYORS OF THE FUTURE
The Hammerson Graduate Programme was 
launched in 2011 and our first graduate surveyors 
joined the Company in the autumn of that year.
Introduced with the purpose of developing  
our own surveyors for the future, the  
programme has been designed to give  
graduates experience in asset management, 
leasing, development and investment whilst 
working towards chartered status with the  
Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors.
2014 was a significant year with both our  
first recruits – Shelley Taylor and Robert van  
Vliet – gaining their RICS accreditation and 
subsequently moving into asset management 
roles within the organisation. 
With further graduates already on the 
programme and more set to join the Company  
in 2015, we are well placed to nurture our  
own talent in the future.

COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT
The 2014 Community Day in the UK was our sixth to date and was  
met with the usual enthusiasm from head office and shopping centre 
employees. 214 employees participated in 15 events ranging from the 
Hammerson Games with 220 young people from Whitmore, Sebright, 
Daubenay and Burbage Primary Schools to painting, weeding and 
gardening at the Coram headquarters in central London. This once 
again proved a valuable team building event, providing an opportunity 
for employees across the business to work together.
Every two years employees select two charity partners with whom  
to work. The selected charities receive a cash donation and, more 
importantly, an opportunity to develop a relationship with the 
business. Employees are incredibly supportive of this process and 
highly engaged with the charities selected, which for 2014/2016 are 
1412
VOLUNTEERING DAYS
CULTURE AND VALUES
2014 was a year in which our values – Ambition, Responsibility, 
Collaboration and Respect – started to become embedded within  
the business and have a real impact on the way we work. 
Good internal communication is important to us and in 2014 an 
increasingly collaborative approach was enhanced through regular 
staff briefings and the introduction of a single Intranet for the entire 
organisation. As a matter of course, the Company regularly consults 
with its employees on a wide range of topics such as changes  
to reward, our approach to internal communications and flexible 
working. Internal updates on business news and performance  
take place on a regular basis. 
Our staff conference, held at Les Terrasses du Port, was themed  
around the values with awards given to those employees who  
had demonstrated them to best effect. 
Within our shopping centres there were numerous examples of 
values-driven activities with our participation at Highcross in Retail  
Path being of particular note. This new initiative, launched by the BCSC 
Educational Trust and the National Skills Academy for Retail, aims to 
attract young people into the property and retail sectors and support 
their development through its high-quality apprenticeship programme.
A YEAR IN SHOPPING CENTRES
In France, the opening of Les Terrasses du Port was certainly the 
highlight but, in addition, the decision to in-source shopping centre 
management services will enable us to maximise performance  
and improve synergies across the portfolio in the years ahead.
In the UK, WestQuay, Highcross and The Oracle maintained their 
Investors in People accreditations and the taking over of the asset 
management at Cabot Circus resulted in 11 new employees joining  
the Company. Growth in our Property Management, T echnical Services 
and Car Parking teams enabled us to deliver an increasing number of 
cross-portfolio solutions, all with the aim of improving performance  
and standards in all our shopping centres.
Samaritans and Elifar. Employees are also encouraged to support  
other charities through our match funding programme. In 2014, 
£18,989 was raised by employees for 22 charities, which was 
supplemented by £6,970 in company contributions. 
In May six employees ventured to Haiti for two weeks to show their 
support for the Haiti Hospital Appeal. With nearly £11,500 raised our 
team were able to see first-hand how far that money goes. With some 
of the funds raised, the Appeal was able to buy nearly 500 banana  
tree roots which our team loaded, unloaded and planted. To further 
support the appeal, we sent a container funded by the Guernsey 
Overseas Aid Commission, loaded up with solar panels and batteries 
for a backup system, clothes donated by Primark and medical 
equipment from the Swiss Paraplegic Foundation.
34 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
During 2014 the Company enhanced a number of business practices 
which support our objective of promoting diversity within the 
organisation. In addition, we advanced a number of new initiatives  
as well as introducing clearly stated targets for the first time.
In the summer our Group Executive Committee attended a workshop 
on unconscious bias. Delivered by Brook Graham, our diversity and 
inclusion advisors, the session was designed to broaden awareness of 
diversity in the workplace and to foster debate about actions to take  
in order to create a more diverse workforce. Our UK and France senior 
management teams will attend similar workshops during 2015.
We continue to place particular emphasis on gender diversity when 
recruiting. Of the 96 new employees recruited in 2014, 52 were female 
(54%) with many of these in senior professional roles. Seven of our  
18 shopping centre General Managers are female.
Our 2014 graduate intake was once again split 50/50 by gender, 
as it has been since the programme’s inception in 2011.
The Company continued to support a range of activities focused  
on broadening awareness of the property industry, particularly 
amongst under-represented groups in society. Specific actions taken 
during 2014 included the ongoing sponsorship of the Pathways  
to Property scheme, participation in the Capital South mentoring 
scheme in Croydon, sponsorship and participation of Retail Path and 
the promotion of Inspiring the Future events across the business. 
The latter part of 2014 saw us introduce a number of objectives, 
against which we will measure our progress. Specifically, these are:
• That women will hold a minimum of 30% of the senior 
management roles throughout the organisation.
• That women are represented in no less than 30% of roles 
identified in the senior management succession plan.
• That the gender gap for employee engagement, as measured  
by our bi-annual employee survey, is no greater than 5%.
The Board’s stated aim is to maintain 20% female representation  
at Board level whenever practicable.
The Company welcomes and fully considers all suitable applications  
for employment, irrespective of gender, race, ethnicity, religion, age, 
sexual orientation or disability. All employees are eligible to participate 
in career development and promotion opportunities. Support also 
exists for employees who become disabled to continue in their 
employment or to be retrained for other suitable roles.

STRATEGIC REPORT During 2014, we reviewed the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) by which we monitor our business.  
This was to ensure they provided the most appropriate metrics for monitoring the achievement of  
the Group’s three strategic priorities which are designed to deliver value for shareholders. In order 
to better align the KPIs with these strategic priorities we have introduced three new KPIs: Cost ratio, 
Leasing activity and Global emissions intensity ratio. The Group’s seven KPIs are split between  
financial and operational measures and the KPIs and associated benchmarks are set out below.

Description
We compare the total return achieved by the Group’s property 
investments on a proportionally consolidated basis, including 
premium outlets, against the IPD Retail Property Universe. The IPD 
benchmark is weighted 70:30 between the UK and French indices  
to be comparable with the geographical allocation of the Group’s 
properties. As the final 2014 IPD indices are not published until  
after the publication of this Annual Report, the benchmark is 
management’s best estimate using available IPD data.

We invest in, create and operate high-quality real estate which is 
attractive to both customers and consumers and provides a platform 
from which to grow income and value to deliver returns in excess  
of the benchmark.
Performance
13.6% (IPD 12.5%) (2013: 8.5% (IPD 8.1%)) 
During 2014, the Group’s property investments produced a total return 
of 13.6% which was 110bp ahead of the estimated IPD benchmark. 
The Group’s outperformance was principally due to our premium 
outlets business which delivered a total return of 19.9%.
2015 focus
We believe prime shopping centres, convenient retail parks and 
premium outlets of the type in which Hammerson invests will 
outperform other classes of retail real estate over the longer term.
Description
The annual growth in the Group’s net rental income (NRI) for 
investment properties owned throughout the current and  
prior periods, excluding the impact of acquisitions, disposals, 
developments and exchange rate movements.
Link to strategy

Net rental income from the property portfolio is the primary source  
of the Group’s operating cash flow and the main contributor to 
earnings. We aim to grow like-for-like NRI through leasing vacant  
space, capturing uplifts from rent reviews and indexation, tenant 
engineering and other ‘value adding’ initiatives.
Performance
2.1% (2013: 2.1%) 
On a like-for-like basis, net rental income grew by 2.1% for the portfolio 
in 2014, above our target of 2.0%. Income from UK and French 
shopping centres grew by 2.2% and 2.0% respectively. UK retail parks 
income increased by 2.4%.
2015 focus
Demand for new retail space continues to improve, particularly in  
the UK. Near-term lease expiries, breaks and rent reviews provide the 
opportunity to increase rental income and implement tenant rotation 
to improve the quality of the retail offer across our portfolio.

36 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 The remuneration of Executive Directors is aligned closely with the Group’s  
KPIs through the Company’s Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) and Long Term Incentive  
Plan (LTIP). 
For 2014, the AIP contains all four of the Financial KPIs, and Total Group property 
returns and the Growth in EPS KPIs are also included as performance measures  
within a number of the annual LTIP awards. 
The operational KPIs are consistent with the Group’s strategic priorities and good 
performance in these areas should deliver improved financial results for the Group.
Details of Executive Director remuneration is included in the Remuneration Report

Adjusted EPS is the Group’s principal profit measure and is an indicator 
of the level of recurring profit available for distribution to shareholders 
as dividends. Sustained growth in earnings reflects the sound capital 
structure of the Group and will support a progressive dividend policy 
and increased shareholder returns.
Performance
3.5% (2013: 10.5%)
In 2014, adjusted EPS increased by 0.8 pence, or 3.5%, to 23.9 pence. 
We benchmark this KPI against the Retail Prices Index (RPI) and in  
2014 RPI was 2.5%. Adjusted EPS increased through additional income 
from the like-for-like portfolio, increased earnings from our premium 
outlet investments and new income from developments. This was 
partly offset by the dilution associated with the share placing, lost 
income from disposals outweighing new income from acquisitions 
and financing activity, where savings will be generated in the future. 
2015 focus
EPS growth will be driven by new rental income from recent 
acquisitions and the completion of developments such as Les Terrasses 
du Port. It will also be enhanced by cost saving measures undertaken 
during 2014.
Description
The cost ratio shows the total operating costs, including the cost 
of vacancy, as a percentage of gross rental income for the Group’s 
property portfolio. 
The ratio is not directly comparable between different companies, as  
it is impacted by different business models and accounting treatments. 
The ratios for 2011 to 2013 exclude the impact of the discontinued 
operations associated with the sale of the Group’s office portfolio.
Link to strategy 
2
Maintaining an efficient operating structure supports the growth in 
the Group’s profitability and enhances shareholder returns and the 
potential for future dividend growth.
Performance
23.4% (2013: 24.6%)
During 2014, further progress has been made in reducing the cost ratio 
as the income generated from the property portfolio has increased 
whilst operating costs have been tightly controlled. The 2014 ratio 
excludes a net one-off restructuring cost of £3.0 million incurred 
implementing a number of cost saving initiatives during the year.
2015 focus
The ratio is forecast to improve as additional income from recent 
acquisitions and completed developments will more than offset 
investment in growing business areas such as digital and development.

We aim to maximise the occupancy of our 
properties as income lost through vacancy 
has a direct impact on profitability. 
However, we believe that a low level of 
structural vacancy provides an opportunity  
for us to manage the mix and location of 
customers within a property. This enhances 
the consumer experience and should 
generate rental income and capital growth.
Performance
97.5% (2013: 97.7%) 
High occupancy has been maintained  
during 2014, with the portfolio being  
97.5% occupied at the year end. This was 
marginally lower than the prior year, but 
above our target of 97.0%.
2015 focus
We expect occupancy to remain high as 
retailers in both the UK and France seek  
space in the best trading locations.

Leasing is directly linked to rental income 
growth and also enables the Group to

Performance

In an improving economic environment, 
during 2014 we have seen an increase  
in leasing activity across all sectors of the 
portfolio. On average, these leases have been 
secured at 6% above December 2013 ERVs 
and 5% above the previous passing rent.

HIGH-QUALITY 
PROPERTY
During 2014, we have introduced a Product 
Framework which has been embedded across 
the business. This is based on six unique focus 
areas as shown on page 3, which have been 
designed to ensure our portfolio is able to 
perform in the evolving retail environment. 
We aim to apply the framework consistently to 
ensure our properties are attractive to retailers 
and consumers and are vibrant places to visit. 
DEVELOPMENTS AND EXTENSIONS
The Group has a proven track record of delivering iconic retail 
developments. We have a large number of development opportunities 
in both the UK and France, including six on-site schemes and three 
major London developments. These will require expenditure of 
approximately £1.5 billion and have the potential to significantly  
grow the business and create new retail destinations. In addition,  
we are working to bring forward a number of potential development 
projects, but are conscious of the need to tightly control expenditure 
while these opportunities are fully assessed.
During 2014 we completed three projects and have continued to 
make good progress in advancing our other development schemes  
as shown in the table below.
Completed developments
In May, we opened Les Terrasses du Port, Marseille, the 62,800m² 
shopping and leisure destination, which has traded ahead of 
expectations. The centre was valued at £480 million at December  
2014, £107 million above its development cost, and is now 98% let. 
Further details of this successful project are on page 21.
At Abbotsinch Retail Park, Paisley, which was acquired as part of the 
Junction Fund portfolio in October 2012, a 5,000m², £9 million terrace 
extension was completed in June. The extension created five new  
units which are fully let, and increased the park to 20,900m².
A 7,200m² extension of O’Parinor, Paris creating a 14-screen cinema 
and food court was completed towards the end of the year. The 
extension is fully let and is part of a wider refurbishment of the centre, 
including Primark’s first Paris store. Retailers have witnessed sales 
growth and a significant increase in footfall.
The 2014 Business Review provides an overview of the achievements made against our  
three strategic priorities during the year. 
ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL YEAR
1
40 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 The first group of new catering operators have successfully opened  
at the 10,900m² leisure-led extension of Silverburn, Glasgow which  
will increase the centre to in excess of 100,000m². The project is almost 
fully let and features a 14-screen Cineworld and a total of nine new 
restaurants, including Five Guys, Chimichanga and Carluccios. The 
restaurants are due to open by Easter 2015, with the cinema opening 
in the summer.
We have progressed the 14,500m² extension to Cyfarthfa Retail Park, 
Merthyr Tydfil where works commenced in 2013. The first phase  
of the extension, including B&Q’s first Eco-learning store, opened  
in September. The remaining 8,700m² of the scheme, including a  
4,600m² full-line M&S store offering clothing, homeware and a foodhall, 
will open in summer 2015. The scheme has provided over 250 jobs 
during the construction phase and will create the equivalent of up  
to 230 full-time jobs when complete.
In March, planning consent for the extension of Elliott’s Field Shopping 
Park, Rugby was upheld following a Judicial Review and we started on 
site in the autumn. The scheme will be anchored by a 5,600m² full-line 
Debenhams and a 4,600m² M&S general merchandise store and also 
involves the construction of a new retail terrace. The extension will 
accommodate a further 13 new fashion and homeware brands and 
provide new catering space, improved car parking facilities and 
improvements to the external environment. Completion is expected  
in autumn this year and 62% of the estimated annual income has  
been secured. The scheme is targetting BREEAM Excellent and the 
integration of 130kWp of solar photovoltaic panels will enable the 
generation of approximately 1mWh of renewable energy each year.
Our 23,800m² development in Le Jeu de Paume, Beauvais is due for 
completion this year, and will be anchored by Carrefour Market. The 
scheme will also include 86 retail units, including H&M and Furet du 
Nord and 37 residential apartments. Leases representing 62% of the 
anticipated income have already been signed or are in solicitors’ hands. 
Construction work for the first phase of Victoria Gate, Leeds 
commenced in April 2014. The 34,300m² scheme is adjacent to  
Victoria Quarter, which was acquired in 2012. The £150 million 
development will consist of three main buildings: a flagship John Lewis 
store; a two-street arcade with more than 30 aspirational retailers and 
restaurants; and an 800-space multi-storey car park. Leasing progress  
is encouraging, with 40% of the retail income let or in solicitors’ hands. 
Further details of this scheme are on page 22.
Following planning approval in June, we started on-site with the first 
phase of WestQuay Watermark. The 17,000m
2
 leisure and catering 
scheme is in the centre of Southampton, next to our jointly owned 
WestQuay Shopping Centre. The scheme includes a 10-screen 
Showcase Cinema de Lux, up to 20 restaurants and a new public  
piazza in front of the city’s historic walls. The scheme is scheduled  
to be fully open by spring 2017. Estimated income for the £80 million 
development is £5 million per annum, of which 58% has been pre-let  
to catering operators including Wahaca, Zizzi and Byron. The scheme  
is targetting BREEAM Excellent.

STRATEGIC REPORT We have continued to progress our three major developments in 
London. In addition to creating new retail destinations, these complex 
schemes offer the potential for significant urban regeneration and to 
deliver attractive financial returns over the longer term.
The redevelopment of Croydon town centre involves the regeneration 
of the retail heart of this area to attract £1 billion of annual retail  
spend. The scheme is being advanced by the Croydon Partnership, a 
50:50 joint venture with Westfield which was formed at the beginning 
of 2013. The joint venture owns Centrale shopping centre and  
a 25% interest in the 155-year headlease of the Whitgift Centre. The 
redevelopment of the Whitgift Centre and refurbishment of Centrale 
will result in 200,000m
2
 of retail, leisure and residential space. Planning 
permission was granted in April 2014. Since this date, Croydon Council 
has resolved to make a compulsory purchase order (CPO) to assemble 
the land required for the scheme and the CPO inquiry began in 
February 2015. The planning process and design of this significant 
regeneration project has taken longer than originally expected and, 
assuming a successful CPO outcome, works are due to start in 2016 
with completion scheduled for 2019/20. Further details of this major 
project are on page 23.
In conjunction with our joint venture partner, Ballymore Properties,  
a planning application to develop The Goodsyard, London E1 was 
submitted in July 2014. The 4.2ha site in Shoreditch has the potential to 
deliver a 260,000m² mixed-use development that will include 19,000m² 
of retail space, 60,000m² of offices and up to 1,500 homes and will 
cater for the growing Tech City media and technology start ups 
attracted to the area. The regeneration will also provide substantial 
public realm including a new park. The public consultation has been 
completed and we are working with the local authorities. A planning 
decision is targeted for late 2015. 
Following approval by Barnet Council in January 2014 of a revised 
planning application, work continues on the regeneration of Brent 
Cross Cricklewood in north-west London. The submission followed 
extensive consultation with local stakeholders and amended the 
outline planning permission granted for the scheme in 2010.  
A reserved matters application for the extensive highways and 
infrastructure works was submitted in January 2015. A key element 
of the regeneration is a 90,000m
2
 extension to Brent Cross shopping 
centre which will deliver a world-class retail, dining and leisure 
environment. The scheme will also provide new parks and community 
facilities and much enhanced transport connections. In conjunction 
with our joint venture partner, Standard Life Investments, we are in  
the process of refining the scheme design and programme prior to 
working up and submitting a reserved matters application for the 
shopping centre extension. This application is anticipated for late  
2015 and, subject to confirmation of CPO powers, we anticipate  
a start on-site in 2017 with completion in 2020/21.

BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED
42 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 We have a number of potential pipeline schemes which we continue 
to advance. These include new-build and extension projects across  
all three of the Group’s sectors: UK and French shopping centres,  
and UK retail parks. 
The precise nature and design of these schemes are fluid and the 
speed of delivery will be dependent on a variety of factors including: 
planning permission, retailer demand, anchor tenant negotiations,  
land assembly, and scheme design. The Group’s principal opportunities 
are shown in Table 25 above. 
REFURBISHMENTS
The £100 million refurbishment programme across the majority of  
our French centres, which began in 2013, was completed during 2014. 
The programme introduced upgraded interiors, new services and 
improved leisure provision to our centres. 
Following completion of the programme we intend to undertake 
increased levels of tenant rotation across the French portfolio to further 
enliven the retail offer and work up refurbishment projects for San 
Sébastien, Nancy; Villebon, Paris and Les 3 Fontaines, Cergy Pontoise.
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS
We closely monitor the performance of our existing portfolio to ensure 
that it meets our strategic requirements. Proceeds from disposals may 
be reinvested in the investment portfolio or used to fund acquisitions 
or developments to generate higher returns.
In January 2014, together with our 50% partner Aviva Investors, we 
sold Queensgate Shopping Centre in Peterborough. Hammerson’s 
share of net rental income from the asset in 2013 was £6 million and 
we received net proceeds of £99 million.
We acquired Saint Sébastien shopping centre in Nancy, north-east 
France for £109 million in February 2014. The city has an affluent 
population and is advancing the Nancy Grand Coeur regeneration 
project which should benefit the centre’s footfall. The 24,000m
2
 centre 
has passing rents of £6 million and there is scope for a number of 
future asset management initiatives to improve the centre and 
increase income.
In September, we completed the sale of the Group’s 50% stake  
in 10 Grosvenor Street, W1 for £54 million. The building was our 
remaining office asset and is currently Hammerson’s head office,  
ahead of the relocation to Kings Place, King’s Cross in June.
Also in September, we bought our joint venture partner’s 40% interest 
in Highcross, Leicester for £180 million. The 105,600m
2
 centre is 
anchored by John Lewis, generates passing rents of £27 million and 
was extended and refurbished by Hammerson in 2008. There are  
a number of asset management opportunities which will attract 
retailers and consumers and to grow the income stream.
Since the year end, in conjunction with our joint venture partner 
Allianz, we completed the acquisition of Nicetoile shopping centre  
in Nice. The 17,600m
2
 centre was recently refurbished and trades on 
four levels. It attracts 13 million visitors each year and generates rental 
income of £13 million. Allianz has a 90% stake in the centre, with 
Hammerson holding 10% and the management contract for the 
property. Our share of the acquisition costs was £24 million.

STRATEGIC REPORT BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED
PREMIUM OUTLETS
Hammerson is the only European REIT to have a strategic exposure  
to the premium outlets market which comprises outlet centres of 
institutional investment quality. We believe the outlet centre market is 
a critical distribution channel for retailers, in particular for luxury and 
fashion brands, as it complements their multichannel strategies and 
enables effective inventory management. The European outlet centre 
market is highly fragmented, but well managed high-quality centres 
can deliver high sales densities and annual total returns above 10%.
The Group has been increasing its exposure to the premium outlet 
sector over recent years and has investments through its long-term 
holding in Value Retail and also a new joint venture, VIA Outlets. At  
31 December 2014, these investments represent 13% of the Group’s 
total property value. 
Value Retail (VR)
VR operates nine luxury outlet Villages in the UK and Western Europe 
with 170,000m
2
 of floor space and over 1,000 stores. Their Villages, 
which include Bicester Village, Oxfordshire and La Vallée Village, Paris, 
serve the luxury, fashion and international shopping-tourism customer 
and are amongst the best outlet centres in Europe. The Group’s stake  
in VR has increased over recent years but remained unchanged during 
2014. We hold a 22% interest in the VR holding companies as well  
as direct investments in certain Villages. When these holdings are 
combined, the Group has an economic interest in the net assets of  
VR of approximately 38%. Hammerson also provides loan finance  
to VR which totalled £64 million at 31 December 2014.
Our investment in VR is consistent with our high-quality property 
strategy. During 2014, La Roca Village, Barcelona opened a 5,800m
2
 
extension, and this, together with the introduction of Sunday trading, 
has led to significant footfall growth. Further expansions are on-site  
or planned with work having commenced on a 5,800m
2
 extension  
at Kildare Village, Dublin which will add 36 new international brands 
when open at the end of 2015. Planning has been granted for a 
4,300m
2
 extension at Bicester Village to add new retail and catering 
and improve road access to the Village.
The Villages have continued to perform strongly during 2014 with 
brand sales growth of 11% across the portfolio. During the year, around 
21% of the like-for-like retail space in the Villages was remerchandised, 
with around half of that resulting from the introduction of new brands. 
Occupancy currently stands at 95%. Future growth is expected to  
be supported by global tourism, new emerging brands, consumers’ 
more considered approach to shopping and the importance of 
perceived value.
At 31 December 2014, the nine Villages were valued at €3.7 billion, 
reflecting underlying valuation growth of 12.1%. VR’s EBITDA in 2014,  
as prepared under IFRS, grew by 13.4% to €125.4 million. Hammerson’s 
share of the property valuations and EBITDA were £885 million and 
£33.5 million respectively. 
We continue to benefit from our relationship with VR management 
and utilise the knowledge gained to enhance the positioning of the 
Group’s portfolio, for example at Victoria Gate, Leeds. Hammerson 
enjoys a supportive relationship with VR, whose expansion into  
China includes Villages at Shanghai and Suzhou.
VIA Outlets (VIA)
In September we announced the Group had invested in a 47% stake  
in a new outlet joint venture, VIA Outlets, formed in partnership  
with APG, Value Retail and Meyer Bergman. The new venture aims  
to acquire existing European outlet centres with strong catchments 
and potential for growth.
During 2014, VIA acquired six outlet centres including Batavia Stad, 
near Amsterdam and Alcochete, Lisbon. The most recent acquisition is 
Landquart, in Switzerland where Hammerson’s share of the acquisition 
costs was £28 million. This centre is 21,000m
2 
and has 90 retail units 
including Calvin Klein, Desigual and Hugo Boss and it benefits from its 
proximity to the wealthy catchment of Zurich as well as tourists visiting 
the region.
In total the VIA outlet centres provide 180,000m
2
 of floor space and 
over 600 stores and were valued at €393 million at 31 December 2014. 
Hammerson’s share of the property valuations and post acquisition 
operating profit were £143 million and £2.1 million respectively.
The operational performance of VIA is summarised in Table 26 below:

*  The above figures reflect overall portfolio performance, not Hammerson’s 
ownership share and the year-on-year figures include pre-acquisition performance.
The VIA partners intend to make further acquisitions in Europe with the 
strategy of creating a c. €1 billion portfolio. In addition to building up 
the portfolio, the focus in 2015 will be on improving the performance 
of the outlet centres by changing the tenant mix; enhancing the 
leisure and food offers; right-sizing some of the units; creating flagship 
units for key brands; and targeted marketing to increase tourist visits. 
Hammerson intends to contribute personnel and expertise to VIA to 
support this strategy.
Page 53 of the Financial Review provides further information on how our 
investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets have impacted the Group’s 
financial performance during 2014.
44 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 Adapting to retail in a multichannel age
Consumers are increasingly considered in their approach to shopping. 
They have more choices than ever before and are using multiple 
channels to research, buy and complete their purchases. Retailers are 
adapting their offer to react to these changes. We are working to a 
tightly defined strategy to ensure that our product offer of proactively 
managed, outstanding retail space meets the demands of both 
consumers and retailers.
We actively rotate tenants to ensure the retail offer is optimised and 
enlivened at each location. Our strategy also recognises the need  
for superb customer service and facilities that make shopping easy, 
more convenient and enjoyable throughout the day. Our catering  
and leisure offers, accessible parking, customer information and  
world-class facilities are constantly refined and improved. 
In 2014, we launched a click & collect service at Brent Cross, in 
partnership with Collect+, which is already performing very strongly. 
A core focus is the seamless integration of digitally enabled services 
into our retail space which is increasingly a differentiator in the 
selection of retail locations. As well as offering free high speed Wi-Fi  
to our shoppers, we are upgrading our web capabilities to assist 
customers with researching their shopping trips. Digital tools also  
allow us to communicate with shoppers in a timely, relevant and 
highly targeted way, driving loyalty and spend.
Following successful trials of our award winning mobile app in  
2013 at The Oracle, Reading and Highcross, Leicester, we launched  
our updated platform ‘Plus’ at Les Terrasses du Port, Marseille in May. 
This mobile app allows us to communicate directly with shoppers in 
real-time, with personalised content and offers based on their interests, 
browsing and redemption history, and stores visited. The innovative 
geo-location technology uses Bluetooth low energy beacons.
We have strengthened our team with digital and loyalty experts  
and invested in class-leading analytic platforms to ensure that the  
true value of this data is realised. The ‘Plus’ app, upgraded websites  
and analytics tools will be rolled out across our shopping centre 
portfolio in 2015. 
In addition to the new digital platform, we continue to deliver 
engaging content across social media channels to more than one 
million followers, as well as supporting successful physical events that 
enliven our mall space such as Autumn Fashion Fix, Student Nights, 
Love Food and The Big Positive Weekend.
INCOME 
GENERATION
We actively manage our portfolio to generate 
sustainable income growth.
We recognise the importance of strong 
retailer relationships and the need to deliver 
tenant rotation to enhance the vibrancy  
of the consumer experience.
Technology is becoming an integral part  
of the shopping experience. Consumers are 
shopping across multiple channels and the 
ability to engage with consumers is the  
key to success in a multichannel age.

Introduction
Retailers are focusing their space requirements on high-quality, prime 
shopping centres, conveniently located retail parks and premium 
outlets of the types invested in by Hammerson. Retailers are making 
these choices because they understand the changing preferences of 
consumers.
As retail specialists, we understand that in order to keep generating 
income growth, we need to stay ahead of consumer and retail trends 
and supporting technologies. Our innovation agenda will ensure that 
the Group’s properties are best-in-class and ready to deliver 
exceptional performance in this new retail environment. 
This specialist approach, alongside improving consumer confidence, 
low interest rates and inflation, and the limited delivery of new retail 
space, combine to create the conditions for ERV growth.

STRATEGIC REPORT OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE
Presentation of information 
This overview provides information on a number of key operational 
metrics which management monitor to ensure the portfolio 
generates sustainable income growth. The information presented  
is consistent with our management reporting systems and includes 
metrics prepared on a proportionally consolidated basis. However,  
it excludes metrics from our investments in the premium outlet 
shopping sector which are shown in the previous section of the 
Business Review, as the Group has less day-to-day management 
involvement and the sector has different operational characteristics 
from the Group’s shopping centre and retail parks interests. 2013 
figures also exclude the office properties which were sold and 
treated as discontinued during that year.
Operational performance summary
The table below shows the strong operational performance achieved 
during 2014, demonstrating our ability to adapt to the changing retail 
environment. The highlights are an increased level of letting activity 
across the portfolio and the recovery in tenant sales in the UK. The 
weaker French sales figures reflect the more challenging economic 
environment in France, although other metrics remain robust.

Like-for-like net rental income
On a like-for-like basis, net rental income generated by the continuing 
portfolio grew by 2.1% during 2014. UK shopping centre growth of 
2.2% was driven by leasing activity, rent reviews and increased turnover 
rent and commercial income, notably at Cabot Circus, Highcross and 
Union Square. However, these positive factors were partially offset by 
the impact of lease expiries and tenant reconfigurations. 
Leasing activity associated with tenant rotation at the newly 
refurbished centres was the principal factor behind French shopping 
centre income growth of 2.0%. UK retail parks recovered from a flat 
year in 2013 to record like-for-like growth of 2.4%, again due to leasing 
activity and the permanent letting of space which had previously been 
impacted by retailer administrations.

Occupancy
At 31 December 2014, occupancy was 97.5%, ahead of our 97.0% 
target. French occupancy fell marginally during the year as a result  
of lease expiries, although this will enable future tenant rotation.

Further analysis of occupancy by business segment is on page 158. 
Leasing
Leasing activity increased during 2014, with 413 leases signed 
representing annual rental income of £29.5 million and 178,900m
2
  
of space. This compares to 364 leases, £23.9 million of income and 
153,900m
2
 in the prior year. For principal leases in the Group as a 
whole, rents secured were 5% greater than previous passing rents  
and 6% greater than December 2013 ERVs.
We continue to be encouraged by improving retailer demand and 
there is an improving trend of ERV growth. Across the portfolio ERVs 
grew by 1.5% during 2014, with growth of 0.9% in the second half  
of the year. This annual growth varied across the Group’s three sectors, 
with UK shopping centres seeing growth of 2.6% and retail parks  
0.5%, whilst the French shopping centres suffered from low  
indexation, achieving ERV growth of 0.2%. 
BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED
46 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 Lease expiries and rent reviews
Our prime property portfolio provides a secure income stream, with  
a weighted average unexpired lease term of eight years. However, 
there are a significant number of leases across the portfolio which  
will be subject to rent reviews, break clauses or expiry in the near  
term. These provide the opportunity to secure additional income  
for the Group, if reviews or new leases are agreed at ERV. 
Over the three years to 31 December 2017, leases with current rents 
passing of £78.0 million are due to expire, or are subject to tenants’ 
break clauses. If these were renewed at ERV, additional annual rental 
income of £7.4 million would be secured. 
Including outstanding reviews and those falling due over the next 
three years, leases in the UK with rents passing of £150.2 million are 
subject to review and, if reviewed at ERV, would generate additional 
annual income of £9.6 million. Rents in our French portfolio are subject 
to annual indexation, which is nil in 2015 for the majority of leases. 
These figures do not represent a forecast and take no account of void 
periods, lease incentives or potential changes to future rental values. 
Further information on lease expiries and rent reviews  
is included on page 159. 
Retailer sales, footfall and occupancy cost
The picture for sales at our UK shopping centres improved during the 
year, with tenant sales growth, calculated on a same centre basis, of 
2.6%, compared to a 0.4% reduction in sales in 2013. Jewellery, sports 
and outdoors and health and beauty sales recorded the highest sales 
growth during 2014. Footfall in the UK reduced by 1.3%, however, 
consumers are spending more time and money during each visit to 
our centres.
In France, the poor economic environment continued to hinder retail 
sales, and same centre sales fell by 1.0% during 2014, compared to a 
2.7% decline in 2013. Footfall increased by 1.5% in 2014, compared  
to a decline of 4.9% in 2013. This is an encouraging trend with  
shoppers attracted to our centres following the completion of the 
refurbishment programme.
The occupational cost ratio, defined as tenant sales as a proportion  
of total occupancy cost (rent, business rates and service charge) fell  
in the UK from 21.5% to 20.8% as a result of the growth in tenant sales 
during 2014. In France, the ratio was 14.3%, an increase from 13.9% at 
the beginning of the year, this change is consistent with the reduction 
in retailer sales during the year.
Non-rental income
Non-rental income, being net income from car parks and the sale  
of advertising and merchandising opportunities, continues to grow 
across the portfolio and is included within ‘net rental income’ . 
In the UK, non-rental income increased by 5.9% to £21.6 million, 
principally reflecting additional income at Union Square, Bullring  
and Highcross, partly offset by the impact of the sale of Queensgate  
at the beginning of 2014. In France, non-rental income increased  
by £1.7 million to £3.1 million, reflecting additional income from the  
new car park at Les Terrasses du Port.
Collection rates and tenant covenants
Our collection rates remain strong and demonstrate the underlying 
strength of the Group’s income stream. 98% of UK billings and 84% of 
French billings were collected within 14 days of the December 2014 
due date. 
Our credit control function assesses the covenant strength of 
prospective tenants and monitors the credit standing of key retailers 
using a credit rating agency. The agency has a four-point indicator 
scale which runs from one (‘low risk’) to four (‘high risk’). As at  
31 December 2014, weighted by passing rent, 90% of UK tenants  
and 83% of French tenants were rated within the two lowest 
risk categories.
Incidents of tenant administrations have reduced during 2014 and, at 
31 December 2014, 55 retail units were let to tenants in administration, 
of which 42 continued to trade. In total, 1.0% of the Group’s total 
passing rents was derived from tenants in administration, and for those 
tenants no longer trading the figures was just 0.4%.The equivalent 
figures at 31 December 2013 were 1.2% and 0.5% respectively.

STRATEGIC REPORT CAPITAL 
STRENGTH
We maintain a strong balance sheet with  
our prime property portfolio supported  
by a robust capital base. Our unsecured 
financing strategy provides the Group with 
financial security and the flexibility and 
capacity to deliver our business objectives. 
It also enables the Group to act swiftly and 
decisively when opportunities arise to further 
enhance performance.

Chart 30 below analyses the sources of valuation change for the 
Group’s property portfolio. During 2014, investment yields fell and 
increased valuations for UK shopping centres, retail parks and French 
retail properties. The yield movement for retail parks and the French 
properties was weighted towards the second half of the year. The 
benefit of leasing and modest rental value growth further boosted 
valuations, although this was principally at the UK and French 
shopping centres. In total, yield improvements accounted for  
83% of the total portfolio valuation increase during 2014.
Further valuation and yield analysis is included on pages 162 and 163.
PROPERTY PORTFOLIO
Presentation of information
As in the previous ‘Income generation’ section on page 45, the 
information presented in this section of the Business Review is

48 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 Acquisitions may be financed initially using short-term funds before 
being refinanced for the longer term when market conditions  
are appropriate. Short-term funding is raised principally through 
syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial 
institutions with which we maintain strong working relationships. 
Long-term debt principally comprises the Group’s fixed rate  
unsecured bonds.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates,  
but are not employed for speculative purposes. 
The Board approves financing guidelines against which it monitors the 
Group’s financial structure. These guidelines, together with the relevant 
metrics, including the Group’s share of joint ventures but excluding 
balances held in our premium outlet investments are summarised in 
Table 33 below which illustrates the Group’s robust financial condition.

During the first half of the year, we received the funds from the

fixed rate senior notes mature in seven, ten and twelve years and are 
denominated in US Dollar, British Pound Sterling and Euro, with the  
US Dollar portion swapped to fixed rate Euro. The weighted average 
coupon is fixed at 3.6% and the proceeds have been used to repay 
existing floating rate debt and increase the proportion of fixed  
rate debt.
In July 2014, we issued a new eight year €500 million bond at a coupon 
of 2.0%. The proceeds were partly used in December 2014 to redeem 
Property returns
The table above compares the financial returns generated in 2014  
with benchmark IPD indices. The above returns include development 
properties and the Group’s returns include those from the properties 
held by its premium outlet investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets. 
The Group weighted IPD All Retail Universe total return benchmark of 
12.5% is weighted 70:30 between the UK and French indices. The All 
Retail Universe indices include returns from all types of retail property.
As the Annual IPD benchmarks for both countries are not available 
until after this Annual Report has been published, the IPD benchmarks 
have been estimated and are subject to revision. The UK IPD data is 
based on the Quarterly All Retail Universe to December 2014. As there 
is less data available for France, we have assumed that the French 
benchmark is equal to the total return generated by our French 
portfolio of 8.3%.
The Group’s total return was 13.6%, compared with an estimated 
weighted IPD benchmark of 12.5%. The total return for the UK portfolio 
was 14.3% which was in-line with the IPD index, although income 
return was 30bp lower than the index which is indicative of the prime 
nature of the Group’s UK portfolio. The Group’s investments in premium 
outlets properties produced a total return of 19.9%.
An analysis of the capital and total returns by business segment  
is included on page 162.
SHAREHOLDER RETURNS
For the year ended 31 December 2014, Hammerson’s return on 
shareholders’ equity was 16.3%. This compares to the Group’s 
estimated cost of equity of 8.0%. The income element of the return  
on equity tends to be relatively low given the prime quality of the 
property portfolio. The capital element of the return was driven by  
the portfolio’s strong valuation performance during the year. 
Hammerson’s total shareholder return for 2014 was 24.7% which 
outperformed the FTSE EPRA/NAREIT UK index by 340bp. Over the last 
five years, Hammerson’s average annual total shareholder return has 
been 11.5% compared with 13.5% for the FTSE EPRA/NAREIT UK index.
FINANCING
Our financing strategy is to generally borrow on an unsecured basis on 
the strength of the Group’s covenant in order to maintain operational 
flexibility. This strategy has ensured access to a wide range of debt capital 
markets at competitive pricing. Borrowings are arranged to ensure an 
appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short-term liquidity.

the outstanding €480 million 4.875% coupon bond, originally maturing 
in June 2015. This refinancing will result in a saving of 2.875%, or  
€14 million, per annum and is in line with the Group’s objectives to 
manage down the cost of debt and extend the debt maturity profile. 
At 31 December 2014, the average maturity of the Group’s debt was 
6.5 years. The maturity profile of the Group’s borrowings is shown  
in Chart 34 below.
Funds raised through the bond issue and, the share placing in 
September, were used in the short term to repay floating rate debt on 
the revolving credit facilities at low floating rates of interest. The timing of 
this has led to the weighted average cost of finance rising from 4.6% at 
the half year to 4.7% for the full year. However, following the €480 million 
bond redemption in December, the running cost of debt fell to below 
4.3%. We believe that the sterling and euro bond markets will continue 
to be available in the medium term to refinance existing bonds as they 
mature and we will access these markets as appropriate. In addition, 
bank lending markets have continued to improve during 2014, with 
falling margins, and we expect to be able to take advantage of this 
situation with upcoming refinancings of unsecured credit facilities.
Our policy for interest rate hedging is to fix the rate of at least 50%  
of debt, although we may increase this at higher gearing levels. At  
31 December 2014, 79% of debt was fixed, compared with 70% at  
the beginning of the year. We expect interest rates to increase in the 
medium to long term and our fixed/floating profile will partly  
mitigate that risk. 
Exposure to exchange translation differences on euro-denominated 
assets is managed through a combination of euro borrowings and 
derivatives. At 31 December 2014, 88% of euro-denominated assets 
were hedged by euro-denominated debt, compared to 79% at the 
beginning of the year. The purpose of this increase was to offset the 
impact of increased euro-denominated rental income following the 
opening of Les Terrasses du Port in May. Interest on euro debt acts as a 
hedge against exchange differences arising on rental income from our 
French business. On average during 2014, approximately 82% of our 
French income was hedged in this way. However, falling euro interest 
rates have led to higher euro-denominated earnings and the hedge of 
euro income is forecast to fall to approximately two-thirds during 2015.
The Group’s unsecured bank facilities and the US private placement 
senior notes contain financial covenants, requiring that the Group’s 
gearing, defined as the ratio of net debt to shareholders’ equity, should 
not exceed 150% and that interest cover, defined as net rental income 
divided by net interest payable, should not be less than 1.25 times. The 
same gearing covenant applies to three of the Company’s unsecured 
bonds, whilst the remaining bonds contain a covenant that gearing 
should not exceed 175% and have no covenant for interest cover. The 
calculation of these ratios includes the Group’s share of joint ventures. 
Hammerson’s financial ratios are comfortably within these covenants. 
Fitch and Moody’s rate Hammerson’s unsecured credit as A- and Baa2 
(positive outlook) respectively. Moody’s upgraded their outlook from 
stable to positive in June 2014. 
Premium outlets
As explained at the beginning of this section, we do not proportionally 
consolidate our two premium outlet interests, Value Retail and VIA 
Outlets. These are financed independently from the rest of the Group’s 
financing arrangements. Both VR and VIA utilise a combination of 
secured borrowings and partner loans to fund their structures. At  
31 December 2014, Hammerson’s share of VR’s and VIA’s net debt was 
£275 million and £31 million respectively. If the Group’s share of net 
debt, properties and other net assets of the two premium outlet 
investments were included within the Group’s financing metrics, the 
Group’s proforma gearing would increase from 46% to 52%, whilst the 
loan to value ratio would reduce from 34% to 33%.
EQUITY ISSUE
Hammerson raised gross proceeds of £399 million in September 2014 
through a successful share placing. 71.3 million shares were issued at 
£5.60 each, representing a 4% discount to the prevailing share price.  
The proceeds were used to finance the £180 million acquisition of a 40% 
stake in Highcross, Leicester and our 47% investment in VIA Outlets. The 
remaining proceeds will fund the Group’s development expenditure.
50 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 Adjusted profit is a key measure of the Group’s financial performance 
as it reflects the underlying earnings of the Group. Details of 
adjustments in calculating adjusted earnings are given in note  
11A to the accounts on page 128.
As explained in the Business Review on page 46, management 
continues to monitor the performance of the business principally  
on a proportionally consolidated basis, except for its interests  
in premium outlets through its investments in Value Retail and  
VIA Outlets where the Group has less day-to-day involvement  
in operational activities. The commentary in this Financial Review  
is consistent with this approach. 
Table 35 below highlights the presentational impact of the adoption  
of IFRS 11 on the Group’s proportionally consolidated adjusted profit.

Outlets which is not proportionally consolidated. All other joint venture interests are proportionally consolidated in this analysis.
Further analysis on the proportionally consolidated income statement is in 
note 2 to the accounts on pages 117 and 118.
Presentation of financial information
The Group’s financial statements are prepared under IFRS and for  
2014 the Group has adopted IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements. The new 
standard requires that the Group’s joint arrangements, which were 
previously proportionally consolidated, are classified as joint ventures 
and are equity accounted. This presentation is consistent with the 
treatment of the Group’s investment in Value Retail, which is classified 
as an associate.
The income statement on page 106 and the balance sheet on page 
108 include single lines showing the Group’s share of post-tax profit 
and the net investment in joint ventures and associates respectively. 
The Group’s profit for the year and equity shareholders’ funds are 
unaffected by the presentational changes associated with the new 
accounting standard. Further details of the impact of adopting this 
accounting policy are given in note 1 to the accounts on page 113. 
FINANCIAL REVIEW
The Group’s strategic priorities of high-quality property, income generation and capital strength  
provide the basis to enhance the Group’s financial performance and 2014 has been another  
successful year for Hammerson.

STRATEGIC REPORT Profit before tax
The Group’s profit before tax for 2014 was £703.1 million compared 
with £341.2 million in 2013, the latter figures includes discontinued 
operations. As analysed in Table 36 below, the year-on-year increase 
reflected portfolio revaluation gains of £436.8 million in 2014, 
compared to £90.3 million in 2013. A good operational performance 
also contributed to the increase in profit. 
Other profit variances related to the net loss of £6.5 million on the sale 
of properties and joint venture interests in 2014 compared to a profit  
of £11.7 million in 2013 and a £13.7 million increase in the fair value of 
derivatives compared to a decrease of £13.9 million in the prior year.

At £178.9 million, adjusted profit before tax was £10.0 million up on 
2013, an increase of 5.9%. Table 37 below reconciles the movement  
in adjusted profit before tax between the current and prior years.  
The principal contributors to the increase were new income from 
acquisitions and developments, additional income from the like-for-
like portfolio and Value Retail. These were partly offset by higher 
financing costs associated with reduced levels of floating rate debt.

In 2014, the portfolio as a whole generated net rental income of  
£305.6 million, compared with £290.2 million in the prior year. Growth 
of 2.1% in income from the like-for-like portfolio was principally  
driven by leasing activity at Cabot Circus and Italie Deux. Net rental 
income also increased with additional income of £17.1 million from 
developments, principally Les Terrasses du Port and £10.8 million from 
acquisitions. This was partly offset by £14.7 million of income lost  
from disposals, principally Queensgate sold in January 2014 and the 
remainder of the office portfolio sold in June 2013.
Further analysis of net rental income by business segment is on page 160.
Administration expenses
As announced with the 2013 annual results, we intended to  
rebalance the Group’s cost base by increasing resources to grow  
the development and digital marketing areas of our business. 
During 2014 a number of initiatives were implemented and we have: 
consolidated senior positions in London; contracted to relocate our 
London head office to King’s Cross in June; reduced employee share 
scheme benefits; closed the UK defined benefit pension scheme to 
future accrual; and transferred a number of head office roles to a new 
operations centre in Reading. 
We have incurred a net £3.0 million one-off restructuring charge  
which has been recognised within administration expenses, but 
excluded from adjusted earnings. The gross cost is £5.5 million, of 
which £3.0 million relates to occupational changes, £1.5 million to staff 
restructuring and £1.0 million to the other initiatives. These costs are 
partly offset by a curtailment gain of £2.5 million recognised on the 
closure to future accrual of the defined benefit pension scheme.
We anticipate constraining total operating costs, whilst increasing 
rental income to further improve the cost ratio over the next few years.

Underlying net administration expenses 43.5 42.3
In 2014, underlying administration expenses, net of management  
fees receivable, were £43.5 million, an increase of £1.2 million, or 2.8%, 
compared with 2013. The increase was principally due to marginally 
higher staff costs and reduced management fees associated with  
joint venture disposals and an outperformance fee received in 2013.
Cost ratio
The EPRA cost ratio for the year ended 31 December 2014 is 23.4%,  
a reduction of 120bp from 24.6% for 2013. The ratio is calculated as 
total operating costs, including the cost of vacancy, as a percentage 
 of gross rental income and the 2013 ratio is for continuing operations. 
The reduction in 2014 reflects a £22.9 million increase in gross rental 
income whilst operating costs increased by £1.5 million. 
The 2014 ratio has been adjusted to exclude the £3.0 million  
one-off net restructuring charge explained on page 52. Including  
this item would increase the 2014 cost ratio to 24.3%. 
The ratio is not necessarily comparable between different companies 
as business models and expense accounting and classification 
practices vary.
The Cost ratio calculation is shown on page 161.
Share of results and net assets from investments in 
premium outlets – Value Retail and VIA Outlets
The operating performance of our investments in Value Retail and VIA 
Outlets is described on page 44 of the Business Review.
As explained above, for the management reporting purposes we  
do not proportionally consolidate the results of these interests as  
the Group has less day-to-day involvement in these operations.
Value Retail (VR)
As the Group has significant influence over the operations of Value 
Retail PLC and its associated entities, our investment in VR is treated  
as an associated undertaking and equity accounted. VR’s contribution 
to the Group’s income statement and balance sheet is set out in  
Tables 40 and 41.

In 2014, EPRA net income from our investment was £21.8 million,  
or 3.0 pence per share, compared with £19.0 million, or 2.7 pence per 
share in 2013. The uplift in income reflects the continued brand sales 
growth driving additional rental income.
During 2014, on an EPRA adjusted basis, the value of the Group’s 
investment in VR increased by £95.6 million. This was principally due to 
the valuation uplift within the VR property portfolio, the Group’s share 
of which was £111.1 million.
Including the Group’s loan to VR, our net interest at the end of 2014 
was valued at £724.2 million on an EPRA basis, equivalent to 92 pence 
per share.
VIA Outlets (VIA)
The Group acquired a 47% stake in VIA Outlets in July, which is a  
joint venture formed in partnership with APG, Value Retail and Meyer 
Bergman. VIA acquired six assets during 2014 and for management 
reporting purposes we do not proportionally consolidate the results  
of VIA and instead using equity accounting.
In 2014, VIA contributed £0.9 million to EPRA earnings. At 31 December 
2014, the Group’s investment in VIA totalled £104.2 million, or  
£108.2 million on an EPRA NAV basis excluding deferred tax, goodwill  
on acquisition and the fair value of financial instruments. Further details  
of the Group’s interest in VIA are shown in Note 13 to the accounts.
Finance costs
We reduced the average cost of borrowings for the Group to  
4.7% in 2014 from 4.8% in the prior year. This was primarily due to the 
increased use of floating rate debt during the year. The €500 million 
bond issue in July and earlier $443 million US private placement have 
 www.hammerson.com 53
STRATEGIC REPORT been retained at fixed rates of interest. Underlying finance costs, 
comprising gross interest less finance income were £109.2 million 
compared with £103.6 million in 2013.
Interest capitalised during the year was £8.8 million and related 
principally to the developments of Les Terrasses du Port, which 
completed in May, and Victoria Gate in Leeds.
Tax
The Group is a UK REIT and French SIIC for tax purposes and hence is 
exempt from corporation tax on rental income and gains arising on 
property sales. The tax charge at 31 December 2014 remains low at 
£1.0 million, of which £0.1 million relates to deferred tax.
Dividend
The Directors have proposed a final dividend of 11.6 pence per share. 
Together with the interim dividend of 8.8 pence, the total for 2014 is 
20.4 pence, representing an increase of 6.8% compared with the prior 
year. The final dividend is payable on 24 April 2015 to shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 13 March 2015 and 2.0 pence 
will be paid as a PID, net of withholding tax where appropriate, with 
the balance of 9.6 pence paid as a normal dividend. As has been the 
case in recent years, there will be no scrip alternative although the 
dividend reinvestment plan continues to be available to shareholders.
Balance sheet
During 2014, equity shareholders’ funds increased by £914 million to 
£4,974 million at 31 December 2014.
Net assets, calculated on an EPRA basis, were £4,999 million, an 
increase of 22.4% during the year. On a per share basis, net assets 
increased by 65 pence, or 11.3%, to £6.38 and the movement  
during the year is shown in Table 42 below:

The increase in EPRA net asset value was principally due to the 
valuation surplus on the property portfolio due to yield improvements. 
Other improvements resulted from the gains from our Value Retail 
investment, the equity share issue and retained earnings.
Financing and cash flow
At 31 December 2014, net debt was £2,265 million, including our  
share of net debt held in joint ventures which totalled £12 million.
Net debt comprised borrowings and currency swaps of £2,324 million 
and cash and deposits of £59 million. During the year, net debt was 
almost unchanged with a small increase of £13 million. The movement 
in net debt during 2014 are summarised in Table 43 below:

Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to  
affect its future development, performance and position are set out  
in the Business Review, this Financial Review and the Principal Risks  
and Uncertainties sections of the Annual Report on pages 40 to 59.  
The financial position of the Group, its liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are also described on pages 49 and 50 and in notes  
17, 19 and 20 to the accounts.
The Directors have reviewed the current and projected financial 
position of the Group, making reasonable assumptions about future 
trading performance. As part of the review, the Directors considered 
the Group’s cash balances, its debt maturity profile, including undrawn 
facilities, and the long-term nature of tenant leases. After making 
enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the  
financial statements.

Business strategy
• Implementation of a strategy 
inconsistent with the market 
environment, risking poor 
investment decisions and 
inadequate returns.
• Shopping centre, retail parks or 
premium outlet markets in UK or 
France underperform relative to 
other sectors or markets, eroding 
shareholder value.
• Consumer spending stalls, 
particularly in France, adversely 
impacting future performance
Related strategic priorities
1 2
• We commission and evaluate research into the 
economy and investment and occupational 
markets and use this to prepare an annual  
Business Plan and regular financial forecasts.
• The Group’s portfolio is diversified by sub-sector 
and its allocation, including exposure to the 
eurozone, is reviewed regularly.
• We focus on prime shopping centres in the best 
locations, convenient retail parks and premium 
outlets, all with experienced management.
• Stress-testing of our business model against  
a severe downside economic scenario has 
confirmed that the Group is robust. Low gearing, 
long-term secure income streams from our leases, 
the currency hedging of the value of and income 
from our euro-denominated portfolio, a good 
spread of debt maturities and the flexibility to 
phase or halt our development programme,  
all point to resilience to market shocks.
• We monitor closely developments in multichannel 
retailing and introduce innovative new concepts  
to our portfolio when appropriate.

The UK economy has seen accelerated 
growth, although the recovery in the 
eurozone has been subdued with further 
monetary stimulus expected in 2015.
Stock markets have performed strongly 
despite potential uncertainty associated 
with forthcoming elections. But downside 
risks remain, especially given recent 
election results in Greece.
Retailers are becoming more confident  
in their outlook but must ensure that 
their sales channels remain relevant in the 
digital age and provide consumers with 
the flexibility and convenience they 
require. Real estate remains a cornerstone 
of their plans.
Property and corporate investment 
• Investment decisions result  
in inadequate returns or the 
adoption of unforeseen liabilities.
• Opportunities to divest of 
properties are missed, or limited 
by market constraints, reducing 
potential returns.
Related strategic priorities
1 3
• Acquisitions are thoroughly evaluated, supported 
by detailed review, financial appraisals, due 
diligence and detailed risk assessment prior  
to Board approval.
• The performance of individual properties is 
benchmarked against target returns.
• Properties are held in a ‘ready for sale’ state,  
with documentation supporting leases, rights  
and obligations readily accessible.
• The Group’s property portfolio is high-quality, 
geographically diversified and let to a large  
number of tenants.

2014 has seen an increase in investor 
demand for real estate, reinforced by  
an appetite from overseas investors for 
relatively safe returns from prime assets  
in the UK and France. This is further 
encouraged by the continuing low 
interest rate and inflation environment. 
These factors have contributed to a rise  
in real estate values during 2014 and this 
trend is forecast to continue into 2015.
However, in the event that there is further 
instability in the eurozone, significant 
volatility could return to financial markets 
in the short to medium term, which 
could have a negative effect on real 
estate values.

Property development
• Over-exposure to developments 
within a short timeframe increases 
exposure to market risk and  
puts pressure on financing  
and cashflow. 
• Poor control of the development 
programme and failure to 
address investment and 
occupational market risks or 
inflationary pressures results  
in inadequate returns.
• Poor management and 
inadequate resourcing leads  
to failed projects.
• Failure to achieve key project 
milestones, such as planning 
consents and land acquisitions,  
on a timely basis damages project 
viability and corporate reputation.

• The Group’s exposure to developments and the 
phasing of projects is considered as part of our 
annual Business Plan and reviewed throughout  
the year. This process also considers future 
resourcing requirements.
• We produce regular management reporting  
to enable effective monitoring of  
development projects.
• Detailed analysis, including market research,  
is undertaken prior to the approval of expenditure 
on each development project.
• Where possible, guaranteed maximum price 
contracts are agreed with building contractors  
and fixed prices agreed for other advisers.
• Multi-disciplinary teams are assembled for each 
development under a project ‘owner’ , and these  
are supported by external expertise.
• Constructive relationships are maintained with 
local councils/government.
• A programme of post-completion reviews ensures 
potential improvements to processes are identified.
• We have a substantial pipeline but will progress 
developments only when the relevant markets are 
sufficiently robust, when we have the right level of 
interest from occupiers and on the basis that sound 
financial analysis demonstrates good returns. 
Developments only represent 3% of the Group 
property portfolio at 31 December 2014, and 
leasing is progressing as expected on the six 
on-site developments.
Business 
review  
(page 40)
We successfully completed Les Terrasses 
du Port in May and were on-site with six 
projects at 31 December 2014.
Our three major London schemes have 
been advanced and this coincides with 
improving demand from retailers for new 
prime trading locations. Local and 
national politicial support is still required 
to bring these schemes to fruition, and 
uncertainty caused by UK elections may 
act to adversely impact the delivery of 
these projects.
We have also seen cost inflation in the 
construction sector, fuelled by growing 
demand for skills and raw materials as 
economic growth returns. The recent fall 
in the oil price should act to cool these 
inflationary trends.
Treasury
• Breach of borrowing covenants 
triggers default and/or repayment 
of facilities or bonds.

• We set guidelines for financial ratios which  
are monitored regularly by the Board.
• Our annual Business Plan includes stress tests 
considering the impact of a significant 
deterioration in the markets in which we operate.
• Gearing stood at 46% at 31 December 2014, 
significantly lower than the Group’s most stringent 
borrowing covenant that gearing should not 
exceed 150%. We estimate that values could fall  
by 52% from their December 2014 levels before 
covenants would be endangered.

The improved economic picture has 
supported property valuations for prime 
assets and hence maintained the safety 
margin for borrowing covenants.
The Group’s balance sheet and financial 
ratios were further strengthened by the 
£399 million share placing in September.
Interest rate and exchange risk 
• Adverse currency or interest  
rate movements result in  
financial losses.

• We set guidelines for our exposure to fixed and 
floating interest rates, using interest rate and 
currency swaps as appropriate. At 31 December 
2014, 79% of the Group’s gross debt was at fixed 
rates of interest.
• Exchange risk is managed principally by matching 
foreign currency assets with foreign currency 
borrowings or derivatives. At the end of 2014, 88% 
of the value of the Group’s euro-denominated 
assets was hedged in this way.
Business  
review  
(page 49)
Interest rates have remained low over  
the last 12 months, and the pressure for  
a near-term increase has diminished as 
inflationary pressures have reduced. 
However, there remains an expectation 
that they will rise in the medium term.
Sterling has strengthened against the 
euro during 2014 and the risk of volatility 
remains at times of heightened 
uncertainty in the eurozone.

Liquidity risk
• Poor planning or external factors, 
including failures in the banking 
system, lead to a liquidity squeeze 
preventing the refinancing of 
maturing debt or leading to 
insufficient liquidity to progress 
the development programme.
• Companies with short-term 
financing requirements may 
continue to find it difficult  
to secure sufficient funding,  
in particular from banks, at  
costs comparable with their  
existing facilities.

• The Board approves future investment 
requirements and sufficient facilities are put  
in place with an appropriate maturity profile.
• We monitor the maturity profile of debt and  
take a proactive approach to refinancing.
• Credit ratings are set for lending counterparties 
and monitored. We use diverse sources of funding.
• The high quality and diversification of our portfolio 
should help to protect values from the negative 
impacts which may arise from changes in the 
financial and property markets.
• While credit conditions during 2014 have been 
favourable for debt issuers, there is a risk that this 
could change. The Group’s recent funding strategy 
has therefore sought to raise new funds to 
refinance near-term maturities. This strategy was 
demonstrated in 2014 by the issue of an 8-year 
€500 million bond in July where the funds were 
partly used in December to redeem the 
outstanding €480 million 4.875% bond maturing in 
June 2015. At 31 December, the Group had 
liquidity of £648 million and an average debt 
maturity of 6.5 years.
Business

Lenders have become more willing  
to lend during 2014, although continue 
to be selective in their choice of 
counterparty, and the corporate bond 
market is open to borrowers with an 
appropriate risk profile. 
Alternatives to the traditional bank 
lending and bond markets, such as 
private placement, remain open to  
the Group.

• Joint venture documentation drafted to align 
strategic direction and to provide liquidity  
and flexibilty for partners and to protect the  
Group’s ownership.

• Speculation and comment relating to changes  
in tax regimes in the UK and Europe is monitored 
with the help of specialist advisers. 
• Developments in regulation are monitored and 
governments and regulators lobbied through 
representation by UK and European real estate 
trade bodies.
• Monitoring of exposure to key regulations at 
portfolio level combined with strategic plan

consultations and industry led dialogue with  
policy makers.
Financial 
review  
(page 54)
Note 8 to the 
accounts
(page 125)
No significant changes during 2014, 
although governments continue to seek 
to reduce fiscal deficits and regulators 
examine mechanisms which would  
make financial markets more resilient. 
Increased taxation may be a risk for  
the broader business sector, but an 
asset-based industry such as real estate, 
which currently benefits from tax-
efficient regimes throughout Europe, 
could become a specific target.
The real estate sector is sometimes 
perceived by regulators to be part of the 
financial services sector rather than as  
an operating business and the industry 
could be adversely affected by 
misdirected regulation designed to 
stabilise financial markets.
Business organisation and human resources
• Management structure or 
resourcing levels are inappropriate 
for achieving business objectives.
• Failure to recruit and retain  
key executives and staff with 
appropriate skills and calibre.

• A Human Resources plan features as part of the 
annual Business Plan which considers team 
structures and talent management.
• The Nomination Committee approves succession 
plans for senior roles.
• Significant changes to the management structure 
are approved by the Board.
• We periodically review the remuneration structure, 
including an annual review by the Remuneration 
Committee and benchmarking against industry,  
or other relevant, comparatives.
• Management competency framework launched 
with management skills formally assessed with

The recruitment market has become

• Continuity plans established at both corporate  
and individual property levels.
• Properties reviewed for flood risk and to ensure 
appropriate defence measures and insurance

predetermined processes and escalation. 
• Physical security measures in place at properties.
• Senior management, including crisis management 
group, receive media training for crisis events.
• Security threat assessed regularly through links 
with security agencies.
• Insurance policies include terrorism cover.
Whilst the overall risk of a major incident 
remains low, assessments for terrorist and 
cyber risks indicate a heightened risk 
status in both the UK and France.

SUPPORTING THE 
GROUP’S STRATEGY
My objective as Chairman is to help ensure the Board creates 
maximum value for shareholders over the long term. We do 
our best to balance opportunity against risk and to lead the 
organisation in an ethical way.
This Corporate Governance Report is intended to give an 
insight into how the Board operated in 2014 to achieve these 
aims. Full details of the Company’s governance arrangements in 
compliance with the Principles of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code are included on pages 94 to 97. 
As you will have read in the Chief Executive’s Report on pages  
4 to 6, 2014 has been a year in which the business has achieved 
strong returns and is well placed to continue to deliver its 
strategic goals. The year has seen economic and consumer 
recovery gather momentum which has helped stimulate 
improved sales in our shopping centres and retail parks. Our 
newly created VIA Outlets investment will provide exciting 
opportunities for Hammerson. Our investment in this sector 
is a key differentiator of our business. Last year I said that I was 
particularly struck by the capabilities of the management team 
and their energy and vision and one year on I remain impressed. 
I want to thank them and indeed all our people for delivering  
a strong performance in the year.
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
The Company complied  
in full with the provisions of  
the UK Corporate Governance  
Code published in September  
2012, which applied 
throughout the financial year 
ended 31 December 2014. 
60 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 An effective Board
As Chairman I am responsible for ensuring that your Board works 
effectively under my leadership in support of the Group’s strategy.  
In last year’s Annual Report I reported on my intention to change the 
structure and frequency of Board and Committee meetings during 
2014. Board agendas have been revised and some items moved to  
the agendas of the Committees in order to enable the Board to spend 
more time discussing investment, marketing and development. Senior 
executives have met with Non-Executive Directors both formally and 
informally to discuss specific projects. The Board has evaluated the new 
approach and I can report that the Directors are satisfied with the way 
the Board is operating. Further detail on this year’s internal evaluation 
of Board effectiveness can be found on page 67 of the Corporate 
Governance Report.
One of the recommendations from the 2013 external Board 
effectiveness review was to introduce an electronic board paper  
portal as a more efficient, secure and sustainable way of disseminating 
Board papers. A project to explore suitable software was managed  
by the Company Secretary and her team. Following an evaluation 
exercise, a provider was chosen and the software implemented.  
It is now being used for the Board and all Committees and feedback 
from Directors indicates that it has been received very positively.
Board changes and succession planning
Since my last report to you a number of changes have happened  
to the Board and its Committees. After the Annual General Meeting 
(AGM) in 2014 we said goodbye to John Hirst at which point Jacques 
Espinasse took on the role of Chairman of the Audit Committee.  
Gwyn Burr assumed the role of Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee after the AGM, having been appointed to that Committee 
in February 2014. 
Anthony Watson will be stepping down at the conclusion of this  
year’s AGM, after nine years on the Board. On behalf of the Board  
I would like to thank Anthony for his commitment to the Company 
and the valuable and significant contribution he has made as a 
Non-Executive Director. Anthony has been a member of the 
Remuneration, Audit and Nomination Committees and was Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee from January 2006 to April 2014.  
He has held the role of Senior Independent Director since January 
2010. I would also like to add my personal thanks to Anthony for the 
significant role he has played in ensuring that the Board meets  
its responsibilities to shareholders and stakeholders in these roles.
Jacques Espinasse will have served on the Board for nine years  
in 2016 and has indicated his intention to step down from the  
Board at the AGM in 2016.
In July, we decided that all Non-Executive Directors would become 
members of the Nomination Committee and so membership 
increased by three. The Nomination Committee report can be  
found on pages 68 to 70.
I am delighted to welcome Pierre Bouchut, who was appointed to the 
Board on 13 February 2015 and a report on the recruitment process is 
described in the Nomination Committee report on page 70. His strong 
financial expertise combined with an in-depth knowledge and 
experience of the retail industry in an international environment 
complement the skills of the Board.
In light of Anthony Watson’s decision to stand down from the Board  
in April 2015, the Nomination Committee considered possible 
successors to the role of Senior Independent Director in consultation 
with all the Board and the Company Secretary. I am delighted that 
Terry Duddy has agreed to accept the role and he will be appointed 
with effect from 22 April 2015. He has both the right personal  
qualities and deep commercial and shareholder relations experience, 
culminating in his years as Chief Executive of Home Retail Group. 
It is my responsibility to ensure that Board members have 
independence of mind and action and that the Board as a whole  
has an appropriate balance and diversity of skills, experience  
and background. This has been in my mind as the changes noted 
above have taken place. Further changes to the Board will continue  
to reflect these points as well as the long-term demands of the 
business as it develops in the coming years. 
Changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code
The Board and I remain committed to following best practice in 
corporate governance. I am pleased to report that the Company 
complied fully with the Code in 2014. Following the publication  
by the Financial Reporting Council of a revised edition of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code in September 2014, we have already 
taken steps to comply with the updated requirements. We plan  
to comply fully with these requirements in 2015.

BRINGING CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE TO LIFE
This section of the Corporate Governance Report highlights  
some of the key activities of the Board during 2014. It should  
be read in conjunction with the section on compliance with  
the UK Corporate Governance Code on pages 94 to 97.
RAISING CAPITAL TO FUND ACQUISITIONS  
AND DEVELOPMENTS
During the year, the Board explored various financing and 
re-financing options proposed by management to enable the 
Company to advance its acquisition and development strategy 
whilst retaining a robust capital structure. Financing options 
considered by the Board included a bond buy-back, the issue 
of shares to be listed on the London Stock Exchange, a bond 
issue and hedging strategies. Market conditions were kept 
under review during this time and management and the 
Board received feedback on likely shareholder responses  
to various debt and equity raising options. Proposals came 
forward for a share placing as part of funding plans for an 
investment in Highcross and the VIA Outlet venture. The Board 
reviewed and approved a proposal to fund the acquisitions 
through a placing of up to 10% of the Company’s existing 
issued share capital. On 25 September 2014 the Company 
announced that the placing had been successfully completed 
and would fund the acquisition of the remaining interest  
in Highcross, provide investment in the European outlet  
sector and partly fund the Company’s significant  
development pipeline.
Key steps in the Board’s process in reaching its decision  
to proceed with the placing are set out below. During  
the process the Board worked closely with management,  
the Company’s legal team and its advisers.

ENGAGEMENT
The Board recognises the 
importance of communicating 
regularly with its shareholders 
and during 2014 the Company 
undertook a variety of investor 
relations activities which were 
organised both for institutional 
and private shareholders. As well 
as the formal programme of 
events, ad hoc meetings took 
place throughout the year. 
The majority of shareholder 
contact is between the 
Company’s institutional 
shareholders and the Chief 
Executive and the Chief Financial 
Officer. During 2014 a number  
of events were either attended  
or hosted by the Company.  
The programme of events is  
set out opposite.
JANUARY

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT BOARD VISIT TO MARSEILLE
In October 2014, the Board held its scheduled Board 
meeting at Les Terrasses du Port, Marseille. Having  
seen the Centre in the final stages of construction last 
year this provided an opportunity for the Board to see 
the Centre open for shoppers. The Board toured the 
Centre and received presentations from the local 
project and management teams including progress  
on store openings and occupancy rate, feedback  
on the opening of the Centre in May 2014 and an 
update on Centre performance. The Board also 
received a presentation on how the multi-channel 
digital programme at Les Terrasses du Port is positively 
driving customer engagement and is also providing 
new insights into customer behaviour.
BOARD STRATEGY DAY
The Board’s annual Strategy Day was held at Les 
Terrasses du Port, Marseille the day after the Board 
meeting. As in previous years, the Board prepared  
for the day by reviewing background commentary  
on the UK and French economies and real estate  
markets and current Hammerson data including  
the Group’s corporate profile, operational data and 
financial forecasts. 
Members of senior management joined the Board  
for discussions which included branding, strategy, 
capital allocation and operational efficiency. The 
agenda for the Strategy Day also covered:
• Review of progress against 2014 Business  
Plan objectives;
• Overview of the UK and European property  
and retail markets and future trends;
• Evaluation of risks in relation to economic 
forecasts, their impact on the Company  
and mitigation;
• Presentation from external advisers on  
linking the Company’s strategy to  
its brand proposition;
• Improving financial performance through  
optimal capital allocation; 
• Growth opportunities in other territories  
and sectors;
• Review sustainability performance  
and opportunities to create  
sustainability leadership;
• Improving the performance of the Group’s 
winning retail venues; and
• Increasing retail spend through  
operational strategies.
A number of initiatives identified as a result of the 
Strategy Day have been incorporated into the Business 
Plan for 2015. The Business Plan influences objectives 
set for the Executive Directors and throughout the 
business for 2015.
DA VID ATKINS’ PERSPECTIVE
Holding this year’s Strategy Day in Les Terrasses du Port, Marseille 
had a huge impact. Being in our newest centre brought our 
strategy to life and gave the Directors real insight into current 
themes and trading through direct contact with our staff and  
our shoppers. We experienced and saw first hand, the latest 
technology, design innovation and industry-leading sustainability 
in the Centre. This really helped to inspire us to challenge our 
ideas about the future strategy of the business.
For me, the importance of the Strategy Day lies not in the 
discussion of day-to-day issues – that’s the job of the Executive 
Directors and management – but rather in the opportunity to be 
ambitious in setting our strategic goals as a Board, to propose the 
unconventional and evaluate our reactions to new themes and 
ideas. We do not confine ourselves to our sector but look at other 
sectors too – for example, other consumer-facing businesses – 
and we evaluate the best of what they are doing.
The key to a successful Strategy Day is that broad-ranging 
discussions are stimulated through posing ourselves challenging 
questions and scenarios. This is especially important for the 
Non-Executive Directors who are not involved in the running  
of the business. The insights and ideas generated through 
discussion will not all find their way into our strategy but we  
take away the best initiatives to be refined and included in  
the Business Plan.

YOUR BOARD’S YEAR CONTINUED
66 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 BOARD EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW
The Board recognises that Board evaluation is a continuous process. A thorough and extensive external Board evaluation was carried out in  
2013, progress against which was reviewed as part of the 2014 evaluation and is reported on in the table below. 
The 2014 Board effectiveness review was facilitated by the Company Secretary and focused on questions grouped around governance themes 
taken from the UK Corporate Governance Code. Each Director gave feedback to the Company Secretary who discussed her interviews with the 
Chairman and a report with recommendations was tabled to the Board and actions agreed. The evaluation was conducted in this way to allow 
the Directors to make more informative responses and to establish any specific areas where the Board could improve its performance.
In general the 2014 evaluation highlighted that satisfactory progress had been made against 2013 actions and in the way the Board continued  
to operate. The Board continues to strive for excellence and identified further opportunities for consideration. These included:
• The continued focus on succession planning, particularly for Executive Directors, and talent development;
• Refining the structure of the Strategy Day and how strategic discussions may be facilitated and made more effective;
• Keeping abreast of the opportunities and risks of Value Retail and how they are managed; and
• Further engagement with senior management below Board level.
Where appropriate these actions have been incorporated into the 2015 Board work plan.
A summary of the Board’s progress against actions arising from the 2013 externally facilitated Board effectiveness review is set out below:
Recommendations from 2013 Board Effectiveness Review Progress on actions
Clearly identify optimum mix of skills that the Board needs. During the year the Nomination Committee commenced a 
phased plan for recruiting two new Non-Executive Directors. 
Pierre Bouchut was appointed on 13 February 2015. The 
appointment of a second Non-Executive Director is underway 
and will be a particular focus for the Nomination Committee 
following the 2015 AGM.
Identify the internal talent pool of new executives with  
high potential and create development plans for them.
The Nomination Committee reviewed succession plans in 
June and continues to focus on this area.
Reduced use of printed Board papers should be considered. An electronic Board portal has been introduced as described 
in the Chairman’s introduction on page 61. 
Board agendas should be revised to ensure adequate focus on 
development projects and marketing. The layout of Board 
papers should also be reviewed.
The Board agendas have been revised, as described in the 
Chairman’s introduction on page 61. The layout of Board 
papers has been reviewed in light of the introduction of  
an electronic Board portal.
Effectiveness of reduced number of formal Board  
meetings should be reviewed once a full calendar cycle  
has been completed.
The Board will continue to keep this under review.
Additional engagement between Non-Executive Directors  
and management should be arranged.
Senior managers are invited to attend Board meetings for 
papers with which they have been involved. During the year 
various Non-Executive Directors have met senior managers 
formally and informally for business specific purposes and 
general networking. Two UK centre visits are in the 2015 Board 
work plan where further opportunities will be scheduled to 
meet employees.
DECEMBER
 www.hammerson.com 67
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT DEAR SHAREHOLDER
During the year the membership of the Committee was increased to include all of the Non-Executive 
Directors. This enables the Committee to assist the Board better in discharging its responsibilities including 
reviewing and evaluating the Board’s balance and composition, and making recommendations to the  
Board with regard to any proposed recruitment and other changes.
The Board is mindful of the need to ensure that both it and the Committees continue to have the right 
balance of skills, experience and knowledge to carry out their duties and responsibilities effectively. In 
particular, during the year and in light of the changes to the Board which are described on page 61, the 
Committee has focused its attention on selecting potential new Non-Executive Directors to join the  
Board. The appointment process was conducted with Spencer Stuart, an executive search consultant,  
and culminated in the appointment of Pierre Bouchut as a Non-Executive Director on 13 February 2015.  
The appointment process is described in more detail on page 70. 
The Committee has also considered a successor for Anthony Watson’s role as Senior Independent Director. 
The Senior Independent Director acts as a sounding board for the Chairman, serves as an intermediary for 
the Directors when necessary and is available to shareholders if they have concerns which they have been 
unable to resolve through the normal channels or for which such contact is inappropriate. Following my 
discussions with each of the members of the Committee, we decided that Terry Duddy had the right 
personal qualities and appropriate skills and experience for the role of Senior Independent Director. The 
Board approved the proposal that Terry Duddy be appointed to the role from the conclusion of the  
Annual General Meeting.
One of my key responsibilities in ensuring Board effectiveness is to review, with the assistance of the 
Nomination Committee, succession planning for the Board. During the year the Nomination Committee 
spent time considering the mix of qualifications, skills, experience and knowledge required for an effective 
Board. Further detail on the mix of skills is described on page 69.
In addition, the Committee considered a progress report on the Company’s approach to diversity and  
was pleased to note steps taken to promote diversity within the business, and short to medium-term 
objectives to focus further progress in this area were agreed. You can read more details on the steps the 
Company has taken in the ‘Our People’ section on page 35.

Board balance and mix of skills
During the year the Committee considered the composition of the Board. Each Director brings a particular range of skills and expertise to the 
deliberations of the Board which facilitates constructive and challenging debate around the boardroom table. Background professions of the 
Board include property, banking, auditing, treasury, retail, media, marketing and technology. All Executive Directors have a strong property 
background as well as professional qualifications in their technical sphere and chart 44 below provides further details of the range of skills  
and expertise on the Board. Following the 2013 external Board effectiveness review and subsequent discussion the Board had determined that  
at least one of the next two Non-Executive Directors appointed to the Board should be recruited with continental European experience and a  
wider background in areas such as investment, banking, financing and fund management or asset allocation. These skills would complement  
the other skills on the Board to ensure an appropriate balance. Pierre Bouchut’s appointment to the Board in February 2015 adds to the  
Board’s existing expertise in finance. In addition, he brings considerable senior management experience in the retail sector and a broader 
European perspective.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
Appointment of Non-Executive Director
The Committee led the process that resulted in the appointment  
of Pierre Bouchut. Key steps in the process are outlined below:
• The Committee considered three executive search consultancy 
firms after which Spencer Stuart was appointed to facilitate  
and advise on the search. Spencer Stuart has no other 
connection with the Group and is a signatory to the  
Voluntary Code of Conduct of Executive Search Firms.
• The Committee’s preference was to recruit a senior business 
person with deep experience in the French market and ideally 
with expertise in both retail and finance. Having considered  
the knowledge and experience required a candidate profile  
was prepared.
• It was agreed that the Chairman and the Company Secretary 
review a range of candidates following which a long list  
was prepared for the Chairman by Spencer Stuart.
• The Chairman met and interviewed seven candidates and 
reviewed the respective skills, experience and fit of each  
of the candidates with the Board’s candidate profile. 
• Members of the Committee interviewed the shortlisted 
candidates and the Committee made a recommendation  
to the Board.
• The Board approved the appointment of Pierre Bouchut  
on 13 February 2015.
Succession planning
The Committee considered succession planning for the Executive 
Directors and other key roles in the organisation. Due to the size  
of the organisation the Committee acknowledges that there are  
not necessarily obvious successors for every senior role. Management’s 
plans for the identification, development and readiness of  
talented successors to the Group Executive Committee and senior 
management roles are kept under review. The Committee noted that 
management’s review of individuals’ performance and potential took 
account of the diversity profile within the organisation. Succession 
planning provides an opportunity to ensure that Hammerson  
is developing a capable and diverse talent pool for the future.  
For further details refer to the ‘Our People’ section in the Strategic 
Report on pages 32 to 35.
Diversity
The Board considers that encouraging diversity, including gender 
diversity, within the Group, is an essential driver of long-term success 
and recognises that potential needs to be identified and nurtured at  
all levels of the organisation. The charts on the right illustrate some of 
the factors the Committee takes into account when considering the 
composition of the Board. As at the year end female representation  
on the Board stands at 20%. The Committee will continue to consider 
gender diversity when recommending any future Board appointments. 
However, future appointments will always be made on merit. 
As at 31 December 2014.

70 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 DEAR SHAREHOLDER
On behalf of the Audit Committee, I am pleased to present its report for the year ended 31 December  
2014. Although this is my first report as Chairman of the Committee, I have been a member of the 
Committee since May 2007. I succeeded John Hirst who stepped down after last year’s Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) after nine years of service and I would like to thank John for his considerable contribution  
to the work of the Committee. Shortly after my appointment as Chairman of the Committee I undertook  
a development briefing focusing on the role of Audit Committee Chairman and more details are  
provided on this on page 65. 
I fulfil the requirement of the UK Corporate Governance Code (Code) as the member of the Committee 
nominated as having recent and relevant financial experience. In addition, my fellow Committee members 
are individuals who hold or have held senior office in business and have both the knowledge and 
experience to properly discharge their duties and a good understanding of the issues under consideration. 
We are supported in turn by members of the senior management of the Company and by the expertise  
of the external auditor, Deloitte LLP (Deloitte), whose representatives regularly attend meetings. In addition, 
the Committee met with Deloitte and the internal auditor, Ernst & Young LLP (EY) without management 
being present to enable full and frank discussion and to satisfy itself that the external and internal auditors 
had not been unduly influenced by management.
The Committee met three times during the year and attendance at these meetings is set out in the 
Company’s report on compliance with the Code on page 94. During the year, the Committee paid particular 
attention to significant judgements in relation to the Group’s financial statements. These are significant by 
virtue of their impact on the Group’s results and the remuneration of senior management. The main areas  
of focus during the year are set out in table 48 on page 72. 
An essential element of the Committee’s work during the year is the scrutiny applied to the valuation of the 
Group’s property portfolio. Having carried out a review of the Committee’s schedule of meetings, I decided 
that an additional meeting would be held in January to allow the Committee extra time to review, debate 
and challenge the valuation prepared by the Company’s external valuer DTZ Debenham Tie Leung (DTZ) 
and also Cushman and Wakefield (C&W) who valued the premium outlet centres. This January meeting  
will be included in future in the Committee’s schedule.
The Committee satisfied itself that the Annual Report is a document which allows shareholders to assess  
the Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy. The Committee considered  
a paper from management on how each of the elements highlighted on the left had been addressed.  
In addition the Annual Report was reviewed by a number of external parties as part of the process  
before the Committee made its recommendation to the Board that the Annual Report is fair, balanced  
and understandable.
In December, the Committee carried out an assessment of its performance and, in its opinion, continues to 
perform its role efficiently and effectively. I am confident that the Committee continues to satisfy itself that 
the internal and external systems of control and safeguards at Hammerson are working well throughout  
the business to ensure that risks are mitigated and managed appropriately. 
I would like to thank Deloitte, on behalf of the Board, for the continuing high quality of the audit services 
they have provided to the Group during the year.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT Table Fig 48
Significant financial judgements 
During the year, the Committee considered the appropriateness of significant financial judgements made in connection with the financial 
statements as set out below:
Significant financial 
judgement considered 
during the year Why this issue is considered significant How the Committee addressed the issue
Valuation of the  
Group’s property 
portfolio (excluding 
Premium Outlets)
Please see page  
114 for more details  
about Valuations. 
The valuation of the Group’s property 
portfolio, including those held in  
joint ventures, is a key risk due to its 
significance in the context of the Group’s 
net asset value. Although valuations are 
conducted externally by DTZ, the nature 
of the valuation process and estimates 
are inherently subjective. The outcome 
of this judgement is also a key 
determinant of the Group’s results  
and affects investment decisions.
The Committee has a robust process in place to satisfy itself that  
the external valuation of the Group’s property portfolio is appropriate.  
The Committee recognises that the Group operates in two liquid and 
mature markets, the UK and France, in which there are well established 
and respected valuation professionals. The Committee reviewed the 
outcomes of DTZ’s valuations, challenged their assumptions and was 
satisfied that procedures and methodologies used were appropriate.  
The Committee is also familiar with the processes by which management 
provides information to DTZ. Current conditions and recent transactions 
in the market were reviewed to provide context. DTZ were asked  
to highlight any significant judgements and disagreements with 
management and the Committee satisfied itself of DTZ’s independence. 
The Committee was satisfied that the valuation of the Group’s  
property portfolio was prudent and reasonably based. 
Accounting for 
property transactions
Please see page  
114 for more details  
about property 
transactions.
During the year, the Group made several 
acquisitions and disposals including 
interests in joint ventures. There are  
risks in the accounting process for  
these complex transactions.
The Committee, in conjunction with Deloitte, reviewed and challenged 
management’s accounting proposal and key judgements, and was 
satisfied that the approach adopted was appropriate.
Premium Outlet 
investments 
(Value Retail  
and VIA Outlets) 
Please see page  
44 for more details  
about outlets. 
The Group has a significant investment 
in Value Retail (VR) and acquired a  
47% interest in VIA Outlets (VIA) during 
2014. These investments are externally 
managed and due to the complexity of 
the underlying structures, there is a risk 
of inaccurate and inconsistent reporting.
The Committee discussed the proposed accounting treatment for the 
Group’s interests in VR and VIA, which is based on the nature of the 
Group’s control over those investments. The Committee also reviewed 
the accounting associated with the VIA acquisition and the valuations  
of each investment ‘s property portfolio which are undertaken by  
C&W. The Committee concluded that both investments had been 
recognised appropriately.
REIT status
Please see page  
125 for more  
details about Tax.
Maintenance of the Group’s REIT status for 
its UK operations and under the SIIC rules 
for its French operations is dependent  
on compliance with certain conditions  
in each jurisdiction. The beneficial tax 
regime resulting from REIT status has a 
significant impact on the Group’s results.
The Committee reviewed compliance with UK REIT and French  
SIIC legislation and concluded that the Group continues to meet  
the requirements. 
Adoption of IFRS 11 
joint arrangements
Please see page  
131 for more  
details about joint 
arrangements.
The Group has adopted IFRS 11 in  
2014 which requires the Group to equity 
account for its joint ventures (previously 
proportionally consolidated). This 
change has a significant impact  
on the presentation of the Group’s  
financial statements.
The Committee, in conjunction with Deloitte, has reviewed the 
disclosure requirements. Management’s methodology, as presented  
in its paper to the Committee, was considered. The Committee was 
satisfied that management has appropriately adopted the accounting 
standard and explained the presentational impact of the new  
standard to shareholders in an appropriate manner.
Going concern
Please see page  
54 for more details  
about Going concern. 
A critical risk is the Company’s solvency 
and liquidity and the appropriateness  
of preparing the Group’s financial 
statements on a going concern basis.
The Committee evaluated management’s assessment of the 
appropriateness of the Group preparing its half-year and annual financial 
statements on a going concern basis and approved the Statement which 
appears on page 54. The Committee considered the Group’s liquidity by 
reviewing reports on the renewal and maturity profile of debt, forecast  
cash flows (including the level of committed expenditure), funding 
requirements and contingent liabilities. The Committee also considered 
these forecasts against the financial covenants in the Group’s borrowing 
facilities and concluded that the going concern basis was appropriate.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
72 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 for other services provided by Deloitte to the Company and 
confirmation is sought that the fee payable for the annual audit  
is sufficient to enable Deloitte to perform its obligations in  
accordance with the scope of the audit.
During 2014 non-audit services provided by Deloitte to the Company 
included acting as reporting accountants for tax related work and the 
Group’s sustainability reporting. Fees for non-audit services provided  
to the Company by Deloitte for the year ended 31 December 2014  
were £0.1m. 
Risk management and internal control
The Committee assists the Board to fulfil its responsibilities in relation 
to the adequacy and effectiveness of the control environment and the 
Group’s compliance with the Code. 
Throughout the year, the Committee monitored the effectiveness of 
the Group’s systems of risk management and internal control, including 
financial, operational and compliance controls. In particular the 
Committee reviewed:
• Deloitte’s management letters;
• Internal audit reports, including monitoring the implementation 
of recommendations arising from them;
• Reports on the system of internal control and the risk 
management framework;
• The Company’s approach to compliance with legislation and the 
prevention of fraud;
• Business continuity and cyber risk; and
• Gifts and entertainment and expenses registers.
Internal audit
EY has provided an internal audit service to the Group since August 
2013. During the year the Committee has monitored the internal audit 
process through management updates and reviewing EY reports, and 
EY has been challenged on its findings at Committee meetings. The 
Committee continues to be satisfied with the service provided by  
EY since their appointment and has approved the continuation of  
EY’s appointment as internal auditor for 2015. Now that a full annual 
internal audit cycle has been completed the Committee will review 
more formally the effectiveness of EY during 2015.
An annual programme of reviews of the controls established to 
mitigate the risk areas identified in the risk management framework  
is undertaken to ensure that they are operating correctly. During  
the year, internal audits were carried out on a number of business 
processes, including:
• Shopping centre property management and operational controls;
• Car park controls;
• Management of tenant credit risk;
• Joint venture management processes; and
• Leasing processes.
These reviews and the implementation of recommendations arising 
from them are overseen and coordinated by a Risk and Controls 
Committee whose primary role is to ensure that internal control is 
integrated into the Group’s daily operations.
Effectiveness of the external audit process
The Committee assessed the effectiveness of the external audit 
process during the year by monitoring Deloitte’s fulfilment of the 
agreed audit plan and its reports on the significant matters and 
judgements that arose from the audit plan. The Committee received 
regular feedback from management on the level of support provided 
by Deloitte. The Committee determined that Deloitte provides an 
appropriate level of service delivered by a team which consistently 
looks for ways to maintain and improve the high standards it sets itself. 
During the year the Committee also considered the re-appointment  
of Deloitte and assessed their independence. 
In forming its opinion of the independence and objectivity of  
Deloitte the Committee reviewed:
• The independence safeguards operating within Deloitte;
• Deloitte’s Audit Transparency Report for the year ended  
31 May 2014; and
• The extent of non-audit services provided by Deloitte.
Deloitte or its predecessor firms have been the Company’s external 
auditors since the Company was founded in 1942. Deloitte is required 
to rotate the audit partner responsible for the Group audit at least 
every five years to protect auditor independence and objectivity.  
Ian Waller, the current audit lead partner has been in place since April  
2012 and is expected to continue until the conclusion of the financial 
statements for 2016. Under the Company’s current interpretation  
of the transitional arrangements for mandatory audit rotation,  
the Company will be required to rotate the audit for the financial 
statements for 2021. In advance of that date the Committee will  
reflect on retendering the Auditor’s appointment. 
The Committee has concluded that the external audit was carried  
out effectively and efficiently with the necessary objectivity and 
independence. It has recommended to the Board that Deloitte be 
re-appointed at the 2015 AGM.
Non-audit services
The Committee is responsible for the development, implementation 
and monitoring of the Group’s policy on the engagement of the 
external auditor to supply non-audit services to the Group, the 
principal requirements of which are that:
• The external auditor may not provide a service which places  
it in a position where it may be required to audit its own  
work, such as book keeping or valuation services; and
• Some services may be provided in specific and exceptional 
circumstances and may include tax compliance work, due 
diligence and property related consultancy. Each occasion is 
specifically assessed and authorised by an Executive Director  
up to a limit of £50,000 and above that limit by the Chairman  
of the Audit Committee.
The full policy on non-audit services is available at  
www.hammerson.com.
As shown in note 4 to the accounts on page 122, Deloitte’s 
remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2014 was £0.7m. 
Consideration is given to the nature of and remuneration received

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT RISK MANAGEMENT IN ACTION –  
ELEVATING RISKS
At the beginning of 2014 each Group Executive Committee 
member was asked to consider and submit their top five 
risks to the business. The responses were reviewed and 
collated into a schedule for further discussion by the Group 
Executive Committee and as a basis for reviewing the status 
of risks or capturing new risks in the risk management 
framework (which is described in further detail on pages  
55 to 59 of the Annual Report). This exercise was repeated 
during the year and the summary review of risks was 
compared against the key risks KPIs set out in the risk 
management framework to ensure that they were being 
adequately monitored and addressed. As a result some  
risk KPIs were updated. The Risk and Controls Committee 
discussed the risks identified which were incorporated into 
the risk management framework with appropriate risk 
mitigation steps identified.
The intention of these regular reviews was to make the risk 
management framework a dynamic document, promoting 
discussions about how risks are evolving and whether they 
are being addressed effectively across the business.
Risk and Controls Committee
This committee is not a committee of the Board but of executives  
from across the business, including UK shopping centres, retail parks, 
French shopping centres and finance and project management teams 
and is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer. The committee reports  
its activities to the Group Executive Committee.
The role of the Risk and Controls Committee is to:
• Promote the application of the risk management framework 
throughout the business;
• Encourage pro-active discussion of risk around the business;
• Manage the annual internal audit programme;
• Consider the results and recommendations of reviews; and
• Monitor the implementation of recommendations.
Anti bribery and corruption
The Committee oversees and monitors the policies and procedures 
which form the core components of the Group’s adequate  
procedures under the Bribery Act, including the Code of Conduct  
and Whistleblowing Policy. During the year the Code of Conduct  
and the Whistleblowing Policy were reviewed, updated and  
approved by the Committee.
The Code of Conduct explains how employees are expected to  
fulfil their responsibilities by acting in the best interests of the Group  
and in line with its corporate and financial objectives. This includes 
compliance with laws and regulations; acting fairly in dealing with 
customers, suppliers and other stakeholders; maintaining integrity in 
financial reporting; treating people with respect and operating within 
a control framework which includes environmental and health and 
safety policies. A summary of the Code of Conduct is available on  
the Company’s website.
The Whistleblowing Policy sets out a procedure by which employees 
may report suspicion of fraud, financial irregularity or other malpractice. 
No reports of any such matters have been received during the year. 
The Company subscribes to the independent charity, Public Concern 
at Work, so that employees may have free access to its helpline.

PROCESS DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 
December 2014. This is my first year as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
(Committee), having succeeded Anthony Watson. I would like to thank Anthony for 
chairing the Committee for a number of years, and for the assistance and support he  
has given me in 2014.
At our AGM in 2014, our remuneration policy (Policy) was approved. No changes are  
being made to that Policy.
As you will have read earlier in this Annual Report, this was another successful year for the 
Company. Adjusted earnings per share grew to 23.9 pence; like-for-like NRI increased by 
2.1% and the cost: income ratio reduced to 23.4%. Using estimated numbers for total 
property return (TPR), the outcome of financial and personal objective performance 
measures resulted in an average of 65% of maximum bonus opportunity for 2014. Our TPR 
relative to an appropriate peer group is a component of both annual bonus (AIP) and long 
term incentives (LTIP). For 2014, we changed the indices for AIP . These indices are published 
by IPD each April and so, for 2014 and in future, the TPR component of AIP reported in the 
Annual Report will be estimated. No bonus payments for TPR are made until the actual 
index data becomes available. We will report the actual outturn on this measure, and the 
bonus payment, in our 2015 Annual Report. 
In April, the Committee was disappointed when, despite good performance relative to  
our peer group, the 2011 LTIP awards did not vest to any material extent, contributing to  
an overall reduction in Executive Director total remuneration of 16%. This was largely a 
result of the continued comparison with office portfolios, which is now inappropriate  
given the change of focus of the Company in late 2012 to retail only. The Committee will  
decide at its April 2015 meeting whether the TPR element of the 2012 LTIP awards  
should be compared solely against our retail property peer group. The policy of granting 
LTIP awards to each Executive Director remains unchanged. However, Executive Directors 
continue to set an example given on-going cost control measures, and have requested 
that 2015 LTIP awards should again be at less than the agreed norm of 200% of salary,  
and grants will be made at a reduced level of 150% of salary. There are also no planned 
increases in base salaries for Executive Directors in 2015.
Following member consultation, the Company’s defined benefit pension scheme 
(Scheme) was closed to future accruals for all participating employees during the year. 
David Atkins and Peter Cole ceased to accrue further benefits within the Scheme and 
became eligible for salary supplements instead.
In December, the Company received a ‘PWC Building Public Trust Award’ for the best 
executive remuneration report within the FTSE 100. A substantial amount of effort goes  
into presenting shareholders with a clear and comprehensive remuneration report,  
and I am pleased that this work has received public recognition.

Notes
1. David Atkins has external non-executive appointments, disclosed in the Directors’ Biographies on page 98. He does not receive a fee for any of these appointments.
2. Timon Drakesmith acts as the Company’s representative as a non-executive director of Value Retail PLC. He does not receive a fee for this appointment. 
3. For consistency and comparison against other Executive Directors, Jean-Philippe Mouton’s remuneration has been converted from euros into sterling in table 52.  
The exchange rate that has been used is £1: €1.241 (2013: £1:€1.178). His base salary was €400,000 in 2013 and €408,000 in 2014.
4. Benefits: taxable benefits (company car or car allowance and private medical health and, for Jean-Philippe Mouton, a seniority allowance and welfare contribution)  
and all-employee arrangements (for the UK Executive Directors, SIP and Sharesave; for the France Executive Director, profit sharing scheme and employer’s contribution  
to an employee savings scheme).
5. AIP: Achievement against Company financial targets and personal objectives (using estimated TPR outcomes) resulted in an average entitlement for Executive Directors  
of approximately 65% (2013: 54%) of the maximum bonus opportunity. Details of annual bonus outcomes are on page 79.
6. LTIP: 2013 figures were estimated in the 2013 Annual Report as final data for the TPR performance measure was not available at the date of publication. The 2013 figures  
above have been updated to reflect the actual outcome using final TPR data. Details of the calculation for the 2013 and 2014 LTIP are at table 53 below. Final figures for  
2014 will be presented in the 2015 Annual Report. Estimates are for reporting purposes only. 
7. Pension: Full pension details and the method for calculating the pension figures above are given on pages 82 and 83. 
8. During the year, no payments were made to Executive Directors for expenses other than those incurred wholly and directly in the course of their employment.
Basis for calculating the values attributable to each performance measure for the L TIP
Table 53 provides a breakdown of the values attributable to each performance measure that when aggregated produce the single figure for  
the LTIP in table 52. The basis for any assumptions used is also detailed. Details of the LTIP award that vested in 2014 can be found at table 59.

TSR The 2014 figure for TSR is for the 2011 LTIP award that vested in 2014. The performance period ended on 1 April 2014 for awards to David Atkins, Peter Cole and 
Jean-Philippe Mouton. For Timon Drakesmith, the performance period ended on 6 June 2014 (2011 LTIP award and second tranche of the Recruitment Share Award). 
Values are calculated using actual performance and the share price on the date of vesting (615.50p for Timon Drakesmith).
TPR The 2014 figures are estimated values for awards scheduled to vest in 2015 (where the performance period ended on 31 December 2014) as final IPD index data is  
not available at the date of publication. The estimate compares the Company’s actual TPR figures with the best available information. Final IPD data will be available  
in April 2015 and the award will vest in May 2015. The estimated value is nil. The actual 2014 figure for TPR will be reported in the 2015 Annual Report.
The 2013 figures for TPR where the performance period ended on 31 December 2013 was estimated ‘nil’ in the 2013 Annual Report as some IPD index data was not 
available at the date of publication. The 2013 figures for TPR are the actual values that vested (see table 59). The values are calculated using the share price on the  
date of vesting (615.50p for Timon Drakesmith, 576.00p for other Directors).
Absolute 
NAV
The 2014 figures for Absolute NAV are the values for awards that are scheduled to vest in 2015 (where the performance period ended on 31 December 2014).  
The value for 2014 is nil.

BASE SALARY
As reported last year, base salary levels for the Executive Directors increased in 2014 by between 2% and 3.6%. For 2015, the Committee 
determined that there would be no increase in base salaries. A number of factors were considered in making this decision including the impact  
of historically low inflationary pressure and the Company’s cost reduction objectives. Executive remuneration benchmarking data was reviewed 
to ensure that base salaries remain competitive.
Jean-Philippe Mouton’s salary (and the other elements of his remuneration) is denominated in euros. When converted, the sterling equivalent  
will vary with currency movements.

The TPR performance measure is based on IPD UK Retail Property (70%) and France Retail Property (30%) indices. However, data for the IPD  
France Retail Property index is published each year in April, and is not available at 13 February 2015. Accordingly, the level of payout for 2014 is 
estimated, based on management’s best estimate using available data (see page 49, table 32 for property returns data). The TPR element of any 
bonus payment to Executive Directors (including the deferred shares element awarded under the DBSS) is made only when all the IPD index  
data is available for the calculation of the TPR performance measure.
The element of bonus determined for each performance measure is calculated by interpolating the actual performance achieved for each 
measure against the scale between entry threshold for vesting and the target to achieve full vesting.
The cost control target was changed in 2014 from an absolute measure to a ratio to align it with the Company’s stated intention of reducing  
the Group total operating costs as a percentage of the income to 21% by 2016.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ PERSONAL OBJECTIVES
Executive Directors are able to earn up to 30% of the maximum award for achieving personal objectives. All Executive Directors’ personal 
objectives were designed to focus not only on the delivery of the Business Plan for 2014, but also on the strategic objectives set out  
on page 3. 
Table 57 below provides detail of some of the significant achievements against personal objectives for the Executive Directors. The personal 
objectives for each Executive Director in 2014 were not disclosed in the 2013 Annual Report as the Board considered them to be commercially 
sensitive. Payout levels were 100% for Timon Drakesmith, 80% for David Atkins and Jean-Philippe Mouton and 65% for Peter Cole.

LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP)
The structure of the LTIP awards, as well as the performance measures and conditions attached to the awards align closely with the Company’s 
strategic focus. Since 2011, the awards have incorporated a balance of relative and absolute measures, and the Remuneration Committee believes 
that this balance remains appropriate.
The structure of the 2015 awards remains the same as the 2014 awards. The comparator group for the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measure 
focuses on major European retail real estate companies and the Total Property Return (TPR) measure compares performance against a retail  
only property index. With regard to the absolute performance measure, earnings per share (EPS) continues to align the interests of Executive 
Directors with those of shareholders. Details of the LTIP structure are set out in table 58.

1. Corio will be excluded from the comparator group on the assumption that the takeover offer by Klepierre announced in July 2014, will proceed.
2. Subsequent to publishing the 2013 Annual Report but prior to granting awards, IVG entered into insolvency. It was excluded from the comparator group when the awards 
were made.
3.  In order to smooth the transition from a three-year performance period to a four-year performance period, an enhanced award of 300% of salary was made in 2011, with half of 
the award subject to a three-year performance period (which vested in 2014) and half subject to a four-year performance period (vesting in 2015). This avoided a vesting ‘gap’ in 
2014 and, overall, results in only a modest reduction in potential awards vesting to Executive Directors in the three-year period from 2014 to 2016 (assuming a consistent level 
of performance is achieved). The second half of the award (i.e. 150% of salary) is shown above, as it remains outstanding and will, subject to performance, vest in 2015.

LTIP PERFORMANCE MEASURES
TSR TPR EPS/Absolute NAV
Performance is measured over the four-year 
period from the date of grant, in comparison 
with a comparator group, including some 
European real estate companies.
Performance is measured over the four 
financial years commencing with the year  
of grant and in comparison with a composite 
index comprising: 
• For awards granted from 2013: 
Investment Property Databank’s  
UK Annual Retail Property Index and 
France Annual Retail Property Index. 
• For awards granted from 2009 to 2012: 
Investment Property Databank’s UK 
Annual All Property Index and France 
Annual All Property Index. 
The relative composition of the indices  
may vary with each grant to ensure that it 
reflects the Company’s portfolio.
Performance is measured over the four-year 
period from 1 January in the year of grant,  
and is calculated with reference to the EPRA 
Best Practices recommendations. 
EPS (for awards granted from 2013).
The composition of the EPS measure may  
vary with each grant to ensure it reflects the 
Company’s portfolio. From 2015, a blend of  
UK and French CPI will be used, whereas in  
2012 to 2014 RPI was used.
Absolute NAV (for awards granted in 2011  
and 2012). 
Calculated as adjusted shareholders’ funds 
divided by the adjusted number of shares  
in issue.

LTIP PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS
TSR TPR EPS/Absolute NAV
Vesting under the TSR performance  
measure is as follows:
Less than TSR of median-ranked  
entity in comparator group 0%
Equal to TSR of median-ranked  
entity in comparator group 25%
Equal to TSR of upper quartile- 
ranked entity in comparator group 100%
Vesting for intermediate performance 
between median and upper quartile-ranked 
entities is on a linear scale between 25%  
and 100%. For awards made from 2014 
onwards interpolation is between the TSR  
of the median and upper quartile-ranked 
companies on a straight-line basis on 
performance of those positions between 
25% and 100%.
Vesting under the TSR performance measure 
is subject to the Committee’s satisfaction 
that the Company’s underlying performance 
has been satisfactory in comparison with 
that of the FTSE Real Estate sector.
Vesting under the TPR performance 
measure is as follows:

PENSION*
Pension arrangements for the year ended 31 December 2014 are detailed below. All salary supplements paid to Executive Directors as part  
of their pension arrangements are subject to deductions as required for income tax and social security contributions in the UK and France.  
Salary supplements and the pension benefit received by Jean-Philippe Mouton do not qualify for AIP purposes or entitlements under the LTIP .  
All benefits accruing under the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme (Scheme) and all salary supplements are reflected in the Single Figure 
Remuneration Table (table 52).
Timon Drakesmith
Timon Drakesmith receives a salary supplement of 20% of base salary by way of pension provision. The actual amount paid by the Company  
for the year ended 31 December 2014 was £81,200 (2013: £80,000). 
Jean-Philippe Mouton
Jean-Philippe Mouton receives a salary supplement of €80,000 in lieu of any supplementary pension benefit. In addition, he participates in a 
legacy collective supplementary defined contribution pension scheme operated by his French employing company where the contributions  
are subject to statutory limits. For 2014, the benefit he received under this scheme was €12,105 (2013: €11,939).
David Atkins
David Atkins receives a salary supplement of 30% of base salary by way of pension provision. This was effective from 2 April 2014, when he  
ceased to accrue further benefits in the Scheme.
For the period 1 January 2014 to 1 April 2014, David Atkins received a salary supplement in lieu of pension benefits as he elected to restrict the 
value of the pension benefits accrued in the Scheme over the 2013/2014 tax year to the annual allowance defined under pension legislation 
(currently £40,000). The salary supplement was calculated to be equal in value to the pension benefits that David Atkins would otherwise have 
accrued in the Scheme over the period, at a rate of 1/60th of final salary for each year of service.
On ceasing to accrue further benefits in the Scheme, David Atkins became eligible for a deferred pension based on his pensionable salary and 
service at that point. Further details of this are provided below.
The actual salary supplement paid by the Company for the year ended 31 December 2014 was £177,214 (2013: £97,829).
Peter Cole
Peter Cole receives a salary supplement of 30% of base salary by way of pension provision. This was effective from 1 July 2014, when he ceased  
to accrue further benefits in the Scheme.
For the period 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2014, Peter Cole accrued benefits in the Scheme at a rate of approximately 1/45th of final salary for  
each year of service.
On ceasing to accrue further benefits in the Scheme, Peter Cole became eligible for a deferred pension based on his pensionable salary and 
service at that point. Further details of this are provided below.
The pension figure disclosed for Peter Cole represents the increase in accrued pension in the Scheme over the year (net of inflation) multiplied  
by a factor of 20, plus a salary supplement of £65,250 in respect of the period 1 July 2014 to 31 December 2014.
Defined Benefit Pension Scheme 
In 2014, David Atkins and Peter Cole ceased to accrue benefits in the Scheme. Pension entitlements are calculated by reference to base salary.  
The Scheme is non-contributory for members. The normal retirement age under the Scheme is 60; members may draw their pension from age 
55, subject to actuarial reduction and the Trustees’ consent. Further information concerning the Scheme can be found in note 6 to the accounts 
on pages 122 to 124 and the Policy reproduced from page 170. A detailed breakdown of deferred benefits under the Scheme for David Atkins 
and Peter Cole is provided in tables 62, 63 and 64.
82 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Executive Directors’ deferred benefits under the Scheme
In the table below, the total accrued benefit at 31 December 2014 represents the annual pension that is expected to be payable on retirement, 
given the length of pensionable service and salary of each Executive Director at the date each ceased accruing benefits under the Scheme.  
The increase in accrued benefit earned during the year represents the increase in this expected pension, including the effect of inflation, when 
compared with the position at 31 December 2013. The increase in accrued benefit during the year excluding the effect of inflation is also shown.

Table 63 shows the transfer values calculated in accordance with regulations 7 to 7E of the Occupational Pensions Schemes (Transfer Values) 
Regulations 1996 and subsequent amendments. 
The Listing Rules figures in table 63 represent the transfer value of the increase in accrued benefits during the period to 31 December 2014 
(excluding inflation) for each Director. 
Transfer values of accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the Scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider  
on transferring the Scheme’s liability in respect of the Executive Director’s pension benefits. They do not represent sums paid or payable to 
individual Executive Directors and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration. Instead, they represent a potential  
liability of the Scheme. The statutory disclosures are based on required assumptions.

General notes
1.  Face values for the DBSS and LTIP awards made in 2014 have been calculated using the grant price in accordance with the respective plan rules:
 – For the DBSS, the grant price was 576.83 pence, which was the average share price over the three business days immediately preceding the award date; and
 – For the LTIP , the grant price was 555.40 pence, which was the average share price over the five business days immediately preceding the award date.
 – Notional dividend shares accruing are not included in the calculation.
2. Details of the performance measures and conditions for the LTIP can be found on page 81.
3.  The aggregate gain from share awards that vested during 2014 was £1,081,131 (2013: £3,025,252). 
4.  For LTIP awards made to Jean-Philippe Mouton prior to 2014, there is no accrual of notional dividend shares. For French tax reasons, LTIP awards granted to Jean-Philippe 
Mouton are in the form of conditional awards of free shares, not share options. 
The Executive Directors’ interests in ordinary shares of the Company under the Share Incentive Plan (SIP) as at 31 December 2014 are shown  
in table 76. The shares are held under a SIP trust. Jean-Philippe Mouton is not eligible to participate in the SIP .

92 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
The objective of the Committee in implementing the Policy during 2015, in line with the Main Principle D.1 of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, is to ensure that the design of Executive Directors’ remuneration promotes the long-term success of the Company and that performance-
related elements should be transparent, stretching and rigorously applied. The variable pay arrangements reflect the Company’s strategic 
priorities, taking suitable account of risk and corporate social responsibility factors. Variable pay structures include provision for malus and 
claw-back as set out in the Policy, which is reproduced from page 170. 
Implementation of the Policy requires the Committee to continue to take into account remuneration packages available within other comparable 
companies, the Company’s overall performance, internal relativities, achievement of corporate objectives, individual performance and experience, 
published views of institutional investors and general market trends and performance. 
Generally, two-thirds of the Executive Directors’ total target remuneration (excluding pension and benefits) is performance related, through the 
annual performance-related bonus plan (AIP) and a long term incentive plan (LTIP). Performance measures associated with remuneration are 
linked to key performance indicators incorporating group financial targets, as set out on page 3 and stretching personal performance objectives.
By order of the Board

 www.hammerson.com 93 COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
This section of the Corporate Governance Report details the 
Company’s compliance with the Principles set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (Code) which is available at www.frc.org.uk. This 
section should be read in conjunction with the Corporate Governance 
Report as a whole as set out on pages 60 to 99.
On 17 September 2014, a revised UK Corporate Governance Code  
was published. The new Code applies to companies with reporting  
periods beginning on or after 1 October 2014. Hammerson will report 
in accordance with the requirements of the new Code in 2015. 
A. Leadership
A.1 The Role of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible to the Company’s shareholders  
for the long-term success of the Group and the delivery of the 
long-term strategic and operational objectives of the Group. The Board 
sets the strategic direction, governance and values of the Group and 
has ultimate responsibility for the management, direction and 
performance of the Group.
The Board operates through a sound risk management  
and internal control system, details of which can be found  
on pages 55 to 59 and 73 to 74.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for  
its decision which can be accessed at www.hammerson.com.
The Board has regular scheduled meetings throughout the year and 
held six scheduled meetings in 2014. Additional Board conference calls 
are held as required between the formal Board meetings. The table 
below includes attendance at formal Board meetings and scheduled 
Board conference calls. Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to 
communicate directly with Executive Directors and senior management 
between formal Board meetings. All Directors are expected to attend all 
meetings of the Board, and of those Committees on which they serve 
and the Annual General Meeting (AGM), and to devote sufficient time 
to the Company’s affairs to enable them to fulfil their duties as Directors. 
Details of Directors’ attendance at each of the Board and Committee 
meetings during 2014 are set out in the table below.
A.2 Division of responsibilities
The roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and Chief Executive are 
separate. They are clearly defined and documented and approved by the 
Board. The Chairman, David Tyler, is responsible for the operation of the 
Board. The Chief Executive, David Atkins, is responsible for leading and 
managing the business within the authorities delegated by the Board.
A.3 The Chairman
The Chairman sets the Board’s agenda and ensures that important 
matters and in particular strategic issues, receive adequate time and 
attention at meetings. The annual Board Strategy Day is dedicated to 
considering the future direction of the Company at the start of the 
business planning process.
Further details of the 2014 Board Strategy  
Day can be found on page 66.
At the time of becoming Chairman in 2013, David Tyler was considered 
independent. In accordance with the Code, the continuing test of 
independence for the Chairman is not appropriate.
A.4 Non-Executive Directors
Anthony Watson is the Senior Independent Director. He is available  
to address shareholders’ concerns on governance and, if necessary,  
other issues that have not been resolved through the normal channels 
of communication with the Chairman, Chief Executive or Chief  
Financial Officer, or in cases when such communications would be 
inappropriate. The Senior Independent Director can also deputise  
for the Chairman in his absence, act as a sounding board for the 
Chairman and be available to advise and counsel all Board colleagues.
The Senior Independent Director chairs an annual meeting of Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors without the Chairman present to appraise 
the Chairman’s performance and to address any other matters which 
the Directors might wish to raise. The outcome of these discussions  
is conveyed by the Senior Independent Director to the Chairman.

94 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Anthony Watson will retire from the Board following the 2015 AGM 
and will be succeeded by Terry Duddy as Senior Independent Director.
The Chairman meets with the Non-Executive Directors as necessary, 
but at least twice each year without the Executive Directors present.
If any Director has concerns about the running of the Company or  
a proposed action which cannot be resolved, such concerns will be 
recorded in the Board minutes. No such concerns arose in 2014.
B. Effectiveness
B.1 The Composition of the Board
During the year the Board reviewed the overall balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the Board and 
Committee members.
The Board is satisfied that the Non-Executive Directors, each of  
whom is independent from management and has no material  
or other connection with the Company, are able to exercise 
independent judgement.
The Board undertakes an annual review of the independence of  
its Non-Executive Directors in accordance with the criteria set out 
within the Code.
Anthony Watson will retire following the 2015 AGM and it is planned 
that Jacques Espinasse will retire from the Board in April 2016.
There are currently seven Non-Executive Directors (including the 
Chairman) and four Executive Directors on the Board.
B.2 Appointments to the Board
The Nomination Committee, chaired by the Chairman and  
consisting of all Non-Executive Directors, leads the process  
for Board appointments and makes recommendations to  
the Board. The Committee’s terms of reference can be found  
at www.hammerson.com.
Further details of the work of the Nomination  
Committee can be found on pages 68 to 70.
Disclosures on diversity can be found  
on pages 35 and 70.
During the year the Nomination Committee appointed Spencer  
Stuart, an independent executive search firm, which does not have  
any other connection with the Company, to identify non-executive 
director candidates. Following a thorough search carried out by 
Spencer Stuart, Pierre Bouchut was identified as a potential candidate 
and subsequently recommended to the Board by the Committee.  
Pierre Bouchut was appointed as a Non-Executive Director  
and member of the Audit and Nomination Committees on  
13 February 2015.
Further details of the recruitment process are described on page 70.
B.3 Commitment
The Board is satisfied that each of the Non-Executive Directors is able 
to devote sufficient time to the Company’s business. Non-Executive 
Directors are advised on appointment of the time required to fulfil  
the role and asked to confirm that they can make the required 
commitment. Their commitment to their role is reviewed annually  
as part of their annual appraisal. Letters of appointment for the 
Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at the AGM.
Positions held by Non-Executive Directors  
are set out on pages 98 and 99.
Each Executive Director is encouraged to take a non-executive  
position in another company or organisation. The appointment  
to such a position is subject to the approval of the Board which 
considers, in particular, the time commitment required.
B.4 Development
All Directors appointed to the Board receive an induction programme 
which takes into account their qualifications and experience. All 
Directors are kept informed of changes in relevant legislation and 
regulations and changing financial and commercial risks, with the 
assistance of the Company’s legal advisors and external auditor, where 
appropriate. Executive Directors are subject to the Company’s annual 
performance development review process through which their 
performance against pre-determined objectives is reviewed and  
their personal and professional development needs are considered.
Non-Executive Directors’ training and personal development 
requirements are reviewed and agreed as part of the annual  
appraisal of their performance, conducted by the Chairman.  
Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to attend seminars and 
undertake external training at the Company’s expense in areas 
considered appropriate for their professional development  
including on issues relevant to the Board and Committees to  
which they belong.
Details of the development programme for Jacques Espinasse  
can be found on page 65.
B.5 Information and support
The Directors have access to independent professional advice  
at the Company’s expense and to the advice and services of  
the Company Secretary who advises the Board on corporate  
governance matters. The Board and its Committees receive  
high-quality, up-to-date information for review in good time  
before each meeting. The Company Secretary ensures that Board  
procedures are followed and that the Company and the Board  
operate within applicable legislation. The Company Secretary is  
also responsible for facilitating Directors’ induction and assisting  
with identifying and enabling appropriate training and for  
Board performance evaluation.
The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter 
requiring approval of the Board.
B.6 Evaluation
In 2013 an external performance evaluation of the Board and its 
Committees was facilitated by IDDAS, which had no other connection 
with the Company. The evaluation considered the balance of skills of the 
Board, diversity, independence, knowledge of the Company and the 
Board’ s effectiveness. Details of that evaluation were provided in last year’ s 
Annual Report. The next externally facilitated performance evaluation  
of the Board and its Committees is likely to be conducted in 2016.
 www.hammerson.com 95 COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE CONTINUED
 The Chairman carries out a formal annual performance evaluation 
individually with each Non-Executive Director to review whether the 
Non-Executive Director continues to contribute effectively and 
demonstrates commitment to the role.
The Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent  
Director are responsible for the annual performance evaluation  
of the Chairman. The Chairman’s evaluation was carried out in early 
2015 and the Board was updated subsequently.
The Directors concluded that following the internal Board effectiveness 
evaluation in 2014 the Board and its Committees operate effectively 
and that each Director continues to contribute effectively and 
demonstrates commitment to the role. 
More details of the internal Board effectiveness  
evaluation are provided on page 67.
B.7 Election and re-election
All Directors are subject to election at the first AGM following their 
appointment. Pierre Bouchut will stand for election at the AGM in  
April 2015 and the Board recommends his election. It is planned that 
Anthony Watson will retire from the Board at the conclusion of the 
AGM in April 2015. With that exception, all the other Directors are 
submitting themselves for re-election at the 2015 AGM and are  
subject to annual re-election. 
Biographical details for all Directors are on pages  
98 and 99. Further discussion on the balance of skills  
and experience on the Board is provided on page 69.
C. Accountability
C.1 Financial and business reporting
The Board considers that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.
A statement of the Directors’ responsibilities regarding the financial 
statements is set out on page 102.
A statement on the status of the Company as a going  
concern is set out on page 54.
An explanation of the Group’s strategy and business model is 
available on pages 1 to 31. An assessment of the principal  
risks facing the Company are set out on pages 55 to 59 and  
performance metrics are set out on pages 36 to 39. 
C.2 Risk Management and internal control
The Board has established processes for monitoring sound  
risk management and internal control which allow it to review  
the effectiveness of the systems in place within the Group.
The Group’s risk management and internal control systems are 
designed to :
• Safeguard assets against unauthorised use or disposition;
• Ensure the maintenance of proper accounting records;
• Provide reliable information;
• Identify and, as far as possible, mitigate potential impediments  
to the Group achieving its objectives; and
• Ensure compliance with relevant legislation, rules and regulations.
It must be recognised that the Group’s internal controls provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement 
or loss.
Management has established a risk management framework and 
sufficient procedures necessary to enable the Directors to report on 
internal controls in compliance with the Code. These involve the 
analysis, evaluation and management of the key risks to the Group and 
include plans for the continuity of the Company’s business in the event 
of unforeseen interruption. Reports on key risks to the Group are made 
regularly to the Board via the Audit Committee. The Board allocates 
responsibility for the management of each key risk to the Executive 
Directors and senior executives within the Group. 
Further explanation of the Company’s approach  
to risk management is on pages 55 to 59 and 73 to 74.
C.3 Audit Committee and Auditors
The Audit Committee comprises five independent Non-Executive 
Directors. It has three scheduled meetings per year, organised around 
the Company’s reporting schedule. During 2014 the Audit Committee 
met three times. In 2015, and in future years, it is planned that there will 
be an additional scheduled meeting to review the year-end valuation 
of the Group’s property portfolio by the valuers, DTZ Debenham Tie 
Leung (DTZ).
Details of the composition of the Audit Committee  
are set out on pages 71.
The experience and background of members of the  
Audit Committee are on pages 69 and 98 to 99. 
The Audit Committee assists the Board to fulfil its responsibility in 
relation to: ensuring that management has systems and procedures in 
place to ensure the integrity of financial information; maintaining an 
appropriate relationship with the Group’s external auditor Deloitte LLP 
(Deloitte); reviewing the effectiveness, objectivity and independence 
of Deloitte including the scope of work and the fees paid to Deloitte; 
and reviewing the Company’s internal audit arrangements. Further 
details are provided in the terms of reference for the Audit Committee 
which are available at www.hammerson.com.
The Audit Committee Chairman regularly reports to the Board details 
of the work carried out by the Audit Committee in accordance with its 
terms of reference.
Jacques Espinasse, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, has been 
determined by the Board to have recent and relevant financial 
experience as required by the Code. It is planned that Jacques Espinasse 
will retire as Chairman of the Audit Committee and as a Non-Executive 
Director of the Board at the conclusion of the 2016 AGM. 
The Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial 
Officer and other members of the senior finance management team 
together with senior representatives of Deloitte are invited to attend all 
96 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
or part of meetings as appropriate. In order to fulfil its duties as defined 
in its terms of reference, the Audit Committee receives presentations 
and reviews reports from the Group’s senior management, consulting 
as necessary with Deloitte.
The Audit Committee meets with Deloitte and with Ernst & Young LLP , 
the internal auditor (which undertakes the majority of the Company’s 
internal audit reviews), in the absence of management at least once 
each year. 
DTZ and Deloitte have full access to each other and the Chairman  
of the Committee meets with DTZ and Deloitte as part of the half-year 
and year end valuations to ensure that they are each satisfied that 
there has been a full and open exchange of information and views.
The Audit Committee has regard to the recommendations of the 
Auditing Practices Board on effective communication between  
audit committees and external auditors and has concluded that  
the relationship with Deloitte meets these recommendations.
Details of how the Audit Committee has discharged its  
responsibilities during the year are provided in the Audit  
Committee Report on pages 71 to 74.
D. Remuneration
D.1 The level and components of remuneration
The principal responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are 
determining and agreeing with the Board the overall remuneration 
principles and framework for the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors, the Company Secretary and the other members of the Group 
Executive Committee. The terms of reference for the Committee are 
available at www.hammerson.com. The terms of reference are reviewed 
annually by the Board. The Chairman of the Committee reports on  
the Committee’s activities at the subsequent Board meeting.
Gwyn Burr joined the Remuneration Committee in February 2014  
and succeeded Anthony Watson as Chairman of the Committee  
after the 2014 AGM.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report can be found  
on pages 75 to 93.
D.2 Procedure
In determining policy on executive remuneration the Remuneration 
Committee takes into account all factors which it deems necessary 
including relevant legal and regulatory requirements, the provisions  
of the Code and associated guidance. Further details are provided in 
the terms of reference for the Remuneration Committee which are 
available at www.hammerson.com.
Details of the composition of the Remuneration Committee  
are on page 75.
Details of advisors who provided services to the  
Remuneration Committee during the year are on page 90.
During 2014 no individual was present when his or her own 
remuneration was being determined.
E. Relations with Shareholders
E.1 Dialogue with Shareholders
The Company actively engages with shareholders.
Throughout the year the Company has undertaken a wide variety  
of meetings, presentations and road shows.
The Board receives reports of meetings with institutional shareholders 
together with regular market reports and brokers’ reports which  
enable the Directors to understand the views of shareholders.  
The Board takes account of corporate governance guidelines of 
institutional shareholders and their representative bodies such as the 
Investment Association and the National Association of Pension Funds.
Hammerson’s website contains information of interest to both 
institutional and private shareholders.
Further details about relations with shareholders can be found in  
the Corporate Governance Report on page 65 and in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy on page 182.
E.2 Constructive use of General Meetings
At general meetings, the proxy appointment form provides 
shareholders with the option to direct their proxy vote for each 
resolution either for or against the resolution or to withhold their vote. 
The Company will ensure that the proxy appointment form and any 
announcement of the results of a vote will make it clear that a ‘vote 
withheld’  is not a vote in law and will not be counted in the calculation 
of the proportion of the votes for and against the resolution. All valid 
proxy appointment forms are properly recorded and counted. For each 
resolution, after the vote has been taken, information on the number of 
proxy votes for and against the resolution and the number of shares in 
respect of which the vote was withheld, is given at the general meeting 
and is made available on the Company’s website. Notice of general 
meetings is despatched to shareholders at least 14 days in advance.
Separate resolutions are proposed on each substantially separate issue.
In the event that, in the opinion of the Board, a significant proportion  
of the votes is cast against a resolution at any general meeting, the 
Company would explain the actions it intends to take to understand the 
reasons behind the vote result, when announcing the results of voting.
The AGM will be held on 22 April 2015 and is an opportunity for 
shareholders to attend and vote on the resolutions proposed.
The Notice of AGM is available at www.hammerson.com and is 
despatched to shareholders who have requested a hard copy of the 
documentation from the Company, together with explanatory notes, 
at least 20 working days before the AGM. Separate resolutions are 
proposed on each substantially separate issue, including a resolution 
to approve the Annual Report.
All Directors normally attend the AGM as well as the Company 
Secretary. The Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees are available to answer questions.
The Board welcomes questions from shareholders. They have  
an opportunity to raise issues formally at the AGM or informally  
with Directors before or after the meeting.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT 
Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the preparation 
of the financial statements 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements  
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required  
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by  
the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have 
elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company  
for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to: 
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
• Make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent; 
• State whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and  
explained in the financial statements; and 
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis  
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will  
continue in business. 
In preparing the Group financial statements, International  
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors: 
• Properly select and apply accounting policies; 
• Present information, including accounting policies, in a  
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
• Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the  
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events  
and conditions on the entity's financial position and financial 
performance; and 
• Make an assessment of the Company's ability to continue as a  
going concern. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time  
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure  
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act  
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of  
the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the  
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the  
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing  
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may  
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement  
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:  
• The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant 
financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and  
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; 
• The Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face; and 
• The Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are 
fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF HAMMERSON PLC
Opinion on the financial statements of  
Hammerson plc 
In our opinion: 
• The financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of  
the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2014 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; 
• the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally  
Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance  
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Cash Flow 
Statement, the Analysis of Movement in Net Debt and the related 
notes 1 to 29 for the consolidated financial statements and the  
related notes A to L for the parent company financial statements. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent 
company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice). 
Going concern 
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement contained on page 102 that the Group  
is a going concern. We confirm that: 
• we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern 
basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements  
is appropriate; and 
• we have not identified material uncertainties related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability  
to continue as a going concern. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be  
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s  
ability to continue as a going concern. 
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
There has been no significant change in the Group’s operations and our assessed risks of material misstatement described below, which are  
those that had the greatest effect on the audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team, 
are the same risks as in the prior year: 
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk 
Valuation of the property portfolio
 
• Hammerson plc (“Hammerson”) owns a portfolio of retail 
property assets valued at £6,706.5 million at 31 December  
2014 of which £4,427.3 million are held by subsidiaries and 
£2,279.2 million by joint ventures (Hammerson’s share excluding 
VIA Outlets). The valuation of the portfolio (including a number 
of development properties) is a significant judgement area and 
is underpinned by a number of assumptions. 
• The Group uses professionally qualified external valuers to fair 
value the Group’s portfolio at six-monthly intervals. The portfolio 
(excluding development properties) is valued by the investment 
method of valuation with development properties valued by 
the same methodology with a deduction for all costs necessary 
to complete the development together with an allowance for 
remaining risk (‘the residual method’). 
• Please see note 12 to the financial statements 
• We assessed management’s process for reviewing and challenging  
the work of the external valuer and development appraisals; 
• We met with the external valuers of the portfolio to discuss and challenge 
the valuation process, performance of the portfolio and significant 
assumptions and critical judgement areas, including future lease income 
and yields. We benchmarked these assumptions to relevant market 
evidence including specific property sales and other external data; 
• For development properties we assessed future costs to complete  
based on development appraisals. We also tested controls around the 
development cycle; 
• We assessed the competence, independence and integrity of the external 
valuer; and 
• We performed audit procedures to assess the integrity of information 
provided to the independent valuer including agreement on a sample  
basis back to actual leases.  
 
Investment property transactions  
• Hammerson undertook acquisitions and disposals  
during the year including acquiring a full controlling interest in 
Highcross, Leicester for £180 million, acquiring Saint Sébastien, 
Nancy for £109 million and disposing of its interests in 
Queensgate Shopping Centre, Peterborough for £99 million. 
• There is a risk that transactions may have complexity which 
includes deferred consideration arrangements, rental top-up 
payments or other contractual obligations which are not 
appropriately recorded within the financial statements. 
 
• We challenged management’s judgements by reviewing sale and  
purchase agreements and other related documents; 
• We assessed each transaction against the recognition, measurement and 
classification criteria of the Group’s accounting policies set out in note 1  
and applicable IFRSs; and 
• We tested the accuracy and completeness of the disclosures in the  
financial statements.

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk 
Accounting for the investment in Value Retail  
• Hammerson’s interest in Value Retail (carrying value 
of £629 million) is equity accounted as an associate.  
• The valuation of the Group’s investment in Value Retail  
is primarily driven by the valuation of the Value Retail property 
portfolio of £2,703 million of which Hammerson’s share is  
£885 million. This is subject to similar judgements to those of 
the Group’s own property portfolio above, including future 
rental income and yields.  
• Please see note 14 of the financial statements. 
• We planned the scope of the audit and instructed the auditor of Value  
Retail accordingly; 
• We met with the auditor, Value Retail management and the external  
valuer of the Value Retail property portfolio to discuss and challenge the 
valuation assumptions including future rental income and yields; and 
• We assessed the competence, independence and integrity of the  
external valuer. 
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee discussed on  
page 72 and the significant accounting policies disclosed in note 1.  
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to  
express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the  
risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters. 
Our application of materiality 
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed  
or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of  
our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work. 
We determined materiality for the Group to be £30 million  
(2013: £30 million), which is below 1% (2013: 1%) of shareholders’ 
equity. We determined materiality based on shareholders’ equity  
as net asset value is a key performance indicator as it takes into 
consideration the valuation of Hammerson’s property portfolio  
and the investment in Value Retail. 
In addition to net assets, we consider EPRA Adjusted Profit Before  
Tax as a critical performance measure for the Group and a measure 
used within the Real Estate industry. We applied a lower threshold of  
£7.8 million (2013: £6.5 million) which equates to 4.5% (2013: 4%) of 
that measure for testing all balances impacting that measure. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to  
the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.6 million  
(2013: £0.6 million), as well as differences below that threshold that,  
in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also  
report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified 
when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the 
Group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the group level. 
Based on that assessment, we focused our group audit scope primarily 
on the audit work at four significant components being the UK, France, 
Value Retail and VIA Outlets (VIA). VIA was included within scope for 
the first time in 2014 following the investment made in the year. These 
four (2013: three) components together comprise 99% (2013: 99%)  
of the Group’s net assets and 100% (2013: 100%) of profit before tax.  
The UK and French components were subject to a full scope audit, 
whilst Value Retail (accounted for as an associate) and VIA (accounted 
for as a joint venture) were subject to an audit of specified  
account balances, where the extent of our testing was based on 
our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the  
materiality of the Group’s operations at those components. 
Our audit work at the four locations was executed at levels of 
materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower  
than group materiality and ranged from £12.6 million to £16.5 million  
(2013: £12.6 million to £16.5 million). For those balances impacting 
EPRA Adjusted Profit Before Tax the materiality range was £3.2 million 
to £4.35 million (2013: £3.2 million to £4.35 million). 
The group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned 
visits that has been designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor or  
a senior member of the group audit team visits each of the locations 
where the group audit scope was focused at least once every two 
years. In years when we do not visit a significant component we will 
include the component audit team in our team briefing, discuss their 
risk assessment, and review documentation of the findings from  
their work. 
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process  
and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion  
that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the 
aggregated financial information of the remaining components  
not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances. We  
have obtained an understanding of the Group’s system of internal  
controls and undertaken a combination of procedures, all of which  
are designed to target the Group’s identified risks of material  
misstatement in the most effective manner possible.

www.hammerson.com 105  
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and 
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements  
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report  
by exception 
Adequacy of explanations received and  
accounting records 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion: 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been  
received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement  
with the accounting records and returns. 
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. 
Directors’ remuneration 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our 
opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have not been 
made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have 
nothing to report arising from these matters. 
Corporate Governance Statement 
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of  
the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with ten provisions of the UK Corporate Governance  
Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review. 
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report 
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we  
are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the 
Annual Report is: 
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or 
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or 
• otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified 
any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit 
and the Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report is 
fair, balanced and understandable and whether the Annual Report 
appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the 
Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed.  
We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies  
or misleading statements. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement,  
the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require  
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards  
for Auditors. We also comply with International Standard on Quality 
Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to 
ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood 
and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated 
professional standards review team and independent partner reviews. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body,  
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to  
the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness  
of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read  
all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by 
us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 
1:  Significant accounting policies 
Statement of compliance 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS and interpretations adopted by the European 
Union. During 2014, the following new and revised Standards and 
Interpretations have been adopted and have affected the amounts 
reported in these financial statements: 
• IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 
• IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 
• IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 
• Amendments to IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements 
• Amendments to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and  
Joint Ventures  
• Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation 
• Amendments to IAS 36 Impairment of Assets arising from 
Recoverable Amount Disclosures for non-financial assets 
• Amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition  
and Measurement.  
At the date of approval of these financial statements the following 
Standards and Interpretations relevant to the Group were in issue  
but not yet effective and in some cases had not been adopted for  
use in the European Union: 
Issued, not yet effective and not yet endorsed for use in the 
European Union 
• Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiatives; effective for  
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments; effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 July 2015 
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers; effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017. 
Issued and endorsed for use in the European Union but not  
yet effective  
• Defined benefit plans: Employee Contributions (Amendments  
to IAS 19 Employee Benefits); effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 July 2014.  
These pronouncements, when applied, will either result in changes  
in presentation and disclosure, or are not expected to have a  
material impact on the financial statements.  
In the 2014 financial statements, the Group has adopted IFRS 11 Joint 
Arrangements which is effective for accounting periods beginning  
on or after 1 January 2014. Under IFRS 11, joint arrangements are 
classified as either joint operations or joint ventures, depending on  
the Company’s rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities  
of the arrangements. The new standard requires joint ventures to be 
accounted for under the equity method and joint operations to be 
reported on a proportionally consolidated basis recognising the 
Company’s share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.  
The classification of the Group’s joint arrangements has been 
evaluated and it has been concluded that the joint arrangements  
fall within the definition of joint ventures. As a result the Group’s 
interests, which were previously proportionally consolidated have 
been presented on an equity accounted basis. The consolidated 
income statement reflects the Group’s share of its joint ventures’  
post-tax profit as ‘Share of results of joint ventures’ and the 
consolidated balance sheet reflects the Group’s share of its joint 
ventures’ net assets as ‘Investment in joint ventures’. The Group’s  
profit for the year and equity shareholders’ funds are unaffected by  
the change, but other income statement and balance sheet items in 
the consolidated financial statements, such as net rental income and 
investment and development properties have decreased reflecting  
the reclassification from those line items of the amounts relating to 
joint ventures.  
The comparative figures have been restated to reflect the change  
in accounting policy. The impact of these changes on the income 
statement has been reflected in notes 2 and 3. The impact on the 
balance sheet and net debt are shown in note 25. The share of results 
from joint ventures is separately disclosed in note 13. Previously 
reported cash flows have been reclassified within the cash flow 
statement, and the cumulative gains on owner-occupied property  
of £21.2 million, which was held in a joint venture, have been 
reclassified from the ‘Revaluation reserve’ to ‘Retained earnings’  
within the statement of changes in equity.  
IFRS 9 will impact the measurement and classification of the  
Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities. The Group has not  
yet completed its evaluation of the effect of adoption.  
Basis of preparation 
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis,  
as explained in the Financial Review on page 54. 
The financial statements are presented in sterling. They are prepared 
on the historical cost basis, except that investment and development 
properties, other investments and derivative financial instruments are 
stated at fair value. 
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to the  
results, other gains and losses, assets, liabilities and cash flows of 
entities included in the consolidated financial statements. Revisions  
to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the 
estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period. If the revision 
affects both current and future periods, the change is recognised  
over those periods. 
As part of the Group’s strategy to focus on the retail sector, the Group 
completed the disposal of the majority of its office portfolio between 
July 2012 and June 2013. Consequently, the relevant assets and 
liabilities were classified as held for sale. The income and expenditure 
of these properties are classified as discontinued operations in the 
comparative period to reflect the discontinuation of the Group’s  
office property activities, which was considered to be a major line  
of business. Details of discontinued operations in 2013 are set out  
in note 9.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 
114 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 
1:  Significant accounting policies (continued) 
Significant judgements and key estimates 
The preparation of the financial statements requires management  
to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that may affect  
the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts  
of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. 
Property valuations 
The property portfolio, which is carried in the balance sheet at fair 
value, is valued six-monthly by professionally qualified external valuers 
and the Directors must ensure that they are satisfied that the valuation 
of the Group’s properties is appropriate for the accounts. Investment 
properties, excluding properties held for development, are valued  
by adopting the ‘investment method’ of valuation. This approach 
involves applying market-derived capitalisation yields to current and 
market-derived future income streams with appropriate adjustments 
for income voids arising from vacancies or rent-free periods. These 
capitalisation yields and future income streams are derived from 
comparable property and leasing transactions and are considered  
to be the key inputs in the valuation. Other factors that are taken into 
account in the valuations include the tenure of the property, tenancy 
details and ground and structural conditions. 
In the case of ongoing developments, the approach applied is the 
‘residual method’ of valuation, which is the investment method of 
valuation as described above with a deduction for all costs necessary 
to complete the development, together with a further allowance for 
remaining risk. Properties held for future development are generally 
valued by adopting the higher of the residual method of valuation 
allowing for all associated risks, or the investment method of  
valuation for the existing asset.  
Accounting for acquisitions 
Management must assess whether the acquisition of property  
through the purchase of a corporate vehicle should be accounted for 
as an asset purchase or a business combination. Where the acquired 
corporate vehicle contains significant assets or liabilities in addition to 
property, the transaction is accounted for as a business combination. 
Where there are no such items, the transaction is treated as an  
asset purchase.  
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition 
method. Any excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value 
of the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill, and reviewed 
annually for impairment. Any discount received or acquisition related 
costs are recognised in the income statement. 
Accounting for joint ventures and associates 
The accounting treatment for joint ventures and associates requires  
an assessment to determine the degree of control or influence that  
the Group may exercise over them and the form of any control. 
Hammerson’s interest in its joint ventures is commonly driven by  
the terms of partnership agreements, which ensure that control is 
shared between the partners.  
Associates are those entities over which the Group is in a position  
to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control. 
 
REIT and SIIC status 
The Company has elected for UK REIT and French SIIC status. To 
continue to benefit from these tax regimes, the Group is required to 
comply with certain conditions as outlined in notes 8E and 8F to the 
accounts. Management intends that the Group should continue as  
a UK REIT and French SIIC for the foreseeable future. 
Basis of consolidation 
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group. Control is 
assumed when the Group has the power to govern the financial  
and operating policies of an entity, or business, to benefit from its 
activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in  
the consolidated financial statements from the date that control 
commences until the date that control ceases. All intragroup 
transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated  
on consolidation. 
Joint ventures and associates 
The results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures and associates are 
accounted for using the equity method. Investments in joint ventures 
and associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted  
for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of 
the joint venture or associate, less any impairment. Losses of a joint 
venture or associate in excess of the Group’s interest in that entity are 
recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or 
constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the entity.  
The Group eliminates upstream and downstream transactions with  
its joint ventures, including interest, management fees and partner 
loan balances. 
Foreign currency 
Foreign currency transactions 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at 
exchange rates approximating to the exchange rate ruling at the  
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated  
in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling 
at the exchange rate ruling at that date and, unless they relate to the 
hedging of the net investment in foreign operations, differences 
arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. 
Financial statements of foreign operations 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill  
and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated  
into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet  
date. The operating income and expenses of foreign operations  
are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the  
year. Significant transactions, such as property sales, are translated  
at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of each transaction.  
The principal exchange rate used to translate foreign currency-
denominated amounts in the balance sheet is the rate at the  
end of the year, £1 = €1.289 (2013: £1 = €1.202). The principal 
exchange rate used for the income statement is the average rate,  
£1 = €1.241 (2013: £1 = €1.178). 
Net investment in foreign operations 
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net  
investment in foreign operations are taken to the translation reserve. 
They are released to the income statement upon disposal of the 
foreign operation. 
114 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014  
www.hammerson.com 115  
Borrowings, interest and derivatives 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, after taking account of 
any discount on issue and attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, 
borrowings are held at amortised cost, such that discounts and costs 
are charged to the income statement over the term of the borrowing 
at a constant return on the carrying amount of the liability. 
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to economically  
hedge its exposure to foreign currency movements and interest rate 
risks. Hedge accounting is applied in respect of net investments in 
foreign operations and of debt raised in non-functional currencies. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value, 
which equates to cost and subsequently remeasured at fair value,  
with changes in fair value being included in the income statement, 
except that a gain or loss on the portion of an instrument that is an 
effective hedge is recognised in the hedging reserve. 
Trade receivables and payables 
Trade receivables and payables are initially measured at fair value, 
subsequently measured at amortised cost and, where the effect is 
material, discounted to reflect the time value of money. 
Net finance costs 
Net finance costs include interest payable on borrowings, net of 
interest capitalised, interest receivable on funds invested, and  
changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments. 
Capitalisation of interest 
Interest is capitalised if it is directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of development properties or the 
redevelopment of investment properties. Capitalisation commences 
when the activities to develop the property start and continues until 
the property is substantially ready for its intended use. Capitalised 
interest is calculated with reference to the actual rate payable 
 on borrowings for development purposes or, for that part of the 
development cost financed out of general funds, at the average rate. 
Property portfolio 
Investment properties 
Investment properties are stated at fair value, being market value 
determined by professionally qualified external valuers, and changes  
in fair value are included in the income statement. Further details  
are given in note 12. 
Development properties 
Properties acquired with the intention of redevelopment are classified 
as development properties and stated at fair value, being market  
value determined by professionally qualified external valuers. Changes 
in fair value are included in the income statement. All costs directly 
associated with the purchase and construction of a development 
property are capitalised. When development properties are 
completed, they are reclassified as investment properties. 
Leasehold properties 
Leasehold properties that are leased out to tenants under operating 
leases are classified as investment properties or development 
properties, as appropriate, and included in the balance sheet at fair 
value. The obligation to the freeholder or superior leaseholder for the 
buildings element of the leasehold is included in the balance sheet  
at the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception. 
Payments to the freeholder or superior leaseholder are apportioned 
between a finance charge and a reduction of the outstanding liability. 
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term  
so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability. Contingent rents payable, such as rent reviews 
or those related to rental income, are charged as an expense in  
the periods in which they are incurred. An asset equivalent to the 
leasehold obligation is recorded in the balance sheet within ‘interests 
in leasehold properties’, and is amortised over the lease term. 
Tenant leases 
Management has exercised judgement in considering the potential 
transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership, in accordance with  
IAS 17 Leases, for properties leased to tenants and has determined  
that such leases are operating leases. 
Depreciation 
In accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property, no depreciation  
is provided in respect of investment and development properties, 
which are carried at fair value.  
Net rental income 
Rental income from investment property leased out under an 
operating lease is recognised in the income statement on a straight-
line basis over the lease term. Contingent rents, such as turnover 
rents, rent reviews and indexation, are recorded as income in the 
periods in which they are earned. Rent reviews are recognised when 
such reviews have been agreed with tenants. Lease incentives and 
costs associated with entering into tenant leases are amortised over 
the period to the first break option or, if the probability that the  
break option will be exercised is considered low, over the lease  
term. Property operating expenses are expensed as incurred and  
any property operating expenditure not recovered from tenants 
through service charges is charged to the income statement. 
Gains or losses on sale of properties 
Gains on sale of properties are taken into account on the completion 
of contract, and are calculated by reference to the carrying value at the 
end of the previous year, adjusted for subsequent capital expenditure.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 
116 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 
1:  Significant accounting policies (continued) 
Plant and equipment  
Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the estimated useful life, which is generally between three and five 
years, or in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term. 
Employee benefits 
Defined contribution pension plans 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans  
are charged to the income statement as incurred. 
Defined benefit pension plans 
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans 
comprises the amount of future benefit that employees have earned, 
discounted to determine a present value, less the fair value of the 
pension plan assets. The calculation is performed by a qualified 
external actuary using the projected unit credit method. Actuarial 
gains and losses are recognised in equity. Where the assets of a plan 
are greater than its obligation, the asset included in the balance sheet 
is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or 
reduction in future contributions to the plan. 
Share-based employee remuneration 
Share-based employee remuneration is determined with reference to 
the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are 
granted and charged to the income statement over the vesting period 
on a straight-line basis. The fair value of share options is calculated 
using the binomial option pricing model and is dependent on factors 
including the exercise price, expected volatility, option life and risk-free 
interest rate. The fair value of the market-based element of the Long-
Term Incentive Plans is calculated using the Monte Carlo Model and is 
dependent on factors including the expected volatility, vesting period 
and risk-free interest rate.  
Management fees 
Management fees are recognised in the period to which they relate. 
Performance fee related elements are recognised at the end of the 
performance period when the fee can be reliably estimated and is  
due for payment. Management fees between the Group and its joint 
ventures are eliminated on consolidation.  
Tax 
Tax is included in the income statement except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the related 
tax is recognised in equity.  
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the 
year, using tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date, together  
with any adjustment in respect of previous years.  
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, 
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts 
used for tax purposes. The following temporary differences are not 
provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes; the initial 
recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor 
taxable profit and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries  
to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected 
manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities, using tax rates that are expected to apply in the period 
when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.  
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset  
can be utilised.

2:  Profit for the year 
As a result of the change in accounting policy resulting from the adoption of IFRS 11 referred to in note 1 on page 113, the Reported Group results,  
as presented in column A in the following tables, have been amended to show the share of results from joint ventures on a separate line. To show the 
impact of this change on the current and previously reported figures, the total share of results from Property joint ventures has been shown separately 
in column B, and reallocated to the relevant financial statement lines. The Group’s share of results arising from its interest in premium outlets have not 
been reallocated as management does not review these interests on a proportionally consolidated basis (see note 3). The Group’s share of results in 
column C, aggregates these elements on a proportionally consolidated basis, which is then allocated between ‘Adjusted’ and ‘Capital and other’ for the 
purposes of calculating figures in accordance with EPRA best practice.

3:  Segmental analysis 
The factors used to determine the Group’s reportable segments are the geographic locations, UK and France, and sectors in which it operates, 
which are generally managed by separate teams and are the basis on which performance is assessed and resources allocated. Gross rental  
income represents the Group’s revenue from its ‘customers’, or tenants. Net rental income is the principal profit measure used to determine the 
performance of each sector. Total assets are not monitored by segment and resource allocation is based on the distribution of property assets 
between segments. 
As stated in the Financial Review on page 51, management reviews the business principally on a proportionally consolidated basis, except for its 
interests in premium outlets held through its investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets, where the Group has less day-to-day involvement in the 
financial performance and which have different operational characteristics compared with the Group’s property portfolio. The segmental analysis 
has been prepared on the basis that management uses to review the business, rather than on a statutory basis. For reconciliation purposes the 
Reported Group figures are shown in the following tables.

In addition to the figures above, redundancy related costs of £1.7 million (2013: £0.6 million) were incurred during the year. 
Staff throughout the Company, including Executive Directors, participate in a performance-related bonus scheme, part payable in cash and  
part payable in shares. The Company also operates a number of share plans under which employees, including Executive Directors, are eligible  
to participate. Further details of share-based payment arrangements, some of which have performance conditions, are provided in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 75 to 93. In addition, the Company operates the following share plans in which Directors do not participate: 
Restricted Share Plan 
Certain UK employees receive awards under a Restricted Share Plan, which provides an opportunity for these employees to build up a 
shareholding in the Company. Under the Restricted Share Plan, share awards vest, subject to continued employment, on the third anniversary  
of grant. 
French Share Plan 
For French employees, who are not able to participate in the Share Incentive Plan referred to on page 174 or the Restricted Share Plan referred  
to above, there is a share plan under which conditional awards of shares are made. The number of shares that will vest after a two-year period is 
dependent on a combination of the performance of the Company’s investment portfolio in France and the Group’s performance.

of the Directors is set out in aggregate in note 29B. Full details of the Directors’ emoluments, as required by the Companies Act 2006, are disclosed 
in the audited sections of the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 75 to 93.  
The Company did not grant any credits, advances or guarantees of any kind to its Directors during the year. 
6:  Pensions 
Defined contribution pension scheme 
The Company operates the UK funded approved Group Personal Pension Plan which is a defined contribution pension scheme. The Group’s cost 
for the year was £3.0 million (2013: £2.0 million). 
Defined benefit pension schemes 
Hammerson Group Management Limited Pension & Life Assurance Scheme (the ‘Scheme’). 
The Scheme is funded and the funds, which are administered by trustees, are independent of the Group’s finances. The Scheme, was closed to 
new entrants on 31 December 2002, and was closed to future accrual for all participating employees on 30 June 2014, which led to a curtailment 
gain of £2.5 million. 
Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Scheme 
The unfunded scheme provides pension benefits to two former Executive Directors; one in the UK and one in France. The amount of pension is 
linked to final salary at retirement. The accrued benefits in respect of the former Executive Directors remain within the scheme and are now paid 
directly by the Group. 
US Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Scheme 
The US unfunded pension commitment relates to obligations to four former employees and their spouses.

D:  Unrecognised deferred tax 
At 31 December 2014, the Group had unrecognised deferred tax assets calculated at a tax rate of 20% (2013: 20%) of £64 million  
(2013: £68 million) for surplus UK revenue tax losses carried forward and £90 million (2013: £90 million) for UK capital losses.  
Deferred tax is not provided on potential gains on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures when the Group can control whether gains 
crystallise and it is probable that gains will not arise in the foreseeable future. At 31 December 2014 the total of such gains was £250 million  
(2013: £235 million) and the potential tax effect before the offset of losses was £50 million (2013: £47 million). If a UK REIT sells a property within 
three years of completion of development, the REIT exemption will not apply. There were no such properties at 31 December 2013 or 2014. 
E:  UK REIT status 
The Group elected to be treated as a UK REIT with effect from 1 January 2007. The UK REIT rules exempt the profits of the Group’s UK property 
rental business from corporation tax. Gains on UK properties are also exempt from tax, provided they are not held for trading or sold in the three 
years after completion of development. The Group is otherwise subject to UK corporation tax. 
As a REIT, Hammerson plc is required to pay Property Income Distributions equal to at least 90% of the Group’s exempted net income. To remain  
a UK REIT there are a number of conditions to be met in respect of the principal company of the Group, the Group’s qualifying activity and its 
balance of business. The Group continues to meet these conditions.

F:  French SIIC status 
Hammerson plc has been a French SIIC since 1 January 2004 and all the major French properties are covered by the SIIC tax-exempt regime. 
Income and gains are exempted from French tax but the French subsidiaries are required to distribute a proportion of their profits to Hammerson 
plc, which then designates UK dividends paid to its shareholders as SIIC distributions. Dividend obligations will arise principally after property 
disposals but for the Hammerson Group there will be a period of around four years after a disposal for dividends to be paid to shareholders. 
Outstanding SIIC dividend obligations arising on disposals and earnings prior to 31 December 2014 amount to £26 million (2013: £30 million)  
and are expected to be settled within dividends paid by Hammerson plc over the following four years. A further £400 million (2013: £300 million) 
of dividends would be payable if the properties were realised at their 31 December 2014 values. Since 1 July 2009, qualifying foreign dividends 
have been exempt from UK tax and therefore no deferred tax provision is recognised. To remain a SIIC, at least 80% of assets must be employed  
in property investment and, with limited temporary exceptions, no shareholder may hold 60% or more of the shares. The Group continues to  
meet these conditions. 
9:  Discontinued operations 
As part of the Group’s strategy to focus on the retail sector, a number of office properties, and related entities, were disposed of between July  
2012 and June 2013. The income and expenditure was classified as discontinued operations in 2012 and 2013, and the summarised income 
statement for 2013 allocated between ‘Adjusted’ and ‘Capital and other’ for the purposes of calculating figures in accordance with EPRA best 
practice is shown below.

10:  Dividends  
The proposed final dividend of 11.6 pence per share was recommended by the Board on 13 February 2015 and, subject to approval by 
shareholders, is payable on 24 April 2015 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 13 March 2015. 2.0 pence per share will  
be paid as a PID, net of withholding tax at the basic rate (currently 20%) if applicable, and the remainder of 9.6 pence per share will be paid as  
a normal dividend. There will be no scrip alternative. The aggregate amount of the 2014 final dividend is £91.0 million. This has been calculated 
using the total number of eligible shares outstanding at 31 December 2014.  
The interim dividend of 8.8 pence per share was paid on 2 October 2014, as a PID, net of withholding tax where appropriate. 
The total dividend for the year ended 31 December 2014 would be 20.4 pence per share (2013: 19.1 pence per share).

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 
130 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 
12: Investment and development properties (continued) 
Properties are stated at fair value as at 31 December 2014, valued by professionally qualified external valuers, DTZ Debenham Tie Leung, Chartered 
Surveyors. The valuations have been prepared in accordance with the RICS Valuation – Professional Standards 2014 based on certain assumptions 
as set out in note 1. 
In the case of leasehold properties, valuations are net of any obligation to freeholders or superior leaseholders. To comply with IAS 40 and IAS  
17 these obligations and the related leasehold assets are included in the balance sheet within ‘Obligations under finance leases’ (note 21) and 
‘Interests in leasehold properties’ respectively. Further information is provided in ‘Significant accounting policies’ on page 115. 
Valuation fees are based on a fixed amount agreed between the Group and the valuers and are independent of the portfolio value. Summaries  
of the valuers’ reports are available on the Company’s website: www.hammerson.com. 
As noted in ‘Significant judgements and key estimates’ on page 114, real estate valuations are complex, derived from data which is not widely 
publicly available and involve a degree of judgement. For these reasons, and consistent with EPRA’s guidance, we have classified the valuations  
of our property portfolio as Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13. Inputs to the valuations, some of which are ‘unobservable’ as defined by IFRS 13, include 
nominal equivalent yield and rental income. These inputs to the valuations are analysed by segment in the valuation and rental data tables on 
pages 158 and 162. All other factors remaining constant, an increase in rental income would increase valuations, whilst increases in nominal 
equivalent yield and discount rate would result in a fall in values and vice versa. However, there are interrelationships between unobservable 
inputs as they are determined by market conditions. The existence of an increase of more than one unobservable input would augment the 
impact on valuation. The impact on the valuation would be mitigated by the interrelationship between unobservable inputs moving in opposite 
directions. For example, an increase in rents may be offset by an increase in yield, resulting in no net impact on the valuation. 
The total amount of interest included in development properties at 31 December 2014 was £2.4 million (2013: £24.6 million). Capitalised interest  
is calculated using the cost of secured debt or the Group’s average cost of borrowings, as appropriate, and the effective rate applied in 2014 was 
4.7% (2013: 4.8%). At 31 December 2014 the historic cost of investment and development properties was £3,930.1 million (2013: £3,124.7 million).

In July 2014 the Group acquired a 47% interest in VIA Outlets. 
In September 2014, the Group acquired an additional 40% stake in The Highcross Limited Partnership, and an additional 50% stake in SCI Espace 
Plus, a Company which owned SQY Ouest, increasing Hammerson’s interest in both partnerships to 100%. The revaluation gains during the year 
up to the date the Group acquired the additional stakes in these entities totalled £5.0 million, which has been treated as a property revaluation 
gain within other net gains/(losses) shown in the summarised income statement on page 132. 
The Group sold its 50% interests in Queensgate Limited Partnership and The Grosvenor Street Limited Partnership in January 2014 and September 
2014 respectively. 
1.  The names of the principal property operated by each partnership have been used in the summary income statements and balance sheets on pages 132 to 135. The results for Highcross 
and Queensgate for the period until disposal have been classified as ‘Other’ in 2014.

1. Includes the results of Brent South Shopping Park in which Hammerson has a 40.6% interest. 
2. Reflects the Group’s acquisition in May 2013 of an additional 16.7% stake in The Bull Ring Limited Partnership, increasing Hammerson’s interest to 50%. 
3. The joint ventures are generally funded by loans from the Company and the relevant partners and this funding has been excluded as it is proportionally eliminated upon consolidation. 
‘Other net gains/(losses)’ principally represent valuation changes on investment properties.

The analysis above reflects the effect of currency and interest rate swaps in place at 31 December 2013 and 2014, further details of which are  
set out in note 20. The interest rates shown are the weighted average for fixed rate borrowings. Variable rate borrowings bear interest based  
on LIBOR, with the exception of certain euro borrowings whose interest costs are linked to EURIBOR. 
20:  Financial instruments and risk management 
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the Group’s business. Derivative financial instruments are  
used to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but are not employed for speculative purposes.  
Further discussion of these issues is set out in Principal Risks and Uncertainties on page 55. The Group’s risk management policies and practices 
with regard to financial instruments are as follows: 
A:  Debt management 
The Group generally borrows on an unsecured basis on the strength of its covenant in order to maintain operational flexibility. Borrowings are 
arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short-term liquidity. Acquisitions may be financed initially using short-term 
funds before being refinanced for the longer term when market conditions are appropriate. Short-term funding is raised principally through 
syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions with whom Hammerson maintains strong working 
relationships. Long-term debt mainly comprises the Group’s fixed rate unsecured bonds. 
B: Interest rate management 
Interest rate swaps are used to alter the interest rate basis of the Group’s debt, allowing changes from fixed to variable rates or vice versa.  
Clear guidelines exist for the Group’s ratio of fixed to variable rate debt and management regularly reviews the interest rate profile against these 
guidelines. 
At 31 December 2014, the Group had interest rate swaps of £250.0 million (2013: £250.0 million), maturing in 2020 under which the Group  
pays interest at a rate linked to LIBOR and receives interest at 6.875%. At 31 December 2014, the fair value of interest rate swaps was an asset of  
£15.0 million (2013: £2.0 million asset). The Group does not hedge account for its interest rate swaps and states them at fair value with changes  
in fair value included in the income statement. 
C: Foreign currency management 
The impact of foreign exchange movements is managed by financing the cost of acquiring euro denominated assets with euro borrowings.  
The Group borrows in euros and uses currency swaps to match foreign currency assets with foreign currency liabilities. The Group also hedges  
the impact of foreign exchange movements in debt raised in foreign currencies through the use of derivatives to swap the cash flows back to 
either sterling or euros. 
To manage the foreign currency exposure on its net investments in subsidiaries in Continental Europe, the Group has designated all euro 
borrowings, including euro-denominated bonds and currency swaps, as net investment hedges. The carrying amount of the bonds at  
31 December 2014 was £775.8 million (2013: £811.3 million) and their fair value was £829.8 million (2013: £845.7 million). Included in the  
senior notes (USPP) due in June 2021, 2024 and 2026 is a euro-denominated borrowings element of €60.0 million which had a carrying  
amount of £46.5 million.

20:  Financial instruments and risk management (continued) 
At 31 December 2014, the Group had currency swaps of £987.3 million, being €121.0 million sold forward against sterling for value in January  
2015 at a rate of £1 = €1.273, €412.0 million sold forward against sterling for value in March 2015 at a rate of £1 = €1.272, €379.6 million of cross 
currency swaps to swap the £300.0 million, 5.25% sterling bond maturing in 2016 into euro at a rate of £1 = €1.265 and a coupon of 4.76%,  
and cross currency swaps to swap US$291 million of Senior notes (USPP) maturing in June 2021 and 2024, into euro at a rate of €1 = US$1.3415.  
At 31 December 2013, the Group had currency swaps of £735.9 million, being €302.5 million sold forward against sterling for value in February 
2014, at a rate of £1 = €1.184 and the €379.6 million and US$291 million of cross currency swaps as described above. The fair value of currency 
swaps is shown in note 20I. 
The exchange differences on hedging instruments and on net investments in foreign subsidiaries are recognised in equity. 
D:  Profit and loss account and balance sheet management 
The Group maintains internal guidelines for interest cover, gearing and other ratios. Management monitors the Group’s current and projected 
financial position against these guidelines. Further details of these ratios are provided in the Financial Review on pages 51 to 54. 
E:  Cash management and liquidity 
Cash levels are monitored to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet the Group’s operational requirements. Short-term money market 
deposits are used to manage liquidity while maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to risk. Longer-term  
liquidity requirements are met with an appropriate mix of short and longer-term debt as explained in note 20A.  
F:  Credit risk 
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank and cash balances, short-term deposits, trade and other receivables and investments.  
The Group’s credit risk is attributable to its trade and other receivables, cash and short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments. 
Trade receivables consist principally of rents due from tenants. The balance is low relative to the scale of the balance sheet and the Group’s  
tenant base is diversified geographically, with tenants generally of good financial standing. The majority of tenant leases are long-term contracts 
with rents payable quarterly in advance and the average unexpired lease term at 31 December 2014 was 8.1 years (2013: 8.0 years). Rent deposits 
and personal or corporate guarantees are held in respect of some leases. Taking these factors into account, the risk to the Group of individual 
tenant default and the credit risk of trade receivables are considered low. The Group’s most significant tenants are set out in the Portfolio  
Analysis on page 161. 
Loans receivable and other receivables include available for sale investments and VAT receivables. These items do not give rise to significant credit 
risk. The receivables in notes 15 and 16 are presented net of allowances for doubtful receivables and allowances for impairment are made where 
appropriate. An analysis of trade receivables and the related provisions is shown in note 16. 
The credit risk on short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks, who are committed 
lenders to the Group, with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. At 31 December 2014, the Group’s maximum 
exposure to credit risk was £205.7 million (2013: £165.6 million).

H:  Sensitivity analysis 
In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Group’s earnings. Over the 
longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings. The tables  
below provide indicative sensitivity data.

(Decrease)/Increase (£m) (17.2) 17.9 (18.4) 19.1
There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity. The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate 
change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest rate swaps, at the year end.

These effects would be more than offset by the effect of exchange rate changes on the euro denominated net assets included in the Group’s 
financial statements. 
In relation to financial instruments alone, there would have been no impact on the Group’s profit before tax. This has been calculated by 
retranslating the year end euro denominated financial instruments at the year end foreign exchange rate changed by 10%. Forward foreign 
exchange contracts have been included in this estimate.

At 31 December 2014, the fair value of financial instruments, including the Group’s share of Property joint ventures, exceeded their book value  
by £306.3 million (2013: £210.9 million), equivalent to 39 pence per share (2013: 29 pence per share) on an EPRA net asset value per share basis. 
The fair values of the Group’s borrowings have been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices, representing Level 1 and Level 2 fair  
value measurements as defined by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures. The fair values of the Group’s outstanding interest rate swaps have 
been estimated by calculating the present value of future cash flows, using appropriate market discount rates, representing Level 2 fair value 
measurements as defined by IFRS 7. The fair value of the Group’s currency swaps has been estimated on the basis of the prevailing forward  
rates at the year end, representing Level 2 fair value measurements as defined by IFRS 7. 
Details of the Group’s cash and short-term deposits are set out in note 17. Their fair values and those of other financial assets and liabilities equate 
to their book values. Details of the Group’s receivables are set out in notes 15 and 16. The amounts are presented net of allowances for doubtful

The Trustees of the Hammerson Employee Share Ownership Plan acquire the Company’s own shares to award to participants in accordance  
with the terms of the Plan. The expense related to share-based employee remuneration is calculated in accordance with IFRS 2 and the terms  
of the Plan and is recognised in the income statement within administration expenses. The corresponding credit is included in other reserves. 
When the Company’s shares are awarded to employees as part of their remuneration, the cost of the shares is transferred to other reserves.  
Should this not equal the credit previously recorded against other reserves, the balance is adjusted against retained earnings. 
The number of shares held as at 31 December 2014 was 1,163,523 (2013: 984,463) following awards to participants during the year of 720,940 
shares (2013: 1,353,344), and the purchase of 900,000 shares (2013: 1,000,000).

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS
Our portfolio provides a secure income stream, with a weighted average unexpired lease term of  
eight years, and opportunities for growth. The portfolio was 3.6% reversionary at 31 December 2014, 
with reversion at the UK and French portfolios of 1.2% and 10.0% respectively. Assuming that leases  
are renewed or re-let and rent reviews are agreed at current ERVs an estimated £17.0 million of 
additional annual income could be secured from the portfolio by the end of 2017.
As explained in the Financial Review on page 51, management reviews the performance of the business including the Group’s share of joint 
ventures on a proportionally consolidated basis, but excludes the Group’s interest in premium outlets through investments in Value Retail and  
VIA Outlets. This is because the Group has less day-to-day involvement and the outlets centre sector has different operational characteristics 
compared with the Group’s property portfolio. The information in the following tables has been prepared on this basis.

2013 figures are for continuing operations only
Staff costs amounting to £1.5 million (2013: £1.5 million) have been capitalised as development costs and are excluded from the table above.  
Our business model for developments is to use a combination of in-house staff and external advisers. The cost of external advisers is capitalised  
to the cost of developments. The cost of staff working on developments is generally expensed, but may be capitalised subject to meeting certain 
criteria related to the degree of time spent on and the stage of progress of specific projects.
Including the net one-off restructuring charge of £3.0 million shown above as operating costs increases the cost ratio to 24.3%. Further details  
on the restructuring charge are in the Financial Review on page 52.

Notes
1. Annual cash rents receivable, net of head and equity rents and the cost of vacancy, as a percentage of gross property value, as provided by the Group’s external valuers.  
Rents receivable following the expiry of rent-free periods are not included. Rent reviews are assumed to have been settled at the contractual review date at ERV.
2. The capitalisation rate applied to future cash flows to calculate the gross property value. The cash flows reflect the timing of future rents resulting from lettings, lease  
renewals and rent reviews based on current ERVs and assuming rents are received quarterly in advance. The property true equivalent yields are determined by the Group’s 
external valuers.
3. Nominal equivalent yields, which are similar to the true equivalent yields but assume rents are received annually in arrears, are included within the unobservable inputs to  
the portfolio valuations as defined by IFRS 13.
4. Represents the returns for the Group’s share of premium outlets through its interests in Value Retail and VIA Outlets.
5. The weighted average remaining rent-free period is 0.5 years.

APPROACH TO REMUNERATION POLICY
The overall objective of the Remuneration Committee (Committee) 
is to determine an appropriate remuneration policy for 
recommendation to the Board that ensures that the Company can 
continue to attract, retain and motivate quality leaders who are 
capable of making a major contribution to the Company’s success 
whilst avoiding paying more than the Committee considers necessary. 
In implementing the Policy, the Committee takes into account various 
factors, including remuneration packages available within other 
comparable companies, the Company’s overall performance, internal 
relativities, achievement of corporate objectives, individual 
performance and experience, published views of institutional investors 
and general market trends/performance. 
Generally, two-thirds of the Executive Directors’ total target 
remuneration (excluding pension and benefits) is performance 
related, through an annual performance-related bonus plan 
(Annual Incentive Plan or AIP) and a long term incentive plan 
(Long Term Incentive Plan or LTIP), and this is considered 
to be appropriate.
The Committee has received clear advice that formal limits are 
required in the Policy and has retained sufficient flexibility to  
enable it to continue to act in the interests of the Company and its 
shareholders. The limits will not lead to pressure on reward levels 
and the Committee is satisfied that it has adopted a suitably 
conservative approach to date and will continue to do so.

after appropriate consultation with shareholders.
• Awards are subject to continued employment, save in the leaver 
circumstances described in the Payment for Loss of Office section 
of this Policy.

• The deferred shares element is currently awarded under the 
DBSS (but may be delivered under a different plan with

• The awards are structured as nil-cost share options. 
• Participants are entitled to a dividend equivalent for the 
period from grant until the vesting date, delivered as 
additional shares when the shares are transferred 
to the participant.
• The performance measures and conditions will be set by the Committee  
on an annual basis.
• The performance conditions will be assessed over a period of one year,  
and may consist of a combination of:
• Financial measures (at the group or divisional level); 
• Operational measures; and
• Individual performance objectives.
• The Committee reserves the right to include such other measures as it 
considers to be an appropriate means of assessing the performance of  
the Executive Directors.
• The Committee retains discretion to amend the vesting level (up or down) 
where it considers it to be appropriate, but not so as to exceed the 
maximum bonus potential.
• Once set, performance measures and conditions will generally remain

personal misconduct and/or where accounts or information 
relevant to performance are shown to be materially wrong

• The performance measures may consist of a combination of financial  
and non-financial measures.
• Vesting under each condition is on a straight line basis with no more  
than 25% vesting at threshold performance. 
• The LTIP rules impose a minimum performance period of three years. 
However, the Committee has determined that the performance period 
should be four years.
• The Committee retains the discretion to amend the performance measures 
and/or conditions used, and/or the weighting of each for future awards and/
or the performance measurement periods. It is the current intention of the 
Committee that future awards be granted with the same performance 
measures and conditions as for the 2014 awards detailed on page 90 to 91.
• Once set, the Committee may only amend the performance conditions in 
respect of outstanding awards in the event that exceptional circumstances 
occur which make it appropriate to do so, provided that the amended 
condition is not, in the view of the Committee, materially less difficult to satisfy.

or the performance measurement periods. It is the current intention of the 
Committee that future awards be granted with the same performance 
measures and conditions as for the 2014 awards.
Once set, the Committee may only amend the performance conditions in 
respect of outstanding awards in the event that exceptional circumstances 
occur which make it appropriate to do so, provided that the amended 
condition is not, in the view of the Committee, materially less difficult to satisfy.

(DBSS)
• Align Executive Director remuneration 
with annual financial and Company 
strategic targets as determined by the 
Company’s Business Plan for the relevant 
financial year.
• In the view of the Committee, to 
differentiate appropriately on the basis 
of performance.
• Partial award in shares aligns interests  
with shareholders and supports retention.
• The current maximum bonus opportunity is 200% of base salary. 
• The Committee reserves the power to increase the maximum 
bonus opportunity to up to 300% of base salary, although there is 
no current intention to do so. The Committee would only increase 
the maximum bonus level above the current 200% of base salary 
after appropriate consultation with shareholders.
• Awards are subject to continued employment, save in the leaver 
circumstances described in the Payment for Loss of Office section 
of this Policy.
• Awards are paid in a mix of cash and deferred shares, with the 
deferred shares element being at least 40% of the total award.
• Subject to clawback and malus provisions in situations of personal 
misconduct and/or where accounts or information relevant to 
performance are shown to be materially wrong and the bonus 
paid was higher than should have been the case.
• Non-pensionable.
Deferred shares element 
• The deferred shares element is currently awarded under the 
DBSS (but may be delivered under a different plan with 
equivalent terms). 
• The deferral period is currently two years, and may not 
be shorter.
• The deferred shares are subject to the leaver conditions as 
set out in the Payment for Loss of Office section of this Policy.
• No further performance targets apply to the deferred shares 
as these represent previously earned bonuses. 
• The awards are structured as nil-cost share options. 
• Participants are entitled to a dividend equivalent for the 
period from grant until the vesting date, delivered as 
additional shares when the shares are transferred 
to the participant.
• The performance measures and conditions will be set by the Committee  
on an annual basis.
• The performance conditions will be assessed over a period of one year,  
and may consist of a combination of:
• Financial measures (at the group or divisional level); 
• Operational measures; and
• Individual performance objectives.
• The Committee reserves the right to include such other measures as it 
considers to be an appropriate means of assessing the performance of  
the Executive Directors.
• The Committee retains discretion to amend the vesting level (up or down) 
where it considers it to be appropriate, but not so as to exceed the 
maximum bonus potential.
• Once set, performance measures and conditions will generally remain 
unchanged for the year, except in exceptional circumstances.
Long T erm 
Incentive Plan  
(L TIP)
• Incentivise the creation of long-term 
returns for shareholders.
• Align interests of Executive Directors with 
shareholders.
• Support retention.
• The performance period is set to reflect 
the capital intensive and cyclical nature  
of Hammerson’s business.
• The choice of performance measures is 
determined by those drivers which deliver 
value to shareholders in the longer term.
• A discretionary annual award up to a value of 200% of base salary. 
The Committee reserves the power to increase the maximum award 
to 300% of base salary in exceptional circumstances, although there 
is no current intention to do so. The extent of vesting is determined 
by the performance conditions.
• Awards are subject to continued employment, save in the leaver 
circumstances described in the Payment for Loss of Office section 
of this Policy.
• Awards are normally structured as nil-cost share options but can 
take other forms – for example, awards made to France-based 
employees may be made in the form of a conditional award 
of shares.
• Participants are entitled to a dividend equivalent for the 
period from grant until the vesting date, delivered as 
additional shares when the shares are transferred 
to the participant.
• The Committee has discretion to settle awards as a cash 
payment in place of the transfer of shares.
• Non-pensionable.
• Subject to clawback and malus provisions in situations of 
personal misconduct and/or where accounts or information 
relevant to performance are shown to be materially wrong 
and vesting was higher than should have been the case.
• The performance measures may consist of a combination of financial  
and non-financial measures.
• Vesting under each condition is on a straight line basis with no more  
than 25% vesting at threshold performance. 
• The LTIP rules impose a minimum performance period of three years. 
However, the Committee has determined that the performance period 
should be four years.
• The Committee retains the discretion to amend the performance measures 
and/or conditions used, and/or the weighting of each for future awards and/
or the performance measurement periods. It is the current intention of the 
Committee that future awards be granted with the same performance 
measures and conditions as for the 2014 awards detailed on page 90 to 91.
• Once set, the Committee may only amend the performance conditions in 
respect of outstanding awards in the event that exceptional circumstances 
occur which make it appropriate to do so, provided that the amended 
condition is not, in the view of the Committee, materially less difficult to satisfy.

RECRUITMENT 
Approach to recruitment for Executive Directors
Statement of Principles
The Company will pay total remuneration for new Executive Directors that enables the Company to attract appropriately skilled and experienced 
individuals, but is not, in the opinion of the Committee, excessive.
The Company will not pay new Executive Directors any inducements to join the Company over and above buy-outs of existing forfeited awards, 
as outlined below.
Approach and limits
Annual salary, pension, benefits, annual bonus and long-term incentive arrangements (including performance measures and/or conditions and 
maximum award levels) as described in the Policy will be the starting point for the structure of any package. The level of variable remuneration 
that may be awarded to a new Executive Director will not exceed the maximum AIP and LTIP limits that can be awarded in line with the principles 
set out in the Policy, with the exception of any compensation for variable remuneration forfeited. The limits contained within the Policy for base 
salary do not apply to a new Executive Director either on joining or for any subsequent salary review within the period of this Policy, although the 
Committee would seek to avoid exceeding those limits in practice.
For a new Executive Director who is an internal appointment, the Company may also continue to honour contractual commitments made prior 
to the internal appointment even if those commitments are otherwise inconsistent with the Policy in force when the commitments are satisfied. 
Any relevant incentive plan participation may either continue on its original terms or the performance conditions and/or measures may be 
amended to reflect the individual’s new role, as the Committee considers appropriate. 
Compensation for variable remuneration forfeited by a new Executive Director
The Company may, where appropriate, compensate a new Executive Director for variable remuneration that has been forfeited as a result of 
accepting the appointment with the Company. Where the Company compensates a new Executive Director in this way, it will seek to do so 
under the terms of the Company’s existing variable remuneration arrangements, but may compensate on terms that are more bespoke than the 
existing arrangements where the Committee considers that to be appropriate. In such instances, the Company will disclose a full explanation of 
the detail and rationale for such recruitment related compensation. In making such awards the Committee will seek to take into account the 
nature (including whether awards are cash or share-based), vesting period and performance measures and/or conditions for any remuneration 
forfeited by the individual when leaving a previous employer. Where such awards had outstanding performance or service conditions (which are 
not significantly completed) the Company will generally impose equivalent conditions. In exceptional cases, the Committee may relax those 
requirements where it considers this to be in the interests of shareholders, for example through a significant discount to the face value of the 
replacement awards.
80 Hammerson plc Annual Report 20 1 3 80
The Company may provide a new Executive Director with global relocation support and/or tax equalisation arrangements as set out in the Policy 
although, to date, the Company has not had occasion to do so. Additionally, the Company may make a contribution towards legal fees in 
connection with agreeing employment terms. 
DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED
176 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 SERVICE AGREEMENTS
Service agreements: New Executive Director appointments from 23 April 2014
The Committee’s approach is for new Executive Directors to have service agreements that have regard to market practice at the 
date of appointment.
The key elements for service agreements for newly appointed Executive Directors will be:
Notice period 12 months’ notice (both notice to and from the Executive Director).
A longer period of notice from the Company may apply to new appointments for a limited time if the 
Committee considers this is appropriate, but would then reduce to no more than 12 months.
Retirement date There is no default retirement age. Requests for retirement are considered on a case-by-case basis. 
At Executive Director level, it is anticipated that 12 months’ notice will be provided.
Post-termination restrictions To protect the Group’s confidential information for an appropriate period for that information, and to 
prevent poaching of its senior workforce and its customer and supplier connections for 12 months 
after termination.
Payment in lieu of notice 
(PILON)
Employment can be terminated with immediate effect by paying a PILON comprising base pay, pension, 
medical insurance and car allowance. A PILON will not apply on termination for gross misconduct, in 
which situation no compensation will be due. The Company will have discretion to pay on a phased basis, 
subject to mitigation. 
Expiry date There will be no fixed expiry date. The appointment of new Executive Directors will be terminable in 
accordance with the notice period.
Change of control and 
liquidated damages
The Executive Director will not have a right to liquidated damages.
The terms summarised above will be subject to any local statutory (or collective bargaining) requirements where applicable.
OTHER APPOINTMENTS
Executive Directors are able to accept, with the consent of the Company’s Board of Directors, non-executive appointments outside the Company 
(provided that such appointments do not lead to a conflict of interests) on the basis that such external appointments can enhance their 
experience and skills and add value to the Company. Any fees received by an Executive Director for such external appointments can be retained 
by the individual (except where the Executive Director is appointed as the Company’s representative).

DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED
178 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 Jean-Philippe Mouton has been employed by Hammerson Asset Management SAS (HAM) since 14 April 2003 as Divisional Director (France). 
He is based and works in France and, as a result, it was considered appropriate for him to continue to be employed under a French law governed 
employment contract with HAM upon his appointment as Executive Director. His employment contract with HAM means that French law applies 
to his terms and conditions of employment as Divisional Director (France). Jean-Philippe Mouton entered into a separate English law letter of 
appointment, which governs his directorship of the Company. Jean-Philippe Mouton also holds French corporate offices, including Chairman and 
Unique General Director of Hammerson France SAS and General Manager of Hammerson SAS, to which he was appointed by written resolution 
of the board of Hammerson France SAS. 
As at 1 January 2013, his aggregate “global” gross base salary in respect of his directorship of the Company, his role as Divisional Director (France) 
and his French corporate offices is €400,000 per annum. In addition, he is paid a supplementary pension benefit. While, of necessity, to comply 
with French law, his termination provisions are more complex than the UK based Executive Directors and split between three distinct parts as 
summarised below, the overall financial implications, before the impact of any collective bargaining agreements, are very similar and in 
aggregate the outcome would broadly equate to one times his global base salary.
Jean-Philippe Mouton
Date of service agreement and 
appointments
• French employment: 25 March 2013.
• UK directorship: 25 March 2013.
• French corporate offices: 9 February 2014
Expiry date Rolling service contract (French employment) with no fixed expiry date.
Notice period Three months’ notice (both notice to and from the Executive).
Base salary/fee • French employment: base salary.
• UK directorship: basic annual fee, subject to annual review. 
• French corporate offices: basic annual fee.
Incentive plans Participation in the annual bonus arrangements and the LTIP .

PAYMENT FOR LOSS OF OFFICE 
Notice periods and contractual rights
The notice periods and contractual rights on termination of each of the Executive Directors, and the key terms that will apply under service 
agreements for new recruits, are set out in the section on Service Agreements.
Annual bonus and long-term incentives
The following table describes the provisions which apply to leavers and the discretions available under the annual bonus arrangements and the 
LTIP . Further detail as to the potential exercise of discretion by the Committee is set out below the table. 
Arrangements Leaver provisions
AIP Under the rules of the AIP , where prior to the end of the performance period an Executive Director gives or 
receives notice, or ceases to be employed by the Group, due to death, ill-health, injury or disability, then the 
Executive Director remains entitled to a bonus, subject to the performance conditions. Any bonus payable will, 
unless the Committee determines otherwise, be time pro-rated. 
Where the date of cessation or notice is after the end of the performance period but prior to payment, the 
Executive Director will remain entitled to payment if the cessation is for any of the reasons above, or in addition  
if the cessation is due to retirement, redundancy or the sale of the company or business for which he works.
Where the cessation or notice does not fall within the above provisions, the bonus shall not be payable, unless 
the Committee determines otherwise which it may do at its discretion. Payment will be on the normal payment 
date, unless the Committee decides to accelerate payment.
DBSS (deferred share 
element of AIP)
Share awards, which represent deferrals of previously earned bonus, lapse on the Executive Director resigning 
or giving notice of resignation, provided that the Committee may exercise its discretion to treat the Executive 
Director as a good leaver. Share awards will also lapse on the Executive Director being dismissed for cause. 
In any other case the share award will continue and will vest in full on the normal vesting date, unless the 
Committee decides to accelerate vesting.
L TIP An Executive Director who ceases to be a Director or employee of the Group by reason of death, retirement, 
ill-health, injury or disability, redundancy, or the sale of the company or business for which he works will be a 
good leaver.
Where the cessation is on any other grounds, awards will lapse, provided that the Committee has a discretion 
to treat the Executive Director as a good leaver. 
Awards held by good leavers will continue and will vest on the normal vesting date, unless the Committee 
decides to accelerate vesting. 
Awards will remain subject to the performance conditions and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, 
be time pro-rated.
In exercising discretion in respect of the annual bonus arrangements or under the LTIP , the Committee will take into account all factors it 
determines to be appropriate at the relevant time including, but not limited to the duration of the Executive Directors’ service and its assessment 
of the contribution towards to the success of the Company during that period; whether the Executive Director has worked any notice period or 
whether a PILON payment is being made; the need to ensure an orderly handover of duties and continuity in the business operations of the 
Company and the need to compromise any claims which the Executive Director may have. In exercising any discretion the members of the 
Committee will take account of their duties as Directors. 
No discretion will be exercisable to treat an Executive Director as a good leaver where he is dismissed summarily for cause or following a formal 
disciplinary process.
In respect of the Company’s HMRC-approved, all-employee share plans, the Sharesave and the SIP , and the profit share plan for employees of 
Hammerson France, the Executive Directors are subject to the same leaver provisions as all other participants.
84 84
DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED
180 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 Other
If the Company terminates an Executive Director’s employment by reason of redundancy, the Company will make a redundancy payment to the 
Executive Director in line with his service agreement, any applicable collective bargaining agreement and under statute, and reserves the right to 
adjust for unfair dismissal.
In addition, and consistent with market practice, the Company may pay a contribution towards the Executive Director’s legal fees for entering  
into a statutory settlement agreement and may pay a contribution of up to £50,000, plus VAT, towards fees for outplacement services as part of  
a negotiated settlement.
Payment to a departing Executive Director may be made in respect of accrued benefit and untaken holiday.
In connection with an Executive Director ceasing employment, the Company may, if the Committee believes it necessary and in the best interests 
of the Company, enter into appropriate new contractual arrangements with the departing Executive Director including (but not limited to) 
settlement, confidentiality, restrictive covenants and/or consultancy arrangements on such terms as it considers appropriate. In such case, the 
Company will make appropriate disclosures of such terms.
A departing gift may be provided up to a value of £5,000 (plus related taxes) per Executive Director on termination of office.
Change of control
On a corporate action affecting the Company, the rules of the AIP , DBSS and the LTIP will apply. In summary, on a change of control of the 
Company awards under the LTIP will vest, subject to the performance conditions and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, be time 
pro-rated. Bonuses may be awarded under the AIP , based on performance to the date of the change of control and, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise, be time pro-rated. Awards under the DBSS, which represented deferrals of previously earned bonus, will vest in full. Under 
the LTIP , the Committee may also determine that a demerger or similar event shall constitute a corporate action. On a variation of share capital  
or similar event, the Committee may make such adjustment to awards under the LTIP and DBSS as the Committee considers appropriate.
EMPLOYEE PAY AND CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP
Employee remuneration packages
Remuneration packages for all Company employees may comprise both fixed and variable elements. The more senior the individual, the greater 
their general opportunity to impact directly upon Company performance, and therefore the remuneration packages of senior managers and 
Executive Directors have a greater emphasis on variable pay than those of more junior employees. 
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the full range of Company benefits offered to employees. In addition, they are eligible for certain 
remuneration to which other employees are not eligible. Executive Directors may opt to receive a salary supplement in lieu of pension, which is 
not available to other employees. Executive Directors are eligible to participate in an LTIP , whereas senior managers across the Group participate  
in other share and incentive plans. Eligible employees, including Executive Directors, may participate in the relevant all-employee share plans 
(namely UK plans for employees in the UK and French plans for employees in France).
Considerations in setting Executive Director remuneration
When setting Executive Director remuneration, the Committee takes into account Group-wide pay and employment conditions, along 
with market and commercial factors. 
The Company strives to pay competitively and to ensure its reward structures recognise superior performance. The Company therefore 
undertakes external benchmarking and internal moderation to ensure that, in its view, at all levels the Company’s remuneration approach 
reflects the appropriate market rate position. When determining base salary increases for Executive Directors, the Committee reviews the 
average Group-wide increase, paying particular attention to the senior manager population.
The Committee reviews performance against the AIP’s performance measures. Personal performance rating impacts bonus calculations for all 
employees and these ratings are calibrated internally to ensure consistency. Executive Director performance ratings are calibrated annually by the 
Committee. Having reviewed both Company and personal performance, and considering payments being made to shareholders, the Committee 
makes a judgement as to what level of bonus payment, if any, is reasonable. The Committee retains discretion to review bonus payments 
upwards as well as downwards (subject to the over-riding limits). 
In accordance with prevailing commercial practice, the Committee did not consult with employees in preparing the Policy or the 
implementation thereof.

CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION 
Policy as relates to Non-Executive Directors
Element Approach to determining element of fees and operation
Fees The Chairman’s fee is determined by the Committee and those of the other Non-Executive Directors are determined by 
the Board on the recommendation of the Executive Directors. 
Fee levels are reviewed periodically taking into account independent advice and the time commitment required of 
Non-Executive Directors. Aggregate total fees payable annually to all Non-Executive Directors is subject to the limit as 
stated in the Company’s Articles of Association from time to time. The Committee reserves the right to provide additional 
fees within the stated limit including for membership of any additional committee the Board may establish.
The fees paid to the Chairman and the fees of the other Non-Executive Directors aim to be competitive with other fully 
listed companies which the Committee (in the case of the Chairman) and the Board (in respect of the Non-Executive 
Directors) consider to be of equivalent size and complexity but are not set by reference to a prescribed benchmark. 
Fees are paid monthly in cash in arrears and are not pensionable. 
Additional fees The Chairman does not receive any additional fee in respect of membership of any of the Committees.
Other Non-Executive Directors may receive additional fees for membership and/or chairmanship of the Remuneration 
and Audit Committees. There is also an additional fee for the Senior Independent Director. The level of additional fees is 
set to reflect the responsibilities of the role.
Other benefits There are no other benefits currently available to any of the Non-Executive Directors. Whilst the Company does not 
consider that reimbursing travel and accommodation expense (including to the Company’s London office) is a benefit in 
the normal sense, should any assessment to tax be made on such reimbursement, the Company reserves the ability to 
settle such liability on behalf of the Non-Executive Director. 
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for performance-related bonuses or participation in the Company’s share plans.
While the Committee does not consider it to form part of benefits in the normal sense, Non-Executive Directors can 
participate in corporate hospitality (including travel and, where appropriate, with a family member), whether paid for by 
the Company or another, within its agreed policies.
A departing gift may be provided up to a value of £5,000 (plus related taxes) per Non-Executive Director on termination 
of office.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements with the Company. Their appointments are governed by letters 
of appointment, which are available for inspection on request. The letters of appointment of Non-Executive Directors are reviewed by the 
Chairman and the Executive Directors every three years.
Appointments of Non-Executive Directors are for a term of three years, subject to the right of either party to terminate the appointment on not 
less than three months’ notice or immediately should a conflict of interest arise. If any Non-Executive Director is not re-elected at the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting, the appointment will cease automatically. 
On termination of an appointment, a Non-Executive Director is only entitled to such fees as may have accrued to the date of termination, 
together with the reimbursement in the normal way of any expenses properly incurred prior to that date. 
The dates of the appointments of the Non-Executive Directors in office as at 31 December 2013 are set out below.

SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
The Company welcomes dialogue with its significant shareholders and seeks their views when major changes are being made to remuneration 
policy. Recently, following feedback from representatives of shareholders, the accumulation period for dividends on shares held in the LTIP and 
DBSS schemes was shortened to cover only the period from the date of grant of the award to vesting for awards from 2014 onwards.

Discontinuation of Interim Management Statements
Following recent changes to EU regulation on financial disclosure,  
the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has removed its requirement for 
UK companies to publish Interim Management Statements (IMSs). As a 
result, and reflecting the long term nature of Hammerson’s business, 
the Board has taken the decision to cease publication of formal IMSs  
in April and November. The Group remains committed to full and 
transparent disclosure and will continue with full-year and half-year 
announcements as well as a comprehensive capital markets events in 
the autumn.

UK Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) taxation
As a UK REIT, Hammerson plc is exempt from corporation tax on rental 
income and gains on UK investment properties but is required to pay 
Property Income Distributions (PIDs). UK shareholders will be taxed  
on PIDs received at their full marginal tax rates. A REIT may in addition 
pay normal dividends.
For most shareholders, PIDs will be paid after deducting withholding 
tax at the basic rate. However, certain categories of shareholder are 
entitled to receive PIDs without withholding tax, principally UK resident 
companies, UK public bodies, UK pension funds and managers of  
ISAs, PEPs and Child Trust Funds. Further information on UK REITs is 
available on the Company’s website, including a form to be used  
by shareholders to certify if they qualify to receive PIDs without 
withholding tax. 
Unsolicited mail
Hammerson is obliged by law to make its share register available  
on request to other organisations. This may result in shareholders 
receiving unsolicited mail. To limit the receipt of unsolicited mail 
shareholders may register with the Mailing Preference Service,  
an independent organisation whose services are free, by visiting  
www.mpsonline.org.uk. Once a shareholder’s name and address  
details have been registered, it will advise the companies and other 
bodies that subscribe to the service not to send unsolicited mail to  
the address registered. 
Shareholder security
Share fraud includes scams where fraudsters cold-call investors offering 
them overpriced, worthless or non-existent shares, or offer to buy 
shares owned by investors at an inflated price. We advise shareholders 
to be vigilant of unsolicited mail or telephone calls regarding buying or 
selling shares. For more information visit: www.fca.org.uk/scams or call 
the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.
